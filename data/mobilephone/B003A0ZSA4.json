I am  really  a fair person/reviewer!These are just a couple or the most difficulties I had with this phone.1) Would not hold charge even for 2 minutes no exargeration.2) When charging the phone and the battery feel like it's about to explode....that's how hot is this cheap phone.Everything about this phone is a bogus, final!I just hate that the seller would not give me back my money for that piece of junk, that I still have had and couldn't used for even 5 minutes.I wished there were option for 0/no star for review not 1, because this one doesn't even deserve 1 STAR!NOT FAIR, NOT FAIR, NOT FAIR!!!!", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "great deal for great phone.", "Author": "Thien Phung", "ReviewID": "R3JVOYFOOOUWK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was hesitant because it was REFURBISHED but when i ot the item it looked brand new with all the anti scratch shipping tape on the screen and keypad. my dad needed a new phone that was slim and easy to use. ive had the razr v3 before myself so i knew it was a great candidate. the screen is average size, what sold me was the beautiful light up keyboard for hiss aging eyes.  the phone came with a battery, car charger, and ac charger just like a brand new phone. believe it or not when the razr came out it was top of the line and sold for $500 without a contract. i got it for $44 shipped so i cannot see how u can go wrong. some people cannot operate smart phones and thats the way it will always be. so big ups to amazon, the seller, and Motorola for keeping such a gem on the market.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "RAZR by Zena Mobile", "Author": "Sylvia", "ReviewID": "RVFSCJ261S95V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product and company, superior quality.Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "WARNING: Do NOT BUY from these folks!", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1WBZ8GSZECT7X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sold product as NEW and when received, open nicely package new looking like phones but quickly found out they were REFURBISHED!
