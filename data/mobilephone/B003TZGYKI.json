ITS NOT GOING TO WORK, only in EDGE or GPRS.. It will work in 3G mode with: T-Mobile, Cincinnati Bell Wireless, WIND Mobile, Mobilicity, Videotron, VTR, Nextel, Optus, Vodafone AU, Vodafone NZ, Orange and Digitel... The description also said: BlackBerry OS 6.0, its imaginary.. It comes with OS 5.0, that's not a big deal I already installed the 6.0 in 30 minutes...

When I asked to replace the phone for one that supports 3G on AT&T;, I was told that I should have known in advance whether or not the phone would work on 3G before I bought it, and since I had opened the box to test it, I would not be allowed to return it for a replacement or refund!  The description of the phone states that the supported HSPDA (3G) networks are 850, 1900, and 2100 (AT&T; uses 1900, T-Mobile 2100), so a reasonable inference would be that 3G will work with AT&T;, but it doesn't. It doesn't because when either AT&T; or T-Mobile brand their phones, they disable 3G capability if the phone is used with the other carrier. The sellers of unlocked 3G phones should be required to disclose who's branded phone they are selling, so that the customer can make an informed choice. Because they aren't required to do so and don't, I was sold a product that does not perform as advertised.

Esta vez fue la excepci\u00f3n, pues ni bien ten\u00eda 3 meses us\u00e1ndolo cuando empezaron mis problemas, que son innumerables: El teclado no funciona se queda como muerto o sino intercambia todas las letras, presiono l y sale m, o la r y sale la s, por lo que muchas veces enviar un simple texto es un calvario. Asimismo, la pieza t\u00e1ctil es incontrolable, no es dif\u00edcil de manejar, es IMPOSIBLE y ni con paciencia, ni con ma\u00f1a, hace lo que quiere. La bater\u00eda dura muy poco, no soy de estar navegando ni enviando mensajes ni hablando todo el d\u00eda, pero si uso un blackberry es porque utilizo sus m\u00faltiples funciones... cuando puedo porque no se me ha descargado. La c\u00e1mara es muy deficiente, pero en realidad no esperaba fuera diferente, pues no es lo prioritario para m\u00ed en un celular. Reclam\u00e9 por la garant\u00eda, pero aunque me siento enga\u00f1ada con el aparato, con la garant\u00eda no pues al comprarlo sab\u00eda no daban, lo hice para ver si pod\u00edan valorar mi caso como diferente. Considero que es mala se\u00f1al que no lo hagan, imagino deben saber los problemas de este modelo, porque si revisaran mi celular (el aparato que tengo en mis manos, no los de otras personas, sino el que yo he cuidado much\u00edsimo), observar\u00edan que ni una rayita de maltrato tiene... por fuera est\u00e1 impecable, pantalla, teclas, parte de atr\u00e1s, como nuevo... pero el problema es que me sali\u00f3 MUY MALO, aunque creo que en realidad no fue mala suerte m\u00eda, sino que en general este modelo tiene ENORMES DEFICIENCIAS.

I spent hours trying to find support, THERES IS NO SUPPORT except forums and technical papers online. There is no way to get one to one customer support, at least I have not found any. I've had the phone for 3 weeks and I am ready to ditch it. Wastes your time. What good are all the functions if you can't use them without constant error messages? I'm a fairly competent gadget user, but this thing has me frustrated. The one thing that works well is the WIFI, no glitches there. The rest is way too complicated, reminds me of the old MP3 players that you had to spend hours on to make them work the way you wanted them to. I agree with the reviewer who says this phone is stuck where windows was about 5 years ago. Complicated, not intuitive and worst of all, no support for the individual buyer, although they have plenty of paid support for companies.

The software is cumbersome.  One must go through arcane menu after menu to do the simplest of tasks.

You have to press the mute button on the top of the phone to unlock it.  Nice.  The menus are less than intuitive.  In fact, Blackberry is probably the best friend that Microsoft ever had because now there is something that is even more of a pain in the neck to use than Windows.
