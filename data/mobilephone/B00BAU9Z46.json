A very good screen, just my size, I'm testing it in Venezuela with Movistar, while open Digitel 4G signal in my town so I will use this operator, works great. The camera is good quality, 13 Mpx photos make itself look very very real. As for the internal memory want it to be 16Gb; really need more memory space, if you are someone who you like downloading applications, music and games plenty, 8 GB is not enough, although there is the option to insert you MicroSD up to 32 GB. The battery lasted lot at first, but after a few days or even hours begins to adapt and becomes longer charging. Overall a very good phone. Do not hesitate to buy it. 5 star to Vendors \"PVCS\".", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect phone for me.", "Author": "Hanna Vi", "ReviewID": "R2WEHFVXDBWWMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love Sony products... (DSC TX-5(digicam)and Xperia V)but, there's one thing they have in common they have poor battery life.I wish Sony will improve the battery life of their products.On the 1st day I used my Xperia V, I charged it twice...then everyday I keep on charging it...On the 2nd-3rd week, the battery life is improving.1st month, the battery last for 2-2.5daysI also noticed that, when I click something on youtube videos, the screen turns into blue.The camera is super clear, like a digital camera.When a friend saw my Xperia V, he also bought it, bec. he was amazed by the specs of this phone almost like iphone5 but much cheaper.Overall...I like it so much :-)", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfied...!!!", "Author": "HVN", "ReviewID": "R3FBRMQ0FUVIM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In short - It's a Sonybut, I'd like to have the dedicated camera button... the power and volume buttons a bit more separated... probably that's all why it does not get all 5 stars from me...I like that the battery is removable... have not checked the water resistance, but I'll find time to have fun...Ou, and very poor choice of accessories makes me sad...", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "battery usage poor", "Author": "swayne", "ReviewID": "RAKJ28YUSSZS6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the phone on schedule, packaging was good. Its my first android phone and I'm pleasantly surprised, the OS is smooth, no lag seen so far, browses multiple pages (5) without lag, the camera is great, tones of apps. However my greatest problem is the battery usage is really poor, once the display is on whether you are on the net or not it uses up the battery quickly. When its charged in the morning (say 7 am) it barely makes it to 4 pm (when it is normally at 10%) and this is with moderate use. If you where to play a game, watch a movie, or use the camera for an hour I don't think it would last until 2 pm. The brightness of the display is as low as is practical, its set to sleep which turns of data usage, gps etc. Listening to music/radio for long isn't so bad since the display will go to sleep. The display uses between 39 - 60 % (with the OS ~ 10) of the batteries energy per charging cycle. Once the display is off it uses little energy. A better battery is needed or a more efficient display.Update 30/09/2013:the battery use is not as poor as previously stated, my initial observations were due to above normal use of the phone due to my enthusiasm with my new phone. When its charged at 7 am it will last until 6-10 pm that evening with moderate use. However playing videos,games, capturing videos or pics(for lengthy periods)and a bright a display still consumes battery quickly. Radio use does not consume that much power (i have listened to it all night without draining the battery or needing to charge it in the morning)I would recommend this phone to anyone wanting a good smartphone.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "hello,", "Author": "Marsoleine Gamez", "ReviewID": "R11E4GHWTPW9JI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good excellent team callus unfortunately my computer screen and I quebro I wonder if that makes any warranty, otherwise please where he could carry the team or where I can get the screen.if I can change the screen again immersed in water?marsoleine", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "fineeeeee", "Author": "ERICK GONZALEZ", "ReviewID": "RUKY343VBMYH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very nicegood cell and has a very competitive camera with other phones on the marketvery nicei like", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R1L724X7VG59I9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a nice and light smartphone.but, for me isn't as good as I wanted.Nice Screen, Fast (at least in the beginning)It's has a Battery that don't last more than 10 hs of full use...", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone i like it so far.", "Author": "Abdelouafi Omar Taoufik \"Pipowafi\"", "ReviewID": "R7VOTOTZ3GGTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phne Sony xperia v lt 25 i is a good phone personaly  i like it so far .............", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a good price", "Author": "Yuliya Cross", "ReviewID": "R3KC7DTMTFNODX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my friend who lives in Russia and he absolutely loves it!
