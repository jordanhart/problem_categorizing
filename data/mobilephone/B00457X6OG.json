Didn't want to shell out the dollars for a plan increase (texting, internet etc) with ATT free phones beyond the basic models. Device worked easily once the ATT sim card was plugged in and the battery charged.  Touchscreen is responsive though not comparable to iphone quality.  Product comes with a stylus which we rarely use.  Supposed to be for texting Chinese characters. We have installed a 4GB micro-SD card to add music files.  Had to install the Samsung Kies application from their website to move music files.  Note:  To get this app - go to Samsung web page and pick a different geography than US for this to show up since the Champ is not directly sold here.The cellphone has quite a few widgets which can be enabled and customized.  Also lets the user change the look and feel of the multiple user screens you can access by swiping across the LCD. Music playback is quite good and the music player remains active even when you get out of that widget.  The speakers are good enough to listen to the music w/o headphones.  The phone also has a built in radio tuner that works quite well.The biggest problem we have with the phone is actually a user interface issue. When the touchscreen is used to dial a number, once the call gets connected the phone screen automatically locks up.  You have to use the hold key for several seconds to unlock it at that point.  This is a big headache if you need to access calling feature like speakerphone or the keypad.  There is no options in the setting to disable this.  We were almost tempted to return the phone due to this issue but held on to avoid the hassles.  Otherwise a great phone at a great price.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "False Advertisement!", "Author": "Unhappy!", "ReviewID": "REUA2THD238QY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great phone of what I could play with. But buying this phone was a huge hassle & a waste of my time! The product shipping was for a 2-day delivery, I received 5 days after I purchased it. Although, the condition is excellent. Unopened, Brand new in the manufacturers box BUT phone has a network lock. It has caused me such hassle. I have tried to purchase a network lock code, impossible. I have contacted my service provider to see if they could help, NO! I called Samsung, they were not able to help either because this is an international phone. I am from the US and it's impossible for me to get this phone unlocked to use with ATT. I am returning and buying strictly a ATT phone!", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "bad buying", "Author": "cesar", "ReviewID": "R391FOQABSV0ZX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was not a good buy, despite the announcement of the phone , Its came locked to any GSM network, I had to pay $ 30 to a company to send me a code to unlock phone, so I do not recommend buying this phone.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cant get it to work", "Author": "vicky", "ReviewID": "R2AWREKXMO7LOB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone in the mail today.

The network setting is GSM with various frequencies and quad band. Just plug in SIM, works fine. The charger plug is actually the international style which won't be able to plug in US. However, the package comes with an adapter.The actual screen size of the phone is small, comparing with its peers. It is a tap touch screen phone - which means tapping works but not so for sliding. You have to use the up-down keys on the side to assist. However, some items in the setup menu (such as sound profile setting), the up-down side keys only adjust volume, you must use the sliding to roll up-down which makes it very difficult.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fine phone", "Author": "Miguel Isaacs", "ReviewID": "RFVKF7R4LOS22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived early good price works perfectly simple and good apps are fine phone is clear easy to hold and carry.

Therefore, I went to Samsung's website to download a user manual.  Next, I studied the entire document to avoid surprises.  The Champ had all the features we required.  Over time I purchased a Samsung GT-C3300i and two GT-C3300k for the spouse and I.Our phones were purchased online (no one in town had them).  They arrived in new condition at my door.  The i came from a major electronic retailer and later the two k from a small family business.What we did:  I put the battery in then promptly charged our phone for about 3 hours- the phone lets you know when charging is complete with a tiny beep and a screen display when you touch a button.  Next I turned the phone on to see if it powered up.  Note: Each of the three phones when turned on for the first time asked a question about keeping a data/profile?? or something? I can't remember exactly.  I told each phone to 'remain' which was the option button on the left.  Next I turned it off, removed the back cover & battery, then put in my unlocked SIM card.  I continued to leave the phone off while strictly following my service provider's instructions for activation.  I waited with the phone off for about 5 minutes then turned it on and it has worked correctly ever since.  All of the phones were unlocked as advertised.  My Pure Talk USA SIM card was unlocked as advertised.  I never needed any secret codes, etc.Our Samsung Champ does not require a data plan to function.  We do not have a data plan yet we can make voice calls, send SMS text, play mp3, take pictures, use the FM radio, widgets, etc.  The Champ has TRT 'touch resistive technology' which is not the same as an ipod touchpad because it is not an ipod.  I think of the Champ touchpad as similar to a microwave oven touch panel of yesteryear.  Samsung added the TRT technology and the stylus for users of written Chinese characters.  For us, there was a very minor learning curve and with time I actually like it better because it is not \"too sensitive/touchy\".  In addition to touch/tap, I can swipe side to side to turn pages and swipe up/down to scroll.  The volume key on side will also allow scrolling.Cell phones in this price range generally do not come with too many extras (an increase in features equals an increase in price). This model is capable of additional memory storage but does not include the microSD card or the SIM card.  It does include a battery, a wall charger with U.S. adapter, and a headset/mic.  More features in addition to the ones mentioned above are: social networking, stop watch, timers, calender, clocks, memo,  currency converters, conserve the battery, we use the included headset to play music instead of the speakers.To transfer music and pictures to/from the phone: I put my microSD card (in it's adapter) directly into the multimedia card reader in my computer.  Next I copy to /from the card then remove it from the computer (and adapter) to place it into the phone.  This is the simplest method for us- no cables or additional software involved.Our Samsung Champ can use the A T T/ T Mobile network but we do not use their services-- we use Pure Talk USA.**What we did when our new Champ arrived set in another language.  Touch the menu icon on the bottom far right which has small blue squares 3 across and 3 down (9 total).  Touch the setting icon on the bottom far right which looks like a round silver sprocket/gear in a blue box.  Touch line 4 phone from the top (line 1 sound profile, line 2 display, line 3 time and date, line 4 phone).  Touch line 1 language.  Touch line 3 English (line 1 automatic, line 2 Deutsch, line 3 English) then touch the blue line of writing at the page bottom which is save.  After touching save everything changed to English promptly.These phones are great even after six months of use.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "dany sandoval", "Author": "dany sandoval", "ReviewID": "R5CI41R2I0RAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "gracias por el Producto es bueno y de Calidad s\u00ed lo agradesco Por vendedor Producto de Primera soja dany de valencia Venezuela", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad touch", "Author": "rings", "ReviewID": "RC6SI2LQS7RTG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bad result of this phone i am very deperessed why i purchaised this item this is very bad bad bad touch phone", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "samsung c3300 champ", "Author": "edwin", "ReviewID": "R1IC044M826SG6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "El equipo esta muy bueno y para ser usado dir\u00eda que buenas condiciones, mientras los sigan vendiendo as\u00ed los cliente se sentir\u00e1n satisfecho de volver a comprar este y otro producto similar a este.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "TEEN PHONE", "Author": "EMAC7708", "ReviewID": "R3AYIC6BV8O2W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great phone for my 16 year old. his last phone was a samsung and it lasted for over 2 yrs.(he broke the screen).well worth the money and it has some good features.
