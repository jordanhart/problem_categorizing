The only reason I no longer have it is that I sadly lost it. This phone has a full QWERTY keyboard that, when flipped also is a speaker. The bottom of the phone is what flips and while on the keyboard side it is slightly angled to text easier. This phone is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a great phone without a data plan.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Dad of teen girl", "ReviewID": "RYDE0BUPRHRO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price, the phone works great and is in new condition, and my daughter is happy. battery life is great considering heavy use.

We have a verizon contract that gave us phones that only lasted a few months before issues developed.

Seriously. Super easy to use, good battery life, takes decent pictures, love the swivel qwerty keyboard. Am actually looking to get it again a few years later...I don't have, nor do I want to get a data plan. With little option out there, I'm seriously considering switching to this phone again. Only reason I switched was it was time to upgrade.

I cannot hear callers or the caller cannot hear me.  I already own the very same phone that has lasted me 3 yrs, very durable, long battery life. I wanted a back phone in case my phone broke. It is so difficult to find a basic phone these days with a very accessible keyboard.  I use my pantech as a primary phone for calls and used my htc  rebound smartphone for data services ,since the battery life on smartphone are not as good a basic phone.  So needless to say I was very disappointed with the 1st use of my new razzle.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
