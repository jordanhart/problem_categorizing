Like listed above, it is simple with not alot of features.  It is my second LG phone and I am happy with it so far.  The sound is good quality (loud enough), signal strength is good, buttons are slightly larger than on the LG TM-510, small and compact phone, very lightweight, silver finish makes it look very professional, might not have along of ringtones to choose from but it gets the job done.The only drawback on it is features.  If you are looking to be able to send text messages, have various ringers, large screen (meaning the size of the font on the screen), and a very well featured phone-then, as stated before, this phone is not for you.  If you are looking for a good phone that will serve your basic operations of simply sending and receiving phonecalls, then this phone is what you want.", "Date": "May 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2IB9FMX58ZWXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone by signing up with Working Assets (Sprint network) last August.  The phone does well for basic features like address book, calling, and calendar.  It has a nice monochrome display and the caller ID line can be read with the phone closed.  Additionally, you can turn off the ringer with the exterior volume button, allowing you to easily cut off a call you don't want to take.  It doesn't have any fancy screen or internet stuff, but that wasn't an issue for me.My original phone did break because the D-pad got jammed.  It was replaced for free and I've had no problems since.  The reception hasn't been great, particularly indoors, but when I'm inside I usually have a land line around anyway.  There does seem to be this weird 1-second delay in speaking, a problem I've had with both phones, so I'm not sure if it's a Sprint issue or the phone itself.  You kind of adjust after a while.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the phone.", "Date": "March 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "NOT A VERY GOOD PHONE FOR 3 REASONS", "Author": "dan", "ReviewID": "R1QHWUVWICB0W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. not many features-no texting, you can only recieve texts from the internet.

I use it quite frequently and have had no problems with it.  I think if you take care of the phone and use it in a normal fashion, the phone will last as long as any other phone, and I have tried a lot of phones!  The flip phone is great as it allows you to save the life of the key pad.  I would reccomend this product, and feel very comfortable in doing so.  I think most of the problems arise from the carrier and how helpful they are in correcting problems.  Choose the right company and you will be happy! I chose a wireless carrier with a Month-to-Month option and can cancel service anytime without any cancellation fees.  Maybe that's the way to go.", "Date": "July 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not-so-great phone", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1GEQ3VTSORN19", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace a Sanyo that was stolen.  Within a few months, I had to get a replacement since the display screen on the outside (the little box) had gone dead.  Within a few more weeks, the second phone's display died, and I've just left it blank, as it was too much trouble to replace - Sprint's customer service is poor.I find the sound quality, key size, and overall features to be acceptable but not great, and wish I had bought a Sanyo again.  With Sprint, you are fairly limited to phone choice - I'd recommend against LG if you are looking at several models/brands.", "Date": "December 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "great sprint phone!!!", "Author": "David Schwager \"schwagerdvs\"", "ReviewID": "R1I022JFGHDSUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 3 years now I would never get another phone.  Over the time I have had this phone.  I have droped it... kicked it trying to pick it up.... and have ran the battery to dead several times all for it to recharge back in no time... I recommed the extra long battery for this phone I could go days before a recharge which was great for me.  But last week I left it in my pants and threw them in the wash all to find my poor little phone dying at the bottom of the washer.  I don't think many pones could even turn on after that abuse... but this one did... and well it doesn't work some part of the circut shorted and it just blinks now... but I just ordered another one and hope for it to be as good as the last one...David", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "AVOID!!!", "Author": "Ogyabooks", "ReviewID": "R2NJIIF4VP0REB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice compact size, but..........display faded within weeks of initial use. the AC adapter also died suddenly.  I think the manufacturers and Sprint have noticed, so they replace it with the Samsung A460 instead. Can't stand the A460 either - features too cumbersome to use.

Verizon is really better if you're in this area, thoughl. Sprint is okay, but it's hard to get service indoors.The phone itself is ok. I got it for free when I bought it here at amazon and signed a year contract. I haven't had the battery issues some of these other reviewers have, but my outside display is missing several lines making it impossible to read. I've heard this is a common problem. I also use my phone for long conversations with parents and friends at home and the phone gets quite hot if you talk on it for more than 30 minutes. It's nice that it's flip though so that the buttons and screen don't get messed up and it's pretty hardy - I've dropped mine a few times.If you can get this phone for free, it's good - it has the basic functions and a nice alarm (with snooze) in the calendar function and has a big address book with multiple listing, so you can have two mobile, two office, and two home numbers for one person.", "Date": "May 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "No wireless web or text messaging", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ETX710KQKHHZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone to replace a broken one and much to my dismay it doesn't have wireless web or text messaging capability!", "Date": "January 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exterior Display Screen!

The display screen has totally faded, which means that I no longer have an exterior caller ID, which really sucks. I took the phone to Sprint to see what they could do and they told me I was just slightly out my warranty  and I could 1. get a new phone or 2. get the insurance, wait a few weeks and then send in a $35 deductible for a replacement.

I am not a \"heavy\" cell phone user and only charge the battery when I'm down to 1 or 2 bars. I am having a problem that is sporadic;  the battery indicates full charge however when I turn it off and on again the battery will suddenly drop from full charge to \"empty\" (no charge at all).  In my opinion there seems to be a problem in the \"on/off\"  button.  I have phoned Sprint to ask if they are aware of any design problems;  their employees say, \"yes, but not exactly like that, but you can bring it in if you want to.\"  I will make the trip to the nearest Sprint store (about 40 miles away) as I do not feel secure that this phone is reliable.  I have spoken with two other people who have stated they were not satisfied with \"LG\" models in general and upgraded to a better phone.
