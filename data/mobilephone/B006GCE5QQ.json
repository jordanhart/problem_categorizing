When I have tried to get one of these from them, they have always insisted on some fee for activation, plan change, whatever. Not to mention the wait in the Verizon store can be long.It is worth it to me not to have to deal with them when replacing my phone. I bought this card, programmed it to my account online and installed it in my new phone. Total about 5 minutes. Couldn't be easier and didn't have to argue with anyone at Verizon to get it.It arrived through amazon prime shipping faster and cheaper than Verizon would have gotten it to me.Worth the 7 bucks.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This SIM card works for prepaid cellular data on iPad 3", "Author": "Mr. Doh \"Doh!\"", "ReviewID": "R1L0SMCQJP3PWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading on the internet about all the unhappy iPad owners that had accidentally screwed up their SIM cards by cancelling prepaid cellular data plans because they deactivated their accounts instead of just stopping the payment plan, I was real nervous about whether this would work for my iPad 3.  I had done the same, not realizing that deactivating my prepaid cellular account would make my SIM card worthless.  Verizon had told me to go and get a new SIM card at a Verizon store back when I did the incorrect deactivation, but Verizon stores will not give out SIM cards unless you are putting your iPad on your regular monthly \"postpaid\" account, which I most definitely do not want to do.So I ordered this SIM card to try to resurrect prepaid cellular on my iPad 3.  When the new SIM card came, I put it in my iPad and activated a new prepaid data plan (1GB) with Verizon.  With one small problem, it worked fine, and now my iPad 3 is again able to use prepaid cellular data for our upcoming trip.  I'm very relieved that all the speculation about not being able to use a prepaid data plan anymore is just not true.  People even talked about exchanging their iPad's to get a new SIM card, but you definitely don't need to do that, just get a new SIM card like this one.The only problem that I had was an interesting one, and might help some of you out there. The activation of the cellular data stuff did not go through the first time that I tried it.  Turns out that since I have a Verizon Network Extender, I had to disable that until cellular data was totally activated.  Once the activation was completed, and I could actually use cellular data, I turned the Network Extender back on, and it's all working well.  But for the time that the activation was processing, I had to have the Network Extender off.Also, the fact is that these SIM cards work for either postpaid and prepaid plans.  There's no such thing as a \"prepaid SIM card\", there's only one kind of SIM card for your iPad.I'm very happy with the way that this has turned out. I was anticipating that I might not be able to use my iPad with cellular data at all, after having paid a bunch extra for that functionality.

My store told me no, and so did Verizon phone customer service. I've read several posts about this online. They all agree Verizon stores will only supply you a new SIM card if you are purchasing a device or activating a new account. My case involved an iPad 3, but I suspect this applies to any device.iPad users in particular need replacement SIM cards because of their unusual feature of allowing cellular data for a month at a time. The problem is that a new SIM card is required each time, with $35 activation fee each time if you have it done at the Verizon store. It's avoiding that activation fee that makes inexpensive SIM cards desirable, because then the customer can activate the new month's service on the iPad itself, by himself, with no $35 fee and no trip to the store.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid In-Store Sales Reps", "Author": "William R Keranen", "ReviewID": "R39K1UOUBWG6GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new SIM card worked perfectly to allow the activation of a privately purchased 4G LTE Verizon smartphone on a month-to-month plan without having to visit a Verizon store.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did me good", "Author": "Tiger", "ReviewID": "RQ764Z0L3BGWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got what I expected, and that's rare these days....

I contacted Amazon customer service via chat and was told that \"that usually never happens\"--which again is not true especially since there are other reviewers who have mentioned said bait and switch.  The service rep was nice enough to \"help\" me manufacture a label so that I could take my time to run to UPS and return said incorrect items.  And then I was advised to order the cards again...in hopes that the next time around I will receive the right product.Needless to say, the product will arrive after I actually have need to put it in my new phone.

Rather than make the trip to Verizon and deal with pushy salespeople and wasting a couple hours, I decided to just order a new SIM card online for $9. The item was received two days later with Amazon Prime, and I was able to replace the SIM card and reactivate my account (by creating a new account) within a few minutes. The $9 cost for the SIM was worth saving the time, money, and hassle of going to the Verizon store. My 4G LTE works again on my iPad on prepaid services with personal hotspot! I highly recommend ordering this SIM card if you make the same mistake I did and accidentally deactivate the account. I am thinking of buying a couple extra to have on hand in case I make the same mistake down the line or I cancel my subscription and Verizon deactivates my account due to inactivity, which they automatically do after five months of no service.
