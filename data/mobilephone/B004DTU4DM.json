It was securely packaged and everything that was suppose to come with it, did ! Not to mention everything works on it. All apps run well and phone calls are a snap. You will need to purchase your own SIM card . Since I don't really talk that much on the phone I purchased a \" pay as you go \" type plan which allows me to text unlimited and talk a little if need be. Make sure you read all instructions and fully charge it before use. If you want to feel like Dick Tracey or 007 this gadget allows you to live out that fantasy. I like the camera and media player functions. It also allows you to record conversations with its handy voice recorder. If your fingers are like pickles and are too big to use the touch screen capability there is a small telescopic stylus in the watch band that you can pull out and when you are done with it discreetly slide it back into its handy little hole that it came out of. \" Pretty damn neat if you ask me \" the price is what hooked me. Under $100.00 and hey, it also tells time.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice cell phone", "Author": "william alexander luna", "ReviewID": "R2Z6IXW055N1BF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The watch phone is great, works good with any simcard, have a good v\u00eddeo recording quality and pictures, the bluetooth headset works fine, the hands free is ok, the two bateries are a good idea.I think the power adapter is failing, after some minutes chargin the phone gives an error mesage.

I received this watch cell phone a few days ago, charge the battery,and now the fun begin. PLEASE BE EXTRA CAREFUL when installing the micro chip. It come with very good instruction, with one flaw, on the picture it show to install the micro chip with the contact facing up, toward the white lable that's incorrect, the contact on the micro chip have to be down to the left, opposite the white tag.After installing the chip, it was very very difficult to clip the micro sd in place, every time I try to snap the clip in place it will pop back out. Remember, the space in the watch is very small, what I end up doing I removed the clip for the micro sc card completely, installed the  micro chip, and the sim card from my international AT&T; phone, clip the sim down, put the battery it the cell phone, crank that baby on, and what do you know it came on.It start searching and found AT&T; network, my data and phone number from my old AT&T;,cell phone, all that information is on the sim card, I made a call, took a picture set the time and date,not in this order, so far so good. guys let us be frank with our selves, for the chinese to squeezed together all this high tech electronic in such a infinitestimal watch cell phone, these people are dam good at what they do.All the doohickey we can buy give us the opportunity to play with gadget we cannot purchase here at home for that price,these widget are very cheap. I speak only for myself. One thing for sure it will not break my bank. I love this watch,cell phone and bluetooth, and mp3 player. I give this Item 4 star because the amount of time it took for the installed of the micro sd card, plus I have to leave the clip out that suppose to keep the sd chip secured in the phone, which is no big deal because  one quarter of the sim card is resting on the micro sd chip, and the sim card is secure in place with the clip.In my opinion lots of bang for my buck. Am thinking ahead, where can I buy an extra battery for this item, thanks for all your assistant. Next is the review for the 4-in-1 DV88 Camera Video MP3 bluetooth sunglasses with 8G of memory I purchase from sherryshop. I hope my information will make a serious impack on all who is thinking of buying this item.
