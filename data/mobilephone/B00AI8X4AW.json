It isn't even that. This phone is pure garbage, and I'm censoring myself by just saying that. Why Samsung would put their name on this is beyond me. With a company as big and reputable as Samsung, you'd think they'd want every product they make to be a quality product. This is straight trash. This was my first ever \"smart\" phone, and it is anything but a smart phone. It is, in fact, a dumb phone. I blame myself for not doing more research on this phone before hand. This is the phone that mommy gives to little Sally and tells her to only call her or 911 on.First and foremost: the battery life on this phone is laughably poor. I unplug the phone from the charger, and within MINUTES, the battery life is down to 80%, and that's without using any apps or surfing the web. I'm talking about unplugging it and putting it in my pocket. I downloaded a crossword app, and I was at 100% battery life. I played the game for 20 minutes, and when I was done, the battery was at 13%.Secondly, it can't connect to the internet...EVER! I had the phone for less than two months, and managed to get online less than five times. I placed the phone DIRECTLY ON TOP of my wireless router, and it couldn't connect to the internet. When it does happen to connect to the internet, it's download speeds, and connection speeds are so slow that they usually time out, and force the browser to stop and quit.Lastly, the storage capacity on this piece of garbage is ridiculously small. I installed 3 apps on it and it said that I had used up all the memory on the phone and that I could no longer receive text messages or use the internet of download any apps.This phone is trash, plain and simple.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this phone!", "Author": "Linda Thigpen \"ThruTheFire\"", "ReviewID": "R2B3KWECBQY75C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought it when it was about $100 and it is NOT worth it at all. It stinks.The battery life is HORRIBLE. If you plan on doing any amount of web-surfing or facebooking on this phone, you better have it plugged into the wall the whole time. Even after charging for about 3 hours (when it SAYS it has full charge) if you talk or text on it for more than 15 minutes, your battery life is already down to less than 50%. It also has barely any reserve or down time. So don't think you can just not use it and save battery life, it will die anyway just because you are checking to see what time it is.The storage is horrible. There isn't even enough room on the device to download a decent sized app then transfer it to the SD card to free up more space on the phone.The OS on it is so outdated that a lot of apps aren't even compatible with it, so beware if you are a Candy Crush freak because you will NOT be able to download the app at all.Another person said it would not connect to their wifi. It connected fine for me, but when you turn the wifi on it drains the battery life VERY quickly. You MIGHT get 30 minutes of web time before it starts giving a low battery warning after you turn the wifi on. And heaven forbid if you should forget to turn the wifi off, your phone will be useless in about 15 minutes because it will die.The alarm is also useless on it. No matter how many times I reset my time zone it still bounces back between Eastern and Central time zones. I can't tell you how many times I set this alarm for 6am and it went off and I got up to make coffee only to find out it was only 5am. If you live in Eastern time zone this would make you an hour late instead of an hour early which would be even worse.The signal is terrible too and goes in and out. It goes from 5 bars back down to 1 bar or no bars in seconds when every elses phone is holding steady signal.Web browser constantly crashes.The calibration is always off and there is no way to reset it.This isn't even a good starter phone for young kids because kids like to play apps...and well...you can't download any without filling up your storage, so unless the apps are transferable to your SD card, you won't be able to download them. This is the first smart phone I have ever owned that my kids did not beg me to get them one just like it.The only people that I think this phone would be useful for is 90 year old people that sit at home and keep it plugged in all the time and never use it except for emergency situations...even then they are screwed if the electricity goes out because it will be dead in less than a few hours with barely any use.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "it was ok", "Author": "Francisco Villa-Real", "ReviewID": "R33QB890VW7NNV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the phone to use it with an application that uses the camera too. But the 2mp camera is to grainy it did not work. So I gave it a low score.If you just want a pic and don't need it hd picture then it's ok.
