{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LG Optimus G E970(AT&T;)", "Author": "Luis A. Lopez", "ReviewID": "R1QTQCDDFH0M1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great! It is my second smartphone and i love it. I have the HTC Evo 3D from virgin mobile and this phone is absolutely amazing. It is very responsive, fast, and the screen looks really clear. Overall a great phone, 10/10 for me.The seller(Cell-Source) sent me the phone as described, Brand new AT&T; unlocked and it works with Net10's 4G network, I tried it with my brother's SIM card. I had seen a lot of reviews on here saying that the 4G did not work in the US, so I did a little research and found out that there is 3 models of this phone. There is the E970(AT&T; version) and there is the LS970(Sprint Version) and i believe there is also an E975(International Version). So, for those of you who are giving this phone a low review because the 4G does not work in the US, make sure you have the unlocked AT&T; version and not the International Version(E975). The E970(AT&T;) has a MicroSD card slot up to 64Gb, 16Gb ROM and it comes with a 16Gb MicroSD card for a total of 32Gb but you can use about 25Gb more or less in total, which I think is enough for everyone. Before you buy, you can always contact the seller and ask to make sure you are getting what you want/need that way you do not spend your money. I would not be able to tell you if the AT&T; version (E970) would work anywhere else in the world, the best thing to do would be to research really good before you buy it. Another way to tell the E970(AT&T; version) apart from the Sprint(LS970) and International version(E975) is by the camera. Both the Sprint and International version have a 13MP camera and does NOT have a MicroSD card slot, they just have a 32Gb ROM (memory for storage). AT&T; decided to go with the 8MP camera instead of 13MP but added the MicroSD card slot, which is much better in my opinion. Other than that I believe the phones have the same specs.Specifications:-Quad-core 1.5GHz Processor-Adreno 320 GPU(for Graphics)-2Gb RAM-8MP Camera, 1.3MP front Facing camera-Android 4.1.2(came installed already)-MicroSD card slot up to 64Gb, 16Gb MicroSD card included.-Micro SIM-2G, 3G, and 4G(Where available, check your desired carrier)-4.7\" True HD IPS+ Display(very nice and clear!)-Gorilla Glass 2-2100 mAh battery(non-removeable)I think this is everything for right now, I will try and update as time goes by. If you guys have any questions feel free to ask I will try and reply ASAP. Thank you for taking your time to read this, it only helps you anyway :pALL SPECIFICATIONS INFORMATION WAS TAKEN FROM gsmarena dot comUPDATE: I've had this phone for about 2 or 3 weeks and it is working great! the battery has a good life with light to moderate use. I am writing this on my phone, the last time I charged it was Saturday night and it still has 30% battery life left. I made a couple of phone calls, text messages, some social networks,picture messaging, and web browsing.one thing that I had an issue with as the messaging app. for some weird reason, my messaging app got deleted and just disappeared. I had to do a factory reset to get it back. good thing is that I had installed an app that backed up my apps, but not data because my phone is not rooted. But overall the phone is working great, if you're looking for a case with not much bulk look for the diztronic matte black case.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellet phone", "Author": "carlos7412", "ReviewID": "R4YMXH9OFD981", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "is a great phone at a low price they recommend in Venezuela only serves 3g and 4g for digitel no for movistar", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus G E970 Unlocked 4G LTE Quad-Core ! 4.7\" IPS 2GB 16GB ROM Phone", "Author": "Emigdio Escalona", "ReviewID": "R1LWUTTK08N7YQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow It is great!

This I received is E970, there are people that buy the E975 and it have a different camera of 13 Mp without expandible memory. E970 has a camera of 8 Mp and expandible memory. The meaning point is that sometimes you need to configure the APN in order to enjoy internet, if you doesn't do the APN configuration you will think that the phone doesn't work 3G.

Includes 16GB microSD card & updated firmware to Jelly Bean 4.1.2 :-). What more you need!!!? & I paid $187 for it (on 29 Jan, 2014). BUT, I received this phone today (10th Feb)!!! Shipping was terrible. It supposed to be delivered on 6th Feb, but... :-|. I was very angry!!! but when I opened the box... wow! it was an awesome experience!!! I definitely recommend this phone!!!Edit (24 Feb, 2014): Still flawless performance after 24 days of power usage. You just can not ask anything more on 'performance' department. I could not utilize 2GB RAM, it is more than enough. Quad core CPU is super fast. I see many users complaining about battery life. Well 2100mAH is not enough for a android device like Optimus G to run 24 hours on moderate use. However, you can get that much of battery life by turning on 'Eco Mode' from setting menu. And about camera performance, it is doing pretty well. Images are fairly sharp enough, though the front facing camera is not that sharp. But you have to consider its price. In this price, this phone is the best phone ever!!! I still, highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "at&t; apps and Wifi tethering... my main problems!!", "Author": "GERMAN L.", "ReviewID": "R123YAKFRCZ1OD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Excellent phone once you root it and uninstall all AT&T; crap!!!! (of course if you will not use it in AT&T; network)... Otherwise the ROM of at&t; will make you life miserable...

You need to tap back button each time to go to android address book.... this is really annoying!! and of course this can't be uninstalled unless you root the phone and use a third party uninstaller.Other fatal issue I found in this phone is that is impossible to enable the wifi hotspot, Wifi tethering. (Of course in different networks that AT&T;)... I tried to enable tethering fuction in normal way (settings>tethering & networks>Mobile Hotspot), and with several apps for this purpose (almost 15) and  was absolutly impossible in each and all these ways...

Previous phone was an HTC Desire..this was\"Supposed\" to be an upgrade. This was a regrettable impulse buy. Bbuy was sellingit for a buck plus a 200 buck gift cert with contract. Now I'm locked in for 2yrs with a barely useable phone.-  First off, poor poor battery life. Poor poor sound volume...you can barely hearanything with a phone cover on it which renders the phone useless.-  Phone apparently requires a minimum 1000mA  charger or it takes 40 hoursto charge!  Most micro usb chargers are 500mA. So don't think that you can useyour old charger..maybe you can ,maybe you can't ...unless you don't mindwaiting.-  Once fully charged I am getting less than a day of use with very minimalusage. Maybe 1hr talk and 20 minutes of data usage..if that.  Worse than that...even when putting it in airplane mode while I am working and only using it on breaks...the battery still discharges. I have only 3 appsinstalled and have disabled background data usage on all of them. Today I tried shutting it off completely between breaks and that seemed to help. But that is ridiculous.-  I could easily solve the battery problem with a battery upgrade...* NO.. I can't!......In their infinite LACK of wisdom, LG saw fit to duplicate the iPhone'sstupidity in using a built-in NON-replaceable battery! I didn't even see thatcoming...who thinks to ask about that when they buy a phone??-  In addition to that, the screen has started to go blank on occasion. Then Ican't tell if the phone is on or off. Ordinarily you would remove the battery soyou KNOW your phone is off and then start the reboot process from scratch. Youcan't do that because the battery is not removable. It's a sad joke. No wonderthey were selling this for a buck!-  Sound is pitiful. Speaker phone is virtually useless. If I didn't have togive the Bbuy $200 buck gift card back which I already spent...I'd return it today.THAT's  how they get you!-  After using my friends Motorola I swore I would never buy another phone withouta keyboard...but I thought with the larger screen I would be able to navigate thetouch screen keyboard better...NOPE. Some of us big fingered clumsy people justneed to have a tactile, analog keyboard that folds out like the Motorola (which Iwould recommend much more highly than this phone).-  Camera quality is not up to par with its claimed 8MP capability. I find theinterface much more clumsy than my previous HTC which allowed you to turn theflash on and off from the screen without using menus.-  The HTC flashlight app which came with my old phone was much simpler anduseful than all the other apps I have found on gplay.-  I don't know if its an AT&T; mod or just Android 4.0, but when looking atpictures it doesn't seem to bring up your latest pic, you have to scroll to lookfor it. its just weird. The HTC was a much more intuitive interface altogether.-  I also preferred the weather and clock widgets and the 5 main screens of the HTC Desire (versus 3). Don't know if that is an android version difference or AT&T;'s piddling.--  Bottom Line:  Beware phones bearing $200 gifts!", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Maria Roversi", "ReviewID": "R3BEGU2JS8QXAW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone!

This is a very good, mostly-unlocked phone. As other people wrote, it is similar to LG Nexus 4 (but $100 cheaper and has 4G) but less powerful than LG Nexus 5 (which is similar to G2 but is twice more expensive than E970). I considered many smart phones, but the ones in my price range were this and Motorola Moto G. E970 was $20 more expensive but far more powerful than Moto G. My voice/data plan is a non-ATT discount company that uses the ATT network. After I installed the SIM card, it took a while for the tech support to activate it and even more to connect it to the 4G/LTE data network. They had to text me two patches to install to make it work (it was very easy: each text message had an Install button). Now it works flawlessly but I haven't done any speed test yet. Overall, the phone has an extremely fast CPU (4-core 1.5Ghz), sufficient RAM (2GB), plenty of SD space (32GB with the bonus SD card), excellent WiFi, good camera (8Mpixels), excellent bright display, and excellent battery.Now the bad news: it's intended mostly for an ATT plan. Of course the phone hardware can work with any provider; it's the preinstalled Android that has locked some apps and services. To be more specific, first, it comes preloaded with many ATT apps. This is fine since you can stop them and disable them from Settings/General/Application. But there is one that you cannot disable: My AT&T.; When you do Call/My Contacts to call a person from your contacts, it tries to connect to your ATT account to synchronize your contacts. At that point, you need to push Back to stop it and go to your contact list. It's not very important but annoying since you always have to push Back every time you make a call or text. I tried to fix this by deselecting \"Auto-sync data\" in Settings/General/Accounts&sync; but many times (always when I restart the phone), I get the same problem. The only solution to this is to \"root\" your phone and uninstall the ATT apps. But the most annoying thing is that ATT (as well as most US mobile providers) has locked tethering by software. Tethering is used when there is no WiFi and you want to connect other devices to your data network through your phone. It is illegal in other countries for a data provider to lock tethering, but here in US, they can do this by soft-locking your phone and sell you a special data plan to unlock it. This is very greedy: it's like your home internet provider charge you extra if you connect a router at home to connect other PCs. So in US, you need to call your provider to unlock tethering, and they will text you a special patch specific to your SIM card.How to root your phone: Rooting means that you get a complete control of your phone, similar to the root account in Linux or Administrator account in Windows. Is it legal? of course it is. It's like asking: is it legal to work on Windows using an Administrator account? It's your phone and you payed a full price. If your phone manufacture voids the warranty because of that, you should report it to forums so that nobody buys its phones. Also you can always unroot. Note though, as root you may do destructive things to your phone and even \"brick\" it, which is extremely difficult to restore (unlike Windows). Also, you may do things that void your data plan (such as unlocking tethering); so read your plan contract carefully. How to root: read the first guide in forum.xda-developers DOT com/optimus-g-att. How to uninstall locked apps: use the app \"ES File Explorer File Manager\" with Root Explorer ON.How to unlock tethering: DON'T. If you are in US, ask your mobile provider. If you are outside US and you are sure your provider allows it, then root your phone and unlock tethering (search: \"e970 tether sqlite\").", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Couldnt be happier....", "Author": "vivian", "ReviewID": "RBJ6DCCK77SYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have shopped, online and in the store at each of the three carrier and finally decided to purchased this unlocked phone and stayed with my carrier rather than switching...sometimes you can't tell by the image until you have the touch and feel of the device in your hand...and i am here to tell you...if you are looking for screen that is bigger than an iPhone (i had that) and smaller than a Note - look no more...this is your phone...but that's just the physical trait...the processor speed on this thing is phenomenon and the clarity....and the battery life...I have it on for almost 24 hours now...and i still have at least 30% left (but probably because i havent been able to get my data to work yet)...it uses a micro SIM (not included) and the unlocked code (included).

The features are amazing and Samsung Galaxy S 3/4 users are blown away with the Q-Slide and Video zoom features. it is clearly better than the S3 and is giving the S4 a good run (LG G2 is out to handle the S4 tho so don't worry). The sleek design is a great fit in my hand and it is light weight. I love the camera i compared it with my g/f's S3 and in most cases the Optimus G was better (despite the internet reviews) really pleased about the phone, the only down side i had is that LG Socia+ does not come on the phone how it did with the LG Prada 3.0 and i cant find a download for it.

What a great phone. I have an LG Optimus G Pro locked to ATT that I use in the US. I needed a replacement for my awful Galaxy SIII for international travel. The SIII had a terrible camera. The photos were washed out whenever there was indirect sunlight. The SIII screen would lock up regularly, particularly just when trying to take a quick photo shot. So the SIII had to go. It was stolen in Colombia. So that put me in the market for a replacement. I love the LG Optimus G Pro. But it's still locked in contract and is really too big to be packed around the world. The Optimus G is just right. It's a nice size that fits easily in a belt case. The G is just as smooth and fast as the G Pro. The WiFi is strong and connects easily. Battery life is very good. I regularly get two days between charges under heavy use with the G. It will last about a week if just sitting on standby while I use the G Pro. The G audio is very good. I listen to both an extensive music collection and audio books on the G. For international travel in which I will be regularly trading SIM cards I like that the SIM slot on the G is accessible behind a cover on the side of the phone. You never take the back off the phone. It's easy to swap both SIM cards and MicroSD cards. The back of the phone is glass and quite slippery. It needs a protective case. I've got a hard case on mine which makes one handed use easy.I picked up my used G that is like new for a very good price. The latest news is that Kit Kat is coming to the G. It works fine on Jelly Bean. But it's nice to know it will get the latest operating system. I'm very happy with this phone. Some phones don't age well. The Optimus G was released in late 2012. It's a great phone that is still cutting edge in both hardware and software.

While I wanted a Galaxy (they are a great choice), they were a bit out of my price range, and with my upgrade AT&T; was willing to give me on of these for $100. All those features, for that cheap? A quad core processor, pretty decent camera, gorilla glass screen, kevlar construction, and all those cool Droid features and programability? I couldn't resist, I thought I'd gotten the phone steal of the century, and after spending about a week learning how to navigate through the droid software, I thought it was too good to be true. Turns out, it was. This thing's reliability is absolutely abysmal. Within a month it began shutting itself down randomly, and would often refuse to turn back on for several hours. This problem eventually passed, and I thought the woes were behind me. NOPE. For the next few months it had repeated hiccups, frequently quitting out of apps spontaneously, changing wallpapers on its own, making emergency phone calls at random (no joke), and other things. And then, right about 7 months after I got it, things got really bad. It started completely crashing whenever I used the internet browser, and would shut down for a solid half hour or so, then turn back on, only to flash white, produce all sorts of odd patterns on the screen, and crash again. And now it does this repeatedly, several times a day. So basically I only have a functioning phone half the time. This device is an absolute disaster. I mean the features are great, outstanding even, and when it works it's quite cool to be honest (all of my friends wanted to mess around with my \"space machine\" when it was new). But that's the problem. It DOESN'T work. Honestly just stick to an Iphone or a Galaxy. All these no name Droids are no named for a reason, their reliability is a nightmare. What a headache. Perhaps I got a dud, but from what I've read a lot of people have been having problems with the Optimus G. Go for something else, save yourself the agony.

I bought a very good, thick case the next day.

It would be cheaper to buy a new phone each time you break the screen if you had to pay labor.Well, I got the screen fixed.  2 months later the microphone stops working!!  no reason why, it just stopped. the speaker phone works so I have to make all my calls with speaker phone.Well, the phone is 4 months old, warranty is void since it was opened, so forget it, I will never buy LG again.  My last LG  broke after 5 months.Coming from a Nokia N8, these new phones are not made correctly.  I literally, not figuratively, threw the N8 at the wall drunk one time, and it stuck in the drywall with no damage to the phone.  It was also dropped kick (on accident) across a road, and I even left it on the roof of my car and drove away.  I never broke that phone and it never had a case. It was indestructible.  LG makes phones that break so you keep buying them again and again and they keep the parts so expensive that its not worth fixing.I would recommend looking for a phone that has a cheaper screen replacement.  then if you break the screen, it wont be cheaper to buy a new phone each time and you can pay $40 for someone to fix your phone.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Item is expected", "Author": "Yorvy David", "ReviewID": "R26V1CO5Q8A1TK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The article is what I expected okay, I agree with the purchase and I'm still looking good phone since I just got", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems with product", "Author": "Greymar Barrera", "ReviewID": "R35LQN9I5TAS8O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello!
