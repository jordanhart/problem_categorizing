It's the one they give you free in the store when you sign up for a plan. In fact when I bought mine I got a $50 mail in rebate, so basically they paid me $50 to take this phone.It has extremely limited space for texts. I send 250 texts a month tops, and I constantly have to delete old texts. As far as internet capabilities goes, you can get online, but it's not very user friendly.That being said, the phone makes calls. For me that was all I needed. If you want a tripped out phone that your friends will envy, this is not the phone for you; but if you want a very inexpensive phone that works, this one is great.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The INSANITY II", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "RAMRF019621SA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for quite some time now and have grown to despise it. It works well, is fairly tough. has a very good keyboard and has good battery life. My problem with it is the buttons, they get pushed while its in my pocket it calls people, or turns on voice commands, reconfigures my phone settings, erases texts, sends texts, trys to buy things, ect. It is supposed to only unlock when slid open but thats not what happens in real life. I found the only way to keep it from doing things on its own is to set a lock code (the 4 digit security code). Now I miss most of my calls fumbling with trying to unlock it,  but at least I win! I cant wait until my next upgrade. If you carry it in a case or a bag it might be alright but if you put it in your pocket it will sound like you are playing Frogger (an old video game)when you walk!", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awful Phone", "Author": "Live To Rock", "ReviewID": "R6HG1I2QM7960", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had the original Samsung Intensity for almost four years and absolutely loved it.  I decided to \"upgrade\" to the Intensity II and could not believe what a disappointment the phone was.  Here's is a list of problems I ran into with this piece of garbage:1. They have rearranged the keys on the keyboard which was extremely annoying, especially since it's basically the same phone and there really was no reason to do that.2. The buttons on the keyboard are flatter than on the original Intensity, so even though I thought I pressed a button I actually hadn't.3.  For some reason the Intensity II cannot receive texts from people with Apple Iphones that are sent to multiple people. My old Intensity had no problem getting those texts.  The Intensity II shows a blank screen.  It's extremely annoying and embarrassing to have to continuously ask my friends and family with Iphones to please resend what they had just sent because I couldn't see what the text said.4.  The phone would just \"lock up\" or \"freeze\" every couple of weeks for no reason.  I would have to remove the battery and put it back in to get it working again.5.  The phone is extremely sluggish compared to my old original Intensity.  It would take a few seconds when pulling up the address book or opening emails.6.  Even though I had the 2 button lock set on my phone, it was constantly dialing numbers or pulling up contacts while in my pocket.  I rarely had a problem with that happening on my old phone, and that one only had the one button lock on it.In conclusion, the Intensity II was a HUGE step back from the wonderful original Intensity.  In fact, I disliked the II so much that I have switched back to my old phone.  If you are considering this phone as an option, I would strongly suggest either the original Intensity or the Intensity III, which seems to be a great improvement over the II.  But in my opinion avoid the Intensity II if at all possible.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone for price", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R1ONYQDLNJBLMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one to upgrade from a very basic LG Revere.

Verison said it would be $ 70 month for the smart prepaid phones  which i seen the reviews show these phones are old outdated junk to and reviews say these phones suck and it is not unlimited bs again.  I pay $50 monthly on this junk.  you tube works well the desktop navagator and email is an extra $10 month bs again.

She saw the phone at a local Verizon store and they wanted 149.00 for it and Walmart wanted 85.00 for it. I shopped around and found this phone for 75.69. Every dollar counts these days and its the exact same phone the stores are carrying.  As far as the phone goes, its basic. Its not an iphone or droid but neither is the price. You are getting a very basic phone with internet capabilities that aren't very user friendly compared to today's smart phones that use Ice Cream Sandwich, jellybean etc. The phone is well worth the 75 dollars in my opinion.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone lives forever", "Author": "Amber", "ReviewID": "R3VMF2CT8640W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for two years now and have dropped it so many times i cant even count.
