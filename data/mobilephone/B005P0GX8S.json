According to Verizon, this phone does require one.  I had to cancel my order, but it was not the seller's fault.***UPDATE: This evening I have talked to three Verizon CSRs and received three different answers on the data plan issue.  I am going to confirm tomorrow and update this review again with a definitive answer (that is in writing).*** LATEST UPDATE: I just had a conversation with Verizon concerning this phone.  According to the CSR I spoke with, and confirmed by his supervisor, when you activate this phone, they will automatically add a $9.99 data plan that covers 75MB of data.  However, you can request that the data plan be removed and that a data block be placed on the phone.The latest information satisfies my concerns and I have requested that the seller rescind my cancellation request and ship the phone. I will be back later after I activate the phone to let you know how my wife likes it.

Verizon had no problem activating it onto my plan and there were no hidden fees at Verizon so that was nice.The battery that came with the phone was not a good one and they had no control over that. So I had to buy a new battery and when I told them that, they were more than willing to help cover that cost.

Probably the digitizer, because it would charge and turn on but the screen was unresponsive making the phone mostly useless.  The people we ordered from were excellent and replced the unit, and that one worked until my daughter dropped it and the digitizer came off.  I purchased a replacement digitizer, which is a pain to install, but it worked for a little while.  My opinion is that the digitizer cable does not attach securely enough.  You slide it into a slot and it just sits there, and if it doesn't stay in the slot properly there is no contact and the darn screen is no longer responsive.  Based on the number of forum complaints, I'd say this is a common problem.
