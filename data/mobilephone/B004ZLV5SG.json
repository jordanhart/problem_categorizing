Summary is that BuyMart is fraud and they sell tampered products as \"New\" instead of \"Refurbished\".I purchased Iphone 3G as Birthday gift for my wife on Dec 2012 and the phone's home button stopped working on Dec 2013 and there were few more days left to complete the 1 Year. Though Buymart and Amazon gives replacement only within like 3 months, I was expecting Manufacturer warrenty of 1 year from Apple.To my surprise Apple said the warranty expired as this product was purchased in Sep 2009! The most surprising thing is that They said lots of parts in this phone has been replaced and tampered with. This was surprise to me since I payed almost 300 bucks to get this phone in \"New\" condition!I Don't see an option to attach a file else I would have  uploaded the diagnosis results from Apple Store here. But these are the highlights from Apple diagnosis notes. I have decided to file lawsuit against amazon and Buymart as both are doing fraud- Upon Visual inspection Unit appears to have third party modification- Unit was purchased in 2009 and taken to a third party location to have repairs- Unit receiver and Speaker is third party- Back module is third party- Unit was sold as \"like new\" however there is evidence of third party repair- Service denied due to unauthorized modificationSo think before you decide to buyThanks,Sunil", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "So bad", "Author": "erdal", "ReviewID": "R134W3AUAY9W7Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item was listed as \"like new\", but there were some problems.
