It was the most advanced phone that Virgin Mobile offered at the time I purchased it.  It is a good phone but it does have some issues. My main issue is that sometimes it crashes. Just out of the blue it will restart itself.  Also when you click on an email link in Opera Mini it will give a fatal error message and crash.  The phone slows down a lot when you have the email app in the background. Ive not had any problems with the touch screen at all.  It works excellently.  The GPS does take a while to lock in Google Maps if you are not outside and sitting still. The battery does have to be charged on a nightly basis but it does last all day during moderate usage.  I have dropped it on concrete several times and the screen was not effected at all. The camera isnt the best but it is nice to have.  Would be better if it had a flash. The full 5 row qwerty keyboard is the best part of this phone.  All in all I have been pleased with this phone.  I would recommend it to others and at under $100.00 its an affordable options for those who dont necessarily need a smart phone.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lg Rumor touch", "Author": "jess", "ReviewID": "R2JBMWGB5TKCPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE THIS PHONE, i dont know what other people are talking about the phones plans being expencive? I pay 25$ a mo. plus tax, and i have unlimited data ( email, IM, Facebook, Youtube, google maps which has gps) and unlimited texting along with 300min a mo. there is no latefee for paying the bill late, they just change you date of payment. Is able to play music from sd card, has a camera and its just my favorite fone from virgin mobile. i have owned 5 other virgin mobile phones and this byfar is one of the best that they came out this so far.  I bought this phone 09/2010 and am still using it. facebook stil works it just needed to update settings for a couple of days. so if you want a phone for a good price and good monthly price you should get this.  other plans are unlim. tex and data, and (i think)500-900 min for 40$ or unlimited everything for 50$.its alot better then those smart phones with their extra charge for 3g/4g network, works just the same.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "is it wrong to love a cell phone?", "Author": "Gavin \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R1SDI229WVZXPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Probably. In most states. But i bought this VM LG Rumor Touch at the 'red & white rings' store when it was on sale. Overall it's a great electronic device. Amazon and virgin mobile's site does a great job of describing it and telling you what to expect. I'll share just some impressions and not-so-great-things about it. But make no mistake, i'd recommend this easily.likes:* mp3's come through clear and crisp in external speaker(headphones and usb cable included)* that 3\" touchscreen is nice compared to my previous 2\" screen on my last cell. it's like going from standard def to HD(sorta)* pics are good and sharp. my shaky hand and some pics look blurry when in camera mode. but once you take it and view it, it looks great. thanks image stabilization(or a variation of it)* micro-sd slot is great for adding lots of mp3's. have not figured how to transport pics and vids to the sd-card slot to view on my camera yet. but then, i'm an idiot with gadgets. (figured it out, just go to tools>mass storage>file manager)* qwerty keyboard is fairly spaced out for me, but if you got big/chubby fingers you might have problems.* i'm a cheap, so i only pay $25 a month for this phone, total! i get 300 anytime minutes for calls, unlimited texts/pic msgs(not including the free messaging through social networks and emails), and unlimited web access. do i need to even repeat that? of course, higher plans with more talk minutes are available as an option.* 3G built-in(but no wi-fi). Spotty at times, but mostly consistent and reliably there when you want to surf the web.dislikes:* not very good video playback in camcorder mode. it's serviceable, and at least the option to take videos and watch them is there. just don't expect high-quality.* you can customize ur pics, but nothing really special or extensive. worse, you don't seem to be able to organzize your pics into specific albums(i will apologize if this option turns up, but i can't find any extensive options to organize your pics)* scrolling through long lists is imprecise and can be frustrating.* you can't seem to assign your mp3's as ringtones.* the default is an 'unlock' screen where you slide to unlock it to access your phone. doesn't bother me much, but i decided that i would leave my cell unlocked cause i could see it might annoy me if i had to unlock it with some code or procedure, no thanks. besides, it's not like i have government secrets on my phone.Overall, great phone(i've actually used it for calls a few times and the reception is good and i live out in the boonies sort of), tons of features, and a cheap monthly plan for me with other options for others.

Never needed insurance because I've never had anything happen to my phone in the past, and after going on about 5 months or so with a broken phone that I used apps to make it almost a real phone, I decided it was time to get a cheap end touch screen phone until I can afford to upgrade again.I was going to get a used one for the cheaper price, but after reading some of the comments, I think it was best to spend a couple extra bucks for a brand new one. I really just needed a basic working phone, so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular with this one.The item came as described. The touch screen is not like the 4g's, more like the older blackberry touch phones. Very basic. The calibration is off even after fixing it.The settings on the phone is limited, very little personality to it.The keyboard, I think the spacing is too much, I had a qwerty before and the keys were a little closer. I wanted the qwerty because after having the 4g android, I couldn't stand all the auto errors on spelling and all the typos that was caused from the touch screen.Other then that, it's fine for a basic phone. I haven't tried calling on it, i'm a big time texter, with virgin mobile, it's unlimited. The signal seems to be good in my area.I suppose my comments are neutral. Nothing really bad, nothing really great about this phone. If you need an extra phone for house line, or something in between, or just a simple phone that's not complicated, this would be it.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hate it", "Author": "mein3", "ReviewID": "R113TNEZTMN8PF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.  If I could give \"0\" zero stars, I would.  I specifically purchased this phone because of the email, social media and navigational apps it touted on Virgin Mobile's website.  I purchased it directly from Virgin Mobile.  I thought I would be saving money with the plan's voice and data package, but the plan's now pretty expensive/useless since the phone doesn't give real access to the data I need.  I could have gone on one of those prepaid cards phone plans instead and it would have been cheaper with the exact same service and features I get now.After one month of having this phone, the apps work poorly or no longer work at all.  The email app does not work for the featured providers - the only way it works is that you have to manually input your POP/IMAP account info to access your email and it is not instant - you must sync to get your messages and even then, you can only get the most 50 recent messages.  Also, after writing an email, it is hit or miss whether or not people receive it.  THE SOCIAL NETWORKING APPS (FACEBOOK, TWITTER, MYSPACE) featured on this phone through Virgin Mobile NO LONGER WORK as of 11/11 - they've been discontinued due to a network upgrade - OR so I have been told as I had contacted Virgin's customer service numerous times - the first explanation being that it was due to network upgrades and the phone would merely have to be reset for the apps to work, but the latest being that not even a month after purchasing this phone - the social media apps are no longer supported.  Also the customer service for Virgin Mobile is the worse I've ever encountered - I've had previous carriers that have offered to trade-in for an upgrade or free minutes, etc. - but this company is completely unapologetic for the false advertising they've given regarding the phone and plan.  The navigation they claim to offer does not come with the phone - it is on yet another separate (costly) monthly plan.  They have a web browser that they suggested you could use to recover \"access\" to email and social media networks - but the browser is out-dated and prevents you from logging on due to \"unable to verify website/server\" messages and if you do manage to get on - the connection is lousy.  As for pictures, like the other social media apps, the photo-sharing apps on the phone are no longer supported (since June 2011 which doesn't make sense why they advertised it in October 2011) and you have to manually send your pictures to email to save.  You can't transfer the pictures to your computer by merely hooking the USB cable to your computer from your phone.  You need to transfer the pictures on your phone to a micro SD card and use either a card reader or fiddle with connecting the phone to your computer with a USB cable.  Also, if you want music on your phone, you need the micro SD card again and preload the memory card with your music.  Game apps are available on the phone, but they are pretty outdated games and yet, a heck of a lot more expensive than Droid/iPhone apps.So basically, what you are left with is a phone for voice calls and text messaging.  The touch screen is lousy - either you press too lightly and the phone does not read you or you press too hard and it instantly launches whatever your finger happened to be on.  You can recalibrate the touch screen, but it doesn't really remedy the fact that this phone's touch screen is not as intuitive as other touch phones.  Since the touch screen is lousy, it gets troublesome to choose the right contact, make and receive calls.  Also, the finicky touch screen locks you out quickly so be careful when you need to make a call that requires the dial pad.  Also, getting your text messages is a headache due to the crappy touch screen.  The keypad is the one thing that redeems this phone, but other than that, I've been ripped off a chunk of change.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Screen breaks! + find cheaper elsewhere", "Author": "Oauzzie Youtube", "ReviewID": "R26S17CKFYK61C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The LG Rumor Touch Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile) is currently valued at $40.00 on the Virgin Mobile website.

I would open up the slide-out keyboard (an awesome feature) to do something and then as I close it, the phone would restart itself.

The ribbon that connects the keyboard to the screen started to go bad after about a year of average use, so when I opened the keyboard it would make the phone shut off right in the middle of a text- or just shut off immediately. When I would answer the phone and slide the bar to \"answer\" it would cut off my call. I'd say 90% of the time I had poor service and my calls would get dropped or would cut in and out. Within the last few months I have been unable to send and receive texts without having to go through the troubleshooting steps to correct it temporarily- after calling and complaining FOUR times to Virgin Mobile customer service. Also, I have not been receiving voicemail notifications so my voicemails would sit in my in-box for days before I would see that I had one, and a few time it wouldn't even show me that anyone had called!Oh, don't get me started on the customer service! They are the WORST customer service team. When I asked why I could not send or receive texts or voice messages, the customer service rep told me there were no towers being upgraded in my area so that would not be the issue. Then I call the next day-with the same issue- and I am told that there are towers in my area being upgraded and that is why I am having these issues. I immediately called them out on it and they tried to change the subject! I cannot believe the inconsistency in information I am given and all they want to do is apologize but not actually do anything! You can never talk to the same person you talked to last time because no one knows who it was and they are not even all in the same location. When I asked if I have to go through the same troubleshooting steps each time I cannot send or receive my texts, I was told yes. I should NOT have to troubleshoot every time I want to text someone and the fact that it was even suggested shows what a horrible phone it is and how poor the service is. I'll admit one of the girls I spoke with was nice, but not very helpful. The others were rude, cut me off when I was talking, lied to me, did not document anything I told them in previous calls- so ended up re-explaining every time I called, did not even listen to what I was saying- this includes a \"supervisor\" which I suspect was JoeSchmo sitting next to him and no one of actual authority.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OR USE VIRIGN MOBILE!I love Amazon and use it for just about all of my purchases, so this review is nothing against the Amazon company.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Rumor", "Author": "Solael", "ReviewID": "R1GARWUV0IN5U0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do like this phone, but it is temporary until I buy the Samsung G4.

Worse, I'm using the manual provided by Virgin Mobile on its own website to troubleshoot. I purchased this phone because I was having a lot of trouble with my new LG Optimus V, which doesn't respond to taps on its screen icons.

It surfs the web OK if you download Opera, and it can do facebook, email, etc pretty well.  I Like the keyboard for both web navigation and texting.  I don't like the phone implementation.  Half the time I accidentally hang up when I try to slide the virtual slider to answer.  The camera is half decent, but it is very slow response.  The biggest peeve is that it can multitask most every app except the mp3 player!  So you can't listen to music and text or surf the web or anything without exiting and stopping the music.I bought this when Virgin only had one bad Android phone, but anymore this isn't worth the few bucks saved.

The Sony was a free* dumbphone I obtained in 2008.  The LG Rumor is a very cheap phone, but I expected it to be an upgrade.The screen is poor, the camera was quite bad, and the included browser was atrocious.  All inferior to the obsolete Sony.The keyboard is excellent.  I'll give LG credit on this.Virgin has badly locked down this phone.  It's a hassle to do things like customize your ring tone with an mp3.In our brief time together, this phone would reboot after any program closed, text sent, or call completed.Via google I learned that this is a common issue and someone modified their LG Rumor to alleviate this reset issue with strips of paper holding the battery against the terminal.  I was surprised to learn this does improve reliability, but the phone is still completely unacceptable.After modifying the terminals to maintain contact, I realized some of the reboots were software related.Unfortunately this is merely the latest LG product I have been disappointed with.This phone is a poor value at any price.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "the worst phone very", "Author": "Danny13", "ReviewID": "R3JO4DST34VY9N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone  not the best and it sick badle the touchscreen suck the screen get broken i give it 1/5 please dont buy this phone", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG should stop making cell phone", "Author": "Pijush Talukder", "ReviewID": "R16SQFEELB3HXK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We changed LG rumor touch twice within two years.
