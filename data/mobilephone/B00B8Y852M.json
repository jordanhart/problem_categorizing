It has everything except the kitchen sink (for me) as far as cell phones go.  I have had the phone for 4 days now.  I purchased the phone from Oakland Wireless.  Shipping was very fast.  From the day it was shipped to the day that I received the phone, 2 days.  I would buy from Oakland Wireless again and I would also recommend Oakland Wireless.On to the phone.  There is more on this phone than I could ask for.  My gosh, I am just so impressed.Before purchasing the phone, I read many reviews.  There were many good reviews for this phone. One review that I came across stated: 6 hours of talk time and 11 days of standby.  This may hold true if there were no preinstalled apps on the phone.  I charged my phone the minute I received it. 3 hrs later I noticed that the battery was going down. (I didn't even talk on the phone yet)  I knew how to fix this.  I would just go in and uninstall the apps that I do not need.  No can do!  Any preinstalled app cannot be uninstalled.  So I stopped the apps from running that I do not need.  My battery doesn't seem to drain as much now.All smart phones have preinstalled apps on them.  In my opinion just preinstalled the important apps and if a person wants more then they can go and download what they want.I gave the phone 5 stars as I feel it is a great and excellent phone. The phone is very user firendly, takes great pictures, sound is great.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "bad product", "Author": "rene c", "ReviewID": "R22F9SJ74PCZS9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "don't buy  from this seller, the product comes defective. don't waste your money.

I have had no problems with it, and it seems to have great battery life. I plug it in every night without turning it off, and by morning it is ready for another day. Of course, I have customized it to my taste, which wasn't too hard after I played around with it for a while.

It was the best ever!  I rated it one star because I was forced to give it up.  It started taking pictures at random and I researched with the mfg.. I was told.  \"Time to get a new phone.\"  Hum?  Looked up glitch on line and, sure enuf, lots of people having the same problem.  I didn't want to give up this phone but seriously believed the mfg specifically encoded or electronically bugged this glitch to stimulate new sales as no one having the problem on line could find a solution.  I endured... after many weeks the picture taking slowed...but other glitches kicked in. Like just freezing - up.  Anytime, except when engaged in an actual call.  But other users I found actually had their calls freeze. Hummm?  Ok.. the freezing was the nail in the coffin.Two other adults in my home are still on their MyTouch phones and not having the problems I experienced.  Perhaps it would have been too obvious for all three of our phones to start going hay-wire?  Also, Four other family members have the new Galaxy's, ie. 2, 3, & the 4.  They are very happy, (except my Daughter, she has the G-2 which I actually tried) They acquired their phones with service discounts, for which I did not qualify. Do I like my new phone? ( the 3Gs iphone) not nearly as well. (Couldn't afford the more current models)  I did try a  Galaxy 2 - very disappointing!  Might have liked the Galaxy 3, but $200 was my budget.  The 3Gs iphone doesn't glitch, well, not much, anyway,  It was not a used phone but a factory new one.I'm not a happy camper.I actually think I would have been better off with a reliable cheapy phone and a decent ipod for the net.. Oh well...
