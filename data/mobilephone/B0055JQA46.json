The item I purchased was supposed to be brand new in original packaging.Instead, I received a refurbished version with the wrong box.I ordered the Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition Unlocked Cell Cellular Mobile Phone.When I looked at the phone inside I could tell that someone was tampering with its internal parts and the label with the UPC code was changed.It was obviously a refurbished phone. They may have as well put a golden body on top of a regular 6700 Nokia (most of them are not the Golden edition).So I could not be sure if it actually is the Golden edition, plus it was supposed to be brand new. One of the sides of the phone could not snap back properly to its place also. And last, but not least, the phone sis not come in the original box. The box was of a regular 6700 Nokia - white in color, but the original box does say'Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition' on it and it should be all black color (I'm talking about the color of the box here). Also 2 of the original accessories were missing - the pouch and the something else, I forgot. You can google 'Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition' and see how the box should look like and what accessories should be included inside. There are some unboxing video reviews in YouTube too.I contacted the seller for a refund. The seller responded to all my emails and accepted a return.I did not pay for return shipping. The seller sent me a label, which I printed. After they received the item, they refunded me.I was not happy with the item, as it was refurbished (tampered with) and in the wrong box (and some missing accessories), but I overall I am happy with the seller! Amazon did not play part in this transaction, although their system allowed for all the communication and refund processes.I advise everyone to double check with the seller before you are buying this phone exactly what the box looks like, and what is the condition of the phone.I hope this helps.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia 6700 classic gold edition unlocked cell phone.", "Author": "Michael Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3PXF9Z6DF89P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phone worked right out of the box.
