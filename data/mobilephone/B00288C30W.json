{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cute and simple but flimsy", "Author": "Jenna", "ReviewID": "R2PTS4HYMHCHIF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: good reception, phone comes loaded with 300 minutes. Nice looking design with a bright, full color screen and buttons that light up blue. Comes with 20 MIDI ringtones, 2 games, and nice choice of wallpapers. Text messages cost 5 cents each. Easy to add minutes right from the phone or online.Cons: has a sort of \"plastic toy\" feel to it.  Very light, very small. Takes some practice to avoid pressing multiple buttons at once. Callers sound slightly muffled. Cannot download new ringtones or wallpaper. Not recommended for heavy phone users or newbies.This is a cheap, no frills phone. It is not a multimedia device. It doesn't take pictures, surf the internet, send emails, or play MP3s. It makes and receives calls and texts and stores phone numbers. To be honest it's a cute little cheap piece of plastic for people who want a cell phone for emergencies or to make occasional calls. Heavy callers, texters, or people that tend to be hard on their stuff should think twice before buying this phone.On the other hand if you are someone that tends to keep your phone nice and shiny, you are a reasonably competent technology user, and you only want to make the occasional call this is an attractive, reliable little phone for a good price.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dishonest phone, dishonest carrier!", "Author": "R. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R3266TLI96HCFA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as refurbished from Net10's website, intending to use it for service comparison against two other cell phones. The test included in-building use, as well as remote area use. The Net10 LG300 failed all tests! This phone shows impressive signal strength indication on the screen, but this means nothing; it simply won't allow calls unless \"Home\" is displayed on the phone's screen. Also, text messaging is limited to approved senders (no premium services, unless they are through Net10's approved suppliers). I couldn't even get weather updates from my local newspaper!I had the phone less than two weeks, and used about 16 minutes of the 500 minute package that came with the phone, when I decided that I had had enough! I called Net10's \"customer service\" to arrange for a return and refund, and that's when matters actually got even worse. First, they cancelled all the remaining minutes (484), and then stipulated a return policy completely different from the policy supplied with the phone (ship it back with delivery confirmation, and then call them back again to confirm arrival and call back again to check the status of the refund claim, etc, etc.)! Oh, did I say that I originally had to call them from two different phones, and was transferred FIVE times, giving IMEI codes, invoice numbers, phone number, my name, address, reason for calling, reason for cancelling, etc. to each of the FIVE reps (all of whom needed more training in the English language)! Other reviewers on other sites have slammed Net10's \"customer service\" as the absolute worst in the business, and I am forced to agree! At 64, I have never experienced such frustration in dealing with a company (intended by this South American company, no doubt)!The LG300 is carefully designed to be used for Net10 alone, and cannot be transferred to another carrier. Even the security code within is restricted to the customer, so certain phone features are disabled!If you are looking for a good phone, and a reliable carrier with good customer service, all I can suggest to you is \"look elsewhere\"!", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Deal on Prepaid", "Author": "MyBeesWax \"A Music Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RH2WDU64RN8O0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In this age where Bluetooth, WiFi, touchscreen, mp3/video players, FM radio, GPS navigation, PDAs, memory expansion slots, voice recognition, web browsers, digital cameras, polyphonic ringtones, etc. are being incorporated into mobile phones, the LG 300 is a severely stripped-down phone that doesn't have ANY of the aforementioned features. It's just a bare-bones, no-frills phone that's reminiscent of the mobile phones in the 90's. Not surprisingly, then, the LG 300 is nothing to write home about.But I will say this -- the LG 300 is sleek and one of the most compact and lightweight mobile phones I've seen. The battery life on standby time is about 4 days. I can't speak to its battery life on talk time because I've never had a long enough phone conversation to determine it. It uses a lithium ion battery so there won't be a problem with \"memory effect.\"If you need a basic cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, this compact phone is a good deal and Net10 is a good service to go with:Free Phone----------For starters, for 30 bucks you get this phone PLUS 300 minutes. Since Net10 sells add-on 300 minutes in airtime for 30 bucks, you're in effect getting this phone for free.Cheap Rates-----------At 10 cents per minute for local or long distance calls, the Net10 phone service is simply the best deal. Text messages cost only 5 cents to send or receive.No Hidden Charges-----------------No wireless contracts or penalties for early cancellation. No roaming charges. 10 cents per minutes, plain and simple.Rollover minutes----------------If you buy more minutes before your old minutes expire, your old minutes will roll over and expire the same time as your new minutes. Minutes will keep rolling over for as long as add more minutes before your current minutes expire.For example, to keep your minutes from expiring, you can add 200 minutes (for 30 days of service) or 300 minutes (for 60 days of service).3 Convenient Ways To Add Minutes--------------------------------You can add minutes by:1) buying Net10 phone cards2) buying airtime through the Net10 Website3) buying airtime directly from the LG 300 phone.To buy airtime directly from the phone, you are required to set up a PIN at the Net10 Website. You will be asked for this PIN whenever you add airtime through your phone.Decent Coverage---------------Net10 reportedly uses both AT&T; (formerly Cingular) and T-Mobile networks. Most of the time, I have no problems with coverage in my area, although I do get dropped calls every now and then.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the best prepaid cell phone service bar none. If you need a cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, the Net 10 phones will fit the bill perfectly.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible Service!!", "Author": "J.M.", "ReviewID": "RGNYR0QZA1QSD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "They charge you minutes off your phone during time you are on the phone with customer service, they were very adamant they are irreplaceable when questioned about that, and you could be on the phone or on hold for an easy hour. More experiences with them: I would not get my unused minutes from the prior month, even after several calls saying they \"fixed it\". And I would go through this on a monthly basis. I earned them because I used phone cards, not a monthly plan. Still have yet to get my \"roll over minutes.\" My phone would randomly be deactivated for no reason then I would have to call customer service to get it activated again. One time they had to mail me a new SIM card (as a fix it for one of my problems) which took a week, so I was out of phone for a week, no kind of compensation for time lost either. I have a hard time understanding some of the operators, with thick accents, I'm constantly asking them to repeat or spell out a word I can't understand.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Complete garbage (for me, anyway)", "Author": "Ruthless", "ReviewID": "R2455G2ZBP3CPJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My niece has a good working Net10 phone that I buy minutes for all the time, so I thought I'd pick one up for my husband and I.  Here's my horror story.I picked up this model in Walmart on a Thursday.  I had to bring it back the following day because the back cover that was included in the clamshell case was THE WRONG ONE, and WOULDN'T FIT.  The girls behind the counter had a little laugh as they opened up 3 more of the same model cases until they found a back cover that would fit it, and I went back home with it a second time.I plugged it in that afternoon, hoping for a powerup by sometime that evening, but nothing.  The following morning, Saturday, still nothing.Completely disgusted, I returned to Walmart that same day and just returned it.If this is any indication of the quality of present Net10 phones, I'm having nothing to do with it, and am, unfortunately very gun-shy about any of them from any manufacturer at the present time.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible (\"I Don't Care\") Customer Service", "Author": "Donald Randall", "ReviewID": "R1EO8L67U6RM2U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product three months ago and tried to speak with the customer service people in Guayana.

My husband's friends like to text him, and he's managed to be able to text back, although he says it takes some getting used to.

I don't want everyone to have my personal cell, so picking this up from WalMart provided a little bit of privacy for me. Strong word of caution here: texting on this phone this phone will make you pray for death.  I once left my real phone (qwerty board) at home and had to eek out a quick message with this - it took for.ev.er.  Without nails or a pencil eraser, it would have been a lost cause.  Also, I once let coverage lapse when I went on vacation and forgot to reup before leaving.  I had no problems getting coverage (and my number) when I returned back home 2 weeks later.

Liu", "ReviewID": "R2LV9XLUKG4BAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I find this phone quite decent. Doesn't have bells and whistles as a more detailed review pointed out, but it can make and receive calls. For people who don't use their phones much, this is just fine.I actually liked its light weightness; it's so easy to carry it in your pocket. It does feel a little flimsy but it works Ok so far (after 1 mo. of light use). The other thing I like about it is its battery life. I only charge it every 3-5 days (I usually turn it off during night).  There seems to be a divergence of rating. The low ratings are most due to bad customer service. I've never read a good review about their customer service (so is TracFone, which is the same company). I've been avoiding calling them and so far I'm able to. I didn't even bother to transfer my old phone number to my Net10 'cause I know it involves talking to them. Just get a new number, if you don't mind. Activation with a new number worked flawlessly for me. The phone activated within 5 min.  The bottom line is this: if you don't make a lot of calls you'll save a lot of money. Previously I was on AT&T;'s lowest monthly plan (500 any time minutes) for ~$40/mo. Now I'm averaging $15/mo ~ 150 min/mo, which is the amount of cell phone calls I make (I don't text either which seems hard with those little keys). Do the math and see if it fits your calling habit. One way to rationalize is this: you're paying the big players big bucks partly because they have a better customer service (the last AT&T; rep I called to cancel my plan spoke perfect English and was based in Ohio, but she's probably making a lot more money than her counterpart at Net10).
