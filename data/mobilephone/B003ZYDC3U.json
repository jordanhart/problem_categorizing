I've had it for about 2 weeks and I can tell you is WONDERFUL. The screen is not hard to look at, is not too small, the screen resolution is very good so all that crap you hear is untrue but of course if you compare it to an EVO or an iPhone display obviously it will fall short. I have all sorts of apps installed on it and they work like a charm i send emails, sms, pictures quite fast, the processor runs like a charm I use app killer because i'm a dork but is not necessary. Battery life was a huge concern i was affraid when i bought it and again proved to be a myth i just lowered the backlight brightness and i easily make it thru the day and back home and still have 15-25% juice.The Only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 HUGE improvement opportunities:#1 the camera is quite crappy... it will take your occasional pic or video but the resolution is quite crappy even though it even does panorama mode. As easy as adding autofocus feature and flash would make it a MUCH MUCH better phone and no frontal cam.#2 It may/may not randomly lose reception in places where other phones have no problems like inside houses or office buildings but i went with it to the beach and no issue but it definitely falls on the category of low end antennas so don't expect it to work in areas where a nokia has hard time finding reception if you know what i mean.hope this is helpful!", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "E&A", "ReviewID": "R13QEPPYSOVXC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using an iPhone for years and recently decided to switch to Android.

This is the smallest smartphone I have ever bought, and this is a great advantage for the device. Unlike other phones where the keyboard is always visible, it is actually hidden under the screen and easily \"flips\" out to make the phone full sized. Because of the hideaway keyboard, the phone easily fits into any of my Jeans and pants' pockets, and I have even sat on this thing several times and it just shifts slightly over to the side or whatever. Very cool.Even though this is a small phone, do not be fooled, this is still android we are talking about here, and you get all the advantages that it brings with it, such as apps, music, a great interface, and seamless wifi & 3g internet browsing.THE AVERAGE:Call quality is ok, nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. Sometimes you get a bit of muffled sound.Battery life is just ok as well. You can get an entire days use, but after that, it's charge or die. I recommend putting the screen brightness on the lowest all the time as well. Contrary to some reviews, the screen resolution is not a problem. Yes, it isn't HD, but it doesn't need to be. You can see what you want to see, and youtube videos look nice when you need them. Playing games is also possible, but a bit more challenging, considering how small the screen is. On the other hand, it is a cool novelty to see angry birds and temple run play out on this small thing, although I wouldn't recommend it to anybody looking to seriously game for hours on end with precision. The phones processing power isn't very good, but you can't tell all that often. Only a couple times has the phone stuttered on me, and that was when I had a lot of stuff going on in the background. One last thing that I forgot to mention is that this thing has an FM radio in it! This is very handy for me as I do not have a data plan, so I can listen to the radio whenever regardless.THE UGLY:Motoblur is a piece of crap. It's not that I am some nut who is paranoid about giving them my facebook info (which you totally do not have to do), but I associate the Motoblur OS with glitchiness. When I played around with a friend's Droid 2, it would constantly act like the thing had a mind of it's own by turning on music, starting the internet browser, and generally doing things without telling you. With the Flipout, this problem is generally gone, except that sometimes when you \"flip\" the phone out, it actually completely shuts off. It is rare, but it does it enough to be a really, really annoying problem, expecially when you flip your phone out to take a call. One last issue I have is that since this is a ridiculously old version of android, you cant put apps on an microSD card, meaning you are left with only about 100 MB of onboard space to put and run apps off of. Any SD card you put into this card would mainly be for music, photos, and videos.SUMMATION:Overall, this is a phone designed for portability. Personally, I use it all the time when I am on my University's campus to check the internet, my email, social network sites, and more. When I run, I plug my earbuds in and tuck it in my pack. I have a 16 gig sd card, so I never run out of stuff to listen to. This is also a phone that the AT&T; network doesn't recognize as a smartphone, so you can turn data for your line off if you want to, and use solely WiFi for your internet needs, since WiFi is pretty much everywhere.Yes, this phone has flaws. The only ones I would really concern myself with though is the whole shutting off thing, and the 100 mb limit thing, but the shutting off issue only happens enough to be occasionally annoying, and the limit doesn't hurt all that much, as I have all the important apps I want. Despite these flaws, the phone is just fantastic.NOTE: a comment that has since been left by another user says that AT&T; recognizes these as smart phones.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice unlocked SMALL phone", "Author": "WestieFan \"WF\"", "ReviewID": "R2BIAE89B52SI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Make no mistake, this is a SMALL cell phone with a small touch screen.  However, for its size and the price of $99, it is very nice.I bought this unlocked GSM phone to use with a Jamaican SIM card.  I inserted the SIM card, powered it up and the phone started the MOTOBLUR registration procedure.  It is NOT necessary to register with MOTOBLUR to use this phone to browse the web or send email on a wireless network.  When the MOTOBLUR registration process starts, select \"Skip for now\".  Go into the Settings menu and turn on Wi-Fi, browse for your network and enter any security settings.  I know it works, I have done it.  I have also checked with my SIM card provider and I have NOT used any data.  Another way to confirm that no data has been used is to go into Settings, then Data Manager and you can see the amount of data that has been sent over the cellular network.  Because I was using my wireless network mine still says \"0\".Using my wireless network, I was able to set up my Google account and register the phone, download my contacts and download applications.Yes, the touch screen is small and crowded, but it has enough space to be useful.  Remember that the \"home\" screen can scrolled to the left and to the right to view icons for additional applications.The \"flip out\" keyboard is OK, but I find the virtual keyboard on the touch screen to be about as easy to use as the virtual keyboard on my iPhone 4S when the phone is in the vertical orientation.  (Yes, I did compare it to an iPhone.)  They are both cramped, but with some practice they are useable.The phone I received is running Android version 2.1.  Not the latest, but still useable.  I only paid $99 for it and for unlocked GSM cell phone running Android 2.1 of any physical size it is a bargain.  Just understand that you are buying a small phone.

And it was a gamble that has thus far paid off. I have only had the phone for about a week, however, it is NOT my first android phone, nor my first motoblur. Alot of what I was coming across in the reviews is complaints about the battery dying, or the phone itself going slow. In my experience, not paying attention to the amount of applications, for example, can and will cause those problems. My sd card was previously used on another android phone, and it took some playing around with, altering, and deleting of old things I no longer used, or required. The phone works great! I love it because of its size, the screen size doesn't make the pictures grainy or blurry, I can see everything crystal clear. The volume controls work great, I am a lover of music, so I downloaded an app for my music to enhance it, as I do on all my phones, and the speakers work great. I usually end up draining my battery pretty quick because I am constantly on it, playing with it. I'm addicted to this little phone. I am pleased that it came with 3 different color change plates, may not strike on most people's radars, however I enjoy the small things lol. I don't like to carry a purse, or a bag around with me all day, so everything of mine goes into my pockets, and the big selling point for my purchasing this phone was its size. It fits perfectly into my pockets. The ONLY thing I do not like about this phone, and perhaps its something I overlooked upon purchasing, is that it seems to have been made for users in South America. I am a citizen of the United States, and for the most part, everything was easily switched to English, I just can't do anything with the NewsFeed app because it will only pick up things around South America. If it were set up for, say, Europe, wouldn't be a big deal because I can read english, and I wouldn't mind reading about what was going on in other areas around the world. I just can't read, or speak Spanish! LOL. In any case, this phone is great, I love it.

A few things on unboxing - mine came with only the black cover, not the red, and was not unlocked. It was in an AT&T; product box. I called AT&T; customer service and gave them the IMEI code on the back of the phone, and got the unlock code for free. It worked with my Tmobile sim card after that. (I'm in Texas, USA and have Tmobile no contract SIM card.) There is a lot of AT&T; specific apps on the phone that need to be removed.The instructions included were not for the flip out phone, they were for a generic AT&T; motorola phone.I had to sign up for a motoblur account, which I didn't like and don't know what it is. But after signing up, it was no problem to use the phone. I'll find out what it is and update. I suspect it's a sad attempt by Motorola to make a new friend of a customer that just wants a phone.It came with a charger and mini-usb to USB cord. It did not come with headphones. The phone did not look used, but the battery did look used -- had some scratches on the back of the battery.====(later in day)I have decided to return this product to the seller, and tell amazon that the seller technical details are not correct (I sent the seller an image of the page). I really did not want a phone that was so geared towards AT&T; -- i.e. all of the AT&T; features are not usable for me. It does make calls and the touch screen is responsive and keypad works etc. But the fact that it was AT&T; locked and set-up is really not mentioned in the details. I would rather buy from Best Buy -- they have an unlocked motorola flip out and the price is very similar ($119) and would come with 1 year warranty.====(a few extra comments)amazon was amazingly fast on the return. I information for a return in the evening, and the following day they had sent a UPS driver to pick it up. I not home -- I didn't expect it would be so fast. The driver came back the following day and the phone is returned now.The company did respond to my inquiry, I had asked about getting the red back cover before I had decided to return it. I have let them know I am returned it due to the AT&T; features I can't use.A few phone features -- there is an onscreen qwerty keypad as well, that is very responsive and easy to use. There was an expiration date on a video message I was sent -- I didn't like that, I think it may have to do with motoblur account and how MMS messages are stored/sent. Just wanted to note that \"feature\" -- it would be a deal breaker for me if I hadn't already sent it back, I don't want videos and pictures expiring at any time!", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you", "Author": "Carol R.

Its small, compact, and the keyboard works well.(Thats about it for the pros)Cons-Battery as they said is horrible (lasts 4-5 hrs with minimal use)-Touch screen seemed like it work well at first however within a day it began to become delayed (few seconds before response)-Some applications would \"open\" to a black screen and just stay that way-As for the camera there's not much to say other then its a 3.1 megapixel camera. It takes mediocre picture at best and when testing out an application that is used by scanning barcodes the camera wouldn't even work for itIn the end Im in the process of returning it. Its a cool phone design but the phones delay time along with its poor battery is too much of an annoyance so I would suggest you save your time and money and don't bother with it.P.S.

So far not good!! I had to get a Spanish speaking person the change my language setting for me, just so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of returning it, waiting for my refund, than having to purchase from a different seller(a real big pain in the ass). The phone was purchased unlocked so I could use it in another country, so I won't know of any other issues until I get to that country and insert a sim card from there. So to be honest I don't know what to expect because so far my experience with this seller could have been a whole lot better. I did get in contact with the seller by email, since they don't have a contact number (quite fishy) and they sent me a link to an English user manual on-line, and I was told that they would send me a memory card. I'm waiting to see how long it will take to receive that...hopefully before I have to leave the country. What I do like though, is that the phone comes with 3 back covers in different colors, and 2 outlet adapters for international travel.

The phone that I received was Motorola Flipout (MB511) branded by Orange (European service provider) WCDMA 900/2100 (\"3G\" bands) GSM 850/900/1800/1900 (\"voice service\" bands) HSDPA.AT&T; uses WCDMA 850/1900, and T-Mobile uses WCDMA 1700, so neither of these can be detected by the phone that I got. Hence, the phone works just fine with voice service (although I couldn't really get EDGE to work, but I didn't care much about that anyway), but it did NOT get 3G service.Different sellers may ship different phones, so don't be completely discouraged, but I would avoid \"The OEM Shop\". It seems like others have had great experience with their purchases.Unlike some phones, you cannot access the service menu on this phone by typing *#*#197328640#*#*, which in some cases allows you to activate additional bands.I found one possible solution, which involves flashing the phone and may or may not work.

Second, Skype does not work with it, i.e you can hear the other side but they cannot hear you. Another lame issue is that whenever you touch the phone(accidentally) it starts either dialing or doing something weird. It does not have lock like iphone to unlock it.

I was iffy at first about web browsing on such a small screen but it actually is very easy to read for me. I was also concerned about how small the qwerty keyboard is but again it is spaced just fine and i don't hit the wrong buttons very often.It's not very durable though. I'm the type of person that has accidental drops and spills quite frequently and most phones I've had before this one could handle food or drink spills and just being dropped in general. This one gave out on me the first time it happened. (Dropped it in a bowl of macaroni and cheese.) The phone itself worked but the charging port just wouldn't charge.
