For every 5 calls that come in, it shuts down or displays enter SIM card.

This tiny little phone has extremely large number of features, such as camera, ring tones, calendar, Bluetooth, mini USB, memory card placeholder, and lot more exciting goodies. Creating a ring tone from my composed MIDI file was easy, just copied the file into the phone, and that's all. I bought this cell phone with a headset and data cable. With USB cable I can connect the phone directly to my computer running Windows operating system. Synchronizing music with Windows Media Player is a click! The Media Player recognizes the phone right away when it is connected. You can also use Bluetooth connection to connect the phone to the computer or other peripheral. The computer software that comes with the data cable is outstanding. I can now write short messages using my keyboard, and more! V360 really is worth buying. It's small, lightweight and has huge number of features!", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New\nNo Sales Tax\n3 Month Warranty", "Name": "Motorola V360 UNLOCKED GSM Triband Bluetooth Camera Cell Phone - Grey", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11ZlTHWIMDL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00164ZD9M"}}
