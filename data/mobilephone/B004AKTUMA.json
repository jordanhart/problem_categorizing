I was used to have a keyboard so the touch screen was a be problem for me.  Also I would touch the screen by accident will holding it and a function would be issued usually changing my default configurations.After about 50 days using my phone I noticed that I was loosing calls because my GSM network would simple disconnect.  Since I still use other phones (with other lines that I have) I noticed that they were working perfect with GSM network.  I then did a SIM swap to check, and Bingo!  Hardware bug!  After searching google, I found out that other owners also had encountered the same problem.  I will try to return it.NOKIA now has lower quality making me very sad with the brand that I used, with no issues, for so many years.Also the lack of macro for the camera is a big issue if you like take photos of business cards and magazine pages.  This is very bad for me, specially at work.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia 4 Lyfe", "Author": "r3dd219", "ReviewID": "R11ZZ8C53BKN5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No matter what happens, I can always count on a Nokia phone to do the job, and that job, and that job too... I needed a real phone with multiple options. This phone runs off the TMobile network and comes with built-in MP3 player/Radio with the option to expand the memory up to 32gig with an sd memory card, 7megapixel flash camera/video camcorder, app friendly, wifi connection, and the ability to connect to a bluetooth. My old phone (Samsung T258G: StraightTalk) would cut off at various times but not this phone... I love how when you touch it, it vibrates slightly letting you know that a selection has been made. This item was ordered with an average shipping speed but still came within 3 days of ordering it. The price was affordable for a phone of this calibur. I love my new Nokia... I know its not the most up-to-date phone, but it suites my daily needs just fine... I'd recommend this phone to anyone (well, I recommend Nokia period). The only phone where I can perform any other function (text/pix, camera/video, even access my internet) while I'm talking on it to someone :-)", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sent me a T Mobile phone", "Author": "Oscar", "ReviewID": "R3D08C14HN1HP1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered a used Nokia C-7 from Amazon Warehouse...condition 'LIKE NEW\" The phone arrives in a plain white box...no Nokia box.
