Lyon \"Qship\"", "ReviewID": "R3W0QZG6VRZH35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone connected for a short while.  I took it to three T-Mobile stores, one of which told me the phone was refurbished, although it came in what seemed to be factory packaging.  They were unable to make the phone connect.  I sent the phone back to Samsung, they told me the phone was fully operational, but they could not connect to T-Mobile, either.I called T-Mobile for the third time, and they told me that the phone was blocked because I was not the owner, and that the phone initially worked because there was a time lag in their blocking system.  It appears the phone is either stolen, or the previous owner leased it and is not making payments.Besides the paying for phone service for the last two months, and having a non-working phone, I also lost my apps and data.  I have several hundred dollars in a pre-paid account the phone will not connect to, which is disappearing at the rate of $50 a month, so I hope this can be resolved quickly.UPDATEAmazon has been very helpful, and has treated me fairly.  My phone is now working.Unitek told me T-Mobile was blocking the phone because I didn't buy it from them.  T-Mobile says the phone was blocked because it's stolen.  Samsung says the phone is in perfect order.I sent the phone back to Unitek, and they returned it wiped, but working.  The IMEI number on the phone's paper label, and the IMEI label on box the phone came in, are different.  When the phone came back from Unitek, the IMEI number had been changed internally and did not match either of the other two numbers.Changing IMEI numbers on stolen phones is so common that there is proposed legislation, the \"Mobile Device Theft Deterrence Act of 2013\" that will, if passed, make reprogramming a phone's IMEI a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.More detail.  Many Android phones are identified by an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.  When a phone is stolen, a carrier blocks the phone using the IMEI.  This can take several months to happen.  So, even though you receive a working phone that appears to be new, that doesn't mean it will continue to work.There is a database of stolen phones, the Central Equipment Identity Register.  If a device is blacklisted in that database, it won't connect to any network.  Consumers do not have access to the database.You may find a phone's original IMEI under the battery.  The actual number can often be found in the phone's setup menu.  Sometimes dialing *#06# will produce it.  If it works, the IMEI will appear when you enter the last #.If you have a similar problem, this may help.  T-Mobile's telephone support will not help you unless you can supply your account PIN (Personal Identification Number), which you may not have readily available.  It was a problem for me because we were spending most of the winter in Florida to be with my wife's ailing mother.  T-Mobile staff at their stores will initially refuse to help without your PIN, but if you present sufficient identification, they should give you the number.  Sales staff may be unaware they can do that, but when I asked them to check policy, gave me my PIN.Store personnel will call phone support.  T-Mobile's phone support varies widely with respect to training and English fluency, but the store can more easily access a higher tier.  For reasons I don't understand, T-Mobil's phone support cannot reliably tell you if your phone has been blocked, but I got that information on the fifth call to them, not including visiting three T-Mobile brick and mortar stores.Store staff will swap your SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, which will lose anything stored on your old SIM card, but the phone will remain blocked .  Before you let that happen, back up your information.  With your permission, they will reset your phone to its original state, which loses everything stored on the phone. It does not unblock the phone.Samsung supplies a program, Kies. It will backup some of the information on your Samsung Android phone.  It can also be used to update the Android operating system.  I strongly suggest you use Kies before you take your Samsung phone to a T-Mobile store.When I add up the cost of the phone, T-Mobile service I couldn't use because the phone wouldn't connect, shipping the phone to Samsung and Unitek, and the apps on it, the phone has cost $630.33 to date.  I have no confidence the phone is legal, or will continue to work with the new IMEI.According to an Internet advertisement, T-Mobile will sell me the same phone, no contract, for $463.99, and give me $50 worth of free time, which is $413.99 for the phone.  Unitek was a bad mistake, but I learned from it.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever", "Author": "Errol", "ReviewID": "R3MA4M3F25B9EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been through quite a few phones and this is my best so far, my second Android to be exact, probably my millionth phone though, lulz, first phone I've had with no freezes, ever. The dual core processor at 1.5ghz is marvelous, might not be the same chipset as the original s2, but the extra processing speed makes up for it without a doubt, the gpu might not be as great as the mali 400 but I can't lie, I've not been disappointed by any of the games and videos I've thrown at it so far, full 1080p videos, looking crisp as ever. Alongside the 42mbps down speed, you don't actually get that, max speed I've gotten so far on speed test is about 15mbps, but serious, would you notice the difference with pages loading faster than any other phone you own and downloads finishing so quickly you need to check if your wifi is on or something? Call quality is also marvelous, no dropped calls for the 4 months I've had mine and I'm still on the stock rom that comes with it, I've actually had no need to root this device, probably the best stock rom I've ever come across or is it the processor that's so fast it's making it look good on samsung's behalf and t-mobile's? Who knows, the screen size was my main attraction knowing I've had issues with even 4inch screens, reason being why I was never fascinated by the iphone, though it is a decent device, but my thumbs are a little big, the screen makes typing so much easier and simpler. And customization wise? Well thanks to Android, I don't need to root to do that, just download whatever customizations I want right off of the play store, anything more complicated that requires root is pretty simple on the device to do too, root is just a click a way, thanks to xda devs for that. So that's about it for my review, getting a little too much on the lengthy side, though I have a lot more I could say, lol. This will most likely be the only phone I'll stay on for more than 6months, since it pretty much satisfies the geek in me, well until something just as solid in the next generation of handsets comes along and well, that depends on if I ever get tired of this phone as well, which doesn't seem to be anywhere close.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well Crafted and Very Fast", "Author": "James Cothern", "ReviewID": "R3S0I1ZHU29S8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second smart phone and first Galaxy. I came off an HTC Incredible with Verizon so let me list the positives and negatives.Positives:1) Came with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, a marvelous upgrade and a quad core processor which produces very fast uploads and downloads2) Allows me to run Google Chrome, a very fast and versatile browser3) Unlocked and open version, allowing me to insert differing GSM Sim cards if I go to another country4) Booted up with a Koodo (a Cabadian provider) label. I feared it night be locked, but upon inserting a T-Mobile SIM, immediately reognized it. Went to Settings>More>Mobile Networks>Network Operators and selected T-Mobile, the provider I am using, also showed ATT was available if I decide to change5) Very fast, be warned that if you are using T-Mobile it will not show 4G, instead H+, lots of arguments about true 4G6) Allows acceptance of up to a 32GB micro SDHC, an advantage I think over the Samsung Galaxy SIII7) Good battery life, I was surprised that I could surf and e-mail on wifi for 12 hours without recharging and still had about 40 percent left8) Crisp and bright screen, easily readable even with reduced brightness9) Dual screen e-mailer, allowing a view of e-mails without opening10)Frees me from Verizon's continual contract negations upon upgrading and from a contract period when I enrolled with T-Mobile. Verizon is good, but too expensive for my blood. We'll see how I get along with T-Mobile since 95 percent of my use is in my home11) Easily rootable, allowing complete backups, tethering and other niceties12) Seller's description and service were spot on. Phone was new and in original packagingNegatives1) This is a GSM phone and GSM is noted for poor reception inside buildings2) Both T-Mobile and ATT do not have the coverage that Verizon does, so you are paying a price if you expect to use it inside a concrete structure or in a low reception area3) On/Off button is poorly placed on upper right hand side, resulting in inadvertent ons and offs4) The sleek design is also slick, and phone is easily dropped because it is thin and hard to grasp. Correct by encasing in a silicone case5) The back cover is a very thin plastic, also corrected by a case6) I live in a dead spot area, will correct by the addition of a Wilson Electronics-DT-Cell Phone Signal Booster for Small Home or Office. I'll review it separately when installedOverall ImpressionJust a marvelous phone, regardless of the provider", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastik PHONE", "Author": "Joseph M.
