Like a dummy i goes and ship first class. Well now i know never ship anything oversea without getting insurance and top price shipping cause once it leave the states you can no longer track it, And you will run into liars like these people who will claim they never got it. Thanks to Amazon trusting me im grateful for that i was refunded all but the 18.00 bucks shipping cost which i will take a lost on. But these people keep emailing me telling me how many sells they made off this phone but notice no reviews. and if anyone bought this phone you best check the inside of it im willing to bet its another phone other than what is advertised, These people selling a phone that really cost 125.00 for over 200 bucks and the quality of the phone low resolution, small space and a number of other things.********************************************************************Order this phone feb 12, 2014 phone came on feb 27,14. The delivery date will say about 25 days but it actually comes within 10 business days. The reason for 0-1 star is because this phone cost me 245.00 and was not a U9000 it was a N9002 and the resolution was 590x920, The seller tried to convenience me that everything was as order, but it was clearly not. I ended up requested full refund (pending) and ordering  a new phone which came within 2 days and came as U9000 with 1280/720 pixels. I received the new phone the same day i was due to leave out of town which was great 3/4/14. I'm sure once they recieve the return phone i will get my shipping return cost plus the phone cost. This phone that 365 store sent me was not even worth 245.00 star N9002 590x920 pixels i did a search and it is worth 135.00-160.00. I notice since i been gone out of town that the price has change to 199.00 But the advertisement is incorrect. would i recommend: NO", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FZYD5SU"}}
