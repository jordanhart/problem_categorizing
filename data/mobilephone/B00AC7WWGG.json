I cannot use my debit card with them so my only two options are: buying it at an electronics store or online in another website.The fist option is virtually impossible since stores such as Bestbuy, Target, Radio Shack, etc. only have Virgin Mobile phones under $400, which are the older LG and Samsung models. However, I was lucky to find it here on Amazon.My main concern was wether or not it was going to work with my carrier because Virgin Mobile phones do not work with all the unlocked cellphones. But it arrived within the expected time frame, new, in it's original Apple box, and with the headphones and cords.It took me less than an hour to change my data plan, activate the phone on-line, and get the phone up and running.It is 30-50 dollars more expensive than on the Virgin Mobile website, but this was the only way I could get this phone and it was worth every penny.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "crystal", "ReviewID": "R1FVJP8LXMZW77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wanted an iphone without the contract and i always had virgin mobile before so i was excited to know that they have iphones and i love it", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase Experience", "Author": "Nina", "ReviewID": "R22LDZA2F0UTBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The experience was a Great one!
