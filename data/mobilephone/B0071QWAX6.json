I can go 16 to 17 hours and still have 70% battery left. Where this really helps is i can just leave bluetooth on all day, and wifi on all day and leave the gps on all day, which all make the phone more productivity, especially if you take the time to configure smartactions, to turn off your ringer when you reach a certain location or to switch off your mobile data and just use wifi when you reach a certain location, or switch to VIP calling at a certain time and a certain place. It is thicker than the original droid razr but still just as thin if not thinner than most other smartphones on the market today. Only drawback is the screen resolution is not hd, and the camera could be faster with the shutter.Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX 4G Android Phone, Black 32GB  (Verizon Wireless)", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!!!", "Author": "Thinker \"Simplify\"", "ReviewID": "R2OWMIIWU1VLIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was exactly what I expected and more.
