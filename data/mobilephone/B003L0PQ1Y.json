{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Tracy M.", "ReviewID": "RXIPNCXUAUI3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think that this phone was great because of the price along with the features. It was under my $150 price limit and had many things that I could do on it such as edit my pictures with many features involved such as cartoon, and warp it in very different ways. I really liked the camera as well as the touch screen because it was very sensitive and there was no difficulty at all. My finger glided on the surface and the phone reacted with great response.Pros: Many features such as Wifi, GPS, camera, Google, Social media on the menu, and many apps.Cons: The only thing that I didn't really like when I bought this phone was that there was no Qwerty keypad which made my texting a little more difficult, but I could manage.Overall, it was a great phone!", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone 'I love it'", "Author": "fastjanow", "ReviewID": "R3VOCKZ9MJBX6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone today I'm so glad I went ahead and ordered it.

This one is clearly better and is good for beginners.
