Also this phone does not have a micro sd memory slot even though the description says it does. Also sync this phone to a PC is challenging, you need to install the software several times to get it to work. If you just want to use it as a phone it is a great phone but all the extras don't work unless you buy a Verizon phone.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "No problems, love it", "Author": "Michael L Vetsch \"Dragonvet\"", "ReviewID": "R113OTA3E227V2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have Tmobile and I bought the unlocked phone and just traded sim cards from my old phone.  I did lose some of my newer contacts and some archived text messages, but other that that everything has been fine.  Synching to my PC was flawless.  Could be a bit tough for a novice but transfering MP3's is easy.  The keys are VERY touchy, that took getting used to.  There are a lot of things I'm annoyed about but I chalk it up to not being used to the phone yet.  So far it has worked well and I'm happy.  It takes some patience to figure out, but it's a great phone IMO.  My main concern is it's size, I bought a case for it because I'm afraid at the price I'll damage it.  I paid $170 on ebay.So I've been using this phone for a while now.  I still like it. I keep it in my pocket while at work, use it as an alarm clock etc.  The quality of the pictures it takes isn't as good as it could be, especially indoors.  Outdoor shots are much sharper quality with the natural light.  The MP3 player works well but for the price of the phone I'm feeling like it should have more memory.  In any case, I still rate it high after all this time.  I haven't had problems.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disappointing transaction", "Author": "Brenda C.

However, it would not work on my wireless network (not at all clear from the description), so I had to return it. I was promised credit minus a 10% restocking fee IF AND ONLY IF I wrote a review favorable to the seller, which I did. To date (February 8, 2008) my card has not been credited. I have never had a bad transaction through Amazon until this one, but I would not recommend that anyone do business with this ethically challenged seller.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Muhammad Din", "ReviewID": "R93B9VGNCMLUW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased LG KG800 Chocolate.

My wife hasCingular (RAZR) and I was going to get that phone as well, but thensaw this one available at the Cingular store and figured I would get it for the looks, andCingular said they support the phone so I thought all would be good.After using it for 3 months, I lose service in A LOT of areas aroundhere, and my wife's phone works fine. I guess it is b/c of all this1900, 850, 900 band issues. If I knew aboutthis problem before purchasing the phone with a 2 year contract, Iwould definitely have gotten a different model instead. Also, I justwent on a trip up to northern Vermont, and my wife's phone neverdropped a call or lost service (Cingular), and I had no service for the wholetrip (Cingular), which was very frustrating trying to do business from the road.I was thinking of getting the battery signal increaser metal strip,but after reading more about the phone, I do not think they will help any?? Ifanyone has any suggestions for me to get a better signal, I wouldappreciate it, as I have paid a lot for this phone that loses a lotof calls daily.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "mEXICO MANUAL AND CHEAP QUALITY", "Author": "Jimmy K.

I liked the sleek design, the color and I was very attracted to the touchscreen.  The phone works quite well, talk time is good and standby time is great.  I had no problems with syncing it to my computer.  The bluetooth works well too.  The phone can take some good banging as this has dropped from me several times with the battery flying out, and it still works fine.  The one and only con I would give it (which is a major one) is that there is no other option for navigating around the menu in the phone except for the touchscreen.  Some other phones have a touchscreen, but still have buttons that you can press to get in the menu and work the phone.  This one only has the touchscreen, so if that screen goes bad...you can forget even having a phone because you won't be able to make a call, send a text, play a game, change your phone settings....nothing that you can usually do while navigating around in the menu.  This is the problem that I am having right now.  I sadly dropped the phone in a puddle of water a while back.  The phone still works fine, functional-wise, but the touchscreen has freezed and no longer works, so I can't do anything with the phone.  This is the major problem as I think that they should have also put in some buttons so that you can still get in your menu.  Now, I have to look for another phone to buy.  I like LG products so I will stick with this brand, I will just make sure to buy a phone with menu, select and navigation buttons.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "but it works fine in spain", "Author": "dax \"daxus\"", "ReviewID": "R131WF9CH661OB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "many bubbles in casing...phone keeps demanding i install a sim card that was not received...best of all, the charger is european, not american...co. rep has offered to work with these \"issues\" but i do not expect them to repay the time and $30.00 it cost to replace the charger, and i do not have the time to waste trading the phone for one that is not marred.", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "The battery last only one day", "Author": "N.
