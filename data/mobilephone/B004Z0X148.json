{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little phone", "Author": "John E. Heyer", "ReviewID": "R2P8EELNYLKMBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for $20 at Walgreen's after my iPhone suddenly decided not to charge.  Activation with NET10 took just 5 minutes and the number worked almost immediately, allowing me to forward calls from my iPhone to this phone for a few days until I got the battery replaced.The phone is small and obviously as low-cost as they come, but doesn't feel 'cheap'.  It also has nice features like a camera and bluetooth, plus the game tetris!  Battery life is great and it can go several days in standby mode or months being turned off.NET10's coverage in the Bay Area and Tahoe was much better than I expected.  I got more bars than T-Mobile and even more than AT&T; in some spots.  One disappointing thing about NET10's prepaid plans is the minutes are only good for 30 days.  T-Mobile minutes are always good for 90 days, so I still like T-Mobile if you only want a cell phone for emergencies. NET10's service does come with a downside though - they 'lock' their SIMs to only work in their phones.  So, if you're thinking you can just pop the SIM out and use it in an unlocked phone, it won't work.All in all, if you want a cheap phone plan and want a small, basic phone, this is a great option.  Worst case scenario you're out $15.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola  W408 Pre-paid Cell", "Author": "Jane Austin", "ReviewID": "R3JDQT5AQ4IKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone for husband. He doesn't like anything with small buttons, and has a low frustation level. He likes the camera. He mostly a talker doesn't text much. Was able to port old phone number quickly. It works well for what he needs it  for. Voice mail was quick and easy to set up. The sound is better on this compared to old phone.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Missing a serious attribute", "Author": "bigronil", "ReviewID": "RSRR7AZFGWERI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone thru Net10 along with a Samsung phone for the wife.One serious feature missing on this phone is to delete all incoming and outgoing calls with a single delete button. On this phone all calls have to be deleted individually, very time consuming.The Samsung has a delete button to clear the memory on all calls.I am currently looking for a new phone. I have googled this phone and other users have the same problem and their is nothing in the manual about this problem or a remedy.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a piece of crap", "Author": "Haywood Jablowme", "ReviewID": "RKFLV4X6G4AKN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The only complaint I had about the Motorola408 is that the battery cover and battery regularly ejected from the phone while in my pocket.  Not just the jeans pocket - also while in a button-up shirt pocket.  It simply fell apart with the greatest of ease.Otherwise, the phone is no more stripped of handy features than any other Net10 phone.  I never had a signal problem until after I smashed it on the concrete when I was fed-up with it after the 1000th time I missed an important call because it fell apart.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just right", "Author": "L.

However, the SIM card came with the phone was invalid so I had to call the (Net10) customer service and spent at least 20 minutes on the phone to confirm my shipping information for them to send me a new card. Since today is Friday, the representative says I won't receive it until next Thursday. So, keep in mind that this item may not be ready-to-go right away.The phone itself is quite decent. At least the keys are easy to use and the setting is flexible so I can avoid mis-pressing the \"Browser.\"Can't make comments regarding the call quality yet, but hopefully, it would be as decent as the phone.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "this is great my son loves it.", "Author": "Jakeb28", "ReviewID": "R1052MVFWJIO8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I baught this for my son and he loves it he really likes the features of it such as the fm radio and the camera and mp3 player.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trash", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "R30SRB9S7PC4ZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not like it at all.It was a big piece of junk.it is made cheap and flimsy.I will never buy that phone again.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hate it", "Author": "wood0921", "ReviewID": "R2FSOP7GMWAAM8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Didnt like the phone it just wasnt what i thought it was otherwise id spent more money and got a higher priced phone.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004Z0X148"}}
