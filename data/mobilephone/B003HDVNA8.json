{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Replacing my C810 with another C810", "Author": "Joan W. Johnson \"average reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2XGX6ODKICT31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned my original Pantech Duo C810 for about a year before dropping it in water and having it (rightfully) stop working. When looking at new phones to purchase, I was heartbroken not to find any with the double-slide keyboards that the Duo has - one number keypad for dialing and one letter keypad for texting and email. The Duo runs on Windows 6.1, which I find so user friendly and easy to understand. The Internet speed is acceptable for me, since I use my computer more than my phone for surfing the web. I just could not find another phone I wanted that equalled how much I missed my Pantech DUO, so I made the decision to order another exactly like my original -- and I'm glad I did. The phone arrived very quickly, it took just one phone call to my phone company to turn it on, and I'm once again a happy Pantech Duo C810 owner. I like everything about it simply because it's a good, basic, easy to use, user friendly phone. If you want fancy, fast, touch screen the Duo isn't for you. If you want simple, basic, and easy to use, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Windows Mobile phone.", "Author": "QWERTY514", "ReviewID": "R1PEQZHES6YTCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive been looking all over for a reasonably priced windows mobile phone.

It shines in text/multi-media abilities . It can be very difficult to obtain and enter the specific \"proxy\" info (sometimes required to establish connection with your service providers MMS servers ) , and can require a call to your service providers tech support guys to muddle through it with you ( good luck ! )Although my T-Mobile rep was incredibly helpful , knowledgeable , and patient , fowarding me an e-mail of the required settings for future reference . This handset was actually purchased as a back-up for the  C810 I regularly use . Why ? Because as three and four G phones become  \"required\" technology , really good QWERTY / messaging phones are growing scarce . So when my wifes Motorola Rival's keyboard excused itself from the rest of the phone , ripping the ribbon cable in half as it did so , I kinda thought it would be nice to have a direct replacement standby at the ready for my phone .", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't Mess with Success", "Author": "J. Osterman", "ReviewID": "R3J9VDD8O17LJ3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my second Pantech dual slider phone and all this thing did was make me long for the old model.On the plus side the unit is lighter and slimmer.On the minus side it had a loose feeling, as though all the connections were not quite tight. That slight rattle was far from what I've come to expect from slider and flip phones that move smoothly and crisply.Second, the slide-out QWERTY keyboard feels almost flat. The keys are raised just a bit so, for me, it felt like I was typing on a flat surface. I prefer a little more substance on my phones.Finally, the phone is not intuitive. It took me about 10 minutes to figure out the camera feature. I'm used to and happier with a more streamlined menu.I think Pantech overthought themselves on this one.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok phone", "Author": "phonekiller", "ReviewID": "R1R3RZXM99KKAP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off this is a ok phone. the pros make up for this phones cons. So the first thing bad about it is the build quality. the phone makes creaking noises in your pocket when you move, the screen is also a little small to look at web pages and photos with, and the included internet browser is slow (download opera mini it is much faster). And then there are the pros. Even though the slider creaks it is durable and can take a beating before breaking, the dual keyboard is also nice and fairly easy to use, and the media player is good at playing media and the speaker does a nice job at playing music to. So now for the part that cell phone are actually made to do... calls, And I am happy to report that the duo makes very good calls, But the terrible camera makes up for that. So I give the duo 3.5 out of five stars", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone was broken and they just ripped me off", "Author": "Chavez", "ReviewID": "R31P5P3R36OG79", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It did not charge at all and I couldn't do anything about it the seller was just a rip off.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hate it!", "Author": "A.

It's a Window's phone, which works about as well as my Windows computer.  It constantly freezes up on me when I'm trying to compose a text message.  It seems to miss every 3rd letter typed, so I have to go back and retype areas of the text message that it missed the first time.

Every guide out there is pretty helpfull, unfortunatly, this phone menu system is different than all other aparently... So no luck there.Second, the phone turns off by itself... A LOT! Specially when connected to the computer USB, wich is unfortunate becaus the adapter supplied if for 110v, and I live in portugal, where we have 220v sockets.Other than those 2 things... It's a nifty little phone for the price asked.EDIT: 3-4 days after receiving the mobile, guess what. no longer charges, not even with the charger (wich I got an adapter for).

I chose this phone particularly because of the dual keypad/keyboard feature. He is one who tends to send more text messages than make phone calls. He has been using this phone for about 3 weeks now and has figured out enough about the phone to create an e-mail account for himself. Great starter \"smartphone\" for those who may be techno-challenged. Since it has Window's Mobile for an operating system, it is also, in a sence, teaching him how to maneuver around a computer that runs Windows as an operating system. Only issue we have encountered is the lack of tech-support from the manufacturer. His is an unlocked version and we needed help configuring internet, and mfr. had no spec sheet in thier own database. Weird. We eventually got everything configured correctly thanks to several on-line blogs.
