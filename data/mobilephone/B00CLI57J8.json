{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for Facebook users!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R382L66U1D53BB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I start my review I just want to say that I'm not a crazy Facebook user and I usually log into my Facebook once a week or so. I rarely ever use Facebook and when I do, I usually just see what's new with my friends/family and then immediately log out. I got this phone for my girlfriend because she (obviously) loves Facebook so I thought it would be cool to buy her a phone that's made for Facebook users in mind. The HTC First is also known as the \"Facebook phone\" and it isn't a high end device by any means and it's geared towards users who love Facebook and aren't tech savvy.  The launcher that's running on top of Android 4.1 is called Facebook Home. You can also disable Facebook Home that comes right out of the box and use the stock android version which is android 4.1 Jelly Bean. This is a cool feature that this phone offers because some people might later decide to use the stock android version if they get bored with Facebook Home.So far from all the testing that I have done, the HTC First has a decent battery life which I wasn't expecting it because it's a mid-range device. It packs a 2000 mAh battery that it's more than enough for people who spent most of their time on Facebook. The screen on the HTC First is 720p which is great for viewing pictures or HD videos. The HTC First is a 4.3 inches device that is perfect for my girlfriend because she has small hands - she's coming from an iPhone 4S. I made her ditch the iPhone 4S and come to Android. :D The HTC First comes with Snapdragon 400 which is a dual core CPU that runs at 1.4Ghz. It has no problems handling everything you throw at it and consumes very little power when it's running; qualcomm really knows how to make great chips.Pros:+Display / Screen:The screen is bigger on the HTC First (4.3 inches) than the iPhone 4S so viewing pictures or watching videos is better on the HTC First. The screen resolution is also much sharper on the HTC First and has more pixel density than the iPhone 4S. The resolution on this phone is 720 x 1280 (342ppi pixel density) which if you compare it to the iPhone 4S is way better.+Android OS:This phone ships with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) which is blazing fast and never lags. If you decide to use the Facebook Home mode then you have quick access to all the Facebook stuff such as the Facebook app, messenger and instagram. You can also access all of your applications if you swipe to the left as soon as you get in the app drawer and you get all of your typical apps that come included in all android devices.+Design:The design is just like any HTC phone you have seen before. It has a nice soft touch when you hold it and has the same feel as an HTC One X which is a good thing. HTC makes really comfortable to hold devices and I like that about HTC. The phone fits really well in hand and my girlfriend loves it.+Camera:The rear camera on this phone is 5MP (2592x1944 pixels) and the front camera is 1.6MP. They both take great pictures and can even shoot 1080p videos at 30fps. I just think it would have been better if HTC put an 8MP camera instead because after all, this device is made for people who take a lot of pictures and share them with their friends/family on Facebook.+Battery:The battery on the HTC First is 2000mAh which is more than enough if all you're going to do is be on Facebook and check the web and whatnot. I tested the battery by being on Facebook and checking the web all day and so far it seems that the phone can last a full day with a single charge so that's great. Qualcomm has done an amazing job with the Snapdragon 400 because you can tell how efficient it is and how little power it consumes. The battery is non-removable if you guys are wondering.+Storage:The HTC First comes with 16GB of storage and can store a ton of pictures and HD videos. My girlfriend likes to take crapload of pictures and videos so the 16GB of storage is more than enough for her.+Processor:The Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (Dual-core 1.4 GHz) does an amazing job at keeping the phone running lag-free. So far I have not experienced a slow down with the HTC First. The Snapdragon 400 also has no problem handling 3D games. The phone comes with 1GB of ram which is plenty for most users.Cons:My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 so I don't want to nitpick on the HTC First because I could come up with a ton of bad things to say but I'm not going to. The only thing that I'm going to say is that the camera could have been an 8MP camera instead. It makes more sense to put an 8MP camera on a Facebook device because people will be taking pictures and uploading them on Facebook for everyone to see. The HTC First has last year's specs and it's a decent phone for people who are on Facebook.Overall, the HTC First is a mid-range device made for Facebook users in mind. It's the perfect phone if you are the type of person who has thousands of friends on Facebook and just love to share everything with your family/friends. The battery life in this phone is pretty decent and will last you a full day if you use it for Facebook and web browsing. The build quality is very well and has a nice soft touch when holding. HTC is known for making great devices, build quality-wise. If you are someone like me that checks Facebook once a week or so then I don't recommend this phone because there are better phones out there. But if you are someone who just loves being on Facebook and staying updated with your friends/family then this device is for you.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "edwin harrington", "ReviewID": "R3CX3NC1K673EJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone ws in beautiful shape and described perfectly by the seller.
