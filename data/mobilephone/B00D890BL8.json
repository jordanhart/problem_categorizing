Christensen", "ReviewID": "R4XYYYRITCHMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, this is going to sound incredibly ironic I know...But I am a U.S. citizen living in South Korea, land of Samsung and LG.  When I wanted to buy a replacement handset for use in South Korea...I ordered a \"made in Korea\" handset from the United States, and had it shipped...back to Korea where it came from!!!  :)Now people reading this are wondering...why the HECK would I do that?  Well the great irony of living in Korea is that most Korean products are more expensive than they are in the United States.  For example, if you want to buy a Hyundai automobile...you can pay $30,000 USD in the United States...or you can buy the same exact model Korean car for the equivalent of about $40,000 USD in Korea.  Go figure...Cell phones are even worse.  Any decent android phone starts around equivalent of USD $800...and goes MUCH more expensive.  I'm not talking about the latest and greatest, either.  Right now, you need to fork out (the equivalent of) about USD $800 to get a Galaxy S2 (brand new, without contract) in South Korea.  To put that in perspective, the Galaxy S4 was just released.  You do NOT want to know how much that costs!!!I knew the level of \"performance\" I was aiming for.  To get a decent android handset in Korea, I would have to spend at least USD $1000 (equivalent) OR fork out several hundred dollars AND sign a two-year contract.  No thank you...So I did extensive research to determine if a factory unlocked phone (say, from Amazon) would work in South Korea.  Based on my extensive research, the answer was NO.  Even some of my friends living in Korea forever told me that it wasn't possible.  But I did it anyway.  :)  On paper at least, many of the factory unlocked handsets sold on Amazon SHOULD work in Korea.  Technically speaking, there is nothing that would prevent them from working on Korean cell phone networks.  I decided to take a chance, as I needed two android phones (one for my wife) and did not feel like spending 2000 USD to buy them.OK, to review the phone...The phone is FANTASTIC!!!  It is the functional equivalent of a Samsung Galaxy SIII, or a Samsung Galaxy \"Grand\" Duo.  The performance is incredible...no lag on anything.  It has a nice camera that takes GOOD digital pictures.  The size is right...small enough to be used one-handed comfortably.  And yet, large enough to do some web surfing on the go.  I get lots of comments on it... it is a very impressive phone with good features and good performance.  :)  The battery life is phenomenal for an android device.  As I'm sure most are aware, any good android device will need to be charged every day, sometimes more than once a day.  I can get two days' use out of the P715 with extensive web surfing.  I've got a 16GB Sandisk ultra-fast Micro-SD memory card installed...will probably never run out of storage space.  This handset performs better than a Samsung Galaxy SIII...and it is cheaper.  I'd say it is a GREAT bargain.For comparison purposes, the other models I considered buying were a Samsung Galaxy SIII Mini, a Samsung Galaxy Grand Duo, Another LG model with slightly larger screen (P768, something like that) and a Google Nexus 4 (made by LG).  I ruled out the Nexus for a couple of reasons.  First, the price was considerably higher.  Based on reviews, I WOULD have been willing to buy the Nexus 4 anyway.  But the Nexus 4 has a battery that can't be replaced by the user.  So that was a deal-breaker, there.  I can't believe Google / LG created such an awesome phone (the nexus 4) with such a glaring weakness!!!  I could not really find anything \"wrong\" with any of the other models I was considering.  I almost went with the slightly larger LG model.  But in the end, the dual sim capability AND large (enormous) battery were enough to convince me to go with the P715 by LG.No regrets.  I got Samsung Galaxy SIII performance for less money.  A LOT less, as I would have paid about four times as much for a similar android device in Korea!Now, on activation...  (Keep in mind this is activation procedure on SK Telecom or KT / Olleh network in South Korea)Activation was a bit of a headache and not a straight-forward procedure.  I had a Samsung Galaxy which was slowly fading on me.  It needed to be replaced.  It had a (properly activated) SK Telecom sim in it.  When the LG P715 handsets arrived (two of them, remember...one white and one blue but looks black...) I popped my SK Telecom sim into the white one and NOTHING.  Actually, wading through all the various settings menus...I could see that the phone was connected to SK telecom somehow...but I had no data flow and (zero) signal strength showing, and I got the \"emergency calls only\" message on the home screen.  :(So, I put the SK Telecom sim back into the (failing) Samsung Galaxy, and the sim worked fine.  Not a sim problem, obviously.So then I took the (now simless) LG P715 to a SK Telecom store.  I told the ladies there that I wanted a new phone number on SK Telecom.  They said \"no problem sir\" and proceeded to pop a new SK Telecom sim into the LG P715.  They didn't have any better luck with it than I did.  They could not get the LG P715 to work on SK Telecom network.  They tried for about 20 minutes, and gave up.  I asked if my handset (LG P715) could not be activated on SK Telecom.  The girl responded, \"I'm not sure...maybe another cell phone store could activate it?\"  In other words, she did not want to be bothered with it.Next day, I took it to another SK Telecom store.  I told the guy there that I wanted a new phone number on SK Telecom.  He looks at my handset and asks, \"where did you get THIS???\"  I tell him I ordered it from the U.S.  And after looking it over for a bit, he has me fill out some paperwork.  He faxes the paperwork somewhere, installs a new sim card in the handset... and then we wait for a return phone call.  After about 20 minutes, we are still waiting for a return phone call.  So he calls SK Telecom and speaks to them in Korean for a bit.  And then he hangs up with a puzzled expression on his face, and tells me...\"SK Telecom can not activate this phone because they say it was not made in Korea\".  So I grab the box and we both read the side of the box...and it says \"Made in Korea\".  (Well it IS LG...so yeah...)  So he calls them back and speaks with them a bit and they ask for some more information from the handset.  In about another 10 minutes...the phone is activated.  YAY!!!  Or so I thought...Took it home, used it for a few days.  Installed many of my favorite apps on it.  It seemed to be working fine.  Only, I was so busy that few days, that I did not really have time to use it \"outside\".  I was always connected to WiFi.  Then I finally realized that for phone and text, it's working great...but I haven't tried data on it.  So I turn the WiFi off and...no data.Long story short...I take it back to the SK Telecom store several times over the next few days, and the guy is very persistent in trying to get it to work...but he finally gives up.  :(He suggests maybe I should try to activate the phone on KT / Olleh.  OK, so far I'd only been playing with the white one.  The other one (blue, but looks black) was still in the unopened box.  I realized that IF I could get it activated on KT / Olleh, that is the one that I would want to be carrying myself.  So I took the brand new, never used handset to the KT / Olleh store.There were three young ladies working at the KT / Olleh store.  I told one I wanted a new phone number on this handset (and handed it to her).  She again asked me where I got it.  (Does it matter???  HaHa...)  But then she just presented me with a wide range of calling plans to choose from.  I chose one that is about the equivalent of $50USD monthly, with unlimited data.Long story short here...it took about 30 minutes and all three young ladies working together to get the LG P715 activated on KT / Olleh network in South Korea.  But it is working!!!Since it has been activated, I have not had a problem with it.  It is super fast on download speeds connected to KT / Olleh network in South Korea.  And of course, it makes phone calls and sends/receives texts.As a funny side note, I took my OLD phone back to the SK Telecom store.  There, the lady (who had tried to activate my LG P715 on SK Telecom) noticed that I was using my LG P715 on KT / Olleh.  She asked me where I'd taken it to get it activated.  She was AMAZED that the KT store right down the street from her was able to get my handset activated with a KT / Olleh sim card.  :)  I only took my old phone back to the SK Telecom store as I was told I had to visit an SK Telecom store in person to cancel my SK Telecom service.  How annoying.  But the look on the SK Telecom lady's face was PRICELESS when she saw the LG P715 working well on KT / Olleh.  :)Summary of the cell phone handset LG P715:  It is FANTASTIC.  Worth much more than you will pay for it.  IT performs better than many android handsets costing a lot more money.  A great bargain!  Buy it...you will LOVE IT!!!Summary of activating the cell phone handset LG P715:  (let's face it...the cell phone handset is useless without the cell phone network)It will take some persistence.  If you think you are just going to pop an activated sim into it and use it, think again.  while I did not have a lot of free time to work on the project, it took me a couple of weeks to get ONE of my two handsets FULLY functional.  The other one is still (NO DATA).  But at least now I know who to take that handset to, to FIX that...Haha...Summary of South Korea Telecom providers:Very hostile to cell phone handsets that were not made in Korea.  A similar situation might be if you went to register your Mercedes car in Denver, Colorado...and the clerk there told you that you could not get plates for it because you bought a German made vehicle.  South Korean cell phone providers only want to activate cell phones \"made in Korea\".  And even then...only certain specific models.It took a bit of arm-twisting to sneak this handset onto a KT / Olleh telecom contract, even though it is made in Korea.  And SK Telecom?  Virtually impossible, it seems...For those who have never been to Korea, but are familiar with United States Telecom companies...Verizon and AT&T; are to the United States...What KT / Olleh and SK telecom are to South Korea.Final word:  BUY!!!", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "so good", "Author": "Oscar Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3CCZ50F2CZXE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i like so much... is a very nice cellphone... so fast and it works fine with Movistar red in Venezuela", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Alejandro camey", "ReviewID": "RSK6K4QBWNBJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really good if you are looking for good tech specs and you have few money hahah.
