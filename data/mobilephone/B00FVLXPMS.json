I have both this and the nexus 5. Compared to the nexus 5, this device is a bit longer, and slightly wider, probably to house the larger battery. The screen is very comparable to the nexus 5 screen. The xiaomi OS is slightly different from regular Android OS, as it is somewhat a blend between Android and IOS. So far it has been an easy learning curve and the OS has been a real joy to use. Xiaomi also regularly releases bug fixes to the OS every Friday.Pros vs the nexus 5:-CPU appears marginally faster-better GPU for gaming-improved battery life over nexus 5-better button placement (IMHO)-better speakers-slightly longer screen as nexus 5 uses some of the screen for the back/details buttons, while the xiaomi mi3 does not use any screen space for the back/details buttonsCons:-camera does not OIS, thus not as good for low light shots-larger phone than nexus 5All in all, both phones are fantastic. My significant other holds the nexus 5 while I'm using the xiaomi mi3.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FVLXPMS"}}
