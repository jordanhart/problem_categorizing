{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Thorough Review", "Author": "Zain", "ReviewID": "ROIUCBSRPNBRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I picked up my Galaxy S4, I had the Galaxy Note II. I put my Note II up for sale online before my S4 was supposed to arrive, and it sold around two weeks before the S4 was supposed to be released, so for the two weeks before my S4 arrived, I had been living with a Droid X. Keep this in mind during my review, as my findings may have been slightly tainted by the fact that the S4 is such a massive upgrade from the Droid X, which I can hardly consider to be a \"modern phone\" anymore. Anyway, I'd like to go through the S4's hardware (screen, construction, camera, internals) then its software and any miscellaneous things I hadn't mentioned so far.ScreenThe Galaxy S4's screen is unbelievably high quality. It is a 4.99\" 1920 x 1080 panel, and colors are extremely sharp and vivid. Text looks fantastic, and because the resolution is so high, I haven't had a problem decreasing the font size to fit more information on my display. The display is 441 pixels per inch; in comparison, the S3's is 308 ppi, a 43% increase! The screen is a massive improvement from the S3 or the Note II. Super AMOLED HD panels like this one make colors really pop, which isn't a problem for me, but some people prefer to have a more realistic/neutral panel on their phones. There is a display setting that you can adjust to make the screen more neutral though, which should help alleviate any issues people have with the S4's standard setup.Physical Construction/Phone ExteriorThe Galaxy S3 was said by Samsung to be inspired by nature, so they made it with very curved sides like a pebble. With the S4, this mantra is refined a little bit. There is a metallic band that circles the phone's sides, and the swooping curves of the S3's back are straightened out a little. The result looks significantly more sophisticated and \"grown up\" than the S3. The back of the phone has a \"Hyperglaze\" finish with a light pattern printed on it, which is interesting but not distractingly so. The pattern is not very easy to see unless you hold the phone close to you or at an angle from a light source. I chose the white S4 because I think white may hide scratches and scuffs better than black, but both colors are enticing.  One thing I am happy about is that this phone doesn't have Verizon's garish logo plastered right onto the home button like it was on the Note II. Make no mistake though, Verizon's version of the S4 still has a jumbo Verizon logo as well 4G LTE one on the phone's back. I would definitely get a replacement back without these ugly logos if I didn't use a case.The volume, power, and home buttons are all substantially upgraded from Samsung's previous phones. They have a nice satisfying click, they don't wobble, and they are easy to feel without looking. I especially like the fact that the S4's home button is in the middle of the bottom bezel, instead of at the bottom like it was in the S3. Speaking of bezels, this phone has practically none. This phone feels like all screen basically, which explains how Samsung got a 4.99\" screen into a body that is actually slightly smaller than the S3's body (which had a 4.8\" screen), making it the smallest ~5\" 1080p phone in the world! Even though the S4 is larger than an iPhone, it feels much more compact due to the great use of space and tiny bezels.A few more things: the S4 feels very light, but the metallic band around the phone makes it feel sturdy. Also, the screen is covered in Gorilla Glass 3 - although you probably can't scratch it with your keys, I still wouldn't recommend dropping it a lot. I bought a soft touch plastic case on Amazon from Elago for my S4 and I really like it, as it keeps the phone more protected while not making it look like an ugly brick. I still love how the power button is on the side of the S4 (unlike phones like the HTC One or the iPhone 5), as it feels like a much more natural position for turning the phone on and off when in your hand.InternalsThe Galaxy S4 has a quad core Snapdragon 600 processor and 2 GB ram, and in my time so far, I still haven't seen any of the occasional lag I felt when I tried a S4 out at AT&T; (maybe this is what took Verizon an extra month in releasing the S4). The international version of the phone has 8 cores - a low powered quad core processor for idling and a high powered quad core processor for doing more intensive tasks. I'm a little disappointed that the U.S. didn't get that processor, but the Snapdragon 600 is no slouch. Regardless, I have gotten fantastic LTE service everywhere I've visited with the S4 so far.The S4 comes with a 13 MP camera (although its set to take 9.6 MP photos by default). This camera is definitely an upgrade from anything else on the market. Not only does it capture a huge amount of detail in photos, but the software has so many useful features too. There are plenty of different modes to take pictures with, but the ones I've really played with and enjoyed are Drama Shot and Animated Photo Mode. Drama Shot basically takes a series of pictures and then stitches them together, which is useful when the subject is moving. I took a picture of my brother doing a flying kick on the lawn and it looks fantastic. The Animated Photo Mode is great, too - essentially, the S4 takes a series of shots and plays them sequentially in one image, like a gif. You can then choose which parts of the photo to animate and which to keep still. It may sound confusing, but it's actually relatively intuitive and fun when you try it out. I have seen comparisons between the S4 and the HTC One criticizing the S4's low light performance, so I tested it out for myself. On Auto mode, with the auto night detection off, the S4's photos in low light look poor. However, in Night mode, the photos improve immensely. Overall, the One's low light quality is better than the S4's, but the S4's camera is much better in all other situations. Of course, the \"better camera\" depends on each person's use for it, but unless you take most of your pictures in the dark, it probably makes sense to go for the S4's camera, which captures quite a bit more detail at all other times and is still decent in the dark. As a side note, the front facing camera is 2 MP, which is a slight upgrade from the 1.9 MP camera in the S3.Like the S3 and the Note II, the S4 comes with a removable battery (2600 mAh) and a Micro SD card slot. I immediately put in my 64 GB card I got on Amazon and now I have plenty of space to store my photos, videos, and music. I haven't yet purchased a spare battery, but it is nice to know I have the option to do so if I want.The S4 comes with approximately 1 million sensors - to name a few, an accelerometer, a temperature gauge, a barometer, two proximity sensors, an RGB notification light, two mics, and even more. One of my favorite things about Android is the notification light; you can instantly tell when your phone has an unread message or other notification. I haven't had a problem with any of the phone calls I've made with my S4, so clearly the noise canceling second mic is doing its job.SoftwareI think that Android has always had more features than iOS but that iOS has always had more polish to it. After Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, I no longer find this to be true. Jelly Bean looks fantastic, and it is also very feature-rich. iOS on the other hand has stagnated. I owned the original iPhone and the iPhone 4, and other than the increased resolution (and the ability to add home screen backgrounds), the software on both phones looks practically identical. iOS, although once groundbreaking, now looks positively gaudy, with many of its apps containing over-the-top skeumorphic design - Game Center and Podcasts come to mind as particularly egregious examples. Android now offers a nice, clean interface that has finally caught up to iOS in terms of visual flair.Jelly Bean isn't the massive overhaul that Ice Cream Sandwich was, but it definitely has some nice new features that I enjoy using. By long pressing on the home button and clicking on the Google icon, you can get to Google Now. Here, Google combines information that it already knows about you into sets of \"cards\" that appear throughout the day at (hopefully) the most helpful time. For instance, when I bought a case and screen protector, there was a card that told me that my package had shipped with UPS two day shipping, and it gave me the option to track it or viewa the confirmation email from Amazon. Google Now also tells you the local weather for the next three days, traffic home from work and other frequently visited places, and sports scores for your favorite teams. In addition, by saying \"Google\" or pressing the speech button while in Google Now, you can use Google's enhanced voice actions. Here, Google uses its algorithms to answer questions about people and places. You can ask it math questions, set alarms, send texts, call people, and do a ton of other things. Somehow, Google has done something to make these voice searches incredibly quick and accurate, often much more so than Apple's voice assistant Siri. If you want to see a funny video of the two compared, search on YouTube for \"Google Search vs. Siri App Judgment\" and skip to 3:31 in the video, it really shows how well Google's voice recognition algorithm works. Another feature introduced in Jelly Bean is expandable/actionable notifications. When I get a text message, I can drag down with one or two fingers on the notification to expand it to see the entire message. This also works with emails and many other types of notifications, as long as the developer has enabled it.The Galaxy S4 runs Jellybean, aka Android 4.2.2., which is currently the most up to date Android version. It has a layer designed by Samsung that overlays Jellybean called Touchwiz, which has its pros and cons. In my opinion, pure, unmodified Jellybean looks significantly better than Touchwiz, but Touchwiz adds some pretty fantastic features that aren't present in stock Jellybean. It would be impossible to mention all the features present on this phone, but I will try to go over the most significant ones.Multi Window: by holding the back button for a few seconds, multi window opens (or closes), allowing you to select and open two different apps simultaneously. One thing I really like doing is watching a video on YouTube while browsing on Chrome or sending a text.Smart Stay/Rotation/Pause/Scroll: Smart Stay keeps the screen on while you're looking at it, which is useful if you do a lot of reading. Smart Rotation stops the screen from rotating along with the phone if it senses your face rotating along too (like if you're laying down in bed). Smart Pause pauses a video if you look away. Smart Scroll scrolls up and down by either tilting your head or tilting the phone up and down. Of course, these features don't work if the front facing camera can't see your face, so that limits their applicability in some situations.Gestures: there are a huge number of gestures built into the phone. You can wave up or down to scroll in the browser, you can wave to answer a call or change songs, you can swipe your palm across the screen to take a screenshot, and you can put the phone up to your ear to start a call while in the messaging app.Air View: this lets you preview messages, images, and other things in many of the built in apps by hovering your finger over them. It used to only work with the S Pen on the Note II, but now it can sense your finger, too.Lock screen applications: I like these because they let you jump to an app right from the lock screen.Swipe to call/text: In the dialer or contacts apps, you can swipe in one direction on a contact to call them and in the other to text them. This seems so simple, but it is extremely convenient.Final WordsAlthough the Galaxy S4 doesn't deviate too far from the S3's look, it has been completely redesigned internally and has also received a whole set of new software features. It will probably take me a few weeks to evaluate the S4's battery life, but I will try to update this review with any further comments I may have. I have only had my S4 for a few days, but these are my impressions so far. If you have any questions, feel free to comment and ask me. The S4 is a fantastic phone and I have no qualms recommending it to anyone.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Device, Beautiful Screen. *** UPDATED ***", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2B0F2109O3F5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this phone for months, while also planning on switching carriers at the same time. Here's what I like about the phone:Beautiful screen - for those of us who don't have perfect vision, this screen is very readable. The fonts are an appropriate size, with good contrast.Nice speed. The screen is responsive, and allows multiple windows to be open at once.Screen size: For certain apps, I.e. the kindle app, this screen approximates an e-reader very well (as opposed to reading on a smaller phone screen.)The interface is very thoughtfully designed. Great job, Samsung! Unobtrusive, noninvasive methods of accessing critical apps are available from almost anyplace on the phone.Icons/graphics are adorable, and creatively designed. No boring manila folders on this phone! Your folders show contents from the outside of the folder... Cute.Ease of use: There is a little bit of a learning curve on this phone (I had the Samsung Epic previously), but I've pretty much figured it out in a few hours. It's going to be great. Once you get the hang of the graphics, it's really quick to move things around, personalize, etc.It really blurs the boundary between a tablet and a phone, without becoming too huge, like the Note (which I am now glad I did not buy).Voice quality: I'd read reviews in the last few days that state that it is not very good... I think it's fine. The sound is clear, and volume is fine.One of my favorite apps for Android: Out of Milk. Running out of groceries? Scan the bar code into one of your shopping lists, (or input by voice or typing), and your shopping list is complete. I keep a running shopping list for Trader Joes, and my other local market. When I go to the store, I simply move the items I need to the top of the list, and go for it! No more paper lists!One heads up: (carrier, not phone related): check on Visual Voicemail.... I use it all the time, and really like it. I was surprised to discover that I had to pay for it as an add on with Verizon.... It was part of my Sprint service previously.** UPDATE **I've had the phone for almost a week, and it's simply a PLEASURE to use! Lots of nice touches: pop up asking if you'd like to add someone to your contacts after a call from a non contact, for example.Camera: is great. I photographed an entire exhibit in a museum.... No flash, in dark rooms, and the photos are stunning.Battery life: surprisingly good! I used the phone all day yesterday, on and off trains where it would have been seeking service in tunnels (usually drains battery quicker), used my Kindle app, made calls, sent texts and emails, and I still had 60% at the end of a ten hour day.Battery recharging: using the charging cord that comes with the phone, it charges in no time... A couple of hours at most. I've been amazed at the recharge speed, compared to my previous phone.Kindle app is like a baby Kindle... there's just enough on the page to not feel like you are only reading a few sentences at a time like on some smaller devices.I'm so pleased with my choice, I hope you enjoy it, also.(And in case this is helpful to anyone: if you are debating about a case, I have the Seidio holster case... Please see my review.)*************UPDATE 2:  June 9The phone continues to work beautifully, but I wanted to give everyone a head's up:Careful how you delete your photos.  I thought I was deleting one picture, and deleted everything by accident!  Back up your photos before you delete anything.  Also, I wouldn't delete anything until you figure out the camera interface.... I hadn't had a chance to do a backup.  And, read the 'confirm\" carefully.  It said do you want to delete this album... I didn't realize it was more than one photo until I hit 'yes', and there was no way to stop the delete at that point.Luckily, I had emailed some of the photos, so I had a few of them, but the rest are gone.**************UPATE 3:  June 22Still loving the device.  I use the camera daily.... Photo quality blows me away. It's great.Check out the Samsung spare battery/ charger for the S4.... Please see my review.  Very nice set.****************UPATE 4: July 6I dropped the phone the other day from about 5 feet onto a hard floor.  In the Seidio case, the phone was fine.... Please see my review of the case for more info.*****************UPATE 5: October 11I took some casual photos on my phone.  They were good enough to use in a professionally produced brochure.  The photos are stunning!Enjoy this great device! Questions? Drop a note, and I'll get back to you.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blows the competition out of the water!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R2Q1QVL0OD5HGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S4 will be the best phone of 2013, mark my words!", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S4", "Author": "Richard Stack", "ReviewID": "R1YUSG67L65TT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a change for me.

Ever.", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R20RP0IZYJT9C7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some background on me:  I bought into the Android hype from the beginning, buying a Droid Milestone (the OG Motorola Droid slider.)  It was a neat device, but riddled with SO many software bugs and hardware that just could not run such a hefty operating system.  I gave up on Android, and switched to an iPhone 4S in 2011.  In late 2012 after a series of iTunes fails, I switched to a Droid Razr M.  A great device and epic battery life in a small package, but a crummy camera and Android definitely needs the 2GB of ram.  OK, enough about me, the phone:Design:  Thin, light, plastic.  The thinness is lost on me - I am 6'5 with proportionally gigantic hands, so I don't need a tiny phone per se.  That being said its almost too thin, and while we're on it its almost too light for its size.  Fortunately if you are part of the 98% that buys a case then this is quickly offset.  The case adds the requisite weight so it feels solid, the requisite thickness so holding it doesn't feel like its cutting into your hands.  Plastic is almost like a four letter word nowadays, but as is the case with the thinness and lightness, you will not see plastic if you use a case.  That being said if you go case free, its all glass front and a metal trim.  A beautiful device through and through (5 of 5)Hardware:  Coming from a dual core S4/1 GB of ram I can say this is a huge performance boost.  I still close down apps from time to time, though thats mostly for battery saving purposes.  I have yet to have this device hang up on me. (Note: Chrome occasionally hangs up, though thats a function of Chrome I suspect. No other apps have hung.)  The antennas in this device are great as well.  I'm a crazy ground dweller (AKA I live in a basement.)  I was getting 1-2 bars on my Razr M, 2-4 bars on this phone.  For all I know they have the cell receiver, but I can tell you theres a marked improvement in the S4.  Data rates remain constant though, around 7 up/7 down on New York City's oversaturated LTE network.  Middling speakers, though quality headphones solve (the OEM headphones are dreadful.)  (5 out of 5)Display:  Ill let a little Apple bias shine now - the Iphone 4S and 5 have half the resolution but are sharper and brighter than this phone could dream to be.  \"But MJ 1080 > iSheep!\" you say.  Well, yes, more pixels is grand, but the iPhone display is simply better.  That being said this is still an amazing display.  I actually prefer AMOLEDs more vibrant colors.  I have slight color blindness, so the popping colors really jive well with my broken ass eyeballs.  Much like a TV you have some good control over the display settings.  I go with the \"Vibrant\" preset cause, well, I love those poppy AMOLED colors.  Theres a setting for every type though. (4 out of 5)Software:  This section both validates and invalidates this review.  I dont know stock vs Touchwiz Android, so I wont win many Fandroids by admitting that but it also shows im not a Fandroid.  I'd like to think I just like good phones.  That said, the software on this phone is wunderbar.  First off the missing software option: software buttons.  Purists love having buttons taking up the bottom 10% of their screen, I hate it.  Its why I got this phone.  Your menu buttons should not be on the !@#$ing screen!  Ahem, anyway.  Beyond that its as if Samsung said \"to hell with minimalist Android\" and fancied it up.  I was able to familiarize myself with it pretty quickly based on previous experience.  Verizon offers free classes on how to use Android if you're new to the system, at least they do here in NY, so that should help with the learning curve.As for most of the new additions: I havent had much luck with them.  Frankly they are pretty weaksauce - I am not going to flail crazily at my phone to answer it or have it pop popcorn, etc.  One really awesome addition though is the Universal Remote Control app included WatchOn.  Cant find your remote?  Got your S4.  At a sports bar where your waitress is taking 20 minutes to switch to the Mets?  Got your S4.  At your girlfriends place, entering hour 4 of an Americas Next Top Model marathon?  Got your S4 (well, at least you can suggest the TV gods are insisting on a new show...)  Android is developed enough that its smooth a babies behind.  And widgets are why I can never go back to iOS.  (Also, being able to drag and drop your music folder instead of librarying and syncing and dancing to the rain gods to get your library on your phone is much, much better.)  (5 out of 5)Battery:  Battery is where this place REALLY shines.  My brother has an S3, and maybe gets 12-14 hours of serious usage.  I want a phone I can use all day, syncing with personal email, syncing with a battery gobbling proprietary work email app, at 70% brightness.  Well, I got it.  Sadly I cant paste in images here, but right now I am looking at 18 hours on battery, 4 hours of display usage, wifi+GPS on all day, and still at 20% battery.  What else can I say?  Well, if youre a road weary business traveler like me you have the option of second batteries and extended life batteries, though I find it rather unnecessary.  This was my biggest area of concern going into this phone, and this is my favorite aspect of it right now.  (5 out of 5)Camera:  This section is pending, as I have taken fewer than 100 pictures at this point.  I will address to hot points of discussion though:  the HDR on this phone so far seems fairly mediocre.  That being said the \"Night\" mode on this phone is the best I have experienced ever.  This phones weakness was supposed to be low lighting and I can say without question that the low light setting on the S4 renders these concerns moot.  Been out a few times with this guy, and the night mode captures dimly lit bar pictures fast and clearly, flash free. (Pending, inclined to say 4 of 5.)Feel free to ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer any.  Im not a super android user, so I cant answer any rooting or custom ROM questions or anything like that, though.

Finally he can join us in the world of smart phones yet fully use and answer the Galaxy S4 even on the days his hand is acting up when he otherwise has difficulty feeling the pressure on the touch screen.

I bought a Galaxy note 2.  Great phone and it introduced me to Android at version 4.1  So that is where im coming from but I found it was just too big after 6 months of struggling trying to use it with one hand in the car trying to check traffic etc.Pros:1.  Perfect size,  big but not too big.2.  Screen is amazing,  rivals the iphone but has all the features of Galaxy note 2.3.  Running latest version of Android 4.2.24. Love the widgets (I have one for Gmail, google voice, out of milk shopping list, google now)  All that info without having to open the app.5.  SD card for storing pictures, videos and music/movies.6.  Great feeling in the hand,  great thickness, and feel.7.  Love the integration with Google8.  Google+ app auto uploads your pictures if you wish,  works like an auto back up9.  Cool new hand gestures like swipping your hand to go through your pictures is pretty neat.10.  The android store is very close to Apple's  I have all apps from when I used the iphone.11.  Google navigation and google maps and google now are my favorite apps.  Along with Google music with all access.Cons:1. Can't use the SD card for apps right now.2.  Limited to 16gb of on board storage (which is fine I guess since its only for apps)3.  Back of the device is a bit slippery and using it with one hand is tough,  I will have to get a rubber grippy case for more traction with the grip4.  Sound quality is nice on the loud speaker and the ear speaker.5.  Wish google music all access could be saved to the SD card to allow more storage for music so it doesn't kill your data plan.Overall great phone,  its everything I like about the galaxy note 2,  in a smaller package,  up to date android, new features and the perfect size.

The 16GB internal limit is not as much as a big deal anymore.  Also, Verizon now sells the 32GB version.If you are reading this, you are likely debating between this and the HTC Droid DNA and the Note II (the only three 4 core phones currently available on Verizon).  I have used all three and like all three for different reasons.  I like the pen on the Note II and my wife is completely in love with hers, but I would never use one.  It is just too big and it is not 1920x1080.  My reason for switching from the DNA to the S4 is so esoteric, I am not sure it really applies to 99% of the people that are purchasing phones.  I really do like my DNA.  In many ways, I much prefer it to the S4.My Phone History: I am coming from a HTC Droid DNA and it is generally the same size, so I have no problems at all with the size.  I just cannot see myself carrying a Note II sized Otterbox on my belt.  Before now, all of our previous 6 phones have been HTC smart-phones.Speed: After having the DNA for 6 months, I can already tell you that you will quickly get used to having a 4 core processor and any old single core phone you pick up later will seem irritatingly slow.  The S4 is theoretically faster than the DNA, but in reality I do not really notice a difference in day to day usage.Display: Like the DNA, it has a FHD 1920x1080 display and I have pretty much stopped using anyone else's computer to browse the web when I visit them or even using my own notebook.  Watching movies directly on the phone is a bit mesmerizing.  You see so much detail, you kinda forget that you are watching a 5\" screen.Screen Rotation: I find the S4 to be far less responsive to noticing that I changed the orientation from Portrait to Landscape than my HTC DNA and it annoys me no end.Tiny Fonts: Some would have issues with the tiny default fonts, however I like very much being able to see more information on the screen at once and I find it very readable and easy to zoom in whenever I want to make it a bit easier to read (or ensure I am clicking the correct box).Dedicated Menu Button: I do prefer having the menu button as a separate button because so many apps do not integrate so very well the 3 dot icon that appears when a phone does not have a dedicated menu button and the DNA equivalent of the active/recently used apps menu is just as easily reached via the long press on the home button on the S4.  The long press of the home button on the DNA takes you to the new Google Now.Touchwiz: The Samsung software will take time for me to get comfortable with. I have been using HTC phones for many years now and I did like their tweaks to stock Android.  Eventually I hope to get use to Touchwiz, but for now, it is a bit frustrating trying to work with an Android phone they way I am accustomed to.  Many of the screens are still a bit cartoonish compared to the more professional looking HTC equivalents.Web Browser: HTC has auto-text-re-flow when you pinch to zoom.  Samsung does not, but the double click seems to take you automatically to the maximum zoom you can have and still see all the text, so maybe it is just a learning curve.  I cannot get the S4 to always default to DesktopView like I was able to with the DNA, which I find very annoying.  HTC also has a cool swipe in-from-the-side way to reach all the options to remain full screen all the time.  HTC's web browser wins by a mile.Flash: I am able to view Flash content on the web just fine with FireFox (one installs the Flash apk separately directly from Adobe's website).Calendar App:  The S4 wins here easily.  Nice interface.  It includes Tasks from Exchange quite easily, however there is no TODAY button when changing the date of an appointment.Mail App:  I like both, but there is one feature HTC has that I really, really, really miss.  It remembers the folders to which you moved mail recently.  Samsung does not.  I have to scroll and scroll and scroll every single time I want to move an email.  I will likely be forced to rename my folders 01 Personal, 02 Client A, 03 Program A, etc. and keep changing them as my currently active workload demands.Folders:  Another feature that HTC has that I miss is that when you add an app to a folder of apps (e.g. Games A-F) it will automatically hide the icons for any apps that are already in that folder.  Samsung will not and will gladly let you add the same app icon again and again every time you did not realize it was already in there.Clock: On an HTC, which you click on a HTC Clock home screen widget, you are brought to the clock app so you can set the alarm or start a timer.  Samsung's Clock does nothing.  You need to create a 2nd static icon just to get to those options.  Quite odd in my mind.  Quite odd indeed.  However the Transparent Weather Clock apps works quite well.Build in Keyboard: The Default Samsung keyboard has a Swype style keyboard built in AND it has a dedicated number row (very very nice).  I do like the tab below the cursor to easily move the cursor to the position you want.  I am missing having the backspace delete the entire word as Swype does.  It is now a habit and causing a lot of rework.  Swype is also built in and I have just changed to it as the default.  Hopefully, one advantage of having it built in will be that it will work in all parts of the phone's interface.  On the DNA, I frequently find that the app I am currently using is not letting Swype add a space after words automatically soIwindupwiththisasamytextentered.External Keyboard: It is working fine with both my wireless USB Keyboard and my Bluetooth keyboards, however it refuses to let me keep Swype as my default on-screen keyboard when I use and external keyboard.  Very odd and very annoying.Text/Messaging: HTC's app will show the emoticon before you hit send (and they were very cool icons).  Samsung's does not (and they are rather boring and unclear anyway), so I have stopped using emoticons because I have no clue what it will actually look like and have no idea how they would be interpreted by others anyway even if I did as they are so understated and cryptic.I wish the Samsung had another feature that is on my HTC DNA... when I side swipe to get from home screen to the next home screen and I reach the end, the Samsung S4 just stops.  if the app I was looking for was to the right and not to the left of the base/middle screen, I have to rescroll past all the screens I just saw to get back to the right most screen.  On the HTC Droid DNA, they are in a loop.  Scroll to the left from the left most screen and you find yourself on the right-most screen, which I like a lot.Unique Samsung apps: I have no use for gesturing or eye-tracking or DriveMode or many of those features. However, I can foresee liking very much:The temperature gauge and barometer (accessible via the SHealth or WeatherStation apps)The IR to remote control the TV when I cannot find the Remote (have not yet tried)Smart Stay / Smart Pause (Smart Rotation is not quite working for me)S TranslatorMultiWindowSamsung HubAirView for some reason defaults to individual items turned off.  If it is \"on\" and not working, just dig deeper as there are more option underneath.  I am a big fan of the idea of AirView.  It is the one feature of the Pen on the Note II that was most tempting.  In practice however, it only worked on half of my emails and simply clicking the date in the calendar worked better and it seldom really showed enough to really help anyway.If Found Contact: There is an OwnerInfo section in Lock Screen Widgets to have your name and work phone number scroll across the lock screen, which is VERY nice should you loose it.  For HTC, I had to create a graphic backgroud file.WiFi disconnect - DLink Routers:  Apparently there is a conflict with this phone and D-Link routers.  All Verizon would tell me was to update my firmware in order to maintain a connection (or buy a new router).  However, both were already up-to-date.  It took a few days of trial and error and google searches, but I think that I finally got the S4 and my DLink Routers cooperating (Different high # fixed channels, Mixed n and g, WPA2-TKIP only)SmartDock: The #1 reason I am upgrading so soon from the DNA (after just 6 months) is to be able to use the SmartDock.  This way I can have simultaneous use of OTG (on the go USB hosting) and MHL 2.0 (to view HDMI in full HD glory on any monitor) and charging.  I found the DNA sorely lacking in this regard.  In theory I could stop carrying my notebook now and do real work via RemoteDesktopping while on the road.  For certain I can now play and video/movies (mostly Windows Media Center recordings) on a portable USB hard drive or flash memory stick projected onto any larger monitor using external speakers no problem.  However, I can only get it to output a 720p signal to my HDMI monitor, not the full 1920x1080.  Disappointed.  Fine for movies, but not so much for RemoteDesktopping.  For video at home, instead of copying files to that USB hard drive, instead I use ES File Explorer and MX Player to play any of the video/movie files on our home network onto our bedroom TV.MHL 2.0: Samsung is selling a Galaxy S4 HDTV MHL 2.0 adaptor, just not in the US yet.  I had to order one from HongKong (it is on its way).  Maybe a SmartDock2 will support MHL 2.0.  My hope it to have a 1920x1080 display on my portable HDMI FHD monitor for RemoteDesktopping.  I will just need to find a better bluetooth keyboard.Replaceable Battery: I am also really liking having the ability to carry a 2nd charged battery.  I do not actually have it in hand yet, but in all my phones prior to my DNA, I carried an extra battery around with me at all times and the extra battery I ordered comes with a charger, which will save me my old hassle of swapping out batteries a second time just to keep both charged.  The main reason I like a removable battery: I do not have to bother trying to conserver battery power.  With the HTC DNA, I was so cautious.  I usually wound up with 70% available at the end of the day, but I wanted to be on the safe side just in case.  With the S4, I can thro caution to the wind as I will have a backup available should the battery die.  But so far, I have yet to kill the battery and I only charge it at night.  The nice thing about this being a high volume phone is that you are more likely to find someone still manufacturing new batteries 4 even 8 years from now.Replaceable MicroSD Card: I found that with the HTC DNA, not having a MicroSD card made it annoyingly difficult to back up my information.  I like having a drive letter and the xtra speed when attached to the computer when the card is in a fast USB 3.0 reader.  However, for some odd reason, I cannot access the MicroSD card while it is still in the camera with its own drive letter (the tool I use to compare folders cannot understand \"camera mode\", no can any other folder comparison tool I have found so far).  With a 64GB card, it is nice to carry around with me the shows no one in our house but me wants to watch, so I can watch them on the train.Flexible back: I like the more flexible plastic back as it makes it easier to change the battery or take out the MicroSD card than it was on my previous phones.  I do not worry anymore that I might break the back.Qi charging:  Samsung sells an alternative back that enables Qi wireless charging.  I have it and it was a very tight fit to get the Otterbox case to snap together, but I removed the inner backing and that helped a lot.  It is very convenient to just lay it down on my Qi charger at night.  It is very generous as to positioning (unlike my old DNA) and as a bonus, the tight fight in my case means I can now once again feel the vibration alarm.  Samsung Galaxy S4 Wireless S Charger Kit (inductive type) - Wireless Charging Black Cover & PadNote that the defaults for storing files (such as Photos) on the SD Card are hidden within the Settings in their MyFiles app.Camera: The S4 does take better noticably pictures than the DNA during my indoor at night side by side test using default and night and HDR modes.  The S4 had richer (and still accurate) colors and more detail.High Volume Sales benefits: Unlike the DNA (or many other phones) and more like the iPhone, nearly everyone makes a version of their accessories for the Galaxy line, so I already had in hand before receiving the phone:Otterbox 77-27434 Defender Series and Holster Case for Samsung Galaxy S 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackSPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil [Ultra Crystal] Premium Crystal Clear High Definition Front Screen Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500  (yes, I remove the Otterbox screen)and soon the: Samsung Galaxy S4 Spare Battery Charger (2600mAh Battery Included)Android 4.2.2: I have been using Android 4.1 for six months now and found it a big improvement over any version prior to that and can easily see (once I fully investigate the changes) liking Android 4.2 even more.  I thought 4.2.2 had multiple login ability (work with password and home without password), but so far, I cannot find it on the S4.Accessories: It comes with the same 2amp charger and 58\" cord as the Note2 does as well as a headset with mic built in and a half charged 3.8V 9.88Wh 2600mAh battery.Samsung Account: As you set it up for the first time, it asks if you want to create or sign into a Samsung Account. There are a lot of cool options there: account.samsung.com  It may prove useful if you are new to Samsung to check out this page before you activate your phone (tho you can always create the account later).Date in Lock Screen: Before it will actually SHOW the date, you need to go to Settings/More/DateAndTime/SelectDateFormat and select any one of the date formats.I will keep tweaking and updating this review as I have previous reviews and will generally answer comments soon after you post them.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Newbie Review", "Author": "kookie", "ReviewID": "R3F6RY27E0AJLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm 62 and have never had a portable phone or pager in my life. I finally decided it was time to give in to the inevitable and got a Samsung S4 for Christmas. Most of the reviews here are by experienced power users who offer insight based upon their wealth of experience. I hesitated to add my greenhorn 2 cents, but then thought that it might be of use to the 6 or 7 people left in the world who haven't already owned and discarded dozens of cellphones.Observations of a Newbie:1) The Good.  - The camera is astonishingly good (This coming from a now retired, but former professional). It handles quick snapshots, low light, back light, mixed light, and fast-moving situations flawlessly. And the 13MP give a resolution that is almost unbelievable. I took a picture of a bunch of people at Christmas, then noticed something in the shirt pocket of one of them. I zoomed in using my fingers, then zoomed in further and further. It was like being in an episode of NCIS. I finally could read the writing on the brochure in the shirt pocket of the guy in the back row of the group photo. Fantastic. No need to ever take along a separate camera.  - The screen resolution is awesome. It's 1080p and it looks it. Clear, bright, saturated colors. No blurring or smearing or jittery motion. Videos taken with the built-in camera are brilliant. No need for a video camera either.  - It's fast! At home I use it over the house Wi-Fi system and it loads pages and scrolls through websites faster than the laptop and seemingly as fast as the mighty 6 processor desktop machine. Surfing with Flipboard or one of the portals is fast and fun.  - Voice Search is worth the cost of the phone by itself. If I had known about this I would have caved in years ago. I had, of course, watched the video of Siri vs Android and laughed about \"Would you like me to show you a picture of a stallion?\" The Google Search as implemented for Android works flawlessly. And quickly. \"What was the score of the Bears game?\" brings a response in less time than it would take me to even open a browser. \"Where's the nearest Redbox?\" brings a direct answer along with 8 or 9 alternatives, all with detailed directions and a link so that I could reserve a movie before heading out. Sometimes we just sit here thinking of crazy things to ask. \"How do you say 'What would you charge to trim my palm tree?' in Spanish?\" Bueno.2) The Bad.  - Battery life is lousy. Granted, we use it predominantly with Wi-Fi, but still: it seems like we're always charging it. I imagine power users wouldn't make it through a day on one charge.  - The quality of the sound is terrible. I mean really. Here you've got a 1080p HD screen and they want you to use Netflix and Hulu and what all to stream movies and the sound that comes out of the speaker hidden somewhere out of the way is thin and shrill and tinny and barely audible. The same songs that boom powerful and brilliant in the car or out of an MP3 player sound like they're being sung by Alvin and the Chipmunks or Mickey Mouse.3) The Ugly.  - The software that comes with the phone is a mess. There's tons of stuff from Samsung. Then Verizon added another ton or two of their stuff. Then they threw in a bunch of stuff they thought might be useful (or for which they were paid money to include - yes, I'm such a cynic!). When you first get the phone there are 4 pages of apps and 13 pages of widgets. And this is before you've even had a chance to download Candy Crush Saga. Even worse is that almost all of it refuses to be off-loaded onto the SD card. I understand that some programs are too important to risk being on the SD card, but Audible? IMDb? YouTube? Really? When you get a memory cleaner and take a look at what is running every time you turn on the phone it's enough to knock you flat. With time I'll delve into it and start shutting things down and removing them, but man, they sure do make things difficult.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The most powerful phone on the market has arrive. See ya' later iPhone!", "Author": "Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"", "ReviewID": "RSZO9G6EMCFXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good: Gorgeous 5\u2033 screen, tons of customization features and options, Air Gestures and Smart Screen are neat, sleek form factor, super powerful CPU and GPU, tons of fast RAM, expandable media options, packed-in headphones are great, amazing 13MP cameraThe Bad: Air Gestures and Smart Screen are just gimmicks and drain the battery fast, battery doesn't last very long unless all features are off, back cover is flimsy and cheap feeling, comes with a lot of bloatwareApple finally met it's match, the Samsung Galaxy S III has sold more units than the iPhone 4 and 4S combined, that's a serious feat. Why you ask? Because Android OS gives you complete freedom to do what you want, not what Samsung wants. There is no iTunes that you are tethered to, you can put what you want on your phone, you can buy expandable media, the choice is yours. People loved that, and the S3 took off due to the form factor and Samsung's smart marketing ideas. With the S4 Samsung has created the most powerful smartphone on the planet, honestly I won't even compare the S4 to the iPhone 5 much because it is more powerful than that phone and the iPad 3.Out of the BoxThe box itself is actually pretty nice. It has a wood texture on it letting you know you bought something classy, something with character, not a robot clone like the iPhone 5. Like wood, you can shape it and do what you want with it, make furniture, do some woodburning, or break it into pieces. Also like wood, the S4 has endless customization options. The S4 comes with earbuds that are better than the iPhone earbuds, as well as three different ear pieces for different size preferences. You will also have to put the battery in yourself, the back cover, and for some carriers, the 4G SIM card. Assembling your phone also lets you know that it's yours, it's not assembled in the box like an iPhone, it gives you a bit more attachment to your phone. This sounds weird to some people, but it's true, there's a reason for all this.Welcome to AndroidFor people who have used Android for awhile (like myself since 2.2) you will love the 4.2.2 Jellybean OS. Samsung's personal touch is amazing with many power saving options, a great shutter menu, and the speed and precision of a high-end PC. Think I'm kidding? There is virtually zero lag even with multiple apps open, but that's not the first thing you will notice.The phone itself is the thinnest and sleekest phone around. Especially for the power under the hood. The 5\u2033 Super AMOLED display is gorgeous and rivals that of high-end HDTVs. It has a 1920\u00d71080 resolution, that's a full 1080p resolution folks, same quality has a TV. The screen is also 441 ppi which is twice that of most other high-end phones. You are looking at pure eye-catching crisp visuals for movies, games, and photos. Nothing out there beats it. It also feels great, it's a perfect rectangle with rounded edges. It has aluminum sides to make it look modern, and it also comes in black and white. I prefer the black because it looks sleeker and the white makes it look like a stretched out iPhone 4S. The volume rocker is very thin and blends in with the phone and same goes with the power button. The S4 has a home button like the iPhone, and unlike most other Android phones. It has a menu and back soft key, but no search soft key like other phones. I found this simple and honestly looks like a better iPhone.Under the HoodFor people who care, or don't care, the S4 is one of the most powerful phones on the market. It has a 1.9Ghz (there are 1.6 and 1.4 Ghz models available) quad-core Krait 300 CPU. That is damn fast, even faster than most high-end tablets. It sports a SGX PowerVR 544 GPU which will let you play the best games out there, but is also extremely fast and current games don't quite push it to its limits, it's a tri-core GPU to boot. In fact, it's just one up from the PlayStation Vita GPU, and everyone knows it can produce near PS3 quality graphics. The S4 has 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM which means tons of room for app switching and you won't have any slow down. You also get a 13 MP camera, yeah 13. It's the same quality as a high-end point and shoot, and the quality is amazing. There is also a 2 MP front facing camera which is better than most phone's 1.3 or 0.3 MP FFC. This allows extra precision when using the Smart Gestures (more later). The battery also has a Near Field Communications chip which allows for NFC beaming to other devices. You can also mirror your screen on another device to show them something. The S4 also features DLNA file sharing for computers and other devices.Air GesturesWith the combination of the gyroscope, front facing camera, and the smart screen you can do things on your phone without even touching it. One feature lets you wave your hand in front of the screen to answer a call, hold the screen with two thumbs and use the gyroscope to look around your pictures, wave your hand in front of the screen to scroll pictures, and various other features. One other feature lets you hover your finger above and image to preview it before pressing it. Honestly, these features are gimmicks and nothing more than something to show off with in public. The biggest issue is they are a serious battery drain. Keeping the FFC and smart screen features on just sucks your battery dry in a few short hours.Smart ScreenA few features here like scrolling pages with the tilt of your head or tilting your screen. It doesn't respond as well as you think and sucks your battery down. You can also use Smart Stay which will turn the screen off when you look away, and smart pause which will pause video when you look away. This all keeps your FFC on and will drain your battery in no time as well.The Little Things That MatterIn the end there are little things that are there for customization. Multi-Window allows you to quickly switch apps with a drawer at the side of your screen, there's a great power-saving mode that underclocks the CPU and can turn off haptic feedback as well as dial back the color resolution on the screen. You will need these because the battery does not last long in the S4 with everything turned on. There's also a little feature that lets you make your own vibration patterns which is really interesting. You can have widgets and short cuts on your lock screen which most phones need third-party apps for, you can control the phone with your voice, and unlock the screen with your voice. This may seem pointless to some people, but the fact that Samsung put it in here means they care about the consumer. They give you all these tools and you can decide if you want them or not, they are not forced onto you. One thing that I do need to mention is that there is a lot of bloatware on the phone that needs to be disabled. I disabled nearly 30 apps that I would never use and just used up space and resources.In the end the Galaxy S4 is one of the most customizable and powerful smartphones on the market, I would go as far as to say THE most. I have never had a phone that gave me so much freedom before, so much power, and such great picture quality. The biggest problems are with the battery and gimmicky features that help drain that battery. The Air Gestures and Smart Screen are for lazy people or people who like to show off, it actually takes more effort to use these than to just use the screen. Despite this, the S4 gives you endless possibilities with the most powerful and efficient mobile OS on the market.

The glass and case are pristine, its the underlying display that has cracked. Google \"S4 AMOLED crack\" and you'll find hundreds of reports of the screen spontaneously breaking. Amazon Wireless will not help you after 30 days. Verizon requires you to agree to pay $600 for warranty repairs if they deem the phone to have been abused, and other customer experiences report that they will treat any cracks, even internal cracks in the AMOLED of anotherwise pristine phone, as abuse. I've called Samsung and their policy is a bit less risky, $70-$170 or free depending on whether they believe you.

Two of these devices have no issue and we love the features but it is the one that does have issues that will do you in.As per our experience out of 3 phones 1 isn't functioning correctly. That's a rough 33% chance that you will end up with a problem like the one I am going to describe below.The Samsung S4 in question was brand new out of the box. There is a 14 day warranty that VZW provides that gives you that time to decide that you like that phone and so that there are no problems with the device. Let's face it folks it takes more than 2 weeks to start seeing problems with a device or at least to confirm it. Verizon wireless knows this or knew it at some point because that same type of warranty was 30 days a few years ago. Back to the device. This Samsung would freeze at day 20 and on every time we tried accessing the gallery or the camera. A battery would have to be pulled each time to get the phone to reset and when you go back to the gallery some of your pictures will be missing and the freeze happens again.Samsung is the only party to blame because this is their device, their manufacturing and q/a process. When you go to the store to spend an hour with tech associate to fix your phone they will determine that you have an unknown issue. They will remedy this issue by sending you a like new replacement device. We received this like new device and then within a few days the same issue has happen with freezing of gallery and camera. But here is the bonus: This second like new replacement that has been certified by VZW to be faultless and in perfect working order has just wiped blank our SD card and is experiencing the same problem as that brand new OTB device. After a week we had some free time so we trekked on back to our verizon store.The second trip was long over 2 hours in the store with a tech person who was unable to make the phone work. The result \"We will send you a like new replacement in the mail\" surely we will not have another faulty device.The replacement device arrives the next day and works for a few days. Then the gallery is not responding again. But for a even bigger slap in the face: this device froze and will not turn on again. No matter if you pull battery or not. It won't even indicate that the charger is in. Nothing, doesn't turn on or twinkle a light. Completely dead second like new certified replacement phone.Today I called customer service and was on a pointless call for almost an hour. I spoke to customer service then to tech support then to the supervisor of tech support who told me that they are sorry for all my problems with this device and they can send us a like new certified replacement phone as the only possible remedy.I'm sorry for expecting anything because there is no way they can send me a brand new phone that could possible have a 66% chance at fix my problem. The supervior's exact words were \"We don't have any brand new phones to give you!\" But they do have them to sell to you. So far the replacement like new phones that have been certified by VZW are a 100% failure to remedy my issue. The first 2 were complete failures, so how could this even be an option at this point. I am completely appalled at how Verizon has put these processes in place to make sure their bottom line doesn't shrink and to make their customers very unhappy and go through this much stress. What a shame! They were much more caring about their customers just a few years ago.

I had also considered the  Razr maxx HD, with it's ginormous battery, but I really wanted something more future proof. when I found the price of the S4 was much more affordable than I thought it would be, I decided to research it as well. being with Verizon, we were the last to get it, so that contributed to the late decision I made. fast forward to now...this phone is AWESOME. the display is beautiful, the phone performs everything lightning fast, and with a minimizing case, (spigen slim armor)feels great to hold. without a case, it's somewhat slippery, which would probably be my only \"con\" of this phone. The battery life has been well above what I expected. for example, the first day I had the phone, I turned off GPS and bluetooth, turned on power saving mode, and unplugged it at 0630. at 1130 that night, i had 40% battery left. we're talking downloading apps, watching videos on youtube, playing candy crush dozens of times, and I had 40% left.

Very fast with apps. The apps available (and automatically migrated from our Android Nexus 7 Tablets) are outstanding. Weather Radar, FreeNav USA, etc. Anything we already had installed on our tablets was instantly migrated to the S4 as soon as we went to the Play Store.2. Very intuitive to use if one is familiar with the Android O/S already.3. Outstanding voice search (google). I needed to find a UPS drop off store in another town. I was in the car, brought up Voice Search and spoke: \"UPS Boone, Iowa\". Up came a link to a Packaging store in Boone {that took both UPS and FexEX packages}, on a map and I could have navigated directly from that screen. Instead, I put the address into NavFree USA and it drove me right to it. Absolutely painless!3. Excellent tactile feedback to input, responsive and discriminating (not a lot of false data entry when typing, tapping or selecting).4. Gorgeous screen.5. Fast charge.6. Excellent Bluetooth compatibility: linked with over half a dozen devices without difficulty.7. Basic apps are useful (clock and alarms work just as one would expect)8. Multiple Home Screens make for easy app organization. I have all weather apps one one page, Playstore, Clock/Alarm, My Verizon Mobile and Camera on my \"Main\" Home Page, News apps like NY Times, The Young Turks, BeyondPod, Guardian on another page.9. Excellent battery life (as long as WiFi is turned off, and charges quickly. (under 1.5 hours for a full charge from about 20%).10. Phone coverage (Verizon) is outstanding, but Verizon always has been in our area.A Few Tips:1. Battery life is dramatically impacted with WiFi ON. When not needed, turn it off and you will get GREAT battery life.2. Get a really good/strong/armored case...don't go for aesthetics, buy a Beast. We like the Otter Defender Series. I feel safe with this case, period. Other cases I looked at were cosmetically attractive and quite obviously didn't protect from drops worth a darn. We have tile floors....end of discussion. The Otter Defender series puts the phone in a highly protective cocoon, with a very strong screen protector. It increases weight and bulk...but unlike many other aesthetically appealing cases, it actually protects your investment.3. If you use WiFi every day, be prepared to charge your phone nearly every day. We use it a lot, so charge our phones every night. One nice thing is that the batteries are user replaceable, inexpensive and readily available. You can even get a new back and an \"extended\" battery if you choose, BUT....that limits your choice of cases.4. If batteries are a problem, Sam's Club has a very nice 10,000 mah LI-Ion pack (very slim silver) for about $50.00 that you can charge via USB and will charge anything with a USB cable. This is a VERY handy device for charging multiple things. We use it for Ipod Touch, Nexus 7 Tablet, and of course, the S4.5.Lastly if you walk or run or otherwise exercise, I HIGHLY recommend the Motorola S11-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones. It is hot and humid in Iowa and walking about 5 miles a day puts a real burden on body temperature. These are very rugged, light and have excellent fidelity. They paired right up with the S4 in Media Mode. Single charge lasts several days of 2.5 hours per day use.In Summary: A great phone that is fast and versatile, requiring a rugged case and capable of just about anything sort of massage.

Until one day I went into a Verizon store and these two phones happened to be side by side. I played with both phones, their cameras, UI and features. No contest, the S4 blew me away and blew the Nokia away. I don't care that the Nokia is the best low light phone because its video and regular photos cannot touch the S4 and the UI is flat and cheap compared to Touchwiz. Then one day I heard big red was going to get the HTC one, so I figured I better try that out before I commit to the S4. I played with one in an AT&T; store, I was not that impressed. It may have more pixels that the S4 but you would never know by looking at them, the S4 has the best looking screen on the market. HTC's news feed is really not that much better than Flip board and it is better to have widget than an entire screen taken up by a news feed. The 4 ultrapixel thing is a gimmick, the HTC one can't produce near the detail of the S4 on anything more than 10 feet away. The S4 seems like a more fun phone, more fun that the HTC one and WAAAY more fun than the Iphone 5, the most boring OS of all time.Breakdown:Screen, the screen is amazing colors pop and there is no pixels to be seen, it looks like somebody printed a glossy pic on each screen.Sound, great with my skull candy, but a mediocre speaker that just sounds audible in my car.Air gestures, works very well, great for moving apps from screen to screen, nice for web use and checking your gallery.Smart view, the eye thing is a joke, it constantly loses your eyes.Features, I love the TV remote option it is so easy to set up, story book is real nice, and the multitasking and two app feature works very well.Memory, Android recently made it so you move apps to the SD card but not all of them, you can delete unwanted factory apps which is nice, but one day I am gonna root this baby!Speed and games, some lag, but moves fast and sharp even while the RAM is all used up. Games look and move amazing.Customization, no phone is better than this one for that!S-voice and Drive, S drive is great if the phone can actually hear you!!! which is rare....S-voice is garbage, one win for the Iphone and Suri.

Suffice it to say, I used those reviews to come to my purchasing decision anyway.  I was split between spending fifty bucks on an S3, which also had great reviews and had a well established track record, or two hundred on this bad boy.  I don't like being the first one buying new technology as there are almost always bugs in the system (think about all the issues each new iPhone comes with).  But after a month I couldn't wait any longer.  Most reviews were overwhelmingly positive at that point.  Many that weren't were often so inane that you had to wonder if the author was high, mentally handicapped, or an Apple plant.  So I pulled the trigger and bought one and I have been in Heaven since!I was coming from a Droid X, which was nice, but SLOW and a little buggy at times.  And the older it got the more problems I was having with it.  I liked the Motorola build quality and interface and considered the Razr Maxx HD, but all the buzz was on this phone and the more I looked into it, the more there was to love about it.  Namely:  1) the screen is big, bright, and beautiful; 2) the battery is HUGE and lasts all day (it is physically 4 times bigger than the Droid X battery); 3) the phone is very fast; 4) the S Voice app (a Siri knockoff) is cool; 5) there are many new features I haven't even begun to tinker with yet, but look promising.All in all, an excellent phone.  As this is also a very expensive phone, you HAVE to protect it against the inevitable drops.  I used an Otterbox Defender on my old Droid X and that protected me from many falls.  At first I tried a smaller case this time and a belt clip holder that could accommodate the extra size of the case.  The case came highly rated, but it was soooo small compared to the Otterbox I just couldn't imagine it handling everything I threw at the Otterbox.  So after about a week with the other case I purchased the Otterbox anyway and am glad I did.  The Defender series on this phone is actually smaller in dimensions than it was for my old Droid X.  It uses different rubber and is a vast improvement.  And I have so much more confidence in just handling my phone.

I had been relatively happy with my Motorola Droid Bionic I'd had for two years, but felt let down by Motorola after seeing the specs on their new phones - the Ultra, Maxx, Moto X, etc.  The Bionic had 1) Removable battery (I used the extended battery), 2) HDMI out (used it all the time), 3) Micro-SD slot (I have a 64GB card), and 4) the Motorola Lapdock as an option, which I bought once it came down in price to about $80.  The new Google/Motorola apparently decided that all of what I liked about Motorola phones was unimportant therefore I decided that staying with Motorola was unimportant in return. The Moto-X has some nice features to be sure, but what it doesn't have  were deal-killers for me.  And I really don't give a crap about ordering a teal phone with white accents; it's a bleeding phone, not a pair of shoes - I just want black.What I like about Samsung is 1) Removable battery, 2) Micro-SD slot, 3) multi-generational accessories 4) an eco-system of 3rd party accessories - what you get when you are a high volume phone. 5) Frequent OS updates and fixes.In terms of the device itself, it is 1) Very fast, 2) Excellent screen, 3) Very good camera, 4) Reasonable battery life.  By \"reasonable\", that is saying that it is not as long as my Bionic with the extended (2600mAh) battery, but maybe 80% of that.  But because of the removable battery, I can also go to a 5200mAh option Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** if I so choose, at the cost of some thickness.  I moved over my 64GB Micro-SD card and it picked up all my media without any reformatting. Everything else so far works well - Bluetooth is solid, WiFi is solid, the IR blaster could use a bit more juice, but does work.  In terms of all of the gadgety motion/gesture stuff,  I've turned it off - it kept picking up unintentional commands and that drove me batty.  Other things like NFC I've yet to try - this phone is stuffed with features.The accessories I've bought, like the iBOLT xProDock Active Car Dock/Holder/Mount for Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 & Note 2. Works with ALL cases. USB cable for charging., work well and are multi-generational, so I have some hope to use them with my next phone.

If not, well, see comments about Motorola above.That's all for now - I'll add more as I try more things.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why you want THIS phone in particular", "Author": "Pecos Bill", "ReviewID": "R26SZFZR0T3122", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why the Galaxy S4 and not, say, the HTC One?  I think there's two big reasons:1) You can replace the battery.  Similar to older cellphones, the Galaxy S4 continues the trend of the replaceable battery.  Actually you may not care about this if you buy a new phone every 2 years and throw your old one away but if you want to resell it or keep it longer, then the ability to replace the battery will become important -- rechargables eventually wear out.  A lot of newer phones (like the HTC One) are building the battery integrated -- you can't replace it.2) It has a slot for an SD card.  Again, some newer phones are bucking this trend and launching with internal storage but no SD card slot.  The Galaxy S4 comes with 16 GB of internal storage but also has an SD card slot.  When I upgraded from the Thunderbolt I just moved over my SD card and bam, all my music and pictures were on the card and moved with me.  It's also a lot more storage to use for videos and so forth.Incidentally, if you're on the fence about a new phone and currently have a 3G phone, you really want to upgrade to 4G if they have it in your area (which, statistically, they probably do -- ask your carrier).  4G means your phone can browse and download as fast as a home broadband connection.  It's a huge improvement and really makes the phone into a useful internet device even away from wifi connections.As for the phone itself, all I can say is I'm really impressed.  I can find no drawbacks to this phone.  I like the size, I like the feel of it, it still fits in my pocket, the battery life is good, the interface is slick and easy to understand.  I like that they added pop-up explanations for a lot of the features (but there are some that are still mysterious and you'll have to look them up to see what they do).  The Verizon phone came with \"bloatware\" but I'm having a harder time faulting them this time.  A lot of it does things I typically download apps for anyway, like turning on the flashlight or taking notes or maintaining a list of calendar events, so no irritations so far.Actually, there is one thing the S4 did that annoys me, which I'm going to list purely in the vague hope that some Samsung engineer reads it one day: they put the charging port on the bottom of the phone.  This means I can't prop the phone upright with my kickstand and have it charging, as I could with my Thunderbolt (where the charging port was on the side).Anyway, that's just a minor quibble.  Overall I'm really happy with this phone and feel it's a good upgrade over my previous HTC Thunderbolt.I've used the HTC One, HTC One X and HTC DNA a fair amount (work phones) and they don't have as many whiz-bang features but I also didn't like that I couldn't replace the battery or insert an SD card.

As with anything there are things I do not like about the phone but other people may find them useful. Most importantly this phone is fast. whether it be playing with apps or surfing the net its very fast! The WiFi also is excellent as is the Bluetooth! I love the nearby devices feature Samsungs DLNA. It took a bit to realize that photos, music and videos wind up in your gallery in the nearby devices folder. But you can share throughout your home network! Excellent! S beam is pretty much a useless feature for me This is the only Samsung product I have so sharing with another Samsung device is pretty much unnecessary. And I really dont know alot of people with a Samsung phone to make it worthwhile. NFC (near field communication) Also pretty much worthless to me there just are not alot of products out there that have this so not worth having right now. Others might find S beam and NFC very cool features though.The gallery seperates everything! camera,downloads,nearby,video,videorecord,screenshots,Facebook folders and autobackup if you have it. Basically any program or app has a folder. KIK whatever. Real nice. The camera is fantastic! Both video and still cam. Love taking snapshots while taking a video. The only thing I have had trouble with is streaming video shot from the phone camera to my tv? it keeps freezing up? but other videos stored on the phone play great? pics and music come across fantastic too! I do not like the Samsung KIES WiFi. It is basically a program that you load on your computer where you can share everything with your phone and computer. You can either USB your phone or its supposed to work on your WiFi. I cannot get it to work with WiFi? I figure a phone like this should work like a Wiz sharing files wirelessly. Why would I USB it? anyways I could not do anything over the WiFi It said my phone was connected but I could share nothing? I have plenty other programs I can use for this so no big deal I uninstalled Kies WiFi from the computer. I found it slow and buggy. Maybe thats something Samsung can work. When you can use the nearby devices to share whats the point? There is also Kies Air. It is kind of a dashboard of your phone you install on your computer. You can look at call logs send and recieve texts from any computer its kinda your phone on your desktop. I do like this however I did have a couple issues. Once its on your computer a screen pops where you have to put in a 4 digit code that is generated from your phone.The problem is everytime you use it you have to go through this? and once again this is all wireless connection and still no way to share files? The air gestures are very cool the voice commands work great and one neat thing I noticed I have a network extender at my house and the phone tells me when its connected. As far as people raving about the battery? I find it good but by the end of the day its gone. Sometimes it doesnt make it that far. The car charger is a must. So I barley scratched the surface of all this phones features and tricks it will take you awhile to figure things out but damn its so worth it!

Not so fine for someone who's used to Android looking and feeling a certain way.  It just loses that Jelly Bean experience in my opinion.  While it's not as blatantly forced as with, say, the Samsung Fascinate No Contract Cell Phone 3G Android Smartphone Verizon, it's still there and obvious.  Downloading a customized launcher like Nova Launcher or MIUI helps a lot to clean this up.  Unfortunately the Settings \"menus\" are simply horrible and unintuitive to deal with.  It would have been much better to keep with one menu rather than trying to break things out and forcing you to hunt for what you want.  The Developer option is also hidden which is the only way to disable some of the blurring and animations that slow the phone down.  I didn't see TouchWiz slowing things down at all, though.  It's just an annoying interface for those that like a customized experience (the whole reason to go Android in the first place).AUDIOSo primarily, I do Bluetooth audio.  There it does perfectly fine.  I had no issues with how the music or call quality sounded.  Where I was a bit disappointed was with the speakerphone.  It doesn't sound \"robotic\" but it doesn't sound clear, either.  Muddy is a good way to describe it.  It's a loud speaker, but just not clear.  There's a lot of distortion that happens at the highest levels.  This isn't the case on phones such as the Motorola DROID RAZR HD (Verizon Wireless), but then that phone comes with a decent equalizer.  I'll hae to get one for the S4, but I hate having to do that.CAMERAI'm quite pleased with the camera quality on the S4, both video and photo - except that I found that the Auto photo setting literally trashes the image for whatever reason.  If you want quality, choose anything else, but not that one.  HDR does a decent job, but I found that either the Perfect Face or Night settings do a better job when dealing with variable lighting.  The flash is quite powerful, capable of capturing things clearly even in the darkest of conditions up to a few feet.  Beyond that and you're of course out of luck.  As far as the video camera, both the rear and front facing do a pretty good job.  The front facing is clearer than on most phones, except that the color is muted.  Decent enough for video calls in normal lighting.  I've recorded video reviews with the S4 that rival camcorder quality in terms of clarity and audio.BATTERYBattery life under normal (i.e. you're not texting your BFF 16 hours a day) conditions can net you between 15 and 24 hours.  That's assuming you're at least partially on Wi-Fi.  Even if you're only on Wi-Fi for 4 hours out of the day, you should still be able to pull 15 hours out of the phone.  That's with brightness, GPS, 4G and Bluetooth on, mind.  I will caution you - DO NOT accept the Google Play Services upgrade.  It will destroy your battery due to a bug.CALL QUALITY/SIGNAL STRENGTH/RECEPTIONIt cannot match the sheer epic that is the RAZR MAXX HD, but it'll do.  Far better than anything Sony put out, for sure.  There's no delay, no echo, no \"robotic\" that I could tell.The two letdowns:- For the price, Samsung definitely should have thrown in an SD card.  Period.  There was no excuse for this exclusion.  If Motorola could do it with the RAZR, Samsung could and should have.- Samsung advertises \"wireless charging\", but the phone doesn't come with that capability.  You're forced to spend an extra $100 after launch (Samsung Galaxy S4 Wireless S Charger Kit (inductive type) - Wireless Charging White Cover & Pad)  For functionality that should have been included.  Worst case, include the battery cover with the phone at launch for free but then offer the charging pad for those that want it.Other than that I don't have complaints.  The people complaining about build quality are iPhone/HTC fanatics who think that aluminum is the only \"quality\".  For me, as long as the thing doesn't creak, I'm good.  This one doesn't creak nearly as bad as, say, the BlackBerry Storm 2 9550 Unlocked Phone - No Warranty.  So I'm good.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great smart phone, but FRAGILE -Protect it!!", "Author": "K. Wessling \"Wiley Retired Prof\"", "ReviewID": "R24V651ZC46D5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my S4 about 7 weeks ago from Costco.  There was a soft case provided that I was concerned about providing enough protection.  Six weeks later my concerns were justified. My phone, which was in my left front pocket, got pressure against its' face as I got out of my car and the screen cracked.  Fortunately I had gotten an insurance plan and it only cost me $25 for a refurbished replacement phone.  I learned the hard way that smart phones and particularly the Galaxy S4 are much more fragile than flip phones or phones with smaller LCD displays.  The size of the Galaxy S4 screen is a mixed blessing.  It allows a lot of viewing area, BUT it makes the phone much more easily damaged.  The large screen adds to fracture vulnerability since pressure on the screen from a hard surface (like a car door frame) can easily put enough stress on the screen to fracture the glass.  I also learned how easy it is to break an S4 just by having it in your pocket.I would suggest three precautions to help protect your S4: 1) Purchase a breakage protection plan to protect you from having to replace the phone early in your contract period for its' full price, 2) protect it with a rigid case that protects the edge of the screen from point pressure and adds resistance to the phone flexing on its' long axis.  3) If you must put the phone in your pocket face the screen toward your thigh and be very careful NOT to let your thigh push the phone against hard surfaces.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My unit was defective", "Author": "WonTonSoup", "ReviewID": "R15E2O8VV5SX47", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had a defective unit, would randomly crash and restart itself about 5 times in one hour.

I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for mediaI have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

The screen is large, bright and sharp and the software integration is wonderful. Everything is better than the Maxx except for 2 things: battery life and radio signal. I expected to lose some battery life when I moved to this phone and I did. However, it's not bad, just noticeably less. For radio signal, I like to stream music as I work out in the gym. For some reason, I don't get strong signal in my gym. In the case of my old Maxx, I could stream music or video with hardly ever getting buffering. With my S4, it do get buffering, especially when streaming video.The Maxx was constructed like a tank whereas the S4 is plasticy. After having both, I'm not convinced that tank construction is better. I bought an Otterbox for my S4 and like the feel better than the Maxx.One the plus side, the camera takes excellent pictures. The phone loads apps faster and just seems much less buggy. Configuring apps and the phone itself is much better on the S4. I also really like that the S4 has a mechanical home button instead of a capacitive button.As far as making phone calls, I think the S4 sounds excellent. I've read reports that say the Maxx is clearer and louder, but I don't agree. The Maxx may get a stronger signal but it doesn't sound any clearer. I think the S4 has more volume and sounds better. This is especially noticeable when a call is placed on speakerphone. The Maxx was loud but sounded distorted at high volume. The S4 gets just as loud with minimal distortion. I also like that the S4 phone app has large buttons for the dialpad, muting, speakersphone, etc.I believe the S4 is the best phone you can get for the Verizon network!", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen cracks easily.", "Author": "Elizabeth A OHare", "ReviewID": "RUUTSO85VCB0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very nice device but the screen cracks very easy find this very disappointing. maybe samsung should got back to the drawing board on this problem happened to my son, grandson and husband so 3 out of 4 phones had to be replaced at over a hundred dollars each.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Larry Van Syoc", "ReviewID": "R3T3BMP47YGRLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure why anyone would want to put this phone down, it is fantastic as far as I am concerned.

But my tax refund said I wanted this instead of repainting my car because I had an epiphany one morning.  I like Samsung... I own a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0\" and I had a Galaxy Stellar for a little over a year, and it served me well.  It took the extended batteries, the pocket wear with no screen protector, flying across the seat of my car, the accidental (and on purpose at times) drops from waist height, the overloading of apps I never use, the sweat and rain... But the microphone didn't work anymore and it had grown to hate me.  I woke up one day and decided to check the weather and the phone crashed and reset itself for the millionth time.  I had the overwhelming urge to throw it against the wall, stomp on the pieces, and then shoot whatever was left with a shotgun.  I didn't do any of that, because I immediately ordered this phone, which I've been wanting ever since it was announced.  Yeah, it's expensive out of contract, but I'm telling you it saved lives.Anyway, kidding aside... This phone has more than enough space for whatever you need and a bunch of crap you don't, and the quad core 1.9ghz processor is a beast compared to a lot of what's on the market right now.  I have had no problems running anything I've thrown at it so far including 3d RPGs at max settings, PS1/N64 emulators, multiple apps or media conversions...

I had an iPhone 4S and was just tired of the non-chalant iOS features....it didn't appeal to me anymore since the did the complete redo of their OS. You can't customize and there just seemed to be a boring aspect to the phone. Switching to this is like night and day. Apple sure could learn alot from Android in giving customers what they want - that seems to be a standard iPhone complaint in that people want alot of the features from Android but don't want to give up their Apple product. This phone is fast compared to the 4S but then again that 4S was 2 yrs old also which is a long time (ancient) in the electronics world. I enjoy the bigger screen and the responsiveness of it. There are some quirks I hate, like not being able to easily transition over in regards to text messages, if you had an iPhone previously then you are stuck in iMessage hell if you go to an Android device and most of the suggestions are people within iPhone need to turn off iMessage - that solution sucks cause they won't do that, I guarantee. I had an iPhone and I wouldn't do that. The other quirks I can learn to live with and aren't that big of a deal.

I came from an old Droid Razr Maxx (not the HD version).  First it doesn't lag and sputter like my Razr Maxx.  The interface is snappy and apps launch quickly.  Given how close it is to CES I predict Samsung will announce the S5 soon but if you have a phone from 2 years ago this is a solid upgrade especially if you can get it for $50 like I did through Amazon.At first I thought I'd hate this phone because the screen's a lot bigger than the Droid Razr Maxx. In reality both phones are nearly the same width across.  They sit in my hand about the same.  The difference is that this phone is taller which can make it hard to hit the buttons but you adjust to it in a couple of days.  I also have small hands so take that into consideration. If you're coming from a iPhone or another 4\" screen this is quite a bit bigger.  Despite the size it's not heavy if anything it's lighter than the iPhone 5s.Some of the nice bonuses: IR Remote control and NFC.  I've used the WatchOn app to watch TV and have used it to control Dish, DirectTV, Samsung, Sony, and Roku devices.  It was cool to tap my phone on my printer and watch it print.  Not exactly sure how useful it is but it was neat all the same.The bad:The only reason I won't give the phone 4 stars is due to TouchWiz and Verizon.In 4.3 which the phone currently has Verizon will not allow Google access to one of the chips that allows tap to pay.  When 4.4 Kit Kat is released this shouldn't be a problem as Google is emulating it with software (unless Verizon somehow disables it). In addition, Verizon has taken additional steps to make it more difficult to root this phone (SCH-I545).TouchWiz just looks too cartoonish, Folders expand in ways that take up too much space (Motorola Razr Maxx interface is better).", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Happy patron", "ReviewID": "RNRDOI5001WEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very satisfied with this product; it is as advertised.

The screen is the perfect size for me and running at 1080p it looks great.  The hardware is powerful enough to blow through games and make general phone use (even when heavily multitasking) very snappy.  Battery life isn't anything to write home about, but it's not bad either; I easily get a full day even with heavy use and can get almost 2 days of lighter use.Most of this phone's (few) flaws are software related.  Samsung and Verizon have stocked this phone with unnecessary software from extra media players to third party stores and trial software.  While this isn't anything unexpected with a contract phone on a large carrier, it's still a hassle.  I'm not a TouchWiz hater either, I like a lot of the cool air gesture and eye-tracking features this phone offers by default.  However, I knew before purchasing the phone that I'd be rooting it anyways, so these software woes were rectified without too much effort.I used Kingo Android Root to quickly and easily add root user permissions to the GS4.  Among the most essential apps for removing and taming Samsung/Verizon software are RootAppDelete and Greenify.  The 2 apps alone have made my smartphone experience far more enjoyable.  The only major downside to rooting is that you will get errors when trying to get OS/firmware updates over air (OTA).  Instead, you will have to use a computer program to either manually load a rom or use something like Verzion Upgrade Assistant (what I opt for) to update the phone via USB.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great Android phone, especially if you're going to root.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone.", "Author": "Kiel Satterfield", "ReviewID": "R2NSQE8MD24IYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is definitely one of the quickest phones I have used.

The phone itself is a really nice greyish black.  The back cover is easy to remove however, it does seem very flimsy in comparison to my last phone.

So I got Apple\u2019s #1 nemesis, the Samsung Galaxy S4. I was a little paranoid because of the large size but when I got a look at the amazing resolution of this 5\u201d screen I was sold.  The super sharp picture and fast refresh rate makes watching a movie on the S4 a very enjoyable experience. And the photos I take with my S4 are so crisp and clear with color unlike any camera I have seen on a smart phone.  I got the 32gb version then added a 32gb SD card giving me more then enough memory to store plenty of apps, photos, and video. There are so many pros with the S4 I can't even list them all.

I did the math, and the current offerings work out to be significantly more costly for my family. Not wanting to rock that particular boat, I opted to pay full price (ouch!) for a no-contract Verizon-branded Galaxy S4.Still, I wasn't absolutely sure it was going to work. Would Verizon actually give us the needed SIM card? Would they actually let us switch the equipment on the line without changing the contract? Would the S4 really perform significantly better than the old Fascinate?Happily, the answer to all of these questions was YES. We went to our local Verizon store last evening, where a nice young man named Chris was happy to help us (yes, he actually did seem happy). He was surprised that the phone didn't come with a SIM, but had no trouble finding one to install. He started up and activated the phone for us, and demonstrated some of its cool features. \"Keep that unlimited deal as long as you can!\" he said. The total cost for the SIM card, and activating the phone, was ZERO.At least a few times, my wife has been heard to exclaim, \"Wow!

Mcclure", "ReviewID": "R2BX3ZYOSZYSPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy S4 when I was eligible to upgrade on my AT&T; plan [May 2013]. I replaced a Motorola Atrix that I used for two years [April 2011].I went into the AT&T; store intending to buy an Apple iPhone 5; my wife got an iPhone in December and I liked it. The salesperson suggested that I consider some of the other newly available devices. After looking over the Samsung Galaxy S4, I decided to get it instead of the iPhone.  It was not an easy decision because the Galaxy is larger than the iPhone, and both are larger than my old Atrix. I really liked the convenience of the Atrix. I never used a case on the Atrix; just a screen protector. The Atrix easily fit in back pocket of jeans and was always easy to grab an use. The larger size of the Galaxy makes it bit more awkward to grasp and pull from a pocket, so I put it in an Otterbox case, which makes it even larger, but easier to grab and hold securely. I really like the larger screen.All \"Android\" systems are not the same. The Atrix is an Android. I really like Android Swype text entry. In some ways Swype has been improved on the Galaxy, and at the same time the new Swype is missing some things that I liked on the Atrix.There are trade-offs in picking a mobile device. Screen-size versus portability is the most difficult choice. The bigger screen [5-inch diagonal] is easier to read and touch-navigate when using the phone, but it means the device must be a little bit larger. A 4-inch screen makes a device more compact, but one needs to do more zooming/scrolling when using the device.One definite plus is battery life and device weight. The Galaxy is noticeably lighter weight than my old Atrix, and the Galaxy battery life is noticeably longer/better than my old Atrix. Even though the Galaxy has a larger screen and newer/faster processors the battery lasts longer.The camera on the Galaxy is very nice. The first day I had it I went for a walk in the woods. I saw a pine seedling growing out of a stump. I had the camera very close to the tiny seedling, just a few inches. I touched the screen on the seedling image and the focus snapped in crystal clear, then I touched the shutter button to take the photo. I did not want to zoom because I had learned on the Atrix that zoom was digital (i.e. fewer/larger pixels) and not optical. The result on the Galaxy was similar to using a macro-lens on my old Olympus SLR film camera. The resulting photo has incredible detail even though the camera was only inches from the subject. I essentially made a life-size photo of the tiny seedling in the 5-inch diagonal screen.One reason that I thought I wanted the iPhone was for Facetime. My wife and children have iPhones and Facetime is simple and automatic on Apple devices. I had expected to be able to use Skype on the Atrix when I bought it... but this did not materialize in the first few months of Atrix ownership and I gave up looking, downloading, experimenting. The AT&T; rep said there are many video-call software options that enable Apple and non-Apple devices to have video calls. I haven't had a strong enough urge to video call to go to the trouble of downloading the app; so I guess for me video call is more of a clever idea than something I really want to do or need to do. I like the usability of the larger screen on the Galaxy S4 compared to the iPhone 5 for browsing the Internet, reading/writing messages and email.My review is rambling a little; not the crisp technical review some authors write.Overall, I am satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy S4.

Just like how I met the galaxy nexus, I met the galaxy s4 online after missing a link on an Android OS fan website. I glanced at her with the tainted glaze of a man in love, but looked again at her alluring curves and quad core processor.After a few moments my galaxy nexus was wondering what I was doing, gazing longingly at another smartphone, and I closed my browser as fast as I could. Weeks later, when the galaxy nexus was recharging in the bedroom, I was able to have a free moment at the computer. I browsed in chrome to find information on this new alluring Galaxy S4 and I was perfectly surprised.LTE, super fast wireless internet1080p screen which shines with the power of the sun, and in just as good resolution for my perfect vision.She just seemed to tease me with her expandable memory, and inclusion of S voice.But just like a girl on prom night, she was the Belle of the ball, in her fancy dress with touchwiz features. Sure it looked so pretty from far away. So, glimmering, white, shiny, etc. And it drew me in with all the handy wavy features that I could wave my hand at.I went to bed that night with dreams of a better tomorrow in my future... maybe.So, when I got up the next day, and the galaxy nexus was pissed. See with this Google environment, if you browse in chrome on your computer with your Google account that you have synced to android, then that android device will know that you were looking up information on another phone. She was judging me for days, and calling me mean names about longing for a new phone that wasn't even born yet.A few weeks later, after I hadn't thought about the S4 in months, and my relationship with my galaxy nexus was going fine, there was the release date announcement. This time I couldn't contain my excitement and the galaxy nexus could tell. But this time, she was a bit more understanding. Anything that I'm passionate for, she should encourage, so long as it's healthy behavior.I should have said on the outset that Galaxy nexus and I are in an open relationship, and include other phones as guests from time to time. But this was different.Fast forward to my decision to purchase my new girlfriend, and everyone was so excited. The galaxy nexus and the s4 got along with sharing so much information about me and each other using DLNA, and NFC. And the speed of that S4, was just amazing.There's the usual, \"familiarity\" period with introducing someone new to the family like this, so I thought I'd just make a light transition, spending more and more time with the S4 everyday. Ignoring some, specific flaws in my \"love has blinders on,\" \"honeymoon,\" phase of our relationship.After a time, it was hard to ignore certain things that came up.The bloatware that can't be removed takes up space of my darling's poor 16GB of storage, leaving only about 6 GB of usable space.The smartwatch touchwiz feature is annoying after you realize how often you look away from your phone while watching a video.And the handy wavy gestures thing, is just like... getting up to that beautiful dress at prom/ball/whatever, and finding that it was indeed stitched together by some backwoods seamstress making minimum wage and clearly missed the point of some features of the dress.But, I've come to terms with her flaws. She loves me, and I love her. We're both willing to risk surgery via custom ROM to fix some more of her glaring flaws. But maybe that's down the road.

Over the years I've blamed much of the sluggishness, apps freezing, apps closing, etc to the design and coding of android.  I loved the S4 at first but once I started loading it with apps I noticed once again apps having issues and general sluggishness of the phone.  My observation leaned on widgets on the home screen running in the ui thread as being the culprit.  After talking to other android owners and researching on the net Touchwiz was pinpointed as the culprit of my woes.  Touchwiz is merely poorly written software that happens to be intercepting all the UI events and causing it to stall.  In some cases causes apps to freeze and crash.After my final months of frustration I began my search for an android replacement (I'd prefer IOS but I need a screen in the 5 inch range).  I narrowed down my search to the HTC One and LG G2.  I've been using the LG G2 for a few months now and besides having a faster processor there's little in their UI overlay software that gets in the way of android.  I've yet to experience app freezes and crashes.  On the galaxy s4 I'd even have problems with google maps freezing on me.  And let me tell you, the user experience on the G2 when it comes to performance is the way Android was meant to be experienced.It wasn't easy to come clean and admit that Samsung faltered on their execution as my friends would consider me a Samsung fanboy of sorts.  I love their tvs, refrigerators, washers and dryers... but the TouchWiz programming, QA, design teams need to actually start using their product along with their competition.  If it's slow.. makes things crash... then it sucks.As an aside, I went so far as to put the Galaxy S4 in developer mode and turned off the TouchWiz UI transition effects and that only provided a minor relief.

There are plenty of tech reviewers out there who have done full work-ups on all the different features, so I'll just hit the main points I noticed.Battery Life:The battery life is surprisingly good.  I've had a number of these types of phones before, ones that are \"cutting edge\", and most of them have terrible battery life.  I've had my S4 for almost a year now and the battery life is still very good.  I do charge it nightly, but if I forget I can usually make it almost 2 full days on the charge.  This of course assumes I'm not playing any full-screen games, keeping the screen on for any length of time, or checking Facebook (all of which significantly drain every phone's battery).  One point on this though is that I've got most of the special Samsung features like S-Voice, Air View, Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, NFC, S-Beam, Multi-Window, and Smart Stay turned off.  I do however keep Air Gestures on.  I also have Bluetooth off most of the time, only turning it on when I need it, and I use the Tasker app to automatically disable my WiFi when I'm not near known connections like my house, my friends' houses, etc.  If you keep Bluetooth on all the time, or WiFi on for the \"location support\" provided by Google, you're looking at about a 25% reduction in how long the battery will last.Samsung apps and features:As pretty much everyone that's rated Samsung devices in the last 3 years has said, just turn them off unless you're showing them off to a friend.  The \"eye detection\" that's used for the Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, and Smart Stay not only eats battery like crazy while constantly trying to locate your face and eyes, but is delayed and spotty under normal usage conditions.  The Air View and Multi-Window only work with a few apps, most of which are ones I never use to begin with, so it's not worth the battery cost and responsiveness costs of having them enabled (especially the Air View that eats even more power trying to detect your finger before it even touches the screen).  The Air Gesture is actually pretty good, depending on which ones you've turned on, but anything that involves scrolling or pausing basically doesn't work, get an app like WaveControl for that instead.  All the scrolling and pausing stuff, when it even works, only works with a few apps, once again mostly apps I never use.  The S-Voice is still notoriously bad, unable to detect almost anything correctly and having an extremely limited set of commands that can be used.  The automatic wake-up feature of it also drains battery so fast you'll be plugging the phone in for a full recharge twice a day even if you don't otherwise use it.  The contacts app was a huge step forward from Samsung's last one, actually allowing contact integration from sources like Facebook, Twitter, etc, and joining and splitting of contacts in a reasonable manner.  It still seems to have a few problems with selecting the default source for a joined contact getting overwritten by the latest data source to update (so you'll almost always see the latest Facebook picture of your contacts rather than ones from Google+ if Facebook syncs more frequently like mine does), but that's minor and can be fixed by saving the picture locally and selecting the local contact as your default.  The calendar app is also a huge step forward, integrating all your calendar sources well and providing a nice mechanism for setting all the important fields from multiple calendar sources. Somehow despite a lot of the stock app updates they provide that have better integration for the features of Android, they still have what I believe to be one of the worst launchers of anyone (the home screen settings, display, etc).  The first thing you should do is go get the free Nova Launcher, Go Launcher EX, or ADW Launcher (or any other for that matter), install it, and set it as your default.  Every launcher out there is better in almost every way from the stock one and has been since well before the S4 even came out.Size and construction:The S4 was originally touted as having a \"very large screen\", albeit smaller than the Notes do, and they weren't kidding.  The screen is nice and large, with a very good resolution display.  It's not as good as a retina display, nothing else is that sharp, but it is significantly larger.  The phone itself feels solid, and the metal bevel around the outside edge gives it that quality feel previous models didn't have.  The battery cover is very thin plastic, so thin I worried about tearing it when putting in the battery and SIM card the first time, but it holds up really well and is much more sturdy than it initially feels.  The screen is virtually unscratchable, and doesn't crack even with rough use.  I accidentally dropped my phone down an entire flight of concrete stairs a few months ago, without any case on it whatsoever, and all I got was a single crack along one corner that doesn't impede the screen at all and can't be felt when running fingers over it.  After almost a year of use, the only noticeable wear effects were on where the \"metal\" bevel edges come up to the edge of the face.  The \"metal\" parts are starting to wear off (I keep my phone in my pocket without a case so it's sliding in and out of my jeans regularly) and reveal the sturdy white plastic they're actually constructed of.Overall I would highly suggest this phone for anyone looking for a new one, even over the Note 3 that's supposedly a newer and larger screened model (mostly because of the battery life).", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Seth", "ReviewID": "R3TTVL9NZ7UIW9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Yes it could do everything as advertised but with a delay in performance.

I didn't want such a big phone, but to get the features and power that I wanted, this was the only option. (-1/2 Star)  3. Because of it's size, the glass has to be super-tensioned, which makes it prone to cracking under the slightest of adverse conditions.  I pulled mine out of my pocket one day and the glass had cracked and the LCD digitizer was non-functional. I did not drop it or sit on it.  No mistreatment, just cracks.  It's estimated that 1 out of 8 Galaxy S3 and S4 phones will crack.  (-1 Star)  4. Samsung did not honor the manufacturer warranty on defective materials and sent it back to me with more cracks than it had when I sent it to them.

Like all smart phones unless you are dealing with Motorola which are built stronger, I'd get a protective case, which aren't to expensive on amazon. I got an Iblason prime case which is fantastic. Nonetheless the phone's quad core processor is super speedy and doesn't lag often unless a lot is going on, and even then the lag is extremely nominal. One of the winning features I feel about this phone is the removable battery. After 6 months any phone's battery is going to not last as long. With many of the phone companies now with non-replaceable batteries you are screwed into a phone which becomes handicap after a year and by 2 you can absolutely notice the difference. Even though a couple phones are better than the S4 now I believe it really held its weight for months, which is not common, for example think about the new set of droids that came out this past year, which were already outdated when they came out besides having gigantic batteries which were not replaceable and would diminish over time. If the S4 goes down in price, I'd def recommend it as a still very competitive phone. Of course you'd want to get a newer phone, but for those who want a cheaper second line phone, at this time I'd absolutely recommend the Galaxy S4.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "This thing is awesome", "Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "R3SSBPSAVM6Y17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is awesome.

I normally carry it in an Otterbox Defender case, but not that night. SPEND SOME MONEY FOR A GOOD CASE. DOOOOOOO IT!While I was waiting for the warranty replacement, I used a friend's old Motorolla Droid HD and it made me aware of a few things. My first charge on the Droid lasted about 2.5 days with light use. I was amazed. Lucky to get a full day from the S4. That was the good. The bad was everything else - and I missed my S4. The resolution of the S4 screen is amazing compared to previous-generation phones. EVERYTHING is faster on the S4 from Facebook to using the internet browser. I would think any two 4G devices would get the same speed from the network, but the flippin Droid was getting about 4.5 MB on 4G whereas just now on my replacement S4 (sitting in the same chair at the same time of day, mind you) I just got 36.77 down and 21.12 up speeds with Ookla on Verizon Wireless network. I didn't even know those speeds were POSSIBLE. So I'm happy.Oh yeah, I also just ordered me a 5200 mAh extended battery for about $20. Worth a shot for that price (and a Seidio case to fit over the battery). Will review that after I've given it a whirl. Never tried an extended life battery but if ever there were a device worthy of one, this is it.My only regret is that the Galaxy Note 3 came out not long after I started my new 2 year contract...so now I want that one.

Not that I'm saying the Verizon's coverage service is bad or anything, but with all the bloatwares pre-installed and the good 'ol horrible Touch-Wiz(yeah it did improve a LOT compared to older versions).I think all that eye gesture features are just useless... I mean it's really cool for the first few weeks but after that, those features just don't come all that handy in real life situation. If there was one gesture feature that I ACTUALLY used in real life, that's probably the wave above the phone to answer the phone call in speaker phone. Besides that, I don't remember other features being useful at all. Especially the features that tracks the eye movements... it uses camera the whole time so it drains the hell out of your battery plus makes the phone slower(in my case at least. after turning it off I saw a significant battery life improvement as well as performance).Lastly, I found this phone a bit awkward to hold.Now above was all the hate part, below is what I actually liked about this phone.The screen.

Previously I had used a Droid Bionic 2, but both my husband and I's phones gave up the ghost two weeks before our contract was to renew with Verizon, so we impatiently awaited our opportunity to upgrade. My husband is a bit of a techhie, and had spec'd this phone out previously, and it met all of his qualifications. For me, it's just been awesome to use. It's got a very user friendly Droid interface, and it was easy to transfer over my songs and apps. Most of my apps work better on the S4 than they did on the Bionic - and I mostly use my phone for Facebook, texting, Pinterest, and Twitter. Nothing too fancy, but I don't have the same delays, page stalling, and forced program closures that I'd had before.My one beef is my texting app is not as sensitive to my randomness as the Bionic 2. Often it corrects words to say the complete opposite of what I'm trying to convey, and the speech to text is just awful. It is kind of fun to see what it comes up with though, if I'm trying to send a speech to text message while driving or busy. S Voice has been fun to play with as well, and she's smart enough to know that the meaning of life is 42 (and cited the correct sources as well). All in all, despite the texting snafus (which would be solved if I typed slower or took the time to stop hating Swype), it's a fantastic phone.

I am about 6 hours into the task.  Transferring files has always been easy on past phones...  But this is Samsung.  And that has been the least of my problems, although I am not happy about it.  I lost some absolutely irreplaceable footage.I bought the best phone (so I thought) because I run a business, and I have to have reliability and the best quality for speaking to vendors and customers continuously throughout the day.  I also like to use the video and camera features - and yes I like to use a lot the phone has to offer.  But of course over the past several months I have found myself using it less and less, because the features do not work.First of all forget all the fu-fu bs apps this phone offers!  The wave your hand thing over the phone (ooooh sooo cool!) is the most ridiculous, worst waste of time.  If you don't disable it, it will drive you crazy because any shadow, false move, makes the phone do something you don't want.  It is a pain in the a*****!!!  Same is true for most of those \"advanced\" features.  I won't go through them.  I tried so many that I ended up disabling for similar reasons.Allow me to tell you about the MAJOR DISASTER this phone caused me...  I use Dropbox for my business so I can work on files in multiple locations.  I also sync my phone to it so I can access a file from my phone on some rare occasions.  I never had a problem with my HTC One.  It would sync the file names to the phone and then when I would try to access the file it would download the contents.  Meanwhile any photos or videos were automatically synced.  Perfect!  Well the geniuses at Samsung have their phones programed to do things a little differently.  Without getting into the details of how it all works... I'll just give you the summarized version.  Basically, Samsung syncs with Dropbox completely, so the phone started downloading all my office files in their entirety!  Plus they have their own cloud software that links to your dropbox files somehow without you knowing it (that's another story).  To make a long story short, the phone malfunctioned and deleted thousands of my business files ON ALL MY COMPUTERS!!!!!!  I watched the files being deleted.  Within minutes thousands were gone before I could shut the process down.  If you understand a little about Dropbox, you can understand how this can happen when you have a crappy device linked to it.  In my discussions with Dropbox they explained how the Samsung programming causes this to happen.  {So, I had to work with some moron (who seemed like some ditzy teenager) over at Dropbox to recover my business files.  That took a week to get straightened out.  My business was basically shut down for a week.  Dropbox is NOT a good file backup system by the way.  I had to learn the hard way.}  SO this GD phone cost me, I don't know, maybe ten thousand dollars in lost business?So, I don't sync Dropbox to my phone.  To sync files I have to use other means ALL WHICH SUCK!!!  The Kies software is a nightmare to use!  It doesn't work and you have to install and update this software and that just to get it working only to find out that other pieces of software (explorer & firefox for example) will only work if you use OLDER versions.  I mean holy S*****!!!  WT***?One more thing to note, this is my third Samsung Galaxy S4.  Yes I have had to replace it for malfunctions and problems that were unrepairable that I have not mentioned here.  I would demand a replacement for my current handset, but I am so sick of trading out files, recreating all of my settings, and dealing with all the hassels...  I am just going to get a different phone as soon as possible.  Probably something other than Android.

I was coming from an iPhone 5 and it does not even compare. At first I was a little skeptical about making the switch but i am very glad i did. The screen on the Galaxy s4 is beautiful, every pixel just pops out of the OLED display with videos and pictures looking super crisp. The operating system it shipped with was 4.2 and has a lot of great features. I personally like the fact that I can customize the phone the way I want it, whether it be another messaging app or changing the way icons look. This is the beauty of the Android operating system. The processor and ram keep things speedy with multitasking a breeze as well as scrolling through websites. I used to have to close my apps on my old iPhone if I went above 5 but the Galaxy can handle a lot more with sometimes having open ten applications at a time and seeing no relative decrease in speed. The battery on this thing is amazing with a charge lasting well into the next day. I use the phone most of the day including playing games, surfing the web, making calls, and texts. I take it off of the charger at 9am and when I go to bed around 12am with about 40% battery left. The only drawback of this phone that I don't particularity like is the construction of the phone.

Since they asked what provider you are using it with, that should have been enough to provide the correct SIMM card.  But anyways, one of the most recent reviews told me all that I needed to do and all is well now.  That is take the phone to your local store and they will put in the SIMM.  If you don't have a local provider, I suggest you contact your mobile provider BEFORE you purchase this phone because it WILLNOT work with out a SIMM.  I hope this makes sense and will hopefully save anyone the heartache of buying a \"brick\" and not being able to use it right out of the box.I wanted a larger screen without carrying around a tablet; this is accomplished with this phone. It's not that much larger than my Rezound, but the screen size is huge compared to it.As most have also stated, the phone is VERY light, and thus, probably very easy to break! I ordered the otter defender along with this phone and it seems very adequate in protecting it from all types of damage; well common sense damage; you still can't drop in in water!You will still have to RE-download all of your apps, and reinstall them, from scratch, even if you move the SD card from your old phone to a new one.  So, before you do all this, write down all of your important data like passwords and user names so the migration is not so hard.I've made one phone call so far, and it was from NC to Ala. and also to a different provider and the quality was better than I had expected after reading other reviews.  No hollow sounds, no breakups or the such.Data transfers are super fast with this phone over my HTC.Also, the setup of things like email accounts and the such are also much easier now, but I think that is due to the software differences between both phone more than the actual phones.

I am trying to get in the habit of using the speed dial feature and Google now because if I start typing the name of someone I want to call, it will display information from one person in my contacts and a drop box next to that info when clicked will reveal the other numerous contacts (sometimes 25) I might be trying to call. This is terrible because I feel it should be predictive and remember which numbers are called more frequently and take those up to the top of the list. To Samsung's credit though I like their tab called favorites. It displays frequently contacted contacts. If the phone were able to let me choose which tab was opened when the phone icon was clicked, I would choose favorites, but as far as I know the UI won't let me. It always comes up with the keypad and a blank space above it.2.  I dislike the preloaded widgets and lock screens. The clock widgets won't let me click on them to view or modify any alarms unless I choose the widget called alarm(stupid widget which only displays which days one of my alarms is set for and the time it will go off). I was able to find an app called \"easy clock widget\". This app allows me to modify my alarms, activate the stopwatch, and start a timer. I miss being able to have the four customizable icons/apps on the lock screen. With the S4 I'm stuck with a clock and a customizable message I can add.3. The calendar widget does not allow me to swipe up and down in order to view a different month, so it makes me click on small icons in the upper corners.This link here http://youtu.be/RHIXtw34wK4 points out some other weak points about the s4 which would take me quite some time to explain on here. I decided to share my dislikes because most people have not pointed them out. In reality all the complaints I have regarding the phone can be fixed in a software update, but I feel it would be more likely they are fixed on their next galaxy s phone they come out with.  I've used the note 2 and for some reason I remember having a better UI and was just more well thought out. To me it seems this phone was just rushed out. The S4 has some new features which are not available on other smartphones yet, but when it comes to the basics, the S4 isn't so good.  So it is a great device, but not a great phone at least for me.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Took 3 different phones to get one lacking serious flaws", "Author": "Shelly W Peters", "ReviewID": "R1KQ6B8YTU18UA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a 5 star phone if you're lucky enough to get a well built one.

The motion swipe sensor did not work at all and I had to exchange it for a new one.The second phone seemed ok, but, I didn't know any better until an unfortunate drop of the phone shattered the screen. Screen replacement for these phones right after its release was running about half the total cost of the phone if bought outright. I decided to buy a new one outright from Amazon and sell the broken one.The third phone performed head and shoulders above the second and first phone. Apps loaded quickly and there was little lag time from the processor unlike the second phone. The second S4 had terrible lag times and app loading speeds. I was really wondering how this was supposed to be a flagship Android. I recently discovered the audio out jack on my third phone has some flaw where it produces static and feedback when plugged into my car. Frankly, it's not worth the trouble of setting up all my apps and screens to send it back over this issue. Luckily, one of my cars has the ability to stream music via bluetooth connection.I would have never known my second phone was faulty unless I had broken it and got a third. It's disappointing a product that has potential to be the best on the market to only be handcuffed by terrible Quality Control.I've owned multiple iPhones and Androids alike.

So far I wish I had gotten an Iphone 5. The large screen on the Galaxy S4 is nice, but what they don't tell you is that you pay a huge price in battery life. Even with the screen brightness turned almost all the way down and all unnecessary apps closed, the battery doesn't even last me a full day. And it's not like I watch videos and listen to music all day. Compared to the performance of the Iphone's battery, the GS4's blows. Also, texting on the GS4 is not as smooth as it is on the Iphone. When you use a symbol or punctuation mark (yes, some of us actually do use proper punctuation), the virtual keyboard should automatically revert back to the regular letter keyboard, as it does on the Iphone, because a punctuation mark is almost always followed by a letter. The fact that the GS4's virtual keyboard does not do this requires an extra press of the shift key, which is a big pain in the butt because it is constantly interrupting the flow of your texting. Also, the GS4 does not have a good selection of text and ring tones. They're all too quiet.Another problem I've noticed with the GS4 is the internet browser is glitchy and prone to freezing. I've had to reload pages many times because the page I was on went dead. Other disadvantages: the model that comes with the Verizon deal has only 16 gigs of storage. If you want more, you have to pay 30 to 50 dollars for an SD card. Another big negative is that there is no equalizer function for fine-tuning the sound of your music. All you can do is adjust the volume. One other thing that is very annoying is that every time someone sends me a text, I also get an email of that text. I've searched everywhere in my phone and have found no way to turn that ridiculous option off.I realize I haven't become completely familiar with all the features of my GS4 yet, but from what I've seen so far I think I'll be going back to the Iphone.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not user intuitive at all.

Go to the store and handle the phones and see what suits you. At first I was put off by size of Note 3 but I thought give it a week(you always have that grace period in which to return) after a week with the Note 3 I'm in love. Would not trade it for any phone out there even if I could get it free. On the other side... If you're happy with the size of the S4 I would still say wait for the S5 to be released.

The flimsy build/weight actually makes it harder for me to hold the phone, which seems like a dumb problem to have. It just feels like a cheap toy.Not sure I care for the software. Comes with an absolutely excessive amount of bloatware. Had four (FOUR!) pages of apps pre-installed, and you can fit 20 apps on a page. Come on. I like the whole concept of 'widgets', so that was a cool feature. For my job I often need a clock with a second hand, and phone does not have one (just a pet peeve there).As for battery life, out of the box it lasted me about a day. After twelve hours of light use the battery was at 58%. Not too impressive.Phone has a very steep learning curve - I've had to google how to do even seemingly simple things on the phone, like for example turning off haptic keypresses (phone vibrates after every keypress on a keyboard), since disabling it in the system settings didn't work (really?). It has to be disabled in at least three different places, including sound settings in the system settings, two different keyboard settings, etc. Menus are not intuitive at all. Also don't care for the phone's integration with google. It's a nice option to have, but the phone tries very hard to make it mandatory. I don't use google except as a search engine, so I don't care for the phone's pushy insistence that I use google for everything from email to music.Just overall I'm not impressed.

Already I'm plotting the unlock but that is for another day.Once I installed my credentials for Google Play it was a simple matter to go down the list of already owned apps and install them in their new home.  I restored a lot of my previous configuration from the Verizon Cloud Backup, which speeds up your process considerably.So far I have configured connection with my Bluetooth Kenwood car stereo, my corporate network and a.provided WiFi at a restaurant down the street.  Wifi signal reception was better than my Casio Commando but not quite as good as my wife's iPhone 4.  4g connectivity was a real pleasure as it left my old 3G as well as my wife's 4g phone in the dust.I will post more in about a week but so far I am quite pleased.

I liked the large screen on the phone and the ability to customize it and do things on it that cannot be done on the iPhone without unauthorized tweaks.  After several months of use and trying to get used to the S4, I have come to the conclusion that I will never buy another Samsung phone again (and I love Samsung products, just not its phones).First, with all of the features, the phone is very sluggish.  It takes several seconds after you disconnect from a call to transition to a new screen so that you can use the phone for something else or so that you can initiate another call.  The iPhone is much smoother.Second, if you are driving, it is almost impossible to quickly and easily dial a number or click on a previous call or favorite to dial.  You have to click on the name, then tap another icon.  The swipe feature absolutely stinks!  It rarely works and sometimes it engages but then disengages and does not initiate the call.  The iPhone is much better in this category.Third, the phone takes a few minutes to connect with the bluetooth in my car, so that using my car's bluetooth features with the phone is irritatingly difficult.  This was not a problem with the iPhone.Fourth, when negotiating through text messages, with the lightest touch, calls the person you received the text from.  Very annoying!Fifth, the buttons on the side of the phone are in the worst position possible.  If you are using the phone to browse the internet, read an email or watch a movie, you will most likely tap one of the side buttons (located on the length side of the phone), thereby causing the screen to go blank.  Hate this!Sixth, the calendar is not nearly as good as iPhone.Seventh, if you have office email that is not on the gmail platform and a personal gmail account, you will need two icons to access the email accounts.  The iPhone allows you to combine the emails under one icon.Eight,  the notifications for missed calls and missed text messages do not popup or show on your locked screen.  Instead, you have these little icons on the top of the screen that do not stand out well and that do not give you very specific information like who the call or text message was from.Ninth, when you have voicemails, there is no clear and obvious indication on the voice mail icon that indicates how many messages you have.  You have to click on the voice mail icon and then check to see how many voice mails you have.  The iPhone voice mail system is a lot easier and better.All in all...I recommend trying another Android phone if you like the Android platform or just get an iPhone.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I want to love it -- but flawed", "Author": "K.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now. But apparently the DHS and FBI just noticed this summer. \u00b5", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S4, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00HWEK39K"}}
