The centro is a great phone with the right software. Palm OS was ahead of its time and the only Mobile software that came close to a desktop version. Palm only draw back is they never package their phone with a 5\" or over screen. These are the some of the software that make this phone great; Agendus, TakePhone, Splash wallet, OfficeSuite, yourCall etc. The best in my view is award winning Agendus which puts your contacts, To Do, Calender, Stocks, Weather, notes and all messages under one roof. This is go to phone to check my busy schedule. I am going to get another so when this one is finish I have back up.
