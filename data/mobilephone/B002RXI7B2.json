{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Do NOT buy on pain of death!", "Author": "Axel", "ReviewID": "R1MTF99KR71VYJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After owning the debacle that is the NoKia N97 for several months, I felt a longing to return to simpler, easier to use and more reliable but feature rich handsets that Nokia used to be very well known for, and were actually pretty good at making. Remember that word 'reliable' for now, as I'll come back to it. But basically,  every time I had to pull out the heavy, bulky, temperamental N97 from my pocket, and wait for its glitchy, lazy software to figure out what I was trying to do at that moment in time, I became more and more resentful of it and realized that sometimes, \"smart phones\" are anything but. I longed for the simplicity and beauty of Nokia's 6230,or 6230i, or 6233 days, when phones did everything you could want them for and didn't require several Phds to operate. In my search, I came to rest upon the Nokia 6700 classic.I'll confess - I was hooked almost from the fist look. It's stainless steel body, it's cool, classy candbybar form with rounded edges and its simple, yet striking front plate communicated a seriousness and promised a robust, straightforward experience. A quick glance through the feature list and I was hooked. I had to have it. I had dreams of abandoning my N97 to my underwear drawer, possibly only to be liberated in times of desperate need when a back-up handset might be helpful for a trip, but determined not to sell it to anyone, as I knew in my soul, I could not wish the N97 disaster on my own worst enemy. In one amazing spec sheet, Nokia had promised redemption and I was eager to give it to them.To be fair, I was warned. Even though I had committed to buying, I raked the internet for reviews. \"Temperamental\" they warned. \"Unreliable\" they screamed! \"Daft\" they exclaimed. I read them all but was unmoved - mine would be the exception, rather than the rule. Mine would defy the expectations, and work well without glitch or incident, for after all, this was Nokia, and Nokia could not let me down so utterly, in such quick succession, with two different products... not me; a fervant, loyal, reliable supporter and purchaser of their products for the last 10 years, without interruption...I've owned the phone for less than three months, and here's the facts: before it just stopped working, the phone would get impossibly hot during phone calls using the headset. It would routinely drop calls for no discernable reason, headset on or not, and when it was offended by your reaction to it doing so, would actually turn itself OFF during phone calls to drive the point home. The phone doesn't have a 3.5mm jack (which I knew when I bought it) so is not terribly good for listening to music or plugging into a car radio, and for reasons which shall always escape me but which shall likely fascinate me to the point of distraction till the day I die, Nokia made it so that the radio could not be played over the loudspeaker!!!!So, you can't play the radio over the loudspeaker.... and it doesn't work very well, for MAKING PHONE CALLS!!!!Oh, Nokia, my once beloved Nokia, whyfore art thou a hopeless gaggle of idiot savants and social maladajusts? Where hast your dependability gone? Why hast your basic five-year-old-knows-better-by-now-common-good-sense abandoned thee?Then, about a month ago, it just turned off, and hasn't come back on since. Despite everything I've tried. And tried. And tried. And keep trying... sigh.So then, the worst insult of all - reluctantly, and with a heavy-heartedness such as I have not felt since, well, watching Episode 1 for the first time, I reopened my underwear drawer... and had to go back to my N97! Oh, the humanity.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, AND IF IT'S GIVEN TO YOU, THE PERSON WHO DOES SO DOESN'T LIKE YOU! I've given it one star because Amazon will not permit me to give it less!DO.NOT.BUY.THIS.PHONE! DO.NOT.ACCEPT.IT.AS.A.GIFT. STAY WELL CLEAR!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why Doesn't America Have Phones Like This? !!", "Author": "Karl Huddleston \"A/V Nut\"", "ReviewID": "RI9SWXAYC19WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To call this phone awesome would be the understatement of the year!  Hands down the most amazing phone I've ever used and I've only had it a week!Before I get started let me say that this is a European phone that is unlocked and I am using it in Provo, Utah in the U.S.  I have 4 lines on my AT&T; account - 2 for me and my wife and 2 for my daughters.  I upgraded my wife's and my phone in January.  We each got an LG Xenon (one blue, one black).  2 weeks ago my wife decided her phone might work better if she put it in a half-full Wendy's Frosty cup for about 3 minutes(!) She was wrong.... :)I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it thoroughly - got it all back together and everything worked perfectly except the microphone - no one could hear her.  So, I didn't have any more upgrades available with AT&T; and frankly I am tired of renewing contracts and being perpetually in servitude to them; I decided to buy my first (almost) full-priced unlocked phone.Enter the Nokia 6700 Silver.  I looked around for quite a while and decided this was what I wanted.  After using a qwerty keyboard for 5 months - I decided that they weren't any quicker or easier than a regular dial pad for texting.THE DESIGN: This is not your normal cheap plastic (American?) phone.  Almost the whole body, including the battery cover, is metal.  And you can feel it in the weight - which I really like.  The keys are textured nice and have a solid feel when you press them. I have average sized thumbs and find I can text easily and quickly. The micro SD card installs under the battery cover near the SIM card - so if you're someone who might remove yours frequently, that may bug you. The battery cover is on solidly and it does take a firm push to slide it off.I like that it can be charged with the included regular charger or with a mini-USB cable type charger.  NOTE: If you buy this to use in the U.S. be aware that the included charger has a European type plug (round tips) and NO adapter for U.S. plugs is included.  So I had to run down to Radio Shack to pick up a Euro - US adapter for only $10.  No big deal.FEATURES:  OK - can someone please tell me why American cell phones don't have nearly half the features that Euro phones seem to? This thing is so flexible and configurable that I'm still going through it!  It's really advanced and I love it - it's like anything you can think of that you might like to adjust to your taste (menus, colors, fonts, sounds, on and on) can be adjusted.  It's absolutely amazing!  As soon as I got, I slipped my SIM card in and it just worked beautifully.  The volume of the speakerphone will blow your mind!  The first time the phone rang - my wife thought I had the TV on!  I'm not hard of hearing but if you are, this is your phone!The look and feel of the phone is just really classy and top notch.  It's nice and thin and small, but not too small to use comfortably unless maybe you have HUGE hands....It has a 5(!) megapixel camera that works really nice.  I tried to text a picture today but it wouldn't send it - just kept saying \"check settings\"; apparently I have to call AT&T; and have them configure this phone for MMS messages.  Has voice-dialing, audio and video recording.One of my favorite features is the motion sensors that are built in.  If you're receiving a call and you want to silence the ring - just double-tap the phone either on the front or the back.  Want to reject the same call? Just double-tap it again.  If the phone is in stand-by mode and you double-tap it, it displays a gorgeous analog or digital clock (your choice) for a few seconds.  Genius.I do find that I'm always rubbing it on my shirt to buff off the finger prints - so if you're someone who would be bugged by that - you may want to consider the black version of this phone instead of the silver one.  But the silver one is beautiful.  If you want to be really gaudy, there is even a gold version ! :)Anyway, so far I'm in love with this thing.  I can't figure out why phones of this quality aren't offered in the US markets?  It seems like we get the turd end of the litters... never again will I sign a contract and never again will I buy a locked phone.... I wish I had done this years ago.  So worth the money!Sorry for the long-winded review - hope this helps.ThanksKarlUPDATE: I have been unable to send or receive MMS messages and AT&T; was unable to determine the issue.  I don't know if there's a fix for this or not.  But be aware that if you send pics via text message frequently, you may not be able to with this phone if you're using it in the U.S. with AT&T.; It's not a deal breaker for me since I rarely send MMS messages.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "maruskasvobo", "ReviewID": "R2HLBZF61LHG2Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "phone has arabic letters which you can't see when you are buying, and some optoinals that you can find in classics nokia 6700 phones you aren't (?) with this versionNokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition Unlocked Cell Cellular Mobile Phone EDGE and GPRS GSM New", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "chas", "Author": "Charles Russell", "ReviewID": "R1NY0N2SWTOAOO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "excellent phone/camera etc.best nokia i have ever had - on my 5th one in 10 years so i am brand loyal.only complaint is the keypad which i am still trying to get used to after 1 month.numbers are not raised up and you have to push harder when texting", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 6700C", "Author": "Joshua W.
