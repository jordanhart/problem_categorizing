{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Android powerhouse with exciting screen and uninspiring design", "Author": "Hendrik Delagrange", "ReviewID": "R6V1F13SLHTLI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an upgrade of the well-known Galaxy S. It has a faster processor and a better battery.The most important point of this smartphone is it's screen (even if it is \"already a year old technology\"): it is vivid, bright and has a lot of contrast. Black is really black - it is hard to see the difference between the black of the screen and the black of the bezel. Probably that's why a lot of the apps have a black background. It is also very sharp so all the fonts appear neat and crisp. It's more colourful but just not that sharp as the Retina display in the iPhone, though you have to examine closely to notice that. Even after a few months the screen continues to please. The 4 inch size makes it just that bit bigger than most other smartphones, which is comfortable and makes a lot of what is on the screen better legible, but it is not as 'huge' as the Galaxy S II, if that is of any concern.I can't compare to the previous version of this phone, but feels powerful in use. All apps that are currently available run smoothly even on this single-core processor. There's also a lot of internal memory available, so you can comfortably install a lot of apps without worries. Call quality is excellent, FM-radio is one of the best available, the 5 MP camera is good, battery life is a bit better than on most smartphones.The phone is made of plastic. That might give it a cheap look, but once you hold it, it is so light that you easily accept that trade-off. Oddly enough, even in this plastic shell to some people the phone looks classy and premium. Probably because of its size. It's not really a beauty. As good as the internals of this device are, the bodywork is quite deprived from fantasy and exciting design. At this pricepoint and for this size (4 inch) there aren't currently that much good looking alternatives though. Still, the uninspiring looks is the first real disadvantage - but tastes differ.The other real disadvantage is that the S Plus probably will never get Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4). It's older sister Galaxy S (9000) won't, according to Samsung because of hardware limitations. That means they probably won't put any effort neither in adapting the mostly identical software for this version (9001), even though the hardware should be perfectly capable of running ICS. That is all guesswork from my part, but if you really want ICS, you should look into this further.All in all, it is easy to understand why the previous version was such a huge succes and still flies off the shelves today. If you want a somewhat bigger screen but not a 4.3\" like the Galaxy S II, are ok with the looks of it and willing to accept the that it likely won't get ICS, then you will appreciate it's feel, speed and most of all outstanding screen every time you grab it out of your pocket.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R3HO63QDDOSSPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone it's awesome. It has a unique styling with sober beauty.It's lightning fast! The new overclocked processor that Samsung installed for this model of the Galaxy S it's working perfectly! It has run every app I installed.Gingerbread it's very user-friendly, has a intuitive interface with easy to use features. Runs smoothly.The obvious advantage it's the Super Amoled Screen, its color and definition are superb, it's like the Sun!The only flaw it's battery life, but I come to understand that is a very common issue in almost every smartphone.The camera doesn't have a flash, but that's no problem since camera phone flashes are not that good, unless their are Xenon flashes. Picture quality is very nice in the 5MP format and the Widescreen 4MP, 720p video recording it's a very nice feature, in my opinion a must have in today's phone market.I'm very much pleased with my acquisition, highly recommend Wireless Everything seller, the only issue with the item I bought from them it's that they sent a broken AC adapter, because it has a European type plug. Nevertheless it's not that hard to find a new one.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nota: Prob\u00e9 este tel\u00e9fono con Movistar en Venezuela, levanta 3G y H perfectamente.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "tjza1", "ReviewID": "R217HQCSJ90K03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was us describe new in box the only problem i wish if you guys have parts for this phones for example original battery cover that can be purchased by people that are selling them otherwise great shopping tru you", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "I really love it.", "Author": "SYED  M  TARIQ", "ReviewID": "R1LT3ZVUWO241V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone because it works like a high end phone.

A couple weeks after having the phone it would suddenly just power off over and over again, It will randomly stop charging, battery was replaced after a couple months and continues to only charge occassionaly. Recently it will now only charge through the computer usb it will not charge through a wall charger. My husband travels so this has been a great frustration to him. The phone also has trouble connecting to bluetooth devices such as a portable in car speaker device that was purchased for hands free use. I have been a satisfied customer of Amazon for many years and this was my first bad experience. I should have returned the phone early on but thought that the problem was our unfamiliarity of using an andriod phone.
