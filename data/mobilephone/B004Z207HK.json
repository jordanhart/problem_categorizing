It is relatively small and light making it easy to carry.  The display is very readable even outside in the sun.  Call reception is very good and voice clarity at either end is very good as well.  Auto rotation lags a bit and sometimes needs a little prodding.  Battery life is great.  The camera is good with resolution and clarity more than acceptable.  Picture colors can be a little washed out as the auto white balance sometimes has trouble.  I've taken to Ace to Germany and Austria and had not trouble connecting overseas cellular services.  Very seamless.  To date I have not been able to wirelessly connect to my home network and download/upload files.  I must connect via USB and use the Kies software which is really clunky.  But I'm still learning.

I had bought the international version in UK last year. It should say  GT-S 5830 i  and not L or anything else. The international version is really the best one and very high quality compared to what is sold here in USA as international version. Beware people !  Most importantly keep in mind its internal memory is very limited 150 MB. It will not allow you but some very small apps to work on your phone. And if the phone does not have at least 35 MB free in internal memory it locks up slows down, goes crazy. a 16 GB external sd card will not help internal memory at all because most apps still require 3 to 5 MB on internal memory. So you have a good phone ! but very limited resources for apps. Worst of all. There is NO WARRANTY !  on these phones.

This is the iPhone copy that has more screen space, less weight and softer feel.People talk of battery life but if you don't have constant updates of all your things (Facebook, email, etc.), I have had my battery last 4 days with not much use (some txting, calls and emails), 2 days with heavy use. I use my phone to call and txt, WhatsApp txt, and check Gmail; I'm not a Facebook maniac, play games (except chess), and have to be constantly checking it; nor do I browse that often on it. I use it to calculate things, unit conversions, read newspapers, translate languages.But you have to take care of your (any) battery: over charge the first charge, you don't let the battery die completely (turn off before that), and after it gets to 100% charge, you disconnect the charger. Anything else you'll kill how long the battery will last.Never thought that I would worry that much, but the camera is great for just 5MP, taking great, vibrantly colored photos. The flash is very strong and works great with a Flashlight App. I love the panoramic shots.You do have to buy the correct version  for your country to get the 3G features.

However, the phone will recognize up to 32GB's of storage but you will probably need to root your phone in order to move apps to SD card.
