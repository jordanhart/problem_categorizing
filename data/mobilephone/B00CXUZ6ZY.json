I do not have a data plan I have pay as you go (don't need to be \"connected\" continuously to the internet). Texting is great with the qwerty keyboard. I just want a phone that texts and calls and is small in size to fit in my pocket.  This phone also makes calls over Wifi so when I don't get a mobile signal if I'm traveling, I connect it to my Myfi.  I can't set up the email account since I don't have data but who cares!  I check my emails on my computer anyway.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as Expected.

WHEN I TRIED TO UPDATE MY BLACKBERRY WORLD IT SHOWS 'MODE NOT AVAILABLE'. WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK UP WHY I CAN'T LOGIN TO MY BLACKBERRY ID IT ONLY SAID 'HAVE TO TRY AGAIN' WITHOUT GIVING ANY USEFUL SOLUTION. I MEAN, WHY DON'T BLACKBERRY MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOES WELL WITH THIS MODE BEFORE SELLING IT????I CAN'T BELIEVE I SPENT $160+ AND ENDED UP GOT A PIECE OF TRASH.UPDATE: After wasting one whole afternoon trying to fix it, I almost gave up and decided to return it. I removed the battery and put both the phone and the battery to the box so that I can return. Then I realized I just can't afford more time choosing another cell phone. I put the battery back and tried to give it another chance. After that it worked. I did try to restart it before deciding to return it, but never took the battery out.The only reason I'm still keeping this phone is I can't afford wasting more time choosing another phone, that's it.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CXUZ6ZY"}}
