{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for the money.", "Author": "squashpup \"squashpup\"", "ReviewID": "R2UBALZNGBM6A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife ordered this phone in a package deal from HSN to replace the worst phone in the world, a Samsung t528g. The LG is a good smartphone and plan for people who aren't bleeding edge early adopters.  The price is right and the phone is a quality piece of equipment.PROS:  Touch screen is nice, the equivalent of my wife's iPod. Very easy to use. The screen resolution is good, but not a super high resolution whatever display.  It does very well for everyday use, though, and is nice and bright. It holds signal well, audio is clear, storage is expandable with a card slot. It comes with a lot of apps by default, including Google Play. It is great for texting, talking and looking up the occasional web site.  It is sleek and compact, and looks much more expensive than it is. Net10's fifty dollar plan (forty five if you register a credit card and auto-pay) is unbeatable for those who would use large amounts of data. As I understand it, if you add another phone on the same Net10 account, you can get an additional five dollar discount per month. Plus, coverage seems to be darn near everywhere. It certainly doesn't look like a prepaid phone, and nothing about it indicates that it is.CONS: Camera is so-so; in good light it takes good pictures, but sometimes indoors, the pics are a little grainy. A flash would help. Video is the same...good enough for documentation purposes and clear enough to watch without irritation, but definitely not HD. Data seems a little slow; as I understand, this phone runs on Edge service, which isn't the fastest.  But, non-power users probably won't worry too much. Also, this phone will ONLY work with unlimited plans...after she got it, my wife decided it might be overkill, but she can't downgrade to the 750 minute plan without also switching phones. Make sure you really need unlimited everything before you take the plunge.CONCLUSION: I haven't bought a bad LG phone yet, and I've had several...in fact, I just ordered another LG phone (not the 35g) for myself.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "SaraJ89", "ReviewID": "R17YZ0KALXLB1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some of the reviews on here make me laugh. I'm a PR student in my senior year and I am one of the few that have a pre-paid android in a sea of expensive iPhone contracts. I often use my phone for in-class assignments and looking up contacts via Google. First of all, this phone is a mini computer, therefore you must treat it as one. Go through and clear your old emails, cache and browsing cookies. It frees up a good amount of space and you will hardly see the \"phone storage low\" message. Second of all, battery life runs low if you keep your phone connected to wifi constantly. TURN IT OFF WHEN NOT IN USE! It takes all of two seconds to turn wireless on and off. Third of all, for the price I can not complain much about the only decent camera and resolution. In auditoriums, I get faster service than my fellow PR students with iPhones! The only thing I will agree with most is the out of country tech support. Speak slowly and clearly.

I am not one to play games on it but love that i can listen to Pandora. I can watch youtube videos and have great service where others around me can't get any. Texting is very easy to do and for the most part operating the phone is very easy. I tried several phones before settleing on this one. Can down load lots of ringtones for free as of now the only thing I guess I could complain of is that I can't down load scramble with friends or draw with friends which alot of family have but that doesn't entirely bother me as I don't really have time for that. I have down loaded some games for my Grandson to keep occuipied when we are out and he is happy with them such as the talking animal ones and angry birds. I would not recommed to people who are looking for a phone to play alot of games on. But if you like to listen to music or look up things online it is fast and easy to text and overall setup.

When I bought it I lucked out as it was on sale at a special promotional price of 39.88!!  I couldn't believe it,  the listed retail price is 89.99 on Straight Talk's website! It has the look, feel and performance of an Android 2.3 that you would think costs well over 100.00.  It streams youtube, tune-in and iheart radio flawlessly (never buffers)!  Battery life is much stronger then other android phones I have owned and it charges fast too. The one drawback to this phone is the camera is not the greatest sharpness but that is no huge deal with me. This phone is still somewhat new so accessories take quite a bit of looking around to find but they are out there (amazon).  Bottom line....  this is the cheapest android phone I have ever purchased and it has performed the best and seems to have the best quality compared to more expensive Straight Talk android phones I owned in the past that ended up disappointing me.

Marsh", "ReviewID": "R3KTSPHMLZJTQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 1st smart phone. We were content with our $30/month plans with plenty of minutes. But wife's Samsung had the weirdest problems that would be too much of a hassle for Tracfone/Straight Talk to ever reconcile. Saw this phone for $80 in a store. At $65 on Amazon made it even better. For only $15 more each/month (family auto enroll plan gives discounts) we have unlimited everything on ATT network (via Net10) with some great apps.Phone is so easy to use. Never thought I would like a touch screen with my larger hands, but this one is great. On the smaller side than most smartphones... something I like. Fits easily in any pocket.My deciding factor in my frugal perspective was Google Nav. It has far exceeded what I hoped for in a Nav. Loved my Garmin, but always froze, screen would stay black, car charger mount connection broke... And so many units have so many complaints still. Google Nav is amazing.Just to have this phone with wifi only and no service is great! Apps still work,Only complaint: memory. Androids have a system memory that limits how much you can add to it. There is plenty of Internal memory, but apps still take up the System Memory which is only about 160MB which I have almost used up. The Internal Memory of 1GB still has about 700MB left, but it doesn't matter. My 4GB external memory SD card that came with it is near empty. There simply is absolutely no way to store your apps on the SD card.But the phone is only $80 retail. If you need more memory for Apps, you probably want a more expensive phone anyway.So Tracfone/Net10/Straight Talk (all under Tracfone, yet different divisions) can provide you with ATT/TMobile/Verizon/Sprint service so cheap, they outsource. That is the biggest complaint IF a problem occurs. It is a pain. But my patience and frugality has helped me overcome that barrier to enjoy great cell service at a much better value.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "lg optimus logig", "Author": "thadoctas", "ReviewID": "R3GHUBWX2AMBRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first smart phone and its more than i expected.instantly watch youtube,stream videos,music,play games,download,and a lot more.i was iffy about touch screen texting(i wanted the actual keypad) but its actually really easy and responsive.i got mine at walmart for 79$ and my wife wanted to see why i was on it all the time.long story short...i ordered her the white one so i can have my phone back.you can do anything a pc can do.plus more (phone features).it hasn't dropped any calls, decent camera, good video quality,comfortable and solid build.i would def recomend to anyone.i have mine thru net10 btw.if u have any questions u can email me at thadoctas@gmail.com. this gets 5 Out of 5!!!", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful alternative to the expensive IPhone!", "Author": "Angela Blizzard", "ReviewID": "R29EVZ9NKD00N8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got 2 of these for my teenage daughters and they love them!

I haven't had it a full 6 weeks and am already experiencing problems.  This phone was supposed to be an upgrade. HA!!!  What a disappointment!So far I've had to take the battery out 7 times in the past week for it to turn on.  I can take the battery out full and slip it back in and it shows half power left. It's frustrating.  The only good thing about this phone is the ability it HAD for me to watch youtube movies and videos without it freezing up.  Now, it'll get through more than half of a youtube movie and BOOM, the big freeze, take battery out, and reboot.UPDATE :I'm still not happy with this phone .  A lot of youtbe videos sho w up as \"unsupported\". That means I can't watch them.  The MP3. player is ridiculous._Try getting your music to loop and play randomly . It's not gonna happen for you. The volume sucks.. Is anybody else as disgusted with this phone as. I am?  I really feel ripped off. Oh and forget loading more than 3 applications . My phone always shows \"storage space is low\" with only 4 applications . Yes, 4!!!UPDATE:Okay, so previously I was complaining about the app situation.  I resolved that problem on my own and was able to load about 12 apps.  Try getting a straight answer from net10 Tech Support.  I dare you.Now here's another bag of horrors to report.  For three days I could not get network connection.  Yes, I allowed it to go on for 3 days.  Why?  I've given net10 Tech Support far too many hours of my life already and was trying to wait it out.  Finally after 3 days, I had to bite the bullet and call.  I broke out in a cold sweat and my stomach started churning as I gingerly tapped each number.  Guess what, the first woman I attempted communication with (she spoke broken English) had me completely erase the phone and return to factory default.  Still didn't work and the witch hung up on me. 3 1/2 hours and 8 calls later, problem still unresolved.  Needless to say, I am LIVID.  I'm out the cost of the phone, frustrated, ticked off beyond my comprehension, angry enough to Three Stooges slap every Tech at net10...exhausted...you name it!!!  I'm there!!! I'm FED UP WITH THESE INCOMPETENT CLOWNS that ALL SPEAK BROKEN ENGLISH and are of NO HELP AT ALL!!!  I'm switching to another service.  Any other service will do.  I'll even pay more money per month just NOT TO BE IRRITATED BY NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING KNUCKLEHEADS...okay, I gotta let it go...whew! Oh, and do you think they're going to re-imburse me for the time my phone did not/does not work...hehehe...silly you...silly me...silly AMERICAN!!!If I could give this piece of garbage NO STARS I would do it in a heartbeat.  I hate this phone.  I feel even more ripped off than ever before. Net10 should be ashamed of themselves for selling this piece of garbage and their pitiful, ridiculous, disgusting, customer service!!!

A definite upgrade over the old flip-phone I had.  Main reason for upgrading was that I do a decent bit of texting and I needed something with a keyboard as the old \"morse code\" way was was getting really old!Uses an older version of Android and a lower-resolution screen and it shows.  Rather limited in memory which limits how many apps you can install.  Kind of slow at times too.  Gets weird occasionally where I will click on someone's name in my call log to call them back and the phone dials someone completely else instead...happens with text conversations sometimes too.My biggest gripe with this phone is the camera.  It is pretty much useless.  You can forget about indoor shots.  There is no flash and worst of all there is no way to focus!  You're at the mercy of whatever part of the scene the camera thinks it should focus on.  3 Megapixels would be fine with me, but the poor sensor, no flash and lack of focus options make the camera just about useless.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a good smartphone", "Author": "Matt S.", "ReviewID": "R2QQDKAF724M7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Shipping took forever.

The phone has some great features:- small form factor- fast user interface- rock-solid bluetooth- a REAL GPS chip built into the phone  with built-in Google maps and navigation- loud ringers you can actually hear- very good battery life- simple power management icons- up to 5 screens of appsTwo more excellent features I want to comment further on. First, is the VOICE features of the phone. Voice dials work flawlessly for dialing contacts, and the built-in Google voice search feature lets you SAY what you want to find in Google and then the browser comes up with the search results without you typing a thing. But the coolest and most useful feature is the ability to SPEAK to create the contents of text messages just by pressing the microphone button on the pop-up (soft) keyboard when you're creating a text message. That feature alone has saved me HOURS of needless typing and correcting and Googles voice engine translates almost perfectly.The other great feature is how well the Bluetooth (BT) works. Unlike many previous phones with Bluetooth, this phone works flawlessly with my VW infotainment system. I stream Pandora radio over BT without issues, the phone directory loads almost instantly when the connection is made, and it disconnects instantly when I disconnect a call from my entertainment console.Now some things that could be better:- the built-in speakerphone is fairly quiet- the soft keyboard clicks when you type it(though I finally found where you can turn that off thankfully)I bought the GSM version of the LG L35G to use on Net 10.

I thought that maybe the other reviewers had just gotten a lemon, but this phone is worse than a lemon.My dad's old flip phone bit the bullet, so we thought that he should upgrade to a smart phone. We didn't want to have to sign up for those expensive contracts, and couldn't afford to buy a $400-$600 phone. I had found this one, and it seemed to be the cheapest phone I could find that still let you download and use apps. He didn't need it for much. The Net10 deal we got with buying it really made it worth it. He could get unlimited talk, text, and data for $50 dollars a month, and they knocked $5 off (for something I forget.) Each added line would only be $45, too. This was so much cheaper than the plans you see where you're tethered to a certain carrier. Too bad the deal was wasted on this piece of crap phone.When he had first activated it, everything was fine and dandy. But as he started using it more and more, the stupid thing kept acting up. It wouldn't turn on quite a few times, and I had to remove the battery for it to work again. Now, when it turns on all the apps that he downloaded don't show up. We can't even access the settings in order to delete anything in the hopes that that would fix it. It did this before, but eventually the apps came back. I've turned this thing off and on and removed the battery a million times and still nothing.As for memory, this phone has jack. You read the specs and see that it comes with a 4gig SD card and you think \"Oh that's a lot of memory! That's probably all I'll need!\" Wrong. The phone's internal memory only has like 200mb on it, and you have to go through that in order to move anything from the internal memory to the SD card. So you're well out of luck if your memory is full and you want to add something straight to the SD card. If you can even move any of the app's data to the external memory in the first place. It doesn't help that Google has to include all of this bloatware wank that you probably don't need, and absolutely bars you from deleting it (Google Books, Google Music, Google Bullcrap). I'm so close to hooking the phone up to the computer and just deleting this junk manually. That would probably lock the phone up, but it's not like this phone is anymore useful in its current state.If I had the ability to give this review a negative amount of stars, believe me I would. I have it on the charger now, but I'm so fed up with it that I want to throw it out the damn window and take a flamethrower to it. That, or slam dunk it into the trash where it belongs. I'm never buying from here again. I might as well just take my money and put it in the garbage disposal.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "MY MOTHER LOVE IT", "Author": "MiSs JaCqUeLiNe", "ReviewID": "R222YWXGE22X4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE IT VERY MUCH AND MY SISTER & MOTHER  DO AS WELL WE WILL SHOP AGAIN VERY SOON AT THIS PLACE OK!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LIKED THIS PHONE, BUT IT WASN'T THE MODEL THAT I ORDERED!", "Author": "CINDY REYNOLDS-DALTON", "ReviewID": "R10EC8GJMS2GMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "GREAT PHONE, JUST THE WRONG MODEL WITH THE WRONG FEATURES THEN THE PHONE THAT I ORDERED.SINCERELY,MS.

While the screen is small, it is clear and sound is good, too.When a person activates the phone with Net10  the sim card runs on AT&T.;  But I am not using it as a cell phone, so I can't address that issue.  I do not require another cell phone, and read reviews of people unhappy with customer service.  All I needed was to use it on wireless for the internet searches.I am very happy with this device and enjoy my late Christmas gift.  I have used it for about two months.  I am a new android user and both touch screen and typing work well.  Mistakes are easily corrected. This is considered by some to be an entry level device.

I bought the phone thinking I'd have a smart phone that I could use with a prepaid plan.

But no - if you buy this phone you can only use it if you purchase the $40 monthly plan. So I'd have a monthly bill. How is that prepaid? I hope I can return it.Even if you do want a monthly bill don't buy this phone. The main feature I wanted from this phone was music but the volume on it SUCKS.

There is very little system memory so you have to be sparse in what apps you add, unfortunately there doesn't seem to be many apps out there that let you move them to internal memory or sd card.  If it weren't for the very low system memory, I would give it 5 stars.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meets requirements for simple applications I need it for at an incredibly low cost", "Author": "Johannes Starke", "ReviewID": "R2ENTHJDFQNGLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tested the smartphone for very specific purpose: to see if it can help people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) or Fibromyalgia manage their health and improve their life (as I describe in this article on Health Rising: [...]Overall, I'm thrilled with how well this smartphone works to complete the basic tasks I tested it for. The following tasks worked well on it:* journaling using AK Notepad together with Google Speech recognition* taking notes with Evernote,* making calls using Skype over Wi-Fi // Update: After using this phone some more, I had to realize that sometimes, when too many other apps are loaded, Skype doesn't work properly on this phone. Make sure that all other apps are closed when you try using skype on this device.* tracking one's sleep with Sleep as Android* track one's heart rate with the Endomondo app and the Zephyr HxM Bluetooth Wireless Heart Rate Sensor, an android-compatible heart-rate monitor.This said, there are also many thinks this phone can't do. I'm not holding this against it, as the phone does the things I asked of it really well. I still think you should know about the things it can't do, in case your budget is not as tight and you might want to have a phone that excells at everything.* The screen is probably the phone's weakest point. To read comfortably the journal entries in my AK Notepad app, I had to increase the font size. This was okay for what I wanted to do, but would definitely be a problem if you want to use the phone as a reading device. Also, the screen was not good enough to really enjoy watching YouTube videos.* The phone comes without a headset, so I recommend that you buy  - this $5 headset (Samsung Ehs44Assbe 3.5Mm Stereo Earbud Headset With Answer Button High Performance) and  - this headset clip (Bose\u00ae SIE2 Sport Headphones Clothing Clip - Dark Gray), to really enjoy listening to audiobooks or music on it.* The system memory of the device was full once I had installed all the application needed for managing chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. If you need the smartphone for purposes other than managing your health, the limited system memory will likely become a problem.Therefore, if you have sufficient funds , which many people with ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia don't, you might want to look into buying a brand-new smart phone that does not have these limitations. For example, you might want to look into the Samsung Galaxy S4, or as a happy medium, a second-hand Samsung galaxy S2. To to safely purchase a secondhand device, you might want to try doing it through the online service swappa.In summary, I will still rate this smart phone five stars, because it does the job I need it for really well: it provides all the functionality someone with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia needs to manage their health and life, and it does so at an incredibly affordable price.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone but lacks.", "Author": "5124", "ReviewID": "R6A0HS20H6JVI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so i bought this phone for $40.00 bucks at walmart by strait talk, and poeple at strait talk lie, so i called them and set my phone up/ account... and i ask them after my 3 months was up if my phone would shut down they said yes, never did? and then on top of that when i setup my account i did put my code in ahead of time and walmart told my i had to buy the month card to get my phone to run but before i didnt turn my phone on and later when i did it never ask me for any code? but if you do have to have to put in the code before then my bad but i dont know if net10 runs it the same way so.............................. but the phone itself works good it has some flaws here and there the music/ speakers is good, camera isnt the best 3.0 mega pixel, youtube work great. but the flaws is the memory you only get a little over 40MB of use, witch isnt to good. and net10 users do get lied to a little it cant play all the good game one to much memory space for the game or the phone just cant handle it because you only got 2.3 so the stuff like gta or modern comat are to high of an update to play it. you can play a good amount of the highend 3D games but you would have to do androids virsion of jailbreak so you can store them on the sd card... plus i dont get why they counldnt make it like that in the first place? if your looking for a phone that can do ok well sure if your picky about apps on memory space then no dont buy it. im hoping on buy the lg optimus extreme its the same thang but it has a 4inch screen, 4.0 ice cream sandwich/update,5 mega pixel camera, it looks like this one the same design just a bit bigger, so yeah a lot of words and side tracking but anyways thank you.
