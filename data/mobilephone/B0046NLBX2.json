This phone is now not new to market, and in 2.5 years phone technology has greatly advanced.  At the time this phone was amazing!  Comparatively, now, 2.5 years later, not so much.If you're expecting this phone to be as good as the phones that were first produced in 2012 - well then, someone has to teach you some common sense about technology.In 2010 this was a great phone, the screen was seemingly very responsive, and I would connect and get information from the internet much faster than my friends with other smart phones.One reviewer mentioned that they needed to delete text messages, etc.. in order to keep the phone performing fast - that is very true.  I had the same issue, but not until the phone was close to 2 years old.I would check email, surf the web, go on facebook, foursquare, etc.. with no battery issues.As the phone was reaching it's 2nd birthday with me, I noticed some of the keys on the slide out keyboard would either not work as well or stick (and lock).  I also noticed some screen lock-up (which keeping memory storage at minimal seemed to eliminate).  The phone seemed to not perform as fast I wanted anymore.I was very hard on the phone, I dropped it numerous times.  I even purposely threw it across a room onto a hard floor to show a friend how strong the phone was, more often than I should of.  And the phone still worked just fine (although I did break off the plastic pieces on both sides of the screen eventually).For 2010 this was a great phone.  In 2012, it just doesn't compete with the technology and performance of the new phones.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "angered customer", "ReviewID": "RV39ZY40KJBVT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone on Amazon, and when I tried to activate it, I was told it was on the \"lost and stolen phone\" list so I was unable to activate it!", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Keep looking", "Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "R3D7NZV590DOZ0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this phone free through a promotion with Verizon.

Don't allow the maps or anything else to update, EVER! There is only a bare minimum of memory on this phone and it fills up QUICK. The phone is SUPER SLOW in general, the qwerty keyboard and push buttons randomly stop working and forces you to pull the battery to get it working again.  Constant random reboots just from opening the slider, which in turn either tells you to install your battery or tells you your sd card is damaged (pull battery to correct). Battery life SUCKS--my phone has been unplugged for an hour, sending 2 texts in the mean time--the battery is at 50% already--and there is nothing extra running in the background.

You would think that with apps having such small sizes in the way of memory the internal phone memory would be enough. It's not. Not sure what the issue is, but every app installed leaves a \"footprint'' on the internal memory even if moved to SD card. So the memory gets used up pretty quickly. Having said that,the phone is enough if you are good about app management. You will have to pick and choose what is really important for you to have on the phone,  and leave enough room on the phone to allow the apps to update (even if installed on the SD card). Having said that:This is a good \"starter'' android phone, which I am positive you will want to upgrade as your mobility needs increase. I have had my LG Ally for 2 years now. Even with the tiny memory the phone was good enough.  The tiny memory caused headaches, but I dealt with it.Unfortunately, as of late, the phone has started to act up... I had never had any issue that you read about for the LG Ally. Now the phone shuts down, even after just being unplugged and having a full battery, while using an app  (for me it has been the Navigation app , maps , web browser, and other apps that require the phone to \"think\"). When I try to start it back up it doesn't recognize that the battery is fully charged and shuts down again. If I leave the phone shutdown for a while it will restart and show that the battery is charged.  So unfortunately the phone has become unreliable and I am replacing it. It has been a decent smart phone for 2 years. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but good enough.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "not good in the beginning and gets worse with age", "Author": "Trey Cox \"Tremanda\"", "ReviewID": "RU6B639X1AR9Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone wasn't good when I first got it but it has gotten much worse once I got past the 15 month mark. I now have to clear out all browser history, text messages, and call history about every 2 to 3 days.  This used to only occur every month but I think the phone can't even recognize how much space is being used because less takes up much more.  I used to have to delete at 9MB of internal space left but sometimes I have to delete at 15MB! I also can only have 3 apps because too much random space has been taken up but there are a ton of pre-installed apps that are never used but I can't get rid of them. To top it all off, the SD card was magically damaged (I took it out once or twice and put it right back in) and it lost all of my pictures. This happened months after I took out the card.  Only redeeming feature is the keyboard, but this can be found on many phones.

After about 4 months of using it, I realized there's hardly any storage space/memory, the phone will stay charged for *maybe* a day.  I've already bought a new battery to keep on hand because I know the one in the phone won't last all day.  The phone randomly freezes while trying to do simple tasks, even when connected to wi-fi you don't get anything close to 3G speed.  The display on my phone sometimes won't turn on at all, and I have to take out the battery, put the battery back in, and turn the phone on - this is the only way the screen will come back on.

I got it because it had positive reviews from CNET and was the cheapest Smart Phone available at the verizon store I went to. I was particularly fond of the slide out keyboard (which I still think is great). It was the cheapest for a reason. Its just plain terrible. Here are the problems:1. Storage Space: This phone has terrible storage space. Yes, it comes with a micro SD card with 4 gigabytes, but what they do not tell you is most apps cannot be installed on the SD card, and even ones that can still require internal memory space. The phone has around 250 megabytes of space, most of which are taken up by the operating system and the pre installed apps you cannot remove (like myspace). Anyone who wants a decent amount of apps should avoid this phone if at all possible. I am a news junkie and I have one news app on my phone because I do not have room for more. Even Worse, if you are low on storage space, say goodbye to any incoming text messages. The phone will tell you the text message was rejected and even after clearing up the space you still won't get the text message.2. slow speed: the operating speed on this phone is very slow. most games do not work. the ones that do lag. further every once in a while the phone freezes. Best part, you cant turn it off because you need the touch screen to turn it off, so you need to remove the battery in order to restart the phone.3. SD card: Other than the fact that many apps cannot be stored on the SD card, the phone often looses recognition of the SD card installed in it. Often times my apps installed on the SD card will not open because the phone does not recognize the SD card. Often the SD card is not registered as being in the phone.So basically, stay away from this phone. It is a piece of junk. You will be stuck with your phone for two years, so don't get cheap like I did, pay more for a decent phone. This one will drive you crazy and you will count the many months until you get your upgrade again and even contemplate buying another phone at full value just because you cannot stand this one!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone.", "Author": "Bonnie J.
