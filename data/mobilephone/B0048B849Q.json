Yes, I had Magic and Desire. Main issue i had with Android is terrible battery life! With magic, battery usually would last for 2 days tops, and thats with few calls, a bit of web browsing, and maybe 2 hrs of music. Than i Decided to go and buy HTC Desire. Terrible decision! I had to charge it every second day,and thats with 2-3 calls a day(duration 2-3 mins per call) and a bit of web browsing.If u decide to listen to music or radio, battery would drain in hours!!! Thats what annoyed me the most, i had to carry around car charger and charge the phone, i got to stage where i was scared to make phone call or battery would die on me.And thats not just me, everyone who had Desire experienced same. Dont get me wrong, Android is really good system, but it's biggest downside is battery life. After I sold my Desire, i decided to get this Nokia, since i liked curvy design, 8Mpix camera, and HD Video recording.After i got it, i decided to do battery test, and WOW! I was blown away! After 2 days, i made some calls, more than on desire,received some calls,listened to music for about half hour, battery is still full! I couldn't believe it! Not even a line has discharged!!! And thats two days!!! By now I'd be charging Desire! Camera is really good, takes really nice pics, but HD Video recording is AWESOME! What Nokia needs to do is upgrade OVI Store, since it looks kinda ugly. Considering phone, get it, you wont be disappointed! 5 stars for this phone! It's a keeper :D", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Add $25 & get the N8", "Author": "E.

It feels like holding a pack of 4 AA batteries or a stick of deodorant. It feels very solid. You feel assured that if you drop it, it will survive everytime. The AMOLED scratch resistant Gorilla Glass front reduces fears of a damaged screen also. The phone is priced at the middle of the pack for an unlocked smartphone, but it includes features higher priced phones do not have. TV out from the 3.5mm jack. Built in flashlight from the dual led flashes by holding the lock switch. Read the data from other phones/memory sticks with USB on the go. The phone has 8GB of built in memory, as well as a microSD card slot under the battery for up to 32GB extra. 8 MP camrea which takes great shots. 720p HD video recording. 2nd mic for noise cancelation. Free unlimited voice navigation. NFC capability. Front camera for video chats. Transfer apps, music, photos, and videos, etc over Bluetooth. WiFi. I store all my games, apps, and programs on the built in memory, and my pictures, videos, and music on the microSD card. It's really convenient. Work and personal email and social network updates can all be sorted out on 3 customizable homescreens. It has a pentaband antenna so it can get highspeed 3G/3.5G data on any GSM carrier in the world. The phone gets reception all the time, even in buildings and in Walmart. Even though it has a dedicated GPU for games like Angry Birds and Need for Speed, the battery will still last all day. If it gets low, an optional power saving mode can be activated to turn down the screen brightness and switch to GSM vs 3G til it's put on a charger. Every single phone I've owned gets those annoying little dust particles under the screen. I don't have a single spec under C7 glass. Nokia has outlined future updated to the core OS and UI so the phone stays relevant for the next few years. Overall, a great modern day smartphone for a great price.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone to get IF you don't want or need a data plan.", "Author": "R. Huang", "ReviewID": "R2CZDPJXBJR556", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing this review to put the Nokia C7 smartphone through its paces. I purchased it from Amazon.comThis is the best smartphone to get if you don't want or need a data plan. Here in the US, a data plan is mandatory (minimum cost $15 USD per month for the lowest level data plan) if you buy a smartphone. The carriers' networks can detect if you're using a smartphone (e.g. iPhone, BlackBerry, Android) within a few days and will automatically add a data plan to your account and charge you accordingly.But not so with the Nokia C7. I believe its Symbian operating system has something to do with it, but I'm not certain.My previous phone was a BlackBerry Bold (1st version). I bought it several years ago, so I was not required to add a data plan to my account (AT&T; carrier). I got the Bold because I liked the BlackBerry operating system, contacts rolodex functionality, great speakphone, and the great antenna reception and sound quality.But after 3 years, the Bold felt dated, especially when compared with the newer touchscreen smartphones. As much as I wanted a touchscreen phone, I wasn't happy about the US Carrier' mandatory data plan requirements. I have no need for a data plan.While one or two other touchscreen smartphone models didn't trigger the US carrier's mandatory data plan requirements, they were not fully compatible with all the frequencies of the US AT&T; 3G network. This is important as AT&T; is phasing out its 2G network in favor of fully converting to 3G.Enter the C7. Unlike other touchscreen smartphones, the C7 did not result in a mandatory data plan from the carriers. It also is fully compatible with all the frequencies of the US AT&T; 3G network.The C7 is very responsive on its gorilla glass touchscreen. It's almost as seamless as Apple's iPhone (there's nothing yet quite like Apple's iPhone touchscreen responsiveness). The C7 weighs slightly less than the Bold and the C7 is less obtrusive in your pocket and easier to hold.The C7 antenna reception is almost as good as the Bold's. I can hear people very clearly. Just as important, people can hear me clearly as well. It's speakerphone is as loud and clear as the Bold's. People on the other end of the line could hear me on the C7's speakerphone as clearly as when I was using the Bold.The C7 also as a \"sleep\" function which basically reduces the phone's power usage by deactivating certain frills, like the screensaver clock when the phone is not in use (but you can still leave its Bluetooth on), resulting in 40% more battery life. I wish the Bold had this functionality.The only negative I see is that the C7 does not have smart dialing (where you enter the first few letters of a contact and the phone presents you an ever shortening list of contacts choices). While this omission is certainly careless given today's basic features of smartphones, it's one I can live with. At least there is a Search function for contacts.In summary, I really feel the C7 is an outstanding phone to buy if you want a touchscreen smartphone but have no need for a data plan and don't want the US carriers to automatically add a data plan to your account. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase.As a side note, if I needed a data plan, then the smartphone I would buy is the Samsung Galaxy S2 or it's smaller incarnation which will be released later this year or early 2012. That touchscreen smartphone is simply amazing, but only if you need a data plan.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "High Quality, High Specifications, Great Value", "Author": "Frank Pizza", "ReviewID": "R3CCUOMXJ9GE14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an owner of several Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones over the years, and I have to say that this phone is in my experience is in a league of its own, it is excellent. Before purchase I compared with many Android phones as well as the iPhone but the C7 is the package overall in terms of quality, specifications, price.I will not mention all the features here, you can look them up, but the most surprising elements to me are the video camera which is High Definition 720p and produces amazing results given its lens size and phone factor - FAR better than the iPhone by a mile. Similarly the 8 mega pixel camera is excellent, including the special \"fixed\" lens which gives high quality and sharpness from 50cm to infinity; very impressive and faster and more accurate than an auto-focus phone camera (which have 4 positions typically, not infinitely variable like a full size auto-focus camera). The only thing 1 in 100 users might miss is not being able to focus nearer than 50cm, but I made pictures of flowers, documents, wine bottle labels no problem at 50cm in good light or flash. The upside of this special lens is that it does not take time to focus, and does not require a thicker case, therefore the whole phone is very thin and sleek with no protrusions for the camera lens like the E71 and E72 which I used to use before.Now to the OS and apps. Nokia's only major problem is that their PR / Marketing department has failed them badly in recent years, they became complacent, however the designers and engineers have continued to exel. Then the so-called expert IT press which has paid reviewers and \"journalists\" pushing certain companies and products should be embarassed with themselves over their comments concerning Symbian OS on Nokia, but these guys know no shame!  In my experience Symbian 3 works excellenty, smoothly. It is low powered yet delivers high performance and sails through all functions and apps painlessly. Similarly with the Nokia Ovi Store, I could not believe the massive range in great apps, and they seem to be more secure than Android since Google do not check apps in their stores unlike Apple and Nokia. Additional security comes from Symbian OS by way of prompting you if you want to allow an app to access specific user data - that's a great step from Nokia / Symbian if you want extra security or you might not feel 100% comfortable with a new or less popular app publisher.Yes, there are some minor improvements that can be further made to this phone, but that is the same with ALL phones and there is certainly nothing major.

Phone keeps randomly restarting itself - often when making a call3.  Phone sometimes hangs up when calls come in4.  Battery life is appallingly bad - I get less than one day out of it from moderate use5.  The Symbian^3 OS is fiddly, clunky and sluggish6.  The insane limits on SMS and call register logging is ridiculous7.  No threaded SMS8.  MicroSD memory cards become corrupted at random - for no reason at all9.  Data encryption does not work10. Gorilla glass is not durable11. Phone gets unusually hot even when talking or using a data connection for a short while12. Vibration is uselsss as I cannot feel it at all. My old 3310 was far better in this respect13. Virtual keyboard is a joke14. Installed apps are poor and the OS is easily corrupted by malwareThe good:1. Looks good2/ Free OVI Maps3. Has an AMOLED displayNothing else. It's a poor excuse for a phone and should never have been released by Nokia. I rate it as BETA quality. Even after applying the ANNA and BELLE updates the phone still performs the same and sometimes worse.This is by far the worst phone I've ever owned and used.

For the past 10 years we have had Nokia phones. We have a dozen chargers now lol!  But I am disappointed in this phone- my main point is the emphasis by Nokia on trying to get you to spend more money once you have already paid them.This is called screwing the customer. For instance the C7 could easily have come with an office type program, and there is one installed, but you have to pay for it, otherwise it just sits there on your phone taking up space reminding you Nokia need to be fed with more of your money. Then there is Ovi store which seems to be displayed on nearly every screen reminding you to feed Nokia again with more money. I counted 50 opportunities for Nokia to spam their customer with various ways for them to get paid- AFTER you have bought their phone, and spent good money on it.It a bit like booking a hotel, and when you have paid for the room, there are no sheets on the bed THEY ARE EXTRA lol!I always felt Nokia was on our side, the side of the customer, but now they have sold themselves and join the rest in trying to SCREW all their customers.
