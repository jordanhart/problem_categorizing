However, I am not sure it will last much longer. It is a little flakey sometimes. When I am walking around in a building I tend to get really bad service. Also, when I get texts, it only vibrates 90% of the time, the other times the screen only lights up to tell me I have a text. Page plus is cheap, but the cell service isn't great. My calls often break up, and sometimes it is hard to hear the other person.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kool phone", "Author": "agustin", "ReviewID": "R3ENEUZEJI4I84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works just great, nice and light. wish it was mp3 playable.
