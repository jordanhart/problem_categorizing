{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Tanyito N", "ReviewID": "R6ZU5Q5PP26NM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really really love this phone. I fell in love with it from the first moment I saw it and had to have it immediately. I bought a unlocked black Rizr from Ebay as soon as I could. People advised me not to get one because they believed that the Razr was such a terrible phone, but never having had a Razr, I felt it was worth a try.*** The good ***- The phone is beautiful. The screen display is bright and vibrant. Wallpapers and photos that you upload to the phone look just as good on the phone as they do on your computer. Everywhere I go I get compliments about it, and my friends wish they had it. It's very slim and easily fits into my pocket.- It's pretty study. It doesn't seem like it would break easily. I actually accidentally dropped the phone onto a concrete floor the other day. No damage what-so-ever. Not even a scratch or a dent.- To me the phone is very functional. My service is Cingular (AT&T;) and it worked immediately when I put in my sim card. Setting up internet was a little bit of a challenge, but doing a little research online solved that problem. The phone slides up easily and all of the menus are easy to access. You can personalize the phone and assign buttons to whatever features you wish.- Texting is very quick and simple because of the iTap. The phone remembers words and phrases you type so it makes long messages less of a hassle to write.- There is a voice command feature that I just started tinkering with that is very cool. You press the voice command button on the side of the phone and you can have the phone call, lookup, or send a txt message or email to anyone in your address book. Or you can even just say a telephone number and it'll dial it for you. With the voice command function you can also tell the phone to pull up applications like the audio player, check batter power and signal strength.- The camera and video are easy to use. The camera has a high intensity flash and zooms in. The video camera is great as well. Extremely easy to use and fairly good quality with sound. With my 1GB micro SD card I can take exactly 1 hour of video or 1000 photos.I use a card reader and micro SD to upload things to my phone and it is so fast. As soon as the card is entered into the phone everything is immediately recognized. It's also a breeze to set your mp3s as ringtones. There is a voice recorder on the phone so you can record your own ringtones as well.- The phone has a couple of games loaded on it already, not really much into games, so I haven't played them. There are two music players: a Java player, and the phone's default player. Theres a calculator, date planner, alarm clock... standard features that you'd find on mostphones.- Battery life is wonderful. I have now gone 3 days without charging the phone and I still have 2 bars (out of three) left in battery life. I suppose it all depends on how much you use the phone for.** Things I don't like **- One word: FINGERPRINTS!! The screen is a fingerprint magnet and it drives me crazy. I actually keep an anti-static cloth with me so I can wipe the phone off when it gets bad.- The vibrate is a bit weak. Sometimes when it's in my pocket I don't even feel it, and there's no way to change the vibration strength.- The speaker phone isn't very loud, but I don't use it that often anyway.- The sound quality of the music and video isn't that great, but I really didn't expect it to be stellar.- The keys are a little hard to press and it's difficult to accurately dial numbers using the pads of your fingers sometimes. I have to use my fingernails to dial or text to keep from pressing the wrong key.But none of these flaws are serious enough for me to take away a star from this phone. The pros outweigh the cons by far. I absolutely love this phone, and if you're a fan of the slider type phones, I urge you to give the Rizr a try. I don't think you'll regret it!", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "wow, its --- ok", "Author": "David Yi", "ReviewID": "R3MBZ5M5LT1V28", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Four days ago, I had a motorola razr, and it was time for me to get a new phone. Well, my razr was terrible, so I doubted rizr a little, but since the design was hot (and it was 2 MP camera!), I got it. Well, heres the pros and cons:Pros:1.Nice design with skin that gives you firm grip2.Has 2MP camera and memory card slot to let you take more pics3.Springy slide so you dont need much forceCons:1.The camera doesn't seem like 2MP and feels same as the average 1.32.MP3 sounds like radio and some music cannot be played even though it can be played in other phones or MP3s3. Theres no change from the razr to the rizr; just slide and MP3.It's just an average phone; just overrated by many critics and overpriced too. You'll probably find a better phone than this one.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "beautiful but difficult to program this unlocked version", "Author": "Jsan", "ReviewID": "R29U8FHRVYA6IP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not real happy with the sound quality of the mp3 or the speakerphone.  My Nokia 3220 speakerphone is far superior, although the 3220 does not have the mp3.  Setting up mMode and MMS for AT&T; legacy plan has been truly challenging as Cingular/AT&T; don't/won't provide tech support for an \"unsupported\" phone(they didn't sell it to me, so they don't want to provide tech support), and believe me I have connections at the tech desk being a former employee, and it's like pulling teeth - still don't have proper settings.  Have searched the AT&T; legacy/Cingular self support site and the web, tried all settings found for AT&T; MMS/mMode to no avail.  I can finally connect to mMode homepage and a couple of other mMode links on occasion, but still getting multiple \"internal server\" errors when attempting to go to specific URLs and some linked to the mMode site.  This phone was obviously manufactured for Asian markets, the Motomanual that came with it gives directions for menu options that do not even appear on this software version.  So, I will view this as a challenge and continue searching for resolution.I really do like the phone, bar the problems I have had with the settings.  It's just plain cool looking, and for the most part user friendly.  If you have the patience to program an unlocked phone straight outta Asia, and internet/MMS is not important to you, this is an awesome phone.  The SMS (text msg) works with no problem, although the iTap takes some getting used to.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bad service", "Author": "Teresa", "ReviewID": "R2RQOYC8FH4P23", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone since I live overseas and wanted one that would work.
