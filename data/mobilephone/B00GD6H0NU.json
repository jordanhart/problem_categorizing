{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best High End Phone Deal In America?", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R397PM4P6DG439", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the first generation Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my \"other\" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say \"Ok Google\" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no \"skin\" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is now how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google \"iPhone Plans Comparison\" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these \"iPhone Plans\" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and \"On The Go\" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google \"Meenova\" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the [AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to my RINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 5 and Its Success", "Author": "Ben Pierce", "ReviewID": "R39DZN23ZHR09K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Nexus by Google to this beast.Hardware:Screen - 1080p screen.  Beautiful, sometimes feels a little \"washed out\", but is quite sharp while playing videos.Battery - 2300 mAh, only lasts me 6-7 hours of screen-on time.  Lasts the entire day if I stay off the phone and pay attention in class... standby time lasts me all day.Camera - Wish the shutter speed was faster, but I'm not a heavy camera user unless I'm sight-seeing or at a concert.  Optical Image Stabilizing makes a huge difference.  GREAT video recording!!!  The mic picks up all the audio perfectly at a concert.Speakers - Probably the worst part of the phone if you're watching a YouTube video with a friend.  Located at the very bottom of the phone, the real speaker is located behind the left holes, and the right holes are \"fake speakers\".  If you cover the left holes, the sound will be muted.  However, 95% of the time I'm using my earbuds to listen to my own music, so it's not a big deal.Design - Feels great in the hands, and the soft-touch back just feels sturdy and easy to grip.  Goes to show you don't need an aluminum metal casing around the phone for it to feel like a quality phone.  The ceramic power and volume buttons are nice and add to the solid experience.  However, I prefer to have the volume jack on the bottom of the phone, but it is easy to get used to.Processor - Snapdragon 800 is extremely buttery.  Everything runs fine with all my apps and data imported (Galaxy Nexus got laggy).  Google Now is quick to use.Software:Android Kit Kat 4.4 - Best experience of the phone.  It's the real reason anybody would purchase an Android phone, especially from Google.  Google Now and the Google Experience makes everything so efficient and is very user friendly.  It syncs everything within your Google account, taking your contacts, locations, sports teams, bookmarks, Chrome searches, etc. and keeps everything up to date.  A pure Google experience that anyone would love.The always-on Google search feature delivers fast & accurate searches that beat our household iPhone Siri every time.Overall:Easily the best Android phone on the market, and you really cannot contend with a $350/$400 Google phone.  The very small shortcomings of the speaker, and itty bitty detail of the camera is almost negligible.

It shoots very clear shots now, the camera app opens quicker and the camera takes a lot less time to focus. If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates)Original Review:I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store)[...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer.Pricing:$350- 16 GB$400- 32 GB A Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz?

No waiting for months to get the next version of androidCons:-Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!)-Camera is decent, but video quality is great!

Limandri", "ReviewID": "R22S9973GW88KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 as a whole is one of the best smartphones on the market.  It comes with the latest version of pure android and should always get future upgrades first and has very good hardware specs.  It's kind of like a Galaxy S4 done right.  It doesn't come with all the really bad software Samsung, Carriers and others put on top of android. It is very fast and android 4.4 kitkat adds some nice updates.  The phone itself is rather plain looking, feels great in the hand and has a very nice display.  The ceramic buttons feel premium over the other phones i used.  I think the standout on this device is the specs and the software, which are top notch.  The display, camera and battery life are very good while not being the best on any phone. Everything else about this phone and this phone as a whole package seems to be the best.  I am very happy with it.  I've used the note 2, galaxy s4, nexus 4, iphone 5s and moto x for extended amounts of time.  The only other phone in the group I would consider is the moto x, if u have a preference for something smaller.  But compared to the rest I've used the Nexus 5 is the better choice.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "Morphling", "ReviewID": "R18P9Q921YET1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that.  I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier.  I got the white one and think it looks fantastic.  With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality:The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands.  So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you.  Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false.  Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more.  The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides.  I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts.  The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh!  They are nice and work well.  The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it.  32GB is enough for MOST users.  If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you.  I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too.Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right?  I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve!  LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well.  HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it.  Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far.  The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone.  I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue.  Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter.  I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals.  This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network.Screen - The best I've used.  I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part.  It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time.  Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking.  The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues.  It works as well as any other top tier phone.  Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED.  It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it.Battery - It's average on this phone.  It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too.  After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time.  It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either.  I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices.Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices.  Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well.  Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby.  I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need.  The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item.  So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough.Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release.  I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things.  Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream.  It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS.  I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android.  This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down.  MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now.  iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it.  Anyway, this thing is fast!  Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down.  I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome.  Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything.  I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now.  You have got to love choices.  Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever.  Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like.That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone.  Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more.  You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price.  It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money.  This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly.  It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences.  I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more.  The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone.  That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Avoid: Two flaws, one fatal, can render this phone unusable and there is no recourse", "Author": "super-elastic", "ReviewID": "R35GGW852XLIM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone directly from Google when it first came out and have absolutely loved it. It worked very well the first few months I owned it. Unfortunately, two flaws have emerged that completely disable the phone, and one cannot be fixed.First issue was that the upgrade to Android version 4.4.2 introduced an error for certain popular applications that use the camera, such as Skype, causing the phone to heat up and the battery to drain in about an hour. Look up \"mm-qcamera-daemon\"; that's the name of the application that will run constantly, even when you aren't using any camera-related apps or even using the phone at all, and that will completely deplete the battery within two hours. The solution is to uninstall these apps, which is inconvenient and reduces the functionality of the phone. Google's evidently known about this problem since the introduction of the latest version of Android and has yet to fix it.The second issue, the fatal one, is the \"SIM Card Added - please reboot\" message. Although it may not affect all that many phones, you will find thousands of posts on this problem. Moreover, at least based on my experience, is that you never know when this problem will rear its ugly head. No one seems to know the source of this problem, whether it's hardware, software, or network related. My guess is it's some unique combination of all three, but the fact of the matter is that it seems to affect primarily the Nexus 5 and not other devices and will render your phone completely unusable. My phone worked nearly perfectly from when I received it in November, 2013 until late April, 2014. Then I took it with me to a new city and as soon as I got off the plane and turned it on, I got this message, and the phone would not connect to the network until I rebooted. Everything was fine after that--for about maybe 5 minutes, or sometime 70 minutes or sometimes 10 minutes, then the message would appear again and the phone would require another reboot to connect to the network again. It doesn't matter if I'm using it or if it's just sitting on a table. Unfortunately, the problem has persisted even after returning home.I've contacted Google twice about the second problem, once by phone and once by chat. They said I had to go through a series of trouble-shooting steps (all of which I tried, by the way, including testing a different SIM) that they promised to email to me and that are required to be performed before sending out a replacement under warranty. Guess what, I never received the email and, so far, after two attempts, there is no way to get Google to honor the warranty.If you want this phone, my advice is to purchase it from a place where the warranty will be honored, because Google has not been responsive to my warranty claim.

My first Android device was an HTC/Google Nexus One, and maybe it's because of that phone that got me sold on Android. I've tried various iterations of the Android OS (with Sense, with TouchWiz, Blur, etc.), but I would keep gravitating to the pure, stock Android experience that I got with my Nexus One. Even flashing a custom ROM on my last phone (Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket) still left me wanting. So, I then looked at the landscape, and after going back and forth on what I want out of a phone, I ended going with the Nexus 5.Why do you ask? It has all the features I expect out of the phone, and on top of it, getting (and receiving updates straight from Google) the latest Android OS. Sure, other phones may be better than the Nexus 5 at one aspect or another, but for one reason or another, each of the other phones are missing something that's a deal-breaker for me. This phone has all the aspects I want, and it does it either good enough or better. Newest OS? Check. Seamless Google Now? Check. Blazingly fast UI? Check. Beautiful, more \"natural\" display? Check. Solid (it doesn't have to be spectacular) camera for photos and videos? Check. Battery life (again, at least 3/4 to a full day's worth)? Check. Understated, clean design? Check. Easily modifiable (unlocking, rooting, etc.) for the tinkerer in me? Ditto. Unique, as in you won't see this all over the place (I've had strangers ask me about this phone)? Ditto.There's been detractors out there, but I feel that alot of it is being too nit-picky about what to expect out of a phone. In the end of the day, you want a phone to work solidly all-around, and this one does it in spades.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It rocks!

The delightful, but underrated and underpowered, Palm Pre, several Samsung Galaxy phones, most recently the Galaxy Nexus.The Nexus 5 blows them all away.  It is blindingly fast.  There something between little and no lag when you tap on an icon until the app launches.  Is this due to the hardware or KitKat?  I don't know, but I also don't really care.The battery life, and power management, are better than the previous phones.  One of my ongoing issues with the Samsung phones is that while I was driving with my phone plugged into a charger when I using the GPS, playing an audio file to my radio, and having my Bluetooth headset active, the battery drained.  I'd lose 30% of my charge in an hour drive.  And the battery would overheat, with the whole phone becoming uncomfortably hot.With the Nexus 5, I do all that stuff and the battery gains charge!  I've gotten into the car with the phone at less than 80% charge and gotten to work with the battery fully charged and the phone wasn't hot to the touch.The camera is great and the screen is amazing.Are other phones better?  Maybe.  And surely something better will be along in six months.  But for now, I'm a very happy camper.A quick note - the phone is available at the Google Play Store for $349 for a 16gb version and $399 for a 32gb version.  Mine was in my hands 4 days after I ordered it, well before Google promised to ship it.

So to test that in practice, I decided to run a couple Vellamo Benchmarks to compare the performance of my old and new phone on different tasks --- all trying to figure out if the upgrade is worth or not.A few conclusions came out of my analysis:- The benchmark results showed that the Nexus 5 is really great if you do a lot of gaming, heavy apps or reading.- If mostly you do internet browsing, however, the difference is almost non-existent -- in which case you can stick with your old device- Nexus 5 is bigger but lighter- Screen resolution and hardware are incomparably better- The Galaxy's only advantage is on the front-camera's higher resolutionOf note, recently my brother's Nexus has been showing problems with unresponsive buttons.

Using ATT LTE.  Bought in the Google Play Store for $399.This phone produced by LG and designed for Google is their flagship phone for Android at half the cost of most the flagship phones from other companies such as Samsung, Sony and HTC and almost 2/3 less in cost than an unlocked 32 Gb iPhone 5s.Pros- Performance- As of December 2013 this is the fastest Android phone second only to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Everything is ridiculously smooth.  Watch videos, browse the web and play games smoother than any Android phone currently on the market.  The iPhone has always been the standard for smooth performance and I would go as far to say that the gap has closed enough between the latest iPhone 5s and the Nexus 5 that the difference is either imagined or a non-issue.- Screen- 1080p in your palm on a 5 inch screen is glorious.  I have a 7 inch tablet that I really don't even use anymore because viewing things on my phone is such a pleasure that there is no need to switch to a tablet.  Compared to an amoled the blacks are not as black and the colors are cooler (or less vibrant as some would say).  A lot of people prefer this more vibrant look of the amoled and at first glance I would have to agree.  But upon further inspection, the lcd produces much more realistic images.  Most of us like more vibrant colors, but this is at the expense of realistic colors.  It is a matter of preference, but I like realistic images better.-Battery Life- I get around 4 hours of screen time a charge (100% to 0% battery) using the Nexus 5 for browsing the web, texting, music and light apps such as Facebook and Instagram.  I would say I am definitely not a power user, but my usage is probably more than the average person and this is an all day phone for me.  I can leave early in the morning and plug in my phone late evening and still be at 1/4 power or even more.  This is without turning off wifi or gps, which would increase my battery life even more.  The phone also barely sips power while the phone is not in use.-Build Quality- This phone looks sharp.  I've read in many reviews that this phone looks plain.  Well I agree.  This phone looks plain in a classy subdued refined way.  Nothing flashy.  The build quality is great.  It obviously does not feel as high end as an iPhone or HTC One, but other than those 2 phones there really isn't a mainstream phone that feels as high end as the Nexus 5 with its silky texture.  Ergonomically the Nexus also feels very good in the hand with only the Moto X with its curved back and the iPhone's smaller size feeling better.  The Gorilla Glass III is supposedly very scratch resistant and the glass does glide beneath my fingers very nicely.  The ceramic buttons are a nice touch that look and feel good, although they do have a little wobble to them.Microphone/call quality- the mic is great for calls and recording. Although only in mono, the sound that is recorded is clear and crisp.  Calls are clear both ways.Android- the perks of a Nexus is getting the newest OS first at least until next November when the Nexus 6 comes out and even after that you can expect maybe a year of the newest OS coming to your phone much faster than other phones.  Kit Kat is a game changer.  Google Now is now central to Android.  I personally can't even imagine using an Android phone without Google Now.  The voice recognition is much more than just a cool gimmick, it is the fastest and easiest way to use your phone.  From any of the home screens all you need to do is say \"okay google\" and then you can command your phone to do an abundant amount of actions the extent of which is beyond the scope of this review.-Cost- This is a flagship phone at midrange prices.  If you are looking for best value per dollar... well you have found what you are looking for.Neutral:-Camera (4/17/14)- Originally I had put the camera in the \"Cons\" section because of the horrible camera UI and the slow focus on the original iteration of the Nexus 5 camera but since 4.4.2 and the new Google Camera App the Nexus 5 camera is an all around solid performer.  In the right conditions this camera with its optical image stabilization takes pictures that can rival almost any phone camera on the market today.  The HDR+ mode lives up to the extra arithmetic symbol.  In fact HDR+ mode is my default picture taking mode with the Nexus 5.  The camera can take decent low light shots and beautiful macro shots and the 1080p video is awesome.  8 megapixels isn't as large a number as some other competitors are using nowadays (but still equal to the venerable iPhone 5s), but it offers up more than enough detail for social network sharing and small prints.  The new UI is very simplified with little control over how pictures are taken, instead it concentrates on streamlining quick snapshots which is what most people use their camera phones for anyways.  The new Lens Blur mode is pretty amazing, adding bokeh to pictures for a dslr like effect.  Although for now the highest resolution is around 3.1 megapixels for this mode.Cons:-Speaker- the speaker is mono and is rather low on volume.  The sound that comes out of the speaker is not bad, but not that great either.  I personally don't need my speaker to have awesome quality sound since if I want to listen to something that requires high fidelity I'll just plug in my earphones.  But the low volume can be troublesome for catching calls and texts in a timely manner.  Kit Kat 4.4.1 is supposed to be fixing this problem.EDIT (12/9/13): 4.4.2 has increased the speaker volume to a much more satisfactory level.-Size-  A large and beautiful 5 inch display has its downfalls.  I have average to above average sized hands and one handed use on this phone is still pretty hard to almost impossible with certain apps.  With Android phones getting larger and larger I predict app designers will start making apps with most of the ui towards the bottom of the screen.  But as it stands right now most apps have a lot of ui elements at the top of the screen and that is a problem since your hand naturally sits more towards the bottom of the phone where the keyboard and Android keys are.  There is no way I can position my right hand so that my thumb can hit the \"Home\" key and hit any button on the upper left hand corner.  If an app has a ui element in that corner (and most apps do) then I have to use 2 hands to operate the phone.  It is obvious with the growing popularity of phablets that people don't mind using 2 hands to operate their phone and maybe I'm too old school, but I would rather my phone be one handed.Conclusion-If this phone had the same pricetag as a Samsung Galaxy s4 or an HTC One or almost any other flagship, this phone would still be worth it.  But at half the price?  This phone is by far the best deal among the current generation of smartphones.  I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for an unlocked smartphone.  Most of my cons will be addressed in future updates (see edits above 12/9/13, 12/31/13, 4/17/14), so the only real hesitation I would have would be recommending this phone to a person with smallish hands.  Otherwise the Nexus 5 is the best deal in high end smartphones right now.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Transition Experience Ever!", "Author": "Daryll", "ReviewID": "R2RPAE3XT44QBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the best user experience transfer ever.

Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review!In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5  has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

John", "ReviewID": "R36ZG6X0SYHEAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review of the Nexus 5.The things I didn't like:1. The speaker is probably the worst part of the phone. Even when you use headphones, it's too quiet. I actually use my Moto G when I want to listen music so that's a real turn off.2. The battery life - I have watched reviews that suggests the battery life will get better with time. I've only had this phone for about a week but it has never gotten me through a full day. It maxes out at about 7 hours so I always have to take my charger. I won't consider myself a heavy user. I use my phone to do mainly chatting, your typical social media stuff, news, internet browsing etc. I don't do gaming or movie watching - so considering that I really expected a full day. I'm still waiting to see if it gets better with time.3. The camera - is a weak point on this phone. It carries a 1.3MP front camera - which is really as bad as it gets on a high end smart phone. This camera is really ok for skype etc... won't give you any good photos at all. The back camera is a 8MP, I will say this camera exceeded my expectations because I've heard so many bad things about it I guess I bought it expecting the worst. I'm yet to take any photos with HDR+ enabled and the quality of the photos are satisfactory. With phones around with 13, 26, 20 and even higher MP, if you're really into photo and video taking, I won't recommend this phone. You're never going to impress anybody with any photo that comes from this phone - never mind it was marketed for these purposes.I will add that there is a new google camera app that was launched last week that makes the experience a better one and includes the lens blur feature of the HTC one (M8) but it reduces the quality of the photo in this mode. As google continues to update the camera app I imagine the experience in this department will only get better.4. Design - I don't mind the simplicity of it but I will admit the iphone 5s and the HTC one (M8) are incredibly sexier and more pleasing to the eyes. So too but less so is the Sony Z2. Phones like the Moto X and the HTC one (M8) are invariably gonna feel better in your hand as well.5. The display. I wasn't sure what people meant by the display being 'washed out'. I found out when I bought this phone. Holding it up beside the Moto G, the display on the Moto G (which is quite incredible I must say) looked better. Something is off with the colours but I find when the brightness is turned all the way up it looks better. Why does the colours change with dimming the display - I'm not sure. Apart from that though, the display is boss.I have not experienced any connectivity problems with this phone.What I love:1. The price. I can't afford an iphone 5s (won't buy one even if I could), the s5, the Z2 or the M8. This phone is always compared to these phones despite the huge price difference. The fact of comparison alone says a lot regardless of the verdict.2. Software - 4.4.2 - I love having the latest and greatest OS and being first in line for every update. Google Now is deeply integrated and there is zero bloatware. These are three things that are highly important to me. At the end of the day, software is what you're going to be interacting with each time you turn on or unblock your phone so I can't think of anything that could be more important.3. Performance. The OS makes specs less important than they use to be because it requires less. For that reason, the Nexus 5 performs just as good and even better than other flagship devices. It can handle any app you throw at it and after one week the phone has not stopped to take a breather. There are other phones that have better specs and it doesn't make them better - they require more to handle the bloatware that bugs down the device. Don't be fooled in this regard - the Nexus 5 has everything under the hood you could ever need.Keep in mind this phone does not allow storage extension.I still give this phone 5 stars because it is obviously intended to target a specific set of people - people like me who place software at the top of the list of priorities alongside price. There really isn't a better phone you'd get at this price.There is no such thing as 'the best phone' - phones are different just as people are different and they are made to meet different needs. You have to know what you want out of your device and I found what I needed out of the Nexus 5. If the strengths of the phone are not important to you and the weaknesses are I could easily recommend a different phone.I'd surely recommend this phone to those whose attention its trying to get - it is a deal you should not miss.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's my first android phone (The best phone I ever had)", "Author": "Gregory", "ReviewID": "R12KYL6TDKLH1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Materials: good details, especially in the back , it feels good to the touch.Display: one of the best in the market , excellent colors and sharpness .Camara : I am not a professional photographer , so I can tell you that for me it is acceptable and even better than some common cameras selling here.Memory 32GB: I think it is a good storage capacity, even for people who lose a lot of videos , take many photos, and downloaded many games, he left over space.Android 4.4 -Platform: It's my first android phone , I think this system is going VERY fluid.

Look at the web as to how to distinguish the two. Google store was dumping the old inventory at the time I bought it, and I have the older version, even though the new one was available for over a month. There was no indication whether the \"new\" or \"old\" phone would ship.I doubt that this is a big deal in the overall long-term function of this device, but it would be good to be able to buy the \"new\" version if given the choice.Some problems that have surfaced:-the phone has a habit of sometimes forgetting it's hooked up to a BT device.-phone doesn't always like to connect to WiFi without a restartFor this I'm deducting a star.Original review below:Bought this on the google play store. $400+ tax and shipping. Had it on my doorstep the next day.Came from s3, and didn't want to renew my contract with SprintPros:-beautiful screen-almost no pre-installed software-fast processors-excellent microphone, most people I call say they can hear me much more clearly-seems to have a better antenna than the s3, have been getting better reception-long battery life-cheap (nearest competitors are 200-250 more)Cons:-google INSISTS on shipping phone with \"hangouts\" which is  a clunky SMS program--forcing you to either endure it or downloading an ad-infested 3rd party SMS app-doesn't seem to like any USB cable except the one that shipped with the phone-charging seems to take a while-screen is a bit dim, even when set to manual and the highest setting--a problem when outdoors in bright sun.

For one, using an android device provides an integrated experience with all things google (Google Calendar, GMail, Docs et al) and provides an ecosystem alternative at a very affordable price - which brings me to the Nexus 5.LIKES5\" displayLook / feel - minimalist with a good solid feel that isn't bulkyDesign - OS and features are very well put together and the \"pure android\" experience is a promise I look forward toDISLIKESBattery life - as expected at the price, I believe (Minimum of 1 full charge the night before and average use)Call quality - not sure what the secondary microphone does for you, but I have had a few call quality challenges that seemed to even out after the first week or so when I got the phone.ATTRACTION - PRICE, AND \"PURE\" ANDROID EXPERIENCEThis phone was an attractive offering for me because of the price point, but also because of the exclusion of 3rd party software that comes with non-nexus android devices. In my opinion, the Nexus 5 delivers on the promise of an android experience that is curated by Google and free of 3rd party interference. Since this is my first nexus device, I'm yet to see what the update commitment will be over the lifetime of the device as Google releases OS updates / new versions.DESIGN: 4.8/5The design is somewhat minimalist in my opinion - especially the device exterior. The weight of the Nexus 5 is evenly distributed across the device, leaving you with a 5\" smartphone that feels light for it's size, but not flimsy or as cheaply made as you might fear at the price point.CALL QUALITY 3.8/5Starting out, in the first week after I got my device, there were phone call quality issues, but whether these went away because of software updates, or because my issues had nothing to do with the phone itself, I am unsure. Articles online suggest there were hardware changes too, and I suspect I got one of the \"newer\" versions after the modifications to the initial hardware for the nexus 5. My call quality today is as expected for a handheld device, but does seem to depend some on the secondary microphone positioned on top of the phone.BATTERY 3/5The battery is what you need to get through a day with power - the nexus 5 promises \"all day battery life\" which it delivers on at average use. Peak use sees you running out of power somewhere at the end of the work day. I would say for the price, the battery is satisfactory.CAMERA **The camera software took some getting use to - the design is different from what I had been use to with my last phone, but this shouldn't come as a surprise (new OS, new software). The photos appear to be pretty good, but not being an avid photo taker / critic myself, I'll refrain from scoring here.DISPLAY 4.8/5The display delivers on the pleasures of a larger smartphone (5\").OVERALL 4.5/5Where 5 is the most awesome smart phone you could buy vs. value for price paid, I think the Nexus 5 gives you a very good deal @ the offered price.

Frankly this is the first time I buy an android phone with a stellar experience right out of the box. I mean almost all problems have been resolved including battery life, lag, responsiveness to touch, etc...On the hardware side, Qualcomm has outdone itself with snapdragon 800.

I'm just reviewing the device and my experience with GooglePlay.***I'd give the Nexus 5 '1 star' for my experience with the product, but I added '1 star' for Google's noble attempt to disrupt the current status quo by creating a well-equipped smartphone for a very reasonable price.I did considerable research on different smartphones before settling on this one.  Nexus 5 really is incredible value for the hardware and features it includes.  And I'm generally a big fan of Google and all its offerings, so I felt pretty good with my ultimate decision.That said, I think Google is venturing into unfamiliar territory by selling its own device through a retail channel and I would warn anyone against buying this.  My problem with the Nexus 5 developed about 3wks after receiving it in the mail from GooglePlay.  Randomly, the touchscreen would become unresponsive.  The side buttons would work and it appeared that the device was still connected to wifi and the cellular network, as I'd be receiving texts and email notifications.  But I couldn't access anything because the touchscreen did not work.I have spoken with GooglePlay support twice and both times the touchscreen worked after a \"Factory reset\" of the device, which takes about 30min and wipes your phone clean.  After one time running through it, I could handle that fix on my own.  But in reality a phone that suddenly and randomly becomes unresponsive, and requires a complete wipe/reset (need to re-enter all of your info and reinstall all apps), is almost worse than no phone at all (imo).  My problem has recurred in a random pattern, several weeks or days apart.  There is no specific action or context in which it malfunctions.Because the factory reset fixes the touchscreen issue (at least temporarily), GooglePlay believes that the malfunction relates to an app that I have downloaded and not defective hardware. They suggest resetting the device and using the device with no apps (what's the point of a smartphone?) and then slowly adding apps back one at a time, hopefully pinpointing the problem.  In reality, my issue has come up at random times and a few weeks apart so it is enormous task to test each app, one-by-one, over that time period to ensure that it is not the cause of the malfunction.  And while I use a medium/high number of apps, almost all of them are major reputable apps (most of them are recommended in the app store) and I don't play any games or have strange third-party apps.Google's other option is where  I take issue.  If I want to claim a defective device, as I believe is the case for mine, Google will send me a new device and return shipping for the original device (all good so far).  The Google warehouse then runs a diagnostic test to see if the original device is in fact defective, presumably a one-time test when they receive the device, which very well might not detect my random touchscreen malfunction, especially if their test involves a factory reset.  If they determine that the original device is free of defects, they will charge me for the new device and keep the original device.  They explicitly will not send back the original device, which they deemed fine and for which I paid for and own.  So at the end I will have paid for two devices but only have one.All of this is a long way to say that Google puts the consumer in a bad position, with only two unappealing options, should anything go wrong with your Nexus 5.  A big part of this situation relates to Android's open platform, which allows Google to disavow responsibility for any apps that you download and may cause you harm or malfunction.  But the other part of this situation is Google's lack of customer orientation: they require the customer to gamble and send back their device for testing at the risk of having to buy a brand new one if their 'warehouse test' comes back clear.  A brick-and-mortar establishment would be able to test the phone in person and address any issue right there.This is a very long review but I wanted to share my experience with others before they commit to this device.  As I said earlier, the Nexus 5 is a noble effort by Google and I'm generally a fan of the company but I would warn against buying direct from them.  May be worth a purchase through your service provider's store location.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this Phone. soooooooooooo Happpppppppy so much better then Iphone.", "Author": "Saeed A.

Sembower \"JS\"", "ReviewID": "R1TDPKLMM82T4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The last three phones I've had have been Nexus.  Previously, I used the iPhone 3G.  I am giving the Nexus 5 four stars instead of 5 because I have yet to find a perfect phone.I define a perfect phone by providing responsiveness, excellent battery life, and an optimal user experience (vast array of applications, features, and feel).The Nexus is the best job Google has ever done to provide me with everything I want.  However, there are shortcomings.  I'll address the benefits first, and the negatives second.Why you need the Nexus 5:1.  This phone is widely available off contract for $399.  The price here is a little higher, but with Prime, you know what you are getting.  That's roughly half of the off-contract price for a new iPhone.2.  If you are operating on an unlimited T-Mobile plan as I am, in Seattle, this sucker is FAST.  Regularly receive over 25Mbps download, over 6Mbps upload.  Fast enough to watch baseball games in real time.3. No bloatware.  I made the switch from Verizon to T-Mobile after my Galaxy Nexus took forever to get updates.  Don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you want the most recent software on your Android Device, purchase a Nexus of a Google Play Edition phone.  done.4. Feel.  The phone feels great in my hand.  They improved the design greatly over the Nexus 4; the back is an almost rubberized plastic, where the 4 was easily shattered glass.  Where the look of the 4 may have been prettier, it feels as if LG/Google wanted to design this thing to be a workhorse.5.  Wireless charging.  Continuing with the 4's charging legacy, all my Qi-chargers work with this.  Note: you don't have to purchase the super-expensive wireless charger from Google.  It looks pretty, but it's price is astronomical.6.  Apps.  Between the Amazon App Store and Google Play store, I find 99.9% of what I want.  I love Amazon MP3 on here.  No DRM, quick downloads.  Seamless.Now...for the bad:1.  Amazon Instant Video - it's a no show. Can't get it native (read: the app) on any Android phone.2.  Camera.  The inclusion of HDR made the Nexus camera better, but it still feels like an also-ran.  If you're connected to Instagram or any other selfie-driven service, an iPhone will probably suit you better.  I take pictures with a nice DSLR.  This camera is used to snap a photo of where I parked :).  YMMV.3.  No Verizon.  Until Verizon lets this phone on their network, it will never get 5 stars.  Verizon would have to agree not to modify the software...and I don't see that happening.4.  Battery.  Still better than its predecessors, I think having a phone with extraordinary battery life (think old BlackBerries) would be a killer Nexus feature.  I get a full day, but want more.In summation, if you are on ATT, Sprint, or T-Mobile, and you want a workhorse off-contract device, you've met your new best friend.  You won't be let down.  However, if you want Amazon Instant Video, go get an iPhone.  You won't find it here.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever owned! (so far)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RAUBOGL5K0OBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Best phone I have ever owned\" is a big claim, especially since I recently also owned a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (with companion Galaxy Gear smartwatch). So let me elaborate...My previous phone (not counting the Note 3) was a Nexus S, one of Google's earlier and not-very-widely-adopted phones. Although made by Samsung, it was a pure Google Android phone with none of the bloat-ware associated with some manufacturers. And with none of the multiple account sign-ups (Google Account + Samsung Hub + ???). I did like the pure Adnroid experience then, and I like it now on the new Nexus 5.Although I missed out on the Nexus 4, two family members each picked up one of those popular phones when Google slashed the price prior to launching the Nexus 5. While those we're outstandingly good value purchases, I'm glad I waited for the Nexus 5 myself.The Nexus 5 is slim and stylish in a very understated way, like a little black dress (but I'm not a girl). Out goes the bling, and in comes a slightly rubberised back which is way nicer than it sounds... and reassuring to hold. The screen is a pleasure to look at, because you can't see the individual pixels, and it's big enough without being a \"phablet\". It's fast and responsive, 4G-ready, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, and very good value for the price I paid \"in store\" soon after launch (hence not a verified purchase here on Amazon). Documentation is scarce, so you may have to do a lot of experimenting or reading around on the web, but there is always The (Unofficial) Google Nexus 5 SmartPhone Book : The missing manual for LG's Android 4.4 KitKat phone.It really is no exaggeration for me to say that I have been telling all my friends that \"this is the best phone I have ever owned\". And I'm pretty fickle.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthy upgrade from most Android/iOS devices", "Author": "Scott Ox.", "ReviewID": "R2G20H3UUA9LAJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 is a very nice upgrade from the Nexus 4, and a quality upgrade from virtually any other Android phone... if for no other reason than the lack of bloatware/customization from the manufacturers & carriers.Screen (++) This is one of the big advantages, moving from Nexus 4.  The screen was NICE on the previous generation, but the N5 is so much more polished.  The screen makes the most of a very slight increase in area by increasing the pixel density.  Where on the N4 pixels were noticeable, the N5 density basically eliminates any issues with this. Also, the only screens that compare with this phone are all Androids.  The iPhone 5/5s can not compete with a screen this size, a full inch larger.Speed (+) Although I'm not a power user on my cell phone, I did notice an increase in speed while opening apps and in the blends when moving between screens.  I'm told that the Qualcomm S800 is a big step up in performance, but you'd have to ask someone else for their personal experience.OS (++) I've tried virtually every operating system for smartphones since the Treo 600 when I was in college 9 years ago.  When you buy a Nexus device, one of the big advantages is getting the new Android OS first.  While I didn't notice a HUGE difference in 4.4 (Kit Kat) over 4.3 (Jelly Bean), I'm happy knowing that whenever 5.0 drops, I'll be first in line for the improvements.  As far as how this OS compares historically, I've been a recent iPhone owner and Android compares favorably in nearly every way to Apple's iOS.  The only significant differences between the two are: 1) Lower innovation, higher polish of iOS apps vs Higher innovation, lower polish for Android apps.  2) Higher customization for Android.  This can go either way... I know plenty of smartphone users who want simple. In that case, higher customization just adds unnecessary steps/hassle.Battery (-) While listing this as a negative, this phone really does compare to most of the high end smartphones on the market.  At 2300 mAh, and a new, more battery friendly LTE radio, it performs as expected.  My issue with the battery here is simple... it's a VERY thin phone.  I'd be happy to sacrifice a bit of the form so the battery could last a full day of heavy use... or closer to it.  This is really a judgement on the industry, but that being said, this phone does NOT last through a full day for this user.  One of the only high points for this phone regarding the battery is that it's wirelessly rechargeable.  While the N5 wireless charger isn't out yet, the N4 charger does work, and helps make charging just that much easier.ADDITIONAL INFO:Speakers (--) Really disappointing. Was hoping for decent volume.  Didn't get it.Form (++) Can't remember all the folks who've mentioned loving the feel/weight of this phone.  Light, but solid.Want a top of the line phone, unlocked, at a bargain price?

As good as the iPhone??", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R12UBJ3JF9P4JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Google Nexus 5 is the latest, fastest Android phone from Google (built by LG). Incredibly fast, light and thin - but is it as good as the iPhone 5s costing more than double the price? Read on to find out.....Firstly, a word of warning. This is a lengthy, thorough and in depth review to compare the two phones - not just trash one or the other. I personally have an iPhone 4S, iPad Air, an Apple TV and several Macs. However, I also have an open mind and limited budget.Display----------The Nexus has a stunning 5 inch HD screen with more pixels on a larger screen, and they're more densely packed. For the techies among us, the Nexus is 1080x1920 pixels and 445 pixels per inch (ppi). This clearly beats the iPhone's 4 inch retina screen at 1136x640 pixels at 336ppi.But what does this really mean? It means you get a bigger, better quality screen than an iPhone 5s (which as a fan of Apple, really surprises me). What it means, is photos and videos just look absolutely stunning, and web pages razor sharp.In short, screen quality on the Nexus is absolutely brilliant, with pure whites and super-sharp text on a larger screen. A clear winner for the Nexus.Speed---------Both Nexus and iPhones are blistering fast. Web pages display instantly, scrolling a breeze, and you can rapidly jump between apps. So not a lot in it. This is an incredibly fast device for the money.It's also worth noting both Nexus and iPhone support the super-fast 4G network as well as existing 3G. You may pay more for a 4G contract (although not from Tesco Mobile or Three), but if you want to get the best out of your phone it's a consideration.Look, Feel and Build Quality-------------------------------------Lets be honest here. The iPhone wins hands down on the top quality, hard edged aluminium industrial design from Sir Jonny Ive. It's lighter, smaller and thinner than the Nexus, and if you have smaller hands (but deeper pockets), it's a beautiful device. A top end BMW 5i compared to a Ford, Peugeot or VW Golf.The Nexus is physically larger with rounded off corners, a lightly curved rubberised back, and tough \"Gorilla Glass 3\" screen. Quietly understated, although the Nexus 5 is (on paper) very slightly heavier, (see specs below), it also \"feels\" lighter - incredibly light in the hand given the relatively huge screen size.I have to admit, the Nexus does sit nicely in the hand, feels light, and the screen is just massive - but if you're looking for top quality Android - you need to pay around double the price, and buy the \u00a0HTC One (M8), but on build quality - the iPhone wins.Camera-----------Considering both have an 8 mega-pixel camera with optical image stabilisation (ie. the camera tries to compensate for shaky hands), the iPhone wins by a fair margin. Automatic zoom on the Nexus is a bit hit-and-miss. I often find you need to use the \"tap to focus\" feature, and annoyingly even this doesn't work perfectly sometimes, especially in low-light conditions where the iPhone wins.Having said that, in normal outdoor situations, it's great for quick snaps, and you can always use a \"proper camera\" if you're really serious about photography.Battery Life---------------Always difficult to tell without a head-to-head test, and even then I think it depends upon how you use the phone. Typically video over WIFI burns the battery and a review (search for \"V3 iPhone Nexus compare\" to see) has helpfully done much of the work for us.Nexus ran 7.5 hours compared to iPhone 5S at 7. So (despite other Amazon reviewer gripes), it's pretty much comparable.Having said that, today I've blitzed the phone today. Downloading Apps, searching on Google, navigating and watching videos of-and-on for the past 11 hours, and it still has 18% battery left.I'll update this review after a few months real world experience.Storage----------Nexus comes with 16 or 32Gb of storage compared to iPhone's 16, 32 or 64Gb, and neither have expandable storage. Having said that, I've lived happily with a 16Gb iPhone for nearly five years without issue, but it depends upon how you use it.Price-------For once it's absolutely black and white. \u00a0Compared to the iPhone - the Nexus 5 is an absolute bargain. \u00a0Fantastic value for money.What about Apps?-----------------Firstly, an App, is a small \"application\" (a program) that runs on your phone or tablet, and there's thousands available from both the Apple and Android stores. Be aware they're \"Apples and Pears\" - an Apple App will only run on an iDevice (iPhone, iPad etc), and you'll need an Android App for this phone.Many apps cost $1 - or 69p in real money, and there's thousands free (frequently advertising funded with an ad-free version for 69p). Here's my favourites:-* Mailbox. \u00a0Incredibly slick mail box app (gmail only - sorry). \u00a0(Free)* Go SMS pro. (Go Chat on Apple) Send and receive text messages. (Free)* QuickOffice. Edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents. (Free)* Evernote. Write and organise notes. Edit them on your Nexus, iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac (Free)* DropBox. Access your files, documents and photos anywhere. (Free)* Tune In Radio. Listen to 1,000s of radio stations world-wide (\u00a32.40)* Spotify. Stream music for \u00a35 a month (or free with ads). Brilliant! (Free)* eBay. Buy and sell your stuff while you're out and about. (Free)* Zite. Online web magazine that learns what you like. Terrific! (Free)* Movies by Flixter. Read reviews of films on cinema and DVD. (Free)* Kindle. Read your books from Amazon Kindle bookstore. (Free)* 1Password (reader). \u00a0Read only access to passwords. \u00a0(Free)Note: All of the above without exception are available on Apple and Android, and some (Evernote, Spotify, DropBox and Box) also run on PCs and Macs.So to my mind - it's a draw. OK, so it's common knowledge that many new apps (typically games) are first launched on the iPhone first, but the market for Android Apps has matured, finally catching up with Apple.Admittedly, I do find iPhone versions of Apps tend to be slightly better versions, as they seem to be launched on Apple first, and Android second, but the difference is not crippling.Viruses - Apple Vs Android------------------------------Unlike Apple who stop you buying Apps from anywhere else, on Android you CAN buy Apps from the equivalent of a \"dodgy bloke in the pub\" - or indeed reputable companies like Amazon. It's up to you really.On Android, if you try to install an app off the internet you get the message \"For security, your phone is set to block installation of applications not obtained from the Android Market\". You can unset this on \"Settings --> Applications --> Unknown sources.In short, if you get a free copy of an App by mail or a web site and you ignore the warnings and install it - you risk getting a virus. It's your call.Operating System---------------------The Nexus runs Android whereas Apple run iOS. Personally I think much is down to taste and what you're used to.Worth noting however, is the Nexus is one of the few Android phones which aren't loaded with additional \"bloatware\" rubbish. Samsung for example, load their phones with a confusing (and unnecessary) \"Touch Wiz\" interface to differentiate their offering. Personally I'd always stick to a Google Android device. As well as avoiding the useless bells and whistles, you get upgrades direct from Google. Other phones often take months to provide upgrades (sometimes never). Worth knowing, if you're considering another Android phone.The statistics-------------In common with Apple, I've tried to avoid quoting \"the numbers\" except to illustrate a difference as pure stats can often misleading. But for those who like to compare:-GOOGLE NEXUS 5OS: Android 4.4.2 (KitKat)CPU: Quad core 2.27Ghz Snapdragon 800Space: 16g or 32gScreen: 5 inch (diagonal) , 1920x1080 (HD) display with 445 pixels per inchCamera: 8 MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 137.9 x 69.2 x 8.6 mm - very thin bezel, almost all screenWeight: 130gAPPLE iPHONE 5sOS: Apple iOS (7.1)CPU: A7 chip with 64 bit architectureSpace: 16g, 32g or 64gScreen: 4 inch (diagonal), 1136x640 with 326 pixels per inchCamera: 8MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mmWeight: 112gOverall Conclusion--------------------Well, I guess in conclusion I bought a Nexus not an iPhone, and that says it all.On balance, the Nexus 5 is:-* Blisteringly fast* Has a beautifully clear, large display (without being silly)* Runs an excellent version of Android (direct from Google so bang-up-to-date and without bloatware)* Runs all the Apps I already run on my iPhone* Is MUCH cheaper!Lets be honest, if I had cash to burn, I'd love an iPhone 5s (or even better a 6). I think the iPhone is a beautiful example of industrial design with top end build quality. Add to that the superb integration with the iPad, Mac and Apple TV, not to mention the security of the touch ID fingerprint scanner, and I can understand why they charge more.If you really can't stand Apple (or think the iPhone screen size is too small. but have the money, I'd also consider the HTC One (H5). \u00a0Apple quality build on Android.However, at this price, it's a steal.

There is no physical button on the front of the phone, so when you are using your phone with encrypted storage, like I am for work, the only way to wake the phone up is to press the button on the upper right side. The volume button doesn't bring up the lock screen nor does tapping on the glass. And finally, there's the battery life. This phone is so powerful that if you turn on all the features, like Google+, NFC, Bluetooth, wifi, GPS, etc... you will have a hard time making it through the entire day without needing to charge the battery.

It also frees up space so you can store more things like images and video, and system memory so your programs run a little faster. It also gives you a single set of apps that work together flawlessly. Dialer, Hangouts (SMS and instant messaging), and People (contacts) work the way they should without the need to get replacement apps for core features to use your phone.Ergonomically, this phone feels great. The soft-touch rubberized backing keeps the phone from slipping out of your grip. A ceramic volume rocker and power button, while not as substantial as the metal-clad iPhone 5s, give the phone a light-weight and solid feel.One of my concerns with the phone is the rubberized backing. In the past, I've had cases with a similar coat of soft-touch material that has rubbed off over time. And while it hasn't happened yet, it may happen eventually. And while the camera and speaker are adequate, they're definitely not industry-leading. Even though the most recent Android update addressed some camera issues, the camera still has some difficulty focusing when you want to take pictures. So while it might work well for a few Instagram pics, it won't replace your point and shoot. The speaker, on the other hand, does get loud enough, but with the quality of a cheap AM radio. Fortunately, sound from the headphone jack is just fine.Overall, if you're looking for a slick device with a gorgeous screen and a slick interface, you can't go wrong with the Nexus 5. While it may have the luxurious finish or take gorgeous pictures like an iPhone, or play music out of front-facing stereo speakers like the HTC One, it nails its core features, like messaging, taking calls, and running apps on a beautiful HD display.

If taken properly they were good but this needs a small bit of practice to achieve the perfectness in the picture. with iphone 5s the camera is pretty good and in certain conditions nexus 5 falls below in this place. in low light conditions iphone 5s does take better pictures that. Videos are decent and pretty good.SKYPE \\ VIDEO CHATBelieve me I don't know what iphone does but Nexus 5 falls well behind in this department. I have tried to skype with my parents (who stay in india )using iphone 5s , ipad air and nexus 5 in and around the same time repeatedly nexus 5 used to drop the video call in between. with iphone and ipad air this is not seen anywhere. the calls are pretty smooth.MOVIES & SOUNDiphone 5s is way ahead in terms of sound clarity or the quality of sound. the volume on nexus 5 is low. when it comes to the screen size of nexus 5 was very apt to watch the movies \\ videos from youtube \\ Netflix.DESIGN , LOOK & FEELBoth are pretty good in their own ways.

I also have experience launching the first 4G LTE smartphone on America's first LTE carrier...so I do know a few things about phones.**HARDWAREFeels good in your hand... doesn't feel as premium as the Nexus 4 but does feel better than some samsung phones. The design is heavily inspired by the iPhone 5 -- just look at the speaker grill portion at the bottom, you'll think it's an iPhone. Google is guilty of doing this on the Nexus 4 too, with the Glass design, and as an Android fan I'm disappointed to see this trend emerging.. but I digress.Screen is great But then there's the BATTERY LIFE... Don't get me started on the Battery life. Damn the battery life.It is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE etc. The phone dies. The phone dies a lot. The phone dies doing nothing.Example~ I went to bed with 52% battery life, no 3rd party apps installed, no GPS, just wifi. I woke up... late.The phone had died in about 6 hours while it was doing absolutely nothing and I woke up refreshed but very late.The battery life also has wild fluctuations... it's quick to die but some days it may choose to surprise you with longer than usual battery life.Battery fixes exist but they'll require you to get Quite technical and potentially void your warranty (Root) -- info can be found @ XDA Developers.Speakers on the phone are pretty bad, if I'm honest. My phone's also been having calling issues -- it refuses to accept/acknowledge calls even if I had full bars, in some tests... the Radio needs an update, and again that'll require you to get Technical (XDA) unless Google releases a Over The Air update (OTA).If you get this phone (and they doesn't fix the battery issue via an OTA) bring a charger & cable with you everywhere you go...the battery issue it itself is grounds topotentially avoid this phone.**SOFTWAREVanilla Android (Kit Kat) is pretty nice & it's what originally attracted me to the Nexus lineup. The latest version (4.4 KitKat) is pretty sweet but it has a few quriks. Google is trying to deeply integrate Google Now into the phone, this means that they replaced the menu card to the left of the homescreen with a giant Google NOW window --- I'm not a fan of this feature at all but it's relatively easy to replace with a custom launcher.TEXT MESSAGING has also been revamped -- everything gets grouped into Google Hangouts by default. It's easily changeably but it's clear that Google's getting greedy for user data now. The New Hangouts client manages hangouts & your SMS. The SMS is now routed & associated with a Gmail ID and you can archive it away... but now it's clear that you're associated data to your Gmail account & Google's building an even bigger profile on you for data mining.Other than those two quirks the OS is it-self pretty good...although the camera suffers from pretty BAD shutter lag.**OVERALL**The phone itself is ok. I wouldn't call it a big jump up from the Nexus 4. The battery life issue is making me Seriously consider returning the device to Google. I plan to order a replacement LCD screen for my Nexus 4 & swap it out. I am awfully Disappointed with the phone's battery life & call performance after spending about a week with it. The OS is great but this phone itself is not worthy a worthy Flagship device -- which is probably why they didn't host an actual press conference to release this phone, they released it on a random blog post.~~~~~~~~~I originally wrote this review to discourage people from buying the Nexus 5 @ a ridiculously overpriced costs from people on here... it's three hundred and ninety nine from Google Play although there is a few week wait.FOR THE PRICE OF THE DEVICE (from Google Play) YOU CAN'T GO WRONG, the fact that it doesn't require contract makes it that much more awesome... KitKat is wonderful & the bang for buck w/ packed with specs is excellent. But the few shortcomings mentioned above are also big enough for me to seriously reconsider my purchase, but it just might be that I'm too picky with my phones.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen shattered very easy and you can not see the screen horizontally when you wear sunglasses \"you can see only black\"", "Author": "Jeehyun Chang", "ReviewID": "RF4EFNXGMS7II", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought nexus 5, about 50 days ago from google play store online. Three days later, I accidentally dropped the phone from only two feet high on flat plastic tile (it fell off fron my y-sherts poket when I pick up somting) but the screen glass shattered. I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price.I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back.Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. \"Send it back to LG\".I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now. LG seems not care, they will send me another ground shipping label to send it back, I have to wait another two weeks. I will never buy LG product again. it broke very easily and their service is very bad.One more, even if evrythig fine, you can not see the screen horizentally while you are wearing sunglases.

The hardware is fantastic, the battery life isn't as bad as they say, and it's got enough power to make it a pretty impressive Mini-tablet experience. Android 4.4.2 (\"KitKat\") is pretty disappointing, what with levels of Google App integration that surpass Facebook levels of nosy spyware, but with a root and the XPosed Framework added, that's easy enough to work around.Unfortunately, it looks like LG and Google forgot that this thing was supposed to be a phone. If you don't install Google Voice (which \"conveniently\" stores all of your voicemail on Google's servers, which they'll then \"helpfully\" transcribe, incorrectly, and log for their future perusal to determine what kind of ads to shove in your face), then the only notification you'll get that you have new voicemail is a blank text message from a 4-digit code (I am led to believe that this is a Sprint-specific problem. Go figure).At least you won't have to worry about your contacts missing your actual text messages, though, since there's some kind of bug which makes the phone randomly decide to send them twice. This was originally reported as a problem with the \"Hangouts\" app being used for SMS (there's that google integration again, storing your text messages alongside your voicemail!). I wasn't using Hangouts, I was using ChompSMS, which I've used for over a year on my old \"Gingerbread\" phone without the problem peeking up.I guess one can make the case that in our modern, 140-character keyboard-swiping world, it was easy to overlook the fact that, when making something called a \"telephone\", it's generally a good idea to make sure audio quality is up to snuff. I've spent the majority of every call in the past week repeating \"What?\", \"I didn't get a word of that?\" and \"Are you chewing on a sock?\" to the unfortunate parties on the other end of my phone calls.
