The ribbon cable that connects the screen to the keyboard tore and is sticking out.  It feels like a cassette tape ribbon, is orange on the front side and black on the backside.  The phone has never been abused or dropped.  This should have been built more sturdy especially with the movable part of sliding the cover back and forth.  The only good news about the phone is that Amazon will give me a full refund.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst phone", "Author": "E. Watson \"EW\"", "ReviewID": "R1HT2QGJAGC88X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first LG phone that I have purchased.  I was skeptical about LG phones, because I have always thought they are low quality cell phones.  I was right and should have followed my instinct.  I bought the LG KS360 unlocked phone for my daughter on her birthday.  At that time, they only had the European unlocked version, and I paid close to $200 for it.  The reason why I bought it is because my daughter had really wanted the look of the phone and for the texting feature.  About 3 months later, this phone started having problems. The screen started freezing when you slide the keyboard open.  It happened only once in a while, so my daughter kept on using it.  4 months later, the screen started going blank, freezing, had some colored lines, and all other things you can imagine.  In other words, the phone has stopped working!!!  I have contacted the LG company but told me that since it is an unlocked international phone, they can't do anything about it, and the warranty has already expired.  I contacted the LG company in UK and was told that it sounded like this phone needs repair.  Never would I purchase another LG phone!! I have never had a phone that lasted only 7 months.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad phone", "Author": "Dwayne Porr \"Dporr\"", "ReviewID": "R3FBV9W0NUYQWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone with great emotion I was looking for one like that but I had not found it, however my experience with the phone has not been as good as I thought.The phone goes off when I'm using it, if I enter the menu remains stuck around 30 seconds, the battery does not last a day.Overall the phone seems to be used and I wonder if it is for this reason that they sell the phone without guarantee, I am completely disappointed with what I received, it was not what I expected I lost my money.I do not live in the united states and for me it is more expensive to buy online, and after this disappointment with this seller and this phone I dont think I will buy in this way again because what you sent me is a product that does not work and obviously the advertising is a complete lie and i'm mad and completely disappointed.I hope you'll can have a reference and dont commit the same mistake I made because what they sell here DOES NOT WORK AND IS A WASTE OF MONEY.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dreamed", "Author": "Luis Miguel Zapata \"Lmasters\"", "ReviewID": "RZIDTG6DNCNEU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This Cell phone was my perfect gift for my girlfriend Patricia, she liked too much and she feelt very happy when she recived this product..In my personal opinion, i think that this cellphone is very complete, 'cause has music, photos, video, bluetooth, contacts, internet..

The screen just went blank one day and has not showed the screen since. I read all the review's and still bought the phone because I liked the way it looked and I wanted somthing new. But it's not worth it. But do what you do. Just make sure you really think about it long and hard b4 you buy this cell phone.

I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NUMBER BUTTON BEING EXPOSED BECAUSE IT'S COVERED. I GET CLEAR RECEPTION, ITS INTERNET CAPABLE, SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD AND I CAN DOWNLOAD WHATEVER I WANT. IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES AND VIDEOS EVERYTHING COMES OUT SHARP AND CLEAR. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS GREAT GIFT.updated January 12/2012Still have my phone. Still love it and its still working, although not as perfect as it was when I 1st got it but its working nonetheless. The only thing I would say the owner should watch for and that is because it's happening to me.  Once you drop it a few too many times (and dropping it means by mistake not intentionally) it tends to cut off by itself at any given time. Also if you close it to hard it will shut off too. But like I said, that only happens when mistakenly dropped so don't let it drop. Other than that this is a dam fine phone and I love it. I know there are other up to date phones out there but when you find something that can take a licking and goes on ticking it's a keeper because it's become immune to abuse (LOL).", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "SIM did not register on the phone", "Author": "Karla", "ReviewID": "R38NE2U345CV01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so excited to get this phone, just my style...But when I put my SIM card in and fired it up it would not register my SIM card!!
