However users should be aware of several deficiencies that may affect their experience:1) Small amount of memory.2) Stability issues/older Android version 2.2.2 (hang-ups of the OS, SD card disconnections, WiFi problems).3) Battery life. Must recharge daily, turning off WiFi when not used is recommended.4) No 4G.5) Poor quality camera. No front camera.6) Somewhat problematic headphones socket (must push that 3.5 mm jack hard down, not every jack is working well with it).Pros:1) Great quality hardware keyboard.2) Small but acceptable quality touch screen.3) Small size, light.4) Wifi, BT.5) Surprisingly fast response for a 600 MHz CPU.In overall, it is a good phone that does the job. It already survived unscathed one fall from approx 1 yard height to the hard floor, so it is relatively sturdy (no comparison to the brick style Palm Treo or Nokia old style brick phones, these could really take great deal of punishment and survive, falls to the concrete, rubbing with the metal keys in the pocket etc. - this phone would not survive such punishment).

Works great though the Android is a bit outdated but still runs everything I throw at it.  I kind of prefer some things on that version.  The keyboard is great.  Be careful pulling out the battery.  There is a little plastic tab to pull on on the buttom.  Otherwise the battery contact wires can be bent and the phone can refuse to turn on or charge in which case those wires need to be adjusted to make sure they have not been bent in, etc.  This is based on my research when I could not turn it on one day.  I took the battery our for about a minute as one repair suggested and made sure the battery contact wires from the phone were nice and straight.  I did pull the battery out using my nails before I realized there is a tab on the bottom for that.  I am keeping it on airplane mode without an SIM card.  When I first turned it on it would not unlock possibly because there was no SIM card so I put in the one from my phone and it unlocked.  I then removed the SIM card and it has not asked for one since.  I also tried using the phone and it worked fine.

I had to \"root\" the phone in order to remove the excessive unwanted bloatware (unwanted/un-needed apps) included with the phone that cannot be removed through normal means. Then I had more internal memory, but still not enough. I partitioned the MicroSD card (I replaced the included 2GB MicroSD card with a purchased 8GB), installed Link2SD, and now have more than 200 working apps on this phone.If you want to truly unlock the full potential of this device, I highly recommend rooting the phone, partitioning the MicroSD card, and linking all apps/libraries using Link2SD app.This phone's firmware does not support ROM swap, in case you are looking for a phone that does.The battery is short on longevity so plan to buy an adapter to charge in your car, and plan to bring your charger with you everywhere. Using WiFi continuously will drain the battery very quickly.Overall, I gave this phone 5 Stars because what it may lack in features compared to powerful Droid Razors, when configured properly, it will easily outperform other phones in its same size class!

MP3 player is perfect!", "Author": "William E. Baldwin", "ReviewID": "R1FTC7TI7ZISVD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Today, I ordered this cell, it is actually the second one I bought. The first I broke :(4/5 stars because the battery life could be a lot longer.So what is good/ bad.Good:Great size, not to big, not to small. The Android OS works great, I get my g-mail, youtube, (which I do a LOT on youtube)You have Twitter and Facebook integration as expected. I do not and will not use these services on my phone, but it is there if you want it. The touch screen works great,scrolling up/down, etc and it responds as it should. Micro SD card up to 32Gigs for your pics/music, etc as expected. Open micro USB charging port so every single wall charger/car charger that we have works regardless of who makes the phone except of course for crApple. I watch youtube videos through wi-fi and it looks and sounds great, I get news feeds from my tech channels and blogs, all work perfect.About the design:Like I said above, not to big, not to small, fits in your pocket comfortably, but get a car holder for your mp3 player. The keyboard as you know is under the screen, slides up to expose it, nice and smooth slide. Not sticky, does not make a clicking sound, etc. Best of all the keys, they are RUBBER not cheep plastic! They work great, and feel awesome. The rubber makes your fingers grip the keys so you don't slide around to much, you get great feeling feedback through your fingers. Perfect QWERTY keyboard. I hate the on screen keyboard's on the i-sheep devices, and what not because I can not FEEL the keys. You know that keyboard feeling on your desktop? Imagine what it would feel like with a flat keyboard that did not have the feeling and sound of the clicking of the keys?  No not right, would be weird..These don't click, but are not supposed to, but still feel great.Anyways...The Micro SD card is behind under the back cover. I was looking all around the sides of the phone like most others, then found it when I just decided to look where the battery is.Ok so the bad:The battery as usual kinda sucks. Like one day charge. I know that is actually GOOD compared to more expensive and much more powerful smart phones, but is annoying. Like if you go to work, then forget it in the car powered on.. then go home 9 hours later and it is dying or is dead. Keep a car charger with you. Power off when not being used for hours. Charge it at night or when you sleep also.Also the phone takes hours to charge. (like 3-4 give/take)  Not a bad thing if you are going to bed, but if it dies in the afternoon and you are going out, again, bring a car charger.The global GPS settings are on by default. This only helps you finds things on maps, and what not. Most of the time it is not useful, and KILLS battery life. Turn it off if you don't need it and you WILL see a large improvement. (Plus there are security issues with it.. tracking and spying and yea.)Overall:I recommend this product for anybody wanting a cheep, efficient Android phone that is UN-locked.Buy a micro SD card to go with it as the internal storage is a joke. (Think about 80 Megs minus the OS)Buy a car charger and maybe an other wall charger as the battery sucks.Great design, keyboard has rubber keys and feels great.Hope this helps.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Deceiving Description", "Author": "Karyn Clark", "ReviewID": "R13MYUCS8ZMHO4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My daugher decided to purchase this phone as she wanted a full keyboard as well as a smartphone.

Berge", "ReviewID": "R1LLDX7JBB06UO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first Smart Phone, my last phone was a Sony Ericson Walkman E350 which was basically a feature phone.  My expectations were low because I knew this was three year old design running a very old version of Android, and on the low end when it was new.  Despite this, it ran almost every App I was interested in, other than Netflix which was a slideshow.  I mostly bought this for the Keyboard for the text messaging, but was pleasantly surprised with the Apps.  It doesn't have a front facing camera so it isn't practical for Video Skype calls, though it makes audio calls just fine.  Running the Skype Software didn't even offer the option for video calls so it might be a hardware limitation so the software doesn't enable it. It runs Youtube just fine, in fact I like the Android App interface better than the Xbox App, which is useless.  I subscribe to a lot of Channels so this should get a lot of youtube use.  It seems fast and responsive, but this being my first touch screen device, I have nothing to compare it to.  Facebook works fine. My only real complaint is the lack of storage and all the crapware At&T; installed on it without the option to uninstall it.  I'm currently looking into the option of Rooting it, but have to do more research on the matter.  I would like to move more programs to the SD card, but they can't be moved either.  I've only been able to install 3 apps before running out of phone space, then I can't receive text messages either.  Still, this phone is a great deal if you just want a phone with a decent keyboard for texting.  I really wanted a sidekick, but couldn't afford it.Update: It can be rooted, but you can't get any space back from the pre-installed apps.  You can only get more space installing a Rom image to replace the original.  I've been to two message boards that were working on one, but they were never able to get it working 100%.  Eventually they gave up because the Sharps sold the rights to the phone and both companies kept referring them back and forth to the other.  Whatever test roms they produced are dead links now. I eventually had to uninstall all my apps and just use the default Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube apps because eventually the caches fill up phone memory.  Plus all the Apps seem to only want to install to the main memory.  I have a 2gb SD card and can only save pictures and video to it.  There is only about 160mb of memory to install apps.  Also, the whatever programs I did manage to install to the SD card would crash because the connection to the SD card is problematic.  I was always unloading and loading to get twitter to work.  Avoid this phone, isn't worth the bother.  Pay the xtra $100 to get a phone with at least 1gb of memory too.  If it says the phone has 512mb, then it isn't enough for the android OS, phone apps, and whatever crapware they install. Make sure the phone is very popular and had a lot of sales so you'll be sure the rooting community made Roms for.  This phone just didn't have big enough following to warrant the effort to create custom roms.
