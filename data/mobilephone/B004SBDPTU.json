{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This  Samsung  is filled with simplicity and reliability", "Author": "ajtoophan", "ReviewID": "R6NT1AP62YSHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the immediate future, I needed  a simple  phone with WIFI, camera, media player, radio, long battery life and reliability; the Samsung Ch@t  S-3350 qualified immediately.It has only 12 main sections  in the menu; they divide into  submenus accordingly. They are easy to access and use. Some require some search. The WIFI ,strangely to me , was tucked away as the 9th option inside the APPS  folder  way down the list. I expected it to be on top of the list since the phone physically is branded \"WIFI\" ; but no biggy,  because a shortcut key can be assign to it so it can be accessed immediately. Shortcut keys are easy to assign. Just press an available key and hold for couple of seconds and the phone will prompt to assign almost any function. Very easy, very convenient and practical.The WIFI is easy to connect ; once connected, depending on the network, it stays connected. Someone complained that wifi when left on drained the battery, I found thatBrowsing and download speed is as fast as my laptop. I was able to open Netflix for few seconds before I was prompted \"insufficient memory\"! This IS my MAJOR complaints with  the Chat.It  will often run out of memory and will prompt \"insufficient memory\" and sits trying to re launch endlessly.I tried to assign the SD memory card as default memory, but it did not help. I did some research online but found no solution. Someone in his review reported the same issue ,but he took it as a natural part of the way the phone is designed. So it seems I will have limited choices of Internet browsing. I called Samsung for advice. I ended up with a total idiot! Who not only was ignorant  but also uncooperative. She thought the device was made in the UK!! And refused to help me because she only does US help!! (This is Samsung???).>UPDATE: NOV 11:Shortly after this review was published, I contacted Samsung again. This time, a knowledgeable representative responded to may call and was very  helpful(Thank you). He assisted me in resetting the memory and did trouble shooting. As a result,I noticed some improvement in browsing speed but still encountered insufficient memory blocks.  At the end, my conclusion is that this device has some memory limitation in processing websites with high memory needs and it must be accepted as is; so for the time being, as it stands, I still like the phone. I know it will serve me well, and in the future I will look for similare phones without the same issue.(Thank you Samsung!)I don't use social networks, but I signed up for Facebook to watch the YU55 meteor passing earth. Logging in was almost instant; I was impressed. Youtube access has no issues but watching videos depends on the video quality itself. There is a slight delay during playing but nothing out of the ordinary.Picture download is fast and of good quality.>UPDATE November 16:Spending more time with this phone downloading pictures I am MORE impressed. I had to seacr Google map for an address and found out that I can actually downlaod a picture of the distentation map to use in my trip!!Very Very useful.I used it on \"spaceweather.com and it downloaded pictures of the sun and sky maps without any glitch. I found out though that it doesn't support \"pic.gif\" format. But other than that I can't praise it enough.The radio is excellent. Must plug in the headphones to start it, then  can opt for speaker function which is very nice and clear. And, of course,  there is an option to record what the radio is playing. Nice!Keyboard buttons  are little small, I was worried at first ,but I got used to them and found myself liking them more than other phones with bigger buttons. (If you have large size fingers , you will have difficulties) .The buttons are ergonomically designed for ease of texting. There is even a preinstalled game of typing which is an awesome way to get familiar with the buttons. Very smart feature to have on the Ch@t, I like that a lot.Camera is  acceptable to me., both video and still There are few changes to the setting to improve quality, but still limited. For what the phone is intended to, it is good enough.Play back of movies is OK. The screen is very crisp and sound quality is high. So far it worked only in the 3GP configuration with great resolution and clarity. Sometimes the pictures slow down or freeze momentarily. Sometimes there is a lag between sound and picture, but hardly noticeable because of the screen size.  Strange thing was, the volume dropped when using the headphone while video play back. I used the supplied headphone and another, my own, with the same results, even when the volume was turned to level 14-the highest, the sound was barely clear. I found no explanation or a remedy for this.Battery is very decent; about a 36-48+ hours of calling /Internet and viewing of movies. When the battery icon is empty it beeps for ever. It will go on  about 5-6 hours until completely dead , but still can make/receive calls. This is the mark of Samsung batteries. One slight issue is the charging time :3 hours exactly. I think it is because of the international charger supplied with it. Here in the US we are still using electric voltage at 110volts, so my guess is that the charger (international specs) is giving half its output so it takes 3 hours; but no problem. Just allocate charging to nighttime during sleep and all is good. I intend to buy an additional battery and a car charger for emergencies anyway.Speaking of batteries, one more thing  about this device (a minor inconvenience) is that  after battery is charged and the phone is re-powered up, the time settings must be reset from the start. The device doesn't memorize time settingWhat I don't like about it:-PRICE, compared other phones these days that can do much more , the price is high; This is only 2G phone with 2MP camera and very limited app range ; it should, in my opinion, be around the $65 mark  and no more-LOCKS out too quickly , couldn't find the option to control the lock of screen.-LIMITATION of browsing due to memory issues-USB cable not supplied with phone; makes it very difficult to transfer videos or music.-PREDICTIVE testing sometimes doesn't give the \"obvious\" choice-TOUCH pad sometimes goes into \"hyper drive\" mode and becomes difficult to control, even with sensitivity turned down to lowest possible setting-someone suggested it is the type of static electricity humans have, which varies.-ALARMS must be deactivated to shut up completely, otherwise they will nag forever; pressing \"Confirm\" will not silence them. This is annoying in the morning. But this is common in all Samsungs I owned.-Bad choice of keyboard colors (purely personal preference-I don't like gray and gold together!) and LACK of red and green for Call/End buttonsWhat I like:-Simplicity-Quality of construction of device-Battery life-Radio and radio recording-Voice recorder-Keyboard ergonomics-Volume control hard key-easy to use-Dictionary function. Fantastic. I use it in every class with my students. They  are getting bored hearign me praise it!!-WIFI , even it has problems, is indispensable.I love this phone-Menu is simple enough for meAt the end of the day, I  really like this phone despite its quirks and Samsung's Unhelpfulness. If you buy it without higher expectation than what it does, you will be happy to have it and it will serve you well.Good luck", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Frustrated!", "Author": "Michael E.

I found them all in this phone, at an affordable price.Getting the back cover off was a bit tricky, and there's even a little warning in the packaging about being careful not to damage your fingernails when trying to open it. (Seriously) Once I got the SIM card and battery installed I fired up the phone and went through the initial setup options, which were simple. I had a look at the available menu options etc, and setup the WiFi access which was easy. It's found under Apps then you simply turn on WiFi and it searches for available signals. Once you select the access point and enter the password (if necessary to gain access) you're up and running. The Browser is pretty basic, but gets the job done for simple browsing on sites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc. The phone has quick icon shortcuts to the various social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, MSN, Yahoo, which take you directly to the specific website. You can then logon and update your status, check e-mails, chat, etc.The camera was basic as well, and does not have flash, but I found it to take good quality pictures and video when enough lighting is available. The music and video player work fine also and it uses the regular 3.5mm headphone jack. Stereo earbuds are provided with a built in mic for hands free talking.All in all, it's quite a package for the price, considering it is for a teenager. In fact I was so impressed with its ability to perform well with the features it does have, I am looking at getting another for my wife. Obviously, if you're looking for a phone with a high megapixel camera, large screen, and other high end options, you would not be looking at this phone in the first place.So if you look at the product description and you are satisfied with the specifications the phone offers, you will be satisfied with your purchase.
