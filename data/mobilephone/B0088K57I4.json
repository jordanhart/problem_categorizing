While it does have a big visible screen it fits in my hand perfectly!I love the camera it is wonderful. The one on the front isn't as good but if you set a 2 second times you can easily take the picture of yourself as well.I must admit I drop the poor thing quite often :( BUT it has been holding up and doing great I bought a case and it has not a scratch or a dent on it.Its very nice and can be personalized to fit youI use ovoo on my phone and it shows up pretty clear and I have lots of fun seeing friend and family while away at collegeIt allows me to view my school work on my phone. I can open XL, Word and Powerpoints on here its pretty efficientAfter downloading the dolphin browser this thing is unstoppable and does things VERY fast.I just love this phone and actually decided to get this over an iphone. I personally feel iphones are over rated and this phone is better. You can expand the space by upgrading the memory card. While it doesn't have Siri you can still download a VERY similar app with a different name. I am also able to use and access emoji's on here as well. My email comes right to me.Its just a great phone and my bill is $40 a month you can not beat that anywhere", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "best phone on boost, best phone I've ever had", "Author": "azb", "ReviewID": "R2UY49T84PNSN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an iphone 3gs on att (constant drop calls), samsung ultra transform (awesome phone, not 4g), Lg margee (Great phone, better reception than the ultra transform, good camera) and finally I got the design 4g ( Love the new ice cream system, the camera is one of the best, the 4g is great, so great much to say about the phone.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "best phone ever with a fast and reliable service provider!

I may miss a few items, and some of the technical features or fixes to bugs are above my modest level of smartphone knowledge.CALL QUALITY, LOG, & CONTACTSVoice quality on both ends is average. It may be enhanced with a good headset.  The speakerphone is terrible **weak on a call or audio playback.  The call history log is virtually limitless. Typing on the numeric virtual keypad, the phone bank searches for the full ten digits in the call bank or contacts. The keypad can be hidden by tapping the icon in lower left corner. During a call, the screen locks while pulled to your face and unlocks when extended away.  Contacts can receive multiple labels, specific ringtones, be blocked or routed to voicemail and organized into groups.  Save your contacts to microSD as VCF files and send to your next Android.  RadioShack and other stores also have devices that assist in address book transfer from phone to phone. Customize ringtones to contact assignments from factory music app.  Voicemail has a feature that saves your messages to the [voicemail] system and your phone's audio records.  The voicemail notification on my phone is buggy because I checked and deleted all my messages but still get notified of a phantom voice message.  I have lost data after two factory master resets to correct this.  HTC offers a PC suite for backing up your device which I have not yet installed.INTERNET 4G/3G, HOTSPOT, BROWSERI was attracted to this phone for the 4G hotspot feature. This allows me the typical benefits of a smartphone plus internet for my other devices as needed.  I encountered a snafu with the 4g after about two months of ownership, however. The server redirected me repeatedly to Clear Wireless's website.  I didn't know what was wrong.  I contacted Boost technical support complaining, went through all the code entry motions, and even did a couple battery removal boots.  Same deal: no 4G service--but 3G still worked where available.  Boost deceived me regarding the cause of the 4G blackout.  Finally they told me after all the time I spent calling them and troubleshooting my phone that they are blocking customer 4G once they reach 2.5gb usage until next billing period.  So I thought I could save my 4G for when I needed it, just using 3G.  I used 3G mostly all last month then attempted to turn on 4G. My 4G was blocked again. Boost never told me that 2.5gb in either mode would cause block.  They claim that they grew faster than anticipated so high use customers are being blocked in 4G mode... while 3G is unlimited.  If you go to Settings>Usage you can set a warning to notify you of data usage in a specific billing cycle.  However, it does not distinguish between 3G usage and 4G--which is actually moot for any purpose other than how much you're being ripped (in 3G) because 2.5gb reached in either mode means no more 4G.  This is the highest price I've paid for a cellular so they'll need to fix their network with the quickness or else. The hotspot feature costs an extra $10 monthly and works well. Save time by turning off and on from \"Quick Settings\" in notifications bar. The Design factory browser is okay but lacking some basics. Touching the url address bar does not highlight full field. You may have to tap again, click \"Select All (text)\" then enter your new web page if not in your bookmarks.  Zoom magnification is a pinch or double tap of your screen.  Your bookmarks can be added to one of your seven home screens with url icon. Also, factory Task Manager doesn't completely kill tabs, windows, and browser history. You must do these manually if you don't have an app like Task Killer to do it.CAMERA, DISPLAY, BATTERYThe camera on here is satisfactory. The pictures are crisp and in low light it makes an outside snapshot taken at 7:45pm dusk look like it was taken at 6:15pm without flash.  The flash can be turned off or left on automatic. Turn the phone horizontally for panoramic videos and stills. I think the weird vertical snaps are only good for tall structures. Its picture file size is 550-800kb--just over half the memory used by my 5mp Nokia.  Pics may be edited (e.g., cropped) or renamed inside device. Shutterbugs, be advised that there is **no lanyard hole for your wrist strap or necklace. The touch display is sharp for my taste. In low light though I like my screen dim to save power and vision.  There's a widget containing brightness but once you go up you'll have to tap Menu>Settings>Display>Brightness to bump brightness all the way down again (unlike Samsung's single button five brightness levels).  The battery on here is decent.  Mine stays on intravenous because of all the features.  Low signal reception drains battery on any phone so airplane mode is available if safe to go offline.  Unlike my Nokia, Bluetooth is not possible while airplane mode is turned on.  You'll need a wired headset to continue music playback.GOOGLE MAPSThe GPS is improved with each update.  While it is not integrated, the GPS uses the accelerometer now to get you to a destination when cellular reception is lost.  Just stay in the Maps app or in background; otherwise it'll forget where you are located. The speech recognition (speak destination) is one of my faves when I can't type. One prob I have is avoidances.  You'll have to tap Menu>Settings>Route & Alternatives each trip to avoid toll roads or highways. It doesn't simply memorize that you wish to avoid tolls by default.  Another feature missing is \"not my destination\" nor can you add places per my knowledge.  The screen brightness must be adjusted manually from Settings (per my knowledge) or home screen widget.MUSIC, BLUETOOTHI put a 59gb microSD in mine, so my storage capacity is stoopid.  What I dislike about this phone and my old Samsung is that it mixes AMR files and other audio like podcasts with my music.  I could be bopping my head one minute to a music file, then a tinny ringtone or voice note comes on.  The only way to fix this is by creating playlists. My Nokia separates AMRs from MP3/WMA and podcasts from music. An old Motorola used a file's folder to determine its library. Naturally, this is a nuisance for me. As I mentioned earlier, the external speaker is very weak for music playback too. Your only hope is a quiet environment or an amplified headset. The bluetooth file transfer wants you to confirm acceptance of files... even from trusted sources.UII still like the grey Gingerbread keyboard better than this ICS keyboard, but I'm getting to learn it.  There is a daatkom button on there for some fields and speech recognition button also.  Sometimes I have to change orientation of the device because the accelerometer causes the phone to freeze by not allowing scrolling to a new field. I'm impressed with the copy + paste text feature as it is very accurate. Another bug it has is its jumpy, bad shot cursor. **When editing or deleting text, you may have to highlight it for cutting because simply pressing backspace may delete other text in the field. So, the cursor will pulsate at the spot where you want it but the text being deleted is in a different paragraph or sentence. Selecting the undesired text will keep the cursor where you want it.**  Adobe Reader is not pre-installed. You'll have to download from Play Store. The alarms, clocks, and timer features on here are nice and dependable.  I haven't even scratched the surface yet but there's a stopwatch, food (culinary) timer, and world clock. The alarms can be programmed for days of the week, calendar dates and other scheduling. This phone is unique to me because it has a SIM card slot near battery.  So even if your card doesn't function in GSM mode, you'll at least have a spot so it won't be lost outside a device. Both the SIM and memory card are kept under battery compartment cover--not hot swappable.In conclusion, I recommend this phone in spite of its flaws and newly restrictive, always difficult-to-reach carrier.  Hopefully Boost will lift 4G restrictions and improve their tech support and client communication in near future.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from older Boost phones", "Author": "Dave \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R270X6IKTL84M4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all-- the things that first impressed me coming from the Samsung Prevail:MUCH faster downloads.Web pages load much faster.phone operates must faster.finally--able to get rid of the icons for stupid apps I don't use anyway.Finally able to REMOVE stupid apps I dont use anyway.Came with than half of the stupid apps I never used and couldn't remove from the prevail.Screen is significantly  bigger (taller) even though phone is only about 1/2 inch tallereverything looks better on the much better screenversion of gmail is good, not totally aggravating to use as in the prevailstill can use any of my mp3s as ring tonewas able to just swap the old mini SD card from my old samsung and all the music and photos and their folders transfered over no problem.Sound is much better than the prevailtouch screen is much better than the prevail.easily transferred over acct at the store I bought it at (although I've done this before online and it was also very easy to do)Still have my TRUE unlimited plan at my low shrinkage rate.about 1.5 gigs of memory on the phone, with about 1.1 gigs free space when you get it out of the box.

Having owned several phones after switching to Boost over 2 years ago, this is first Android device to come to Boost that makes you feel like you got your monies worth. At nearly $100-140 cheaper than the Galaxy S II, I am sure you will not be disappointed with this device. Overall the Galaxy S II might be a more powerful phone (however poorer screen), but upgrading any previous Boost phone to this HTC will make you feel like you have finally stepped into the 21st century.The most impressive feature on this phone is the screen. The resolution is awesome making for an ultra-clear viewing experience.Performance... this device can bog down to the point it is annoying, however this occurs rarely and can be used as an indicator for you to restart the phone. This is simply done by holding down the power button and then selecting \"Restart\" from the menu that appears. 95% of the time this device runs smoothly and efficiently.I run this device all day, on wi-fi, and still have plenty of battery at the end of the day. In reality, you could go 1.5 days on this phone with minimal use and still be fine. With heavier use, such as surfing on your phone for 2-3 hours and playing 1-2 hours of Sprinkle (great game BTW), will drop the battery level to the point where it might need to be plugged in an hour or two earlier than normal.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "All around good phone.", "Author": "Amber Worth \"Say something about yourself!\"", "ReviewID": "R3M8R8KPLTCPBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because my regular phone as well as the backup for it were dead.  I was told that I could return it in 30 days, and so... left with this phone, fully intending to trade up to the Galaxy SII when it came out.When the time came to return the phone and switch, I liked it too much.It does absolutely everything I need it to.Pros:- Great camera (though the auto white balance is a little over aggressive)- Great Audio (catches high, mid and low range well, plus the volume is not damped too much to drive bigger headsets)- Great Voice Quality during calls- Loud enough speaker phone- Responsive GUI (touchscreen keyboard & such)- Enough RAM to run all the stuff I download.- Enough onboard memory to hold all the stuff that I can't put on the SD card.  (This actually really surprised me.  It was originally one of my biggest fears and one of the reasons I had planned to take the phone back, but so far, I have never had a problem.)Cons:- Battery that comes with it never ever makes it all the way through the day.- Had to get a case to correct 2 problems:== The plastic cover on the bottom stopped staying in place after only a few days.== There was nothing protecting the glass from direct impact (no ridge around the glass for protection).- Looses DATA connection when switching between towers a lot or when switching between 4g and something else.  That might be a carrier issue though.  This only happens with data though.

Call reception is slightly better than my Galaxy Prevail but there are occasional dropped calls on the Sprint network.The 4G coverage isn't as complete I thought in the Chicago suburbs. I don't need it in the house, but when I walk around the neighborhood there is no 4G even though it shows up on the coverage map. The 3G wireless, however, is better than the Galaxy Prevail. Pandora goes from one song to the next pretty quickly. Podcasts stream quickly. When I am in  4G territory which is pretty frequently when I drive around the Chicago Metropolitan area, my web experience is very good.The camera is great. I like that there is enough internal memory for all of my apps.Battery life with everything on is poor. I keep the phone plugged in a lot of the time. I'll probably look for apps that help maximize battery life.Voice commands and voice to text work fantastically.One bad experience that I'd like to touch upon is the case of a phantom voicemail icon or a voicemail icon that wouldn't go away.This is from not deleting all messages on my previous phone. The only way to get rid of this is to1) take your previous phone or preferably a non-smart phone and to switch your account to this phone2) leave yourself a message3) delete this and all other messages4) switch the Boost service back to your HTC Evo Design 4GThis got rid of my problem. I sought help with this problem from Boost, and none of the many, many things we did helped including deleting my voicemail account and reprogramming my phone.I really love this phone, but of course with all of these caveats, I cannot give it a 5 star rating, but this phone is too wonderful despite all the negatives to give it a three star.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Few things to know before you buy!", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R38RJSTVPGM1LI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi everyone. I've been using BlackBerry's all my life, from Verizon to Sprint and then finally to MetroPCS's BlackBerry. After two years, I decided to try an Android and this is, in fact, my first Android phone ever and I love it. After being in so many contracts and paying so much, BoostMobile offers a reliable service with 4G in most places. If it's not 4G then it's 3G, which it's still fast!Anyways, here are some few things that might help. Buying this phone on Amazon.com is no different than buying it through BoostMobile.com. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you might find the price of this phone on Amazon a few dollars cheaper than BoostMobile.com. Other than that, it all comes the same. In it's original packet. It's like you bought it on BoostMobile.com.Also, if you're a new customer, you would have to pay the first month upon activation, which for this phone is better if you get the Unlimited Monthly Plan one. No activation fee. You can do it all online, which it's great!The monthly fee is cheap. $55 for unlimited EVERYTHING, which it's great as well.The phone is nice.

The HTC Evo Design 4G is huge improvement in many ways: Speed, memory, ice cream sandwich, front camera, surprisingly large screen for the size, much better rear camera, and a load of features that include turning on the speaker by turning the phone over. It does everything I want. But one thing convinced me to go with this phone instead of the Galaxy SII 4G: the clever and sturdy rear panel. The Prevail and the SII both have very cheap plastic rear panels that pop off if the phones hit the floor or another surface from as little as two feet. The batteries also fall out. On the SII, it's difficult to reattach the back securely.On the EVO, the back panel isn't just sturdy and substantial. Only one small segment at the bottom opens. Once that nice textured piece slides off, another piece has to open before the battery will come out. The microSD card also gets extra protection. It goes inside the compartment, which allows access with the battery in or  out.

Afterwards I moved on to the Samsung Captivate, which is a Galaxy S phone. When the time came to upgrade I decided to drop the contract and try out Boost Mobile as Sprint has awesome coverage in my area. The Evo Design 4G met the price range I was looking for as I couldn't afford the higher end Galaxy phones and I had a good experience with my original Hero.When the phone arrived I was immediately impressed with the build quality and the way the phone felt in my hand. Wow! I couldn't believe it. It was a world of difference to my several other pre-paid phones and my wife's dumb phone slider, even my Captivate. It feels solid in the hand, without feeling heavy. The semi-rubberized back of the phone does not feel slippery in my hand.My wife has a regular slider phone, and she is not a fan of smart phones at all. After having the phone for three months and constantly bragging about it my wife took it from me and loves it. She brags to everyone around and loves the phone more than I do.Everything about the phone has been excellent from radio coverage to speed and use. The GPS has nearly instant locks and the apps that use it, bike apps and such, work great. I'm not much of a gamer on the phone, but the few I play work as well as my Galaxy S. The camera rocks, and my house is very low light, and video is equally impressive.I do have two complaints. The back of the phone gets a little hot after serious use, but cools off quickly. This hasn't been a serious issue, but is something to consider if you plan to spend a lot of time using the phone without a headset or bluetooth. And the second complaint is the Amazon Appstore App is absolutely useless.

The \"Chinese New Year\" theme is amazingly beautiful.There are a lot of options to customize this phone to exactly how you see fit. The only thing I suggest on EVERY Android phone is downloading an app called \"Handcent\" which lets you customize your text messaging program on all levels.

I bought it as a cheap upgrade from the Galaxy Prevail, and at first, I thought it was the greatest phone ever. I didn't start using it heavily until about a month in and that's when I started noticing the faults. First, the battery life is a bit sub-par. Lasts about half the day before I need to urgently seek an outlet. Then, I noticed to doesn't really run all the games I want it to run, which that big of an issue because I can live without them. Another fault I felt was pretty significant was the speaker and speaker volume. When watching netflix on my phone, unless I have headphones, I eventually give up watching. The speaker is on the back, which makes it very diffilcult to watch and listen good at the same time. Also, some apps (like netflix) don't pump out a great deal of volume, which in combo with a backside speaker make it near impossible to enjoy. One more issue I had with the phone is that there's no way to remove HTC Sense. I started growing tired of the same lock screen and app screen, and I just wanted the stock Android 4 UI.Other than that, the camera's are great, the touch screen is greatly responsive.

It has disappointed me greatly. Although the internal storage is great, I have at least 43 apps downloaded in addition to the bloatware it came with and plenty space left. The back camera is awesome and whats best of all about it is that it has the best speaker quality I have ever had in a Smartphone. My kids watch Netflix on it and you can hear it LOUD and CLEAR without having max volume. I also have to admit that I have rarely had an issue with it completely freezing or shutting off prematurely. I have only had to pull the battery once since I had it and it has only restarted on me twice in 3 months. However, even with those good qualities it lacks speed seriously. The single core processor is very apparent. It often lags very badly even with just swiping through my screens. Worst of all the call connection is super slow. It's not Boost, I have never had this issue with my other Boost android phones. I literally sit there for nearly 10 to 15 seconds sometimes waiting for my call to connect and go through. My husband has the same phone and he has all the same issues I have. I have to actually look at the screen again to make sure it didn't hang up. And nope! it's still sitting there waiting to connect the call.Also, I download pics people send me and they take days to show up in my gallery. I can find them in my SD card but not in the gallery. Then several days later, there they pop up!The lagging and slow call connect I can no longer deal with. I am changing to a faster phone with a dual core processor. Oh and the front camera is very poor.The phone is also smaller then previous 4\" screen phones I have had, such as the ZTE Warp and also the Motorola Triumph. Maybe it's just that it has a less square shape and slimmer width. But it feels small to me in comparison. I would not recommend this phone if speed is important to you. I fear if I had an emergency I would be long dead before my phone would get around to connecting me to 911. I'm at least glad I didn't pay the $300 for it when it first came out and only spent $179.

Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair. When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions. Now, the phone had to be reactivated, but that process failed even though I tried numerous times. Unbeknownst to me, the motherboard was replaced in the phone and the device now had a new MEID/serial number, which was not in the . Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service. HTC handed off this disaster to me with the claim that they took care of their responsibility to the buyer under warranty -- though, obviously their policy of repair with new MEID is responsible.This is not a one-time thing or a rant from me, one unsatisfied customer. Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day. They refuse to send me a phone which can be activated right away.Thus, I will never, ever buy another HTC phone (for instance, I had to buy yet another phone to be able to have service again and though an HTC phone was at a lower sales price, I chose to get a Samsung instead of throwing my money away with HTC).

However there are things I do like. I like the touch screen. For the most part, it is responsive. I like how I can customize my wallpapers. Downloading apps is pretty fast.

Did I wake them?HTC is on the job for you!!!!!I have never had such a outstanding phone that makes random calls.I love it. I love it. I love it. Can't wait for the \"While I'm sitting on the POT.\" App to come out. This way you can make phone calls while I'm going to the bath room too. By now so you don't miss out on this great phone. Order now and you can call your Mom while you... She changed your dirty ... as a baby and probably is still wondering how our movements are working. This phone will allow you to keep her updated every time you...God bless HTC for really thinking though their random dialing system.Old Post:What word best describes this phone? HATE!!!!!!Harsh? Yes, but honest.I give it 2 stars because it is a phone. It does do that.But here is what I hate about it:1. Battery life. Short, very short, can not go more then a few hours off charger. I have extra batteries for when I am not in my car or at the office or at home. If I go out for a few hours I run the risk of the phone dieing do to battery life. To fix this, I have an extra battery with me always just in case. Note, the phone is just on. So no music, no web searching, no calling, no movies, no texting, the phone is just on. That is it.2. Will not sync to computer, Windows 8. Downloaded HTC Sync, but will not help. Just says \"No Device Detected.\" I found a few posts with others complaining the same thing. Phone will not sync. There seems to be no solution.So again here is the problem. You  can't add movies, can't add photos, can't add music. What fools. And you can't say the old 90% of computer problems are operator malfunction. Blaaaa!! There is no programing required. You should be able to just hook it up and follow the pop ups. The computer shows it as \"Removable Disk (D:),\" but you can't access it. Thank you HTC, Google and Microsoft and who ever else had there hand in this pile.Note, I realize I can blame M.S. Windows, but even though it is a Google phone, much of the software is licensed by google from Microsoft to make the phone work.How did I find this out? I asked a friend who works for MS and he told me. That is why the phone, although a Gooogle platform feels and works like a Microsoft product. It has some Microsoft inside.  Odd bed fellows in deed. So who do you blame? Me for buying this joke I guess.3. Ring tone changes often. Now this is odd. your ring tone will change about every other week or so. The funny thing is that you are not expecting it, and you just sit or stand there thinking it's someones phone, and it is yours. There you are while others are looking at you as if to say, \"Aren't you going to answer your phone?\" I have to admit it is kind of funny you looking around to see who's phone is ringing.4. Crashes often. Need we say more on this one. Or it just reboots for no reason other then it's junk. Also programs just crash. Again we all see this one. We do not need to go into great detail.5. Camera quality is bad. Again, we all know what a bad photo looks like. Do not plan to take a lot of them with this phone. Dim lighting is the worst. You will still want a second camera for those special events. It's ok to make a photo of your Craigslist item I guess. But skip the B-day party.6. Makes random calls while you are sleeping. This is my favorite. You go to sleep with the phone in the room. You make a noise in your sleep, and the phone is still listening and thinks you want to make a call. So you wake up to the sound the the phone calling someone on your contact list. Yes it's 3am and you are calling your boss, client, mom, favorite pizza place or who or what ever. I have learned to put the phone in Airplane mode every night to keep it from calling people at 3am. What a piece of junk. Just goes to show you they don't test this junk do they. No it's lets get it to market as quick as we can and then blame operator error. Ya, nice try dumbies.Anyway, now you know why I hate this phone and just had to vent.Thank you for listening.P.S.

Listen, it's not a horrible phone. But it's not what I would call a good phone, either.The battery life stinks to high heaven. I'm lucky if it lasts 12 hours on any given day. I have to carry around the charger by default, even if I plan on coming back home soon. You never know if I'll stop somewhere for a cup of coffee and that time spent puts the current charge over the edge into drain-out territory.Also, when the battery is low (which is more often than not), the LED indicator flashes an obnoxious bright orange, and I cannot for the life of me figure out a way to shut it off. I even tried downloading a variety of apps to help manage this, to no avail. The light is blinding. I don't want to see that thing when the on-screen battery indicator is already clearly showing me the battery is low and I'm trying to send out one last text or social media update before the phone shuts off (e.g., \"Phone about to die, will be unreachable for a while, please send food and supplies.\")The processing power is weak. The apps open, sure. Most of them, anyway. But crashes are frequent and operating times are often slow.So much for the bad. The good? It's a smartphone. Okay, it's an average intelligence phone.

Also the phone, when in 4G, using hotspot, allows you to make calls with it while continuing to use the internet from your attached phones.  Not the case in 3G though.

So I tried using the other one that I ordered for my Mom and hers said the same thing. Was on the phone with boost for over an hour that day, they tried every reset they could try, then told me to wait 72 hours for a phone call from their engineers, engineers never did call, so today, February 22nd, I called them, they tried everything again, and still nothing. They have no answers as to what the problem might be, because they to, have no idea. So, it must be the phones themselves, I have paid $384.38 for these phones, protective covers and cases, not to mention 55 bucks worth of minutes on each phone, and have not been able to use them for almost a whoe week?? Is amazon a rip off??

Arnold", "ReviewID": "R9UJIWGA21PN4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had two of these phones now.  As another reviewer stated, customer service through HTC is *horrible*.  They will make you go through every step even if the only realistic answer is a hardware failure.  After all that, they inform you that you have to *pay* to ship them the defective phone, and you will get it back 2-3 weeks later fixed *if* it is defective.I could not bring myself to do this - why?  Because 2-3 weeks without a phone is outrageous.  Second, the problem is that the 3G antennae appear to be damaged easily, but not 'completely broken'.  Both phones had great reception when they first arrived.  They had DRASTIC reductions in coverage after being dropped.  This is dropping without noticeable damage in the outer shell.  I'm sure HTC would have sent the phone back either saying that it wasn't damaged (since the 3G technically still worked, and therefore it must be my 'area of coverage'), or that it was my fault that I dropped it (which may be true, I suppose... so don't get this phone if you ever ever might possibly ever drop it more than 6 inches).I think another reviewer's problem with reception even though it was stated online that he was in a good coverage area might have just been a defective 3G antenna upon arrival.  If the box got dropped or shaken too much in the mail, it could damage the 3G antenna.4G worked the same before and after dropping occurrences, but unfortunately I could not rely on 4G to get me through since it isn't in many areas yet.  Also, text messages don't seem to go out on 4G, only when 3G is active (maybe this is normal, I'm not sure).As far as the rest - Boost coverage has been much as it was while I was on Sprint (they do use the same network after all).  The phone itself is sleek.  It seems to have poor RAM memory (this is my first smart phone, so take that as you will, but I expected better speed and reliability).", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard problems", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R1SFTKP8AN414B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It came whit problems on the keyboard that u use on the Internet it disappears when I try to type something", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thanks boost !", "Author": "Rev charlie grear", "ReviewID": "R2FCNP1X9BDHS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wooooooooow been waiting & waiting for boost to come out with the evo !

I thought it was an excellent phone, but couldn't get a signal at my house.  I reviewed the coverage map which indicates a good signal before I bought the phone.  Just about every call I made from my house, inside or outside, was dropped.  I called for technical support and was walked through updating and resetting my phone.  I was also told that the tower servicing my area was undergoing maintenance.  The maintenance completion date came and went, and my phone signal was still terrible.  I could pick up my phone, see all signal bars highlighted, and immediately drop to NO signal.  I called for technical support again.  Once again I was walked through updating and resetting my phone.  The signal was no better.  At that point, my case was elevated to receive \"engineer\" support.  I called technical support  back a few days later.  I had not heard anything back from engineer support, my phone wouldn't work, and my 30 day warranty was about to expire.  I wanted to return the phone & needed a RA number.  I was told by a young man with a thick accent that I could barely understand that I would have to call on Monday as that office was closed on the weekend.  So I called Monday and was told that my 30 days had expired.....NO KIDDING!!!!  I was brushed off & strung along by technical service until the warranty expired.  They don't tell you that you can't arrange for returns on the weekend.  BEWARE!  They have customer service 7 days a week except on the weekends.  Now I'm stuck with a very expensive phone that I can't use at my house.  DON'T BUY FROM BOOST!
