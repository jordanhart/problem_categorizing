This kind is not the most practical for using the web(even per AT&T; reps), but more for texting.I've got texting disabled for cost reasons, but even after nearly 2 years, the touchscreen QWERTY keyboard is fairly easy to use.  Most functions on this phone soon become easy to understand, but several things I really appreciate are(1)Good Reception(many of my other neighbors have to take their phones outside to get reception, but my calls are crystal-clear throughout the house); very few calls dropped.(2)Great Battery Life--5 Hours for talking only (a blessing when my former phone battery, rated for 3 hours lasted only 1 1/2)(3)Great Camera & photo-editing ability--I can actually aim the phone at my computer monitor & get a picture looking close to the original; photo editing sometimes makes it hard to think I didn't actually download from the web!For those NOT really needing a Smartphone(& its costs), but good for texting & talking, THIS is the one for you.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unless your luck can win you the lottery, don't get this.", "Author": "Shogai", "ReviewID": "R3BGHGXBCJ7AQK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've unfortunately had an extremely terrible experience with this phone - even moreso than the other user who wrote about it randomly restarting. Before I go into details, here's a list of pros and cons after using this phone since last March until last month when I switched back to my older original Samsung Solstice (which is absolutely amazing).Pros:+ Battery life is above average, lasting for a few days of constant messaging.+ The touchscreen is responsive.+ The layout is easy to maneuver around.+ The SD card is much less of a hassle to get to and works more efficiently than the older Samsung Solstice.+ Solid design makes it hard to damage and the screen is solid enough to not need a protector unless you put keys in the same pocket or other objects capable of doing so.Cons:- Heats up to a concerning temperature from talking on the phone for more than 5-10 minutes.- The battery life while talking starts fine, but becomes rather horrendous as time goes on.- There is no touchscreen calibration option in the phone settings menus (unfortunate for people like me who type a little oddly).- The sound quality through the speaker is pretty tinny.- The phone restarts randomly when receiving or sending texts or calls.- If unlucky enough like me, it WILL start running incredibly slowly.I originally had the Samsung Solstice for 2 years and that phone was, and still is, incredible. The battery life is amazing, it has never had any issues with calls or texts, and has lasted even getting drenched in water due to someone knocking an open water bottle on it. Just take it apart and let it sit near a heat source (unfortunately I was in my college dorm so I had to be resourceful and prop the parts up behind my laptop heat fans) and it will be good as new in an hour. The only issues with it are that the screen becomes less responsive so you have to press slightly harder than normal touchscreen phones and that you could have Micro SD card issues. It would selectively choose to detect my inserted SD card or not but after reformating it on the phone a couple times, that problem seems to have disappeared. However, even after saying all these good things about the original, the Solstice II did not live up to what the original established.The main thing that I need to elaborate over just the list of cons is the last bullet, \"it WILL start running incredibly slowly\". When I first got the phone from AT&T; after the biannual upgrade, I had no problems. Everything seemed to run fantastically and I liked most of the new feelings and the extra screen sensitivity. However, after using it for a couple months, it started to restart approximately 1-2 times a week after receiving or sending a text. No big deal at first. Another month in, and it got more frequent. By October 2012, it would restart 3-4 times a day and started freezing even right after restarting the phone. Signs of this would be an incredible decrease in speed and response time on the phone itself. Opening a menu would take 3-5 minutes instead of instantaneous, trying to type a text turned into anywhere between a 4-10 minute project for something as simple as \"Be there in 2 minutes.\", and when it decided to freeze, you'd have to pop out the battery and wait 3-5 minutes before putting it in so it would start up again. It got to the point where it can't get past the home screen without freezing now, so I've left the battery out of it and have been using my original Solstice since November 2012 just until I find a new messaging phone (none of this newfangled smartphone nonsense).For anyone even looking at this page, please please please don't put yourself through the pain and aggravation of purchasing this phone.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Solstice 2", "Author": "Samuel Harper", "ReviewID": "R14C5TBVVC1PWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Phone is a smart phone for those who can not afford the high priced smart phones.

Call sound quality is absolutely poor even with full bars and the screen freezes randomly.One good thing about this phone is its sturdiness. I have dropped the phone a few times and still the scree has not a scratch. Battery life also seems decent and I also like the size of it. Besides that, I would stay far away from this thing.

First of all, this phone is indestructible! Relatively slim, light, and wearing a glass touch screen, this phone could have easily been fragile and useless beyond even its true capacity, But I can say that I have dropped this phone more than a million times and it works just the way it did when I first opened the box. The screen never cracks, however the battery back does fly off along with the battery if you drop it; at times this is comical to me.  Another striking advantage to this device is its stereo speakers. The sound quality of the external speakers are louder than that of most smartphones, music players, and mp3s. I compared the speakers to the IPhone's and they are indistinguishable in quality and possibly louder in volume. Another notable plus is the phone's battery life, which will last me two days or so of frequent texting, browsing, and calling without the need of charging the battery.  The phone does not drop calls that I have noticed, but has one major defect that really has ruined the phone for me entirely since the beginning. On a bad/unlucky day this phone will shutdown or restart at random, when you get a text/call, or press any button. This is beyond annoying and happens all the time in the worst situations possible. I press a button and the screen turns black and shuts down. If I happen to notice it doing this I have to restart the phone and wait to redo whatever I was doing. If I was about to send a text (many times a very long one) it will restart and lose my text, forcing me to rewrite it. If I was receiving a text or call it will shutdown and I will have to wait until it reboots to see it. Sometimes I will be searching the Internet and it will shut down when i open a new page, get a text, or just whenever it decides to annoy me. The restarting problem has been a problem from day one, even after I replaced the battery. additionally, unfortunately, there are many other quirks this phone has. I will get texts from nobody, or it will say I have \"-1\" text? I didn't know texts were quantitative in nature!  Also there are several design flaws that make the phone inefficient, mainly the size of the on screen keyboard. The keyboard's \"buttons\" are too small and are in a strange qwerty configuration that makes you miss letters and have to correct your self because you pressed the wrong button. Also the on screen keyboard changes depending if you hold it horizontally or vertically, and may get stuck if you are at an awkward position.  Besides these rants this phone is workable, just not enjoyable. There are practically no free apps (Facebook and that's about it) and the ones listed on the \"Appcenter\" all cost $4.99/month... I am not about to pay $5 A MONTH for a knockoff version of a free game you can find on other phones. I would not suggest this phone to anyone who is looking for an upgrade, because this phone is a downgrade.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible phone with inherent software and firmware problems that can not be fixed", "Author": "Quest936", "ReviewID": "R1C9QJYH82NH17", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is horrible.  And after contacting Samsung I have found out mine isn't a lemon.  It is an inherent problem with ALL of them (yet for some reason they didn't recall it or come up with a fix).  It cuts off by itself, even in the middle of calls.  Do NOT depend on its alarm because it will go off at the wrong times if it goes off at all.  The touch screen is horrible calibrated and you can't change it.  Also the screen will change from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, for no reason.  You will get text messages hours, even days, late.  The screen will freeze.  The only good thing about this phone is its size (if you don't like bulky phones).
