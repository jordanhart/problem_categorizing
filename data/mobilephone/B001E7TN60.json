Ah, that lovely keyboard. Besides being surer and faster, when you pull it out to type, you can still see the entire screen for surfing.

The HTC Touch Pro 2 is offered by all the major US carriers at this time. Some like Sprint have retained its international features so you can use CDMA and international protocols.  I've been using cellular phones since the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS)was introduced in 1983. With the enhancements provided by HTC atop Microsoft Windows Mobile v6.1, the Touch Pro 2 is an absolute delight for the businessperson. With one glaring exception, it can be used as a substitute for a laptop computer in many circumstances. The exception is the lack of mouse support in the Qualcomm Bluetooth stack. Bluetooth keyboards work fine, but mouse functions are not supported. In my eyes, this represents a major oversight which I hope will be rectified in future ROM revisions.  Aside from that, the HTC Touch Pro 2 represents the state of the art in smart phones. It has a gorgeous 3.6-inch TFT-LCD touch-sensitive screen with 480 X 800 WVGA resolution. The screen also tilts which makes airline tray or restaurant table movie watching, RSS feed reading and (where possible) web browsing a pleasure. It also makes working on business documents in Microsoft Mobile Office, DataViz or SoftMaker products a pleasure. There is a five-row, slide-out QWERTY keyboard that is the best I've ever had on a cell phone. While you can't touch type, you can do a pretty good job of two finger pecking.  Some carriers, again like Sprint, offer the HTC Touch Pro 2 with a standard 3.5mm audio jack. What a pleasure to finally just be able to plug in a pair of ordinary headphones!The HTC Touch Pro 2 accepts microSDHC cards up to 16 GB. (I presume 32 GB is also supported.) You can put plenty of music and video on the card, have great audio and a truly luscious screen. I am really amazed at just how well movies look on that screen. You'll be best served with a third party media viewer like the CorePlayer.  The design is very finger-friendly. Some functions, such as browsing with the included Opera browser are adapted to finger swipes for navigating on and between pages and sites. My personal preference, however, remains the stylus. The onscreen keyboard is the best I've ever worked on and works especially well with fingertips. You don't have to be dead-on to type a character. The logic does a very good job of figuring out what character you intended to strike.  The CPU is the same Qualcomm MSM7200A 528 MHz used in the Touch Pro and other HTC cell phones. It gets the job done, but it is not the fastest processor on the block. The allotment of 512 MB ROM and 288 MB RAM is reasonably generous, but like money, you can never have enough.  The Touch Pro 2 measures 4.57 X 2.33 X 0.66 inches and weighs 6.3 ounces. I carry it in a shirt pocket and don't find the size or weight to be a problem.  Bluetooth and WiFi work just fine on this unit.  Some carriers, again Sprint is an example, keep the GPS enabled. While Sprint has an optional paid navigation program, I use my Touch Pro 2 GPS with Google Maps and Microsoft Bing. I no longer use a separate GPS unit this is all I need.  Output volume is excellent and there is a novel conference phone feature built in. Put the unit on its face and the back microphones are started. Fidelity and noise cancellation are pretty good. It is a nice feature for those who use it.  The 3.2 megapixel camera is nothing spectacular. There are no hardware buttons for the camera and it is both slower and more inconvenient to use than one triggered by a hardware button.  There is TV output through an optional cable and a bunch of other features that some may find useful.  A 1500 mAh battery is standard and it will last through a day of strenuous usage. But overall, plan on charging this unit every day or two if you make much use of it. Buying a second battery or an external battery is a wise idea.  Overall, I have found performance to be excellent in every regard. Teamed with a Bluetooth keyboard, I can often leave my laptop at home. Web browsing is a delight with Opera, Skyfire or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Memory problems have been non-existent for me no matter how many applications I've launched. (I do continue the well established habit of invoking the Task Manager from time to time.) The reset button is under the back cover which is, in my opinion, a design error - but I haven't had to use it much. When I need it, though, it is something of a pain. You have to remove the stylus first, then the back cover. It is not a pleasant task under any circumstance, especially when the lighting is low.  Do I like the HTC Touch Pro 2? You bet. I think it is the best smart phone I've ever used. It gets closer to the grail of the highly portable computer that has been envisioned since the 1970s. Yes, the pipeline is already filling with devices running the much faster AMD Snapdragon processor. HTC is about to launch a unit with Snapdragon and a 4.3 inch screen. I suspect that the next model of the Touch Pro will be launching little more than a year from now and I suspect I will be straining on my leash to get one.  In the meantime, the HTC Touch Pro 2 is a dream to work with. If they fix the Bluetooth stack to work with a mouse or if a third party follows through with its promise to release a replacement stack, the HTC Touch Pro 2 will truly be a hand-sized laptop replacement. It is quite the marvel and a delight to use.Jerry", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "A.

I am with a small government agency that received about 50 of these phones as a general upgrade to our older ones.  After only about a month of use the complaints from the majority of users were pretty signficant.  We're currently working with our Verizon rep. to have them all replaced.The main problem we've found is that when you are talking on the phone, your ear will come in contact with the touch pad.  It's pretty common for that to either start dialing another call and/or hanging-up the current one.  The operating system is also very slow with signficant lag time as you click on icons.  Also, a slight nudge on the key pad, say while it is sitting in your pocket, will cause the screen to turn on; which runs the battery down pretty quickly.I would avoid this model.

Not sure if its becos its running Windows Mobile, but its just not very intuitive and user friendly. There is no way to turn it on from the face of the phone and you need to do it by pressing it on the top which is not very convenient. The apps run very slowly and the touch screen operation is sometimes very frustrating - it does things that you didnt intend to do. The bluetooth operation is very flaky. I have also had problems of the phone locking up a few times and you have to reboot it. Do not expect the touch to be intuitive and precise like the iPhone, you will be disappointed. The most frustrating thing is, its very slow in responding when you are searching for a contact or typing something to find someone.  I have also noticed that there is a delay while making or receiving a call - like you have to give it a few secs to respond.
