Only thing is they could put more details about the phone up, but otherwise great experience.About the phone: we all know that wp8 is a new OS. With that being said they have alot of catching up to do in minor areas and you can see the leaps and bounds they are making in regards to apps and hardware. And this phone is one of the best. No issues I love this phone. Colors are great, fluid movement, live tiles are definetly a feature I love from my other windows phone. APP store is vastly improving and adding apps at a rate that is astounding. Nice big screen, People Hub and Me Tile intergration is great for ppl who like everything in one neat place. There are other features way to numerous to mention. If you want to know more, make that switch to WP8. Trust me you wont be dissapointed.In between my WP7 and this one I had an Iphone 4s then made the move to Samsung S3. Tired of static tiles and all the other rhetoric of android and IOS. I am happily back where I belong.I really dont think I will ever make the switch back to either of those OS's.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "ativ s i8750", "Author": "W.

One thing I don't care for is 3times it has restarted itself, the first time may have been legit, went through a known dead zone, but the other times were at home where at&t; is fine. I also love the fact that it has a removable battery which is getting harder to find nowadays.As far as windows, I love it better than android, it isn't always getting bogged down by anything whereas in android google services is always slowing things down. Also love having microsd card as expanded memory. Could there be improvements on windows phone, sure all os's could use improvements. There are things I would like to see but others may not need , such as file explorer, but give Microsoft time and this will be even better.Finally, it is a shame Samsung did not release this particular unit in USA because I think it would have been a big success.One more thing if you are switching from microsim to minisim, either buy a new simcard, or use a simcard cutter. I had an at&t; microsim that I had cut by hand and had to tape in place because I could not make the little notch on the side that latches it in place.

The phone is basically a mini version of a Windows 8 PC, sets up very quickly for communications, and there is evidence that the WP8 is gaining quickly in popularity.All WP8 phones from the different brands work the same. Everything on a WP8 is an app, and these apps receive updates. Those who are new to smartphones may need a little more time with their hmms and ahs to discover the many abilities a WP8 is capable of doing, whereas anyone having experience with the Androids and Apples will have a head start in getting a WP8 up and running the way they like, also probably discovering that some important provisions may not be available yet. But that is changing with every new operational update. In the meantime, the built in Network Sharing feature will provide an access to the Internet for those who otherwise don\u2019t have WiFi readily available, from whence everything else then becomes available.This Samsung Ativ S was outdated before I ever purchased it, but I trust its lowly 3G abilities will be fully capable for transmitting my messages and calls, and for playing Internet radio for several more years. If you prefer having all the 4G abilities then check out the Samsung Ativ S Neo, or the several other brands that are available, including Microsoft\u2019s latest Nokia line of WP8s.  Having added this Samsung to my increasing GS3 and GS4 collection, I can really appreciate its audio improvements that rival those of the iPhone. The WiFi, Bluetooth, music player, and video player apps on this phone are outstanding, and the ability to place a 32G SDCard and direct everything to it, makes this phone a wonderful asset to have readily available. It\u2019s the many little conveniences about it that I can appreciate, like turning itself on fully when plugged into a PC, or that you can view every app on the phone simply by swiping to the left. The best part is that Microsoft provides an entire informational website dedicated to learning all about the WP8, and is loaded with instructional videos and tips for getting your new WP8 set up the way you prefer.The WP8 is a natural for those who use any of the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and EndNote Office apps on a regular basis. Mobile Office is installed at the factory and is ALMOST as fully provisioned as the PC versions. Excel users should be very pleased that spreadsheets are updated when brought up, depending on the extent it has been provisioned. I\u2019m sure there will be improvements in time, but even so, none of the Android Office-type programs are nearly as well provisioned, and this could be a major determiner as to what type of phone is best for you to have. No need to search out a Dictionary app either because the phone arrives with one that I really like and is especially easy to use. And then there are the many other regulars commonly found on a Windows 8 PC also available. Looking for a particular app, then search through the many that are available at the Windows 8 phone website.The one and only downer regarding this phone is the placement of the Camera button. I hit it accidentally several times before getting a snap on case for the phone and that finally ended that problem. Overall, the Ativ S has an attractive design with its grey coloring and highly reflective chrome edge, it is a wonderful phone that I\u2019m sure will serve me reliably for many years.

The Nokia phone has become her own merits in the most desired by users of the platform, which makes the Lumia 920 so unique from the competition?For starters, its spectacular display PureMotion IPS technology, which ensures a much higher response rate than that of its rivals, plus a high brightness even under sunlight and an incredible touch sensitivity. Its density of pixels falls below the HTC 8X, but instead offers a slightly larger screen coming up to 4.5 inches. On the performance side, processor and RAM shared with rivals, and stays at an intermediate point on the capacity of the battery, below the Samsung ATIV S.But if there is another feature that is special about the Lumia 920 is its main camera. Beyond its 8.7 megapixel, the largest of the three phones compared, which has led to more comments PureView technology is used by Nokia that offers quality in the photographs as had never before seen on a mobile. His system allows high quality photos in low light conditions and image stabilizer, polemics aside, substance ensures improved video recording from the competition.The dimensions of Nokia smartphone loses out, being the thickest of the three little heavy and quite unlike most of its 6.53 oz. In return we have a more compact look great all the design \"unibody\" inaugurated with Nokia N9. Care adds details, such as wireless charging sold separately.HTC 8XThe headliner HTC is all a sample of expertise and stand out very well against its rivals, with several points in which the lead.The screen is not one of the sections which emerged victorious. The HTC 8X offers the smallest screen of the three devices with its 4.3 inches, but it does maintain a great resolution of 1280x720 which give it the highest density of pixels from the comparison. Its Super LCD technology maybe stay a little behind the rest but offers more than enough quality. In their guts have the same processor dual-core Snapdragon S4 of ATIV S and 1GB of RAM, although in this case with less battery of three in competition. Storage also remains somewhat behind, with 16GB internal and lack of microSD card slot.Paragraph photographic eye, because, without hogging all attention wing that has taken the Lumia 920 in this issue, the 8X offers an 8-megapixel camera more than satisfactory, equipped with technology similar to what HTC has offered in its latest Android devices . And to complete the multimedia section, nothing better than to take their work with Beats Audio for great sound provide the terminal. Not to mention LTE and NFC connectivity it shares with its other two rivals.Despite seeming to be left behind by its smaller battery, less internal storage and lack of microSD slot, the explanation is found faster when we take a look at its small size. The 8X is the smallest of the three high-end WP8, but still thicker than the ATIV S, leaving its weight in a mere 4.59 oz. To this we attach a very attractive design that has received very good reviews from those who have had their hands in appearance and comfort.SAMSUNG ATIV SProbably the most enigmatic of high-end phones with Windows Phone 8. Samsung is superior in several sections.The ATIV S boasts the largest screen size with 4.8 inches they leave behind its competitors. Also, this comes with HD Super AMOLED technology so successful that the company has made on other devices. Instead maintains the same resolution 1280x720, leaving a lower pixel density than its rivals, although still at very high levels. Again we have a dual-core processor at 1.5 GHz and the same 1 GB of RAM, although in this case is supported by a battery of 2300 mAh, significantly better than their opponents. As for storage, the Samsung is the most flexible, allowing internal choose a size 16 or 32 GB and appending its possible expansion with microSD cards.The camera is perhaps where worst comes stopped ATIV S compared to the other two competitors in the high range. While maintaining the type with its 8 megapixel, lack of promotion by Samsung of the same rule we can think of as technological added special in this case advertise their rivals. The rest of the features is on par with its rivals, including the maximum connectivity LTE and NFC.That if, as a work of engineering the Samsung smartphone stands out from the rest thanks to its spectacular screen size in the body content thinnest of the three, with just 0.34 in. thick. To that we can add their meager 4.76 oz, almost on par with the HTC 8X, and you have a real beast of a body very content.

I questioned it because I had never bought an unlocked phone or a phone thru Amazon before. I did see in the reviews from other people that had bought it that it would only work for AT&T; or T-mobile. Which wasn't a problem because I have a pay as you go plan thru AT&T.; The phone was given really good reviews so I decided to buy it. It was shipped the day I ordered it which I was very happy about. It arrived in the original sealed box in perfect condition. I did have to take it to AT&T; to get a new sim card because the one from my phone was too big. Once that was installed and my phone number and contacts were switched over to the new phone my data package wouldnt work. The AT&T; employee told me that when you buy and unlocked \"generic\"(not assigned to a specific carrier such as AT&T;)phone that there is no guarantee that your data package will work. He also told me that this is a Samsung UK phone not a Samsung US phone. Which is why some words such as dialing(dialling) and favorite(favourite) are spelled incorrect.Samsung apparently does not make a US ATIV phone with Windows. He attempted to get my data to work but wasnt able to but I was able to use it with wifi. He told me to call Samsung which I did and they were not able to help me. They told me to call At&T; and after about 20-30 minutes on the phone with technical support they were able to get it working as well as the ability to send and receive picture messages. I forgot to mention that that wouldn't work either. AT&T; also has it listed as a tablet not a phone so it did take the technician a minute to find it. Now that everything on my phone is working correctly (except for the misspelled words) I LOVE IT. It has alot of cool apps and games and I have gotten alot of compliments on its appearance. As well as alot of people asking what kind of phone it is(no one has seen it before and they love the chrome look). If you are willing to deal with the hassle to get it going its an awesome phone.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "not good", "Author": "Adam Kovacs", "ReviewID": "R3RELTOZDU1LI8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi.

The phone arrived quickly (actually a day earlier than predicted) and I was amazed at the quality and condition of the item.  The phone was described as used, therefore, I honestly did not know WHAT to expect.  But, once it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised, because it unpackaged, and looked and responded just like a new phone.  I am extremely happy with the item, and just pray that it will continue to function as expected.  I love the windows 8 operating system.  It's fast, and the phone is everything I hoped for and wanted.  My only concern was wishing that there had been some kind of warranty offered with the phone, or one I could purchase from Amazon.

Not a good deal. Secondly, I will talk about the phone. The screen is large, but color is terrible. Super Amodled  saturates the color. It make black looks really black, but white is not white any more. Coming from an HTC 8x user, I have to say, Ativ s screen is unacceptable, and it hurts my eyes badly. Not only the screen, compare the HTC 8x, this phone is really heavy to hold in your hand. I am more than disappointed with the camera and the speakers. Both are inferior compared to HTC 8x.Moreover, While I get an update to GDR3 very soon after Microsoft release the update. I have not be able to update the phone to GDR3 although I hope to get it someday. Maybe, Samsung is too busy with Android fan boys and completely  WP users. However, the phone offering you one cool thing that you can use Micro-SD card, so you can increase the storage. It is the most valuable feature of this phone. The battery is just acceptable and better than the 8X a little bit.Think twice if you want to buy this phone, and think 10 times if you are in the U.S.  I'm so regretful of wasting my 267 dollars on this phone. You should consider an HTC 8x which has better camera, better screen, nicer body build, and lighter weight. Unfortunately,  it also has lots downside, too. Here are the list of what I have experienced: short battery life, small storage, and sometimes lags.If you want a Lumia, don't buy 920. It is bulky, heavy outdated just as the Ativ S although Nokia has better support. Chose Lumia 925 instead, it is an upgraded of the 920. I would recommend you buy Lumia 1020 since I heard lots of comment about that phone.Hope my comment help you make a good decision!", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "camera stopped working", "Author": "Abhiroop Bhattacharyya", "ReviewID": "R8YJY3R0SVYFO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "back camera stopped working after few days, rest part is fine. skype and few other apps takes time to launch", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "No FLAC support.", "Author": "hrrmph", "ReviewID": "R276ALZYMAAM4C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was shocked to find out that Windows Phone 8 has no FLAC support.  So if you like to listen to high quality, uncompressed music in the industry standard FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) file format, then this phone won't play them.Even worse, there is no third-party plug-in or codec that you can install to fix this.Blackberry BB OS-10 devices and Samsung Android devices have this support built-in.  FLACs work fine on my BB Z10 and Samsung Note 2.It's not Samsung's fault; all Windows Phone devices have this problem.This phone is probably the 2nd best WinPhone device available now, simply because of the Micro-SDXC storage slot and the removable battery.  Those are features missing from the Microsoft Lumia phones.The Samsung ATIV Neo is probably the best WinPhone because it also adds LTE support... but no FLAC support.So my Windows Phone experiment comes to a crashing halt.
