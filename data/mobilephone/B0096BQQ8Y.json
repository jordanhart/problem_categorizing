It came quickly from this seller and is as described.This is the best phone on the market (including the iphone 5) by far.  It is on the larger size so if you have small hands you may want to look at a smaller screen size.  Although there are small women using the Galaxy Note...The red is gorgeous.  The front is a dark red that has a certain sparkle to it in light.  The back I was a little disappointed in as it almost looks pink is certain lights; not the same color as the front at all.  Luckily you can buy any color back cover you want (I went carbon fiber) for about $13 on amazon.I can't say enough about how good this phone is.  It does everything and more.  So many innovative features its not funny.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of this distributor", "Author": "Meri A Richardson", "ReviewID": "R9L75GNDVDBGN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the red galaxy International phone. I had difficulty with the charging port going into the phone from day one. The cable would only go in partially. It would charge so I thought maybe that was the way it was suppose to be. My bad... Then in week two the cable would not insert at all. I then took the liberty to buy an additional cable from Amazon in case it was the cable. Again my bad... I say my bad because by the time I contacted the seller they referred me to the Samsung international, tried the cable my 30 day warranty has expired by 3 days. So now both - Distr and Amazon say can't do anything.Some things to keep in mind-- first and foremost I received a defective product from day one.2) Two read the return warranty from the co. 30 days means 30 days not when you get it but when you receive it. So you don't get 30 days I got 24 days. You certainly will not get any give from them even if they send you crap. 3) Amazon will not come to your aid either if your 3 days past the 30 days 4) Also when purchasing an international phone it negates any US warranty but you can call UK or email UK with your fingers crossed that someone will get back to you. I am still waiting for a response.I would have accepted a replacement. Didn't offer. So I can only help your phone works and don't expect anything from them.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Attractive Colour", "Author": "R. Byer \"R.

I paid $425 for this phone. I  thouroughly read reviews. When I received the phone it came in a very nice red box. The phone is a beautiful deep wine color -  I actually paid more just for the original looking color of the phone and the fact that it's unlocked. The phone was shipped in a timely fashion. I received the phone three weeks ago today. I went to T-Mobile, they had no problem with the international sim or transferring all of my data from the Blackberry to the Galaxy. Those are the positives...Now for the negatives:1) From day one I noticed that the phone was 3G versus 4G. I asked T-Mobile about that. They said that the speed was made up for with the \"H+\". NOT! The speed is relatively slow considering the phone and what it should be able to accomplish.2) I am only able to send a maximum of 10 persons per text. I have a group of 36 people that I regularly texted at once with my Blackberry. I now have had to break that group into sets of 10 and resend the same text message 4 times - very frustrating.3) I have 6 email accounts on my phone. It took me three days to get the \"Microsoft Exhange\" accounts active. Not intuitive at all.4) The 6 email accounts do not sync without manual assistance. I have tried everything. Called everyone. It's disgusting! I wake up in the morning and only have emails from gmail and hotmail the other accounts must be manually synced ALL DAY LONG. I never had this problem with my Blackberry. It synced every 1-5 minutes.5) My work provides free WiFi. It drops every 5 minutes. It never dropped at all with my Blackberry.6) Random applications just run for no reason sucking the life out of my battery. My Blackberry battery lasted 48-72 hours. The battery when I finally released the phone after 4 years of use was the original. There was no lack of charge.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy S lll I9300 is mediocre at best. It has a lot of apps (I read my InStyle magazine on my phone now). I wish Blackberry was not going out of business. I would have purchased another one of those.My next phone will probably be an Apple. My friends and co-workers love theirs - Oh well, lesson learned.Like I said earlier, it has only been 3 weeks since I received the phone maybe my experience will improve.

When taking photos, I experience only milliseconds of shutter lag. it is just mustang!All is not perfect about this phone however.  The placement of the power button on the right and the volume button the left is a bad design.

There may be a slight learning curve for those not familiar with the latest abilities of this phone, but I suggest just playing with it. It's really the only way to learn. The camera takes fantastic photos. Some reviewers have commented that if you have small hands, the phone may be too big for you. I have small hands and find no problems with the phone. I am so happy with this phone. There is only one thing - and it's not against the phone, but the sellers. Please be aware that if you buy this phone, you need a micro SIM card. Had I known that prior to purchase, I could have obtained the card before the phone came.

The camera is decent enough for a smartphone, keep in mind it's nothing you'll get on a DSLR, but it is one of the best Cameras on any smartphone currently. As far as speed goes, it's pretty zippy and I've experienced no lag. So far, this phone has been awesome. However, the phone I recieved was blocked from Network access by att. Meaning it was reported stolen/lost and now it's basically useless unless you're in a wifi hotspot. I inserted my H20 sim and tried making a phone call, but it said \"This device is restricted from Network service\". I talked to a person from att and they confirmed that the phone was reported.

The price of the Galaxy was better but the size was kind of a problem. I have broken a lot of phones, even drowned my blackberry on December so I went with the least expensive phone.After it arrived I have to say I am very happy with the size, it is bigger but I love the screen size.
