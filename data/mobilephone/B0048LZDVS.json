{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Happy With Tracfone and Samsung T301G", "Author": "Spudman", "ReviewID": "RUNNBTQ6K5LAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung T301G is the one slider phone offered by Tracfone as I write this review. I bought it to replace Mrs. Spudman's T Mobile pay as you go phone. We have no problem with T Mobile, just that particular phone.The Samsung is a small, light, many featured phone for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive fancy phones. Mostly we just want to make and receive phone calls on the go without being burdened by a service contract with a monthly bill.Though she's a technophobe, Mrs. Spudman had little trouble setting up the phone and her voicemail account using the included instructions.  My own phone is an LG Tracfone model; I have been very happy with Tracfone and find it easy to add minutes and check my account either on the phone or on the Tracfone site.Likes:Easy set upThe display - clear, bright and easy to read. When placing or receiving a call, phone numbers appear on the screen in large digits. Love it!The ringer is loud and very audible. Choices of ring tones are limited and don't match those of the fancy phones, but they are more than adequate for our tastes. Additional ring tone choices are available on the Tracfone site for a fee. They're really nothing special though.Voice quality on this phone is excellent at both ends of the phone call. It's as good as our land line's and better than that of my LG phone.The external Caller ID. When your phone rings, the caller's number is displayed on the screen. The user can then choose to accept or not accept the call.Battery life has been more than acceptable for us. Mrs. Spudman turns off the phone's power overnight to make the charge last even longer. Charging is conveniently simple and doesn't take that long. You can charge the phone in your car or at home.I bought the phone's optional accessory package which includes a case, earphones, and two chargers and adapters. A great deal. The phone also came with some starter minutes and double minutes for life, a great, great feature.  At the time I ordered, I even got a ten dollar restaurant gift certificate.The phone was easy to hook up to our hands free Bluetooth  in our 2011Legacy.Dislikes -  NONE so far.Some of the features:Text messaging, voice mail, free caller ID, free call waitingBluetoothSlider designVGA camera with decent picturesColor screen displayMMS picture messaging - My wife and daughter exchange photos regularlyHandsfree speakerHearing Aid CompatibleDouble minutes for life - This is a deal maker.For the low price, features, and lack of any long term commitment, I don't think you can go wrong with this phone. If you want cutting edge technology, look elsewhere and be prepared to empty your wallet.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "it's fine", "Author": "Victoria Lugo", "ReviewID": "R9H2WUT0O0NFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone since last summer. It works great. I'd say it's not for people who text very fast, but I don't, so it doesn't matter to me. The battery life will last, just look up the proper way to charge a cell phone. If you do it the wrong way, you'll drain your battery life in no time. I don't know if the battery lasts for 14 days, because I have my phone on the most energy wasting setting lol. The only thing I have noticed is it will be fully charged, and then by the end of the day, the battery indicator will say it's dead, but it will last for a few more days before it starts beeping and dies. It doesn't bother me, I just noticed it. I love how it slides open, much easier than some sliding phones I've tried. It has an okay camera, of course it doesn't match the hd quality pictures of some of the cell phones today, but I didn't expect that when I got it. It's a great general use phone for people who don't need all the extra features that phones come with today. The only complaint I have, is that there's no way to take the browser off my shortcuts. I accidentally hit the button, and it charges me. Otherwise, I love this phone because it's simple and really cute.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Misleading advertising", "Author": "A.

Certainly does not last 14 days on standby as stated. After ONE day starting with a full charge and not using the phone the battery is dead. You might get one brief phone call on a full charge. I've ordered a replacement battery to see if that will help. I'll post later with results.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, bad support", "Author": "\"Mark\" Anthony", "ReviewID": "R2D3T27ROGX5ST", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A little booklet manual came with this phone...beware, some of the instructions don't work. Your left alone on how to figure all the features...some are obvious, and others you have to call them for explanation.

Scrymgeour", "ReviewID": "R1PWXX1Z2PTSW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long-time TracFone customer and really like this Samsung unit which I bought about 4 years ago. It is easy to use, easy to send text messages, has a variety of ringtones, nice calendar and a durable and foolproof keyboard. Unfortunately, I lost the unit and was shocked to learn that TracFone no longer offers it on its website. I then reluctantly bought another Samsung unit but was very disappointed as it's features were inferior to the model T301G and decided to poke around the Internet to see whether my preferred unit was still available. Fortunately, I found the T310G and immediately bought it as a very good price. Perhaps I should have bought 2 of them!", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone is OK, activation is not so great", "Author": "Myron Shlapak \"MandBinc\"", "ReviewID": "RES4KLA5HXJ69", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone itself is a very inexpensive, AKA cheap, cell phone and so far seems to work fine. Getting it activated on Tracfone was a bit of a challenge, as their instructions leave a little to be desired.The Phone itself came in its original package with a free 2 year calendar and special discount coupons. The problem was The calendar was for 2011 and 2012 and the coupons expired in 2012. The phone was purchased in 2014. This could be one reason it was so inexpensive to buy.The Tracfone activation instructions were a little bit unclear as it said to activate go to the webpage and there was an activation page to go to but the phone would not activate properly, not matter how many times I tried to do it.I then tried to set the date and time but every time I thought I did it, it would revert back to January 2001.At last, after a few deep breaths and various expletives that were deleted, I tried again.I tried to Log on with the user name I provided on the activation page. Lo and behold, they did not know me! So then I went through the new user registration process and all went along smoothly. They even automatically updated the phones' date and time.Things are usually simple when you provide clear instructions.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "Rex", "ReviewID": "R31REV42OHA8PC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little phone at a wonderful price and the Tracfone service is great.  This is the early Android software but still does everything we need in a small easy to  use package.I recently read an editorial that Android phones are mostly used for basic calling.  I am sure that is true because there are a Kazillion of these little phones with droid issue one two and three and this is a wonderful system.  If you want the real computer on a phone buy Android 4+ phones that are much better than iPhones and cost less than half the price for a really decent phone.  The real plus to Android is the endless stream of App's out there for most any task.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Amanda Lee", "ReviewID": "R1YAVJ9KJVOXP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is what i wanted in a work phone.

It seems to work well in the area where I live. The screen is sharper than other Samsung budget phones. The keys stay lit about 20 seconds and the back slides on and off easily for accessing the battery and remains securely shut.It has bluetooth but that is only for use with a headset. The only thing your can do with the camera is send pictures to another phone or email them. There is no USB port or memory card to transfer photos to a computer. When you email them the image isn't very big. For me that makes the camera feature irrelevant.I saved about twenty dollars buying the phone and air card from Shop Cell Deals at Amazon rather than through Tracfone.It was easy to activate the phone online but took two attempts. I had to wait about ten or fifteen minutes for the phone to hook up after trying it the first time. Tracfone included a coupon book which gave an extra 60 minutes and 2 months as a bonus. My 1 year 400 minute air time card became 860 minutes and 14 months since this is a double minutes phone.The booklet Tracfone supplies gives very little information. At Samsung's website they have a better manual which is more comprehensive as far as the functions of the phone go.The Contacts List has an email entry. You have to scroll down past what's visible on the screen to find it. The \"@\" sign and \".\" are both found on the \"1\" key. Just keep pressing it till they come up.You can text with the phone but that's a bit laborious since the keys use the \"abc\" method of multiple letters per key.For a basic no frills phone it's okay. It won't replace your camera and if you don't text much you probably will be quite happy with it. There are much worse phones out there.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "not sure its a christmas gift", "Author": "barb plott", "ReviewID": "R12HJVR9B5F0N3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i can not comment on the phone i ordered them as a christmas gift and i havent gave the gifts yet sorry", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "One star is too many!", "Author": "L.
