I had an extremely difficult time finding anyone who would activate this phone.  Apple told me it was originally purchased in Nov, 2011.  AT&T; told me I was the 5th person activating the phone.  Paid $610.00 for a much used phone with no warranty other than 1 month from deal grabber.  Phone would only charge to 40%.  That's probably why the other 4 people got rid of it.  Can't put a new battery in because it's some how part of the phone. Sent it back told them if they can't replace with a new phone under apple warranty give me a refund.  This is the third day still waiting.  Amazon rep put a complaint in for me and assured me of my refund.  Went to AT&T; because I am already set up with an account bought iphone for $349.00 not as much GB but really did not need it for my use. So buyer beware new doesn't always mean new.  Not like the price was too good to be true, but did not get what was represented.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arrived Super Fast, Messed Up Camera", "Author": "CBennet", "ReviewID": "R19VB0ZFWI4FIX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I lost my previous 64GB 4s, and you can't buy this phone new anymore. I need the storage, but I didn't want to shell out $850 for a new 64GB iPhone 5 w/o a contract or upgrade. I ordered it Thursday afternoon and it arrived Friday morning, which was great. I was concerned at first because the Apple box said 16GB, but the Amazon label said 64GB. Luckily the Amazon label was correct. After a few days, the phone is working great in all areas but one: there's something wrong with the camera, causing all photos to be fuzzy. Since this isn't an essential function, I'm still happy I saved money over a new iPhone 5.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Faulty iPhone Rear Camera, was advertised as Like new", "Author": "Daulat Pal Singh", "ReviewID": "R1RDCGQ0CBUZ5E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First time dared to buy from amazon warehouse deals. IT was supposed to be like new means no scratches, no hardware flaws nothing. just no warranty was the only thing which was not supposed to be coming with this product. I purchased it for one of my relatives who lives on the west coast was leaving to India for almost six months. Hoped that the product, because I am buying from amazon would be defect free as promised on their website. But !The device was delivered. went to India with my relative who has an active AT&T; connection in the USA. They wanted to take pictures while being in India. And the rear camera was not able to focus. Hardware fault with the rear camera. Vow!I called the amazon helpdesk and told them that the person who has this faulty product will be back to USA almost after six months. She promised that she would extend the return date on the product so that when my relative will be back, I could generate a return slip and send it back to amazon. surprisingly, the new date was never put in for return and now they have to cope up with a faulty phone even after paying around $450 for this device.Lesson learnt. No more relying on what amazon says, I mean like new didn't have to mean that Camera was faulty. Right??", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy if the seller doesn't provide details on the condition of the phone", "Author": "Wong Wai Ming", "ReviewID": "R1NZFFEQKGBOVD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The condition of the phone is not match to what the seller write.
