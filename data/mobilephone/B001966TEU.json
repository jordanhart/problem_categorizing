I didn't think it was possible to improve on the V3xx, but this is the phone. I've owned everything from sliders to flips from several makers. The Razr V9 is a beautiful phone with exceptional sound clarity and a menu that is so intuitive that most will have it mastered quickly. Mine ia a beautiful mahogoany color. There just is no better phone out there.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "I Love This Phone!!", "Author": "C. Taylor \"Gadget Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2C5RLB76SQ5V5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 4th Motorola phone and I LOVE it. I don't generally espouse such affection for my electronic toys and gadgets, but the phone really does deserve high praise IMHO. The quality and asthetics are great (although, I would have preferred slightly more contrast of color in the face) and it has enough features to make it a useful device without the bulk of a smartphone. Obviously, BlueTooth stereo rocks (no pun intended) but you WILL need BT headphones because there isn't a headset jack. It's unlocked, so you'll have to do a bit of research and tinkering for web settings and MMS, but once done, $15/mo through AT&T; gets unlimited web access with video from news, sports, and entertainment channels. You can also view YouTube videos. Download Yahoo Go! and Opera Mini (both are free) and you've got a GREAT litte device that gives you internet access and information at 3G speed to pass idle bits of time, but is still primarily a slim and sexy phone that fits discreetly into your pocket or purse.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Unpleasant Surprises", "Author": "J. Thomas", "ReviewID": "R2CLL8796SYLXZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Razr2 is really a good phone, but buying an unlocked one is not such a great idea.  Of course, none of the service providers have had them for several years - the flip phone is a vanishing item.Amazon sells this one through HassleFree, which is anything but. Mine came from Australia, programed for the main service provider there, Telstra.  Setting it up for a U.S. provider requires some work.  For instance, when you try to dial your voice mail, it will attempt to contact a voicemail box in Australia.  It took a trip to an ATT store to get this changed.Also, the phone always shows a \"new voice mail\" icon when none is there.  Further, after a voice mail is left, it is always followed by a text message showing a few strange symbols.  ATT tech service was very good, but told me this is an electronic quirk that can't be remedied.  Due to the differences in Telstra and ATT phone programming.The seller puts difficult limitations on a return for refund, i.e. No more than 30 minutes talk time.  It takes longer than that to determine if the phone even works.I can use the phone as a backup, but if do-overs were possible, would find a used phone that came from a U.S. provider.I would not recommend any unlocked phone, unless you know where it comes from.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best!", "Author": "Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...", "ReviewID": "R2OXK43V2LMNSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for over two years. I'm finally upgrading to a Windows Smart Phone (HTC Touch Pro 2) but have felt some sadness moving away from this beautiful and functional phone and decided to write a review about how much I've liked the phone.First, this is a slick, high quality phone both aesthetically and in build quality. Everything just feels solid and well made, including the responsive touch pad which makes texting as easy as possible considering it doesn't come with a QWERTY pad. The hing is one of the best I've seen on a flip phone, and even after two years of constant use it is still solid and not wobbly at all.The LCD screen is very nice, even by today's (end of 2009) standards. It's crystal clear, and make texting, operating the phone, playing games, etc., fun and not eye straining at all. The front screen, while lower resolution, is useful for taking self portraits (in camera mode when the phone is shut, it displays what the 2.0 mega pixel camera is pointed at!) and displaying your own custom images.The phone has a built in mp3 player (compatible with mp3s and WMA files) that is better than average for a phone based player. The phone can also play music over the phone's speaker, which sounds surprisingly good!The touch screen buttons on the front of the phone are well placed and easy to use for changing tacks or pausing.Voice commands works fairly well, but certainly not perfectly. I find it recognizes what I'm saying about 75% of the time.Phone call clarity is the best of any phone I've ever used, and better than friend's phones I've tried that are new.A few complaints:1) To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3.5mm adapter.2) The phone occasionally freezes up and needs to be reset by removing the battery.3) web browsing is pretty poor on this phone, but I never used that functionality much so it didn't bother me.Overall I've LOVED this phone and it's held up remarkably well over the last 2+ years. This is a high quality piece of hardware that's stood the test of time.4.5/5 Stars.

I like flip phones as they provide convenient proximity with ear and mouth for clear communication. I really like the style of this phone and convenient of having external buttons which can control music, photos and conversation.Major flaws are as follows:1. To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3.5mm adapter.2. Alarm is much worse then in Motorola E8, U9 or EM35 (other phones in my family). You can only set the time, rather then days of week when to ring.3. You can't zoom photos.4. You can't browse content of the phone. You can only access the content by the programs (pictures by picture viewer, music by music player...)5. You can't read text files due to #4.6. Installing apps is not conveniently planned: Menu > Settings > JavaSettings > InstalledApplications > InstallNew...When you get the phone, check if the battery cover fully closed (I saw three units with manufacture-flaws).", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Kelvis Garcia", "ReviewID": "R32DI4SDTEFGG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a excelente phone, I bought it to a old person, that love the phone, i used to have one long ago.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice product but not compadible with my network.", "Author": "Raver", "ReviewID": "R136W2INFK4NI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Extremely good communication and customer service.
