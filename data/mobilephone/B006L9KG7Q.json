{"Reviews": [{"Title": "a lot packed in this phone", "Author": "C. Pedersen", "ReviewID": "R2KBAIJGM0JI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to test out T-mobile.  I use a Galaxy Nexus with Verizon.  I was pleasantly surprised at the feature packed into this phone.  I thought the colors in the screen were nice.  The screen is responsive.  I really liked the \"in car\" feature of voice to text.  Phone feels solid.  Never used the camera.  Reception to signals is excellent.Finding a physical QWERTY phone is more and more difficult.  This is a pretty good option.  HTC is a good phone manufacturer.  I do see another company is making a MyTouch for T-mobile now.  It is by Huawei.  That phone is junk.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "only worked for 1 day!", "Author": "robbie", "ReviewID": "R24TLPV2DHGSA1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "as a guy who goes through phones all the time i have to say that this phone was very nice bu what made me rate it a 1 is well because it stoped working after 1 day it glitched out and then refused to turn on", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ultra-fast 4G-enabled, Android 2.3-powered smartphone with 3.7-inch LCD display, side-sliding QWERTY keyboard, and dual-core 1.2 GHz processor\nWireless-N Wi-Fi networking with mobile hotspot sharing with up to 8 devices plus Wi-Fi Calling capabilities\n8-MP camera; HD 1080p video capture; Bluetooth stereo music; 8 GB microSD card; DLNA capabilities; HTML web browser with Flash 10.1\nUp to 9 hours of talk time, up to 312 hours (13 days) of standby time; released in August, 2011\nWhat's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, charger.
