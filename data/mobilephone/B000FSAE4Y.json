Not knowing was really the sole hesitation when deciding what to spend my gift certificate on.--USB cable--charger (not US but comes with adapter)--256 micro memory card w/adapter--Motorola Phone Tools software (mPT)--headphonesI needed to upgrade from my v300 for 2 reasons.  I love being able to connect my phone to my computer to backup, etc, but it was taking more effort to connect the cable due to use.  Also, it was kinda a brick; not pocket-friendly when I did have them (women's clothes & pockets...oy vey) and when I did use the belt clip it was weighty & bulky. The pocket friendliness of the Razr alone makes the purchase worth it.  Being able to play music and video is a bonus.  This is not an iTunes version but transfering mp3 is easy enough via mPT.The only negative worth noting so far is that the phone has blacked out twice, requiring me to momentarily remove the battery to completely power off & 'reset' the phone.  My v300 \"fritzed\" on occasion too, also requiring the battery removal but it never proved to be more than a minor annoyance.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "This Phone Is the Hotness!!!", "Author": "Yeshiva M. Wright \"Mizz Diva\"", "ReviewID": "R3IY9Z5LBTRA2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just had to write a review on this phone, after seeing some fairly unfounded reviews I figured I didn't want to write it until I had fully \"tested\" out my own! Admittedly, I did not get my phone from Amazon--but hopefully you will find my review beneficial all the same.Okay, I noticed--first off--one reviewer complained (there is no better way to put it) about the phone being \"crap\"--saying reception or whatever was poor. Well I want to say that this couldn't be far from the truth; at least as far as my phone gones--it couldn't be better! Another reviewer mentioned, that she had difficulty setting the phone to her network--or to be more specific, she was displeased that she could not get all of her features working--like email and web access--thus giving the phone another unfortunate strike. I can tell you from personal experience with mines I'm not gonna lie and say that I wasn't simiarly frustrated when I--initially-couldn't get mine setup to my Cingular network. However, if one takes the time and a little \"googling\" you can find various Motorola modding forums [...] and sites like that w/ other Motorola unlocked phone users that will happily guide you in the right direction to getting your phone working to just about any network! Literally, with a little persistance it took me less than a week--a matter a fact, within the same week that I got my phone--to completely have mines configured to my Cingular network (email, web, and all)!Top it off w/ the iTunes and the hot color and this phone is a absolute winner in my book--by far the best cell I've had! Hope my lil' review helps! :)", "Date": "March 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good choice so far!", "Author": "viaticalpiano \"vp\"", "ReviewID": "R6M1XOLZTW4XB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been couple of months since i have purchased this cell phone and so far i am pretty happy with it. The only problem is it is not compatible with the T-Mobile voice mail system. Therefore each time i have a missed call, a voice mail message or if i access my messages it sends annoying blank text messages. Although there is no charge for them i have the additional headache of deleting them. It also tends to attract fingerprints and dust more than my other phone's but it is sleek and attractive compared to any other phone's i have had. So if you can live with the above problems then it is a decent phone. Otherwise only time will tell about it's reliability and durability!", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works better than the standard RAZR I had.", "Author": "Koonk", "ReviewID": "RSTCGT7WKD8CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone I have had no problems with at all.

It worked OK and itunes feature was sort of cool. I really like the size and shape of the RAZRs, so I purchased this phone agains my better judgement (I had a Cingular RAZR that lasted just over a year (1 yr warranty), then completely froze). After a few months with the V3i, every time I checked voicemail, I'd get an empty text message. I've read in forums stating that without Cingular software on the phone (or some PC hack), the V3i interprets Cingular's voicemail symbol deactivating message (whatever you call it) as a text message. This doesn't hurt the functions of the phone, but the text messages are very annoying and you will get charged by Cingular for a text message every time you check your voicemail. If you call Cingular and complain they might take the charges off your bill, but this gets to be a real neusance after a while. Because of this and past experiences, I would never recommend a RAZR without a stern word of caution--don't expect it to last.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Results", "Author": "MICOL", "ReviewID": "R1QWK63LFS13I8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Love my Razor, but this replacement to my original, is pure crap.

Then my screen would occasionally turn black or white.  My mp3 player started taking a long time to load or just failed to load.  The background would take awhile to load.  This problem with the screen became progressively worse until last week (six months into owning phone)  Screen went completely black and will not turn on except occasionally when you're charging it to say charging.  Phone can only be used to call out and receive calls...no viewing at all.  In addition, it is having problems powering up and staying on.  I am under warranty, but I am afraid cingular will decide it is damaged not defective (even though the phone has little damage and problems started before it was EVER dropped!) as so many people say they do and charge me 200$.
