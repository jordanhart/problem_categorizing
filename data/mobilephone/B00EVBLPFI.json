{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Soles etc, not so good seller. Those 4 Stars are for the Phone.", "Author": "Fireman26 \"FireMan 18\"", "ReviewID": "R2KNWP2UI32F84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Soles etc fulfill by Amazon.Com.  Please note that this  review is about the seller; not the phone.This phone was supposed to be brand new, however it was used. It has scratches on the lower left corner of the screen. On the back it has scratches on the upper right corner as well as around the lens of the back camera along with some dirt around it.The cover plastic on the back has dirt around the edges, like if somebody has been using the phone for awhile. Which to me was the case.  Also a new phone has plastic all around it, this phone has none. The phone arrived ready to be used, which mean; all I had to do was insert my Sim Card and it was ready to make a phone call.  There was no setup up time which is normal on a new phone; Which also suggest that the phone had been used.Remember before you use a new phone there are a few steps to follow, depending on how you answer your first question; At least on an AT&T; phone is that way.I'd emailed Soles etc about this issue, to give them a chance to fix it.  This was their reply:\"I am so sorry to hear this, we purchase in high-volume. sometimes phoned slip through that are damaged! you are welcome to return the phone to Amazon and can get a full refund. thank you\"I'd paid US$449.00 for this phone, now a phone like the one that I've received is about US$ 255.00, almost US$200.00 difference for that and a quote \"Slip Through\".  I don't think a seller should make a mistake that would cost its customers that amount of money. Plus all the time that you have to spend to return the item, get your money back and be able to buy another phone.  It took me several more days to get another phone; after everything was \"said and done\" with my return. In my case I have no money \"sitting around\" waiting to be spent every time a seller makes a mistake. Please Note:This review is based on my own personal experience with this seller, with this particular item.  Other buyers might have had  different experiences, which could have been either positive or negative.Update 02/20/2014\"If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on me\".***Well shame on me this time***I bought another New LG Optimus G Pro  from Soles etc. I really wanted this phone, I was kind of:  \"Let me give Soles etc a second chance\". Guess what, They dropped the ball again.  As soon as I opened the box, I saw the screen protector full of finger print, scratches on the screen, the rear camera has scratches and looked used.  This phone was worse than the first one. It went back inside the box right away, printed out the return label, dropped it at my closest UPS store the following day.  I did not do it the same day, because I came home late from class that night.I'm very picky when it comes to electronic, I like to keep them always in a perfect condition. Specially cellphone, you have to be very careful with them.  If you drop it, it might not work properly again.  So, am I going to take the risk of buying an used, scratched cell phone?; which btw suggest that the phone has been abused for US$ 449.00.  No way!!!!Just to clarified, I did not purchase this phone as a \"like new\" condition.  I bought it as a Brand New Phone.I think that all of you deserve to know this information, we can not give our hard earned money to a company that believe that we are a bunch of uneducated buyers or not smart enough to see the difference between a new phone and an used one.Soles etc is officially on my \"Do not Trust List\"My advise to all of you stay away from this seller, do not buy anything from Soles etc.  Not even a dollar for fifty cent. Two times, is too much.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellence.

Figured Id have fun \"auditioning\"  brands and phones first.Knew the specifications of the inventory. I'd match these with my wants. And needs.Apple. I experienced their Locked down, non REALmultitasking system. Very limited screen size. (More later)HTC their HTC First was on display at the time as a Facebook phone. The display was larger ( than Apple's), so that was good. Not a quad core, but that was no priority. Was quick. But only 1gig of ram. Hmmm.  NoHTC ONE. Really the best display in the business thats readily available. And bar none, the best when i was \"auditioning\". I was about to pull the trigger on this. But then i saw the Note II.Note II. NICE size. Saw that I don't like the Samsung bloatware\". Wait.... The Note II CPU is reported to induce system lag ( checked. 18 onth old tech ). And the Note's display. One look vs the HTC ONE made me want to run to the HTC. But then i saw the LG G PRO.  Why was it back in a corner I asked.  Broken? The sales rep said no. He \"Just didnt have it on, and in front\". ( ??? ) But it's a new model. I countered.LG G PRO Like I said above. Excellence.CPU Fast. I multi-task. Need for speed is real for me.Case. Ok, to Business class. Not like the HTC OneRam. 2 Gigs, I can have many programs/windows open at once. The system speed is maintained .Display. One word. AWESOME!!! Bright. Clear. Accurate. Not like Samsung's displays which look punchy. And the Note looked, well, I didn't like it.The Display on the G PRO, turned down to \"0\" at nite is still quite legible so I can work. Love it!\"Qslides\". Calculator. Calender. Video. NotesNow THIS is multi-tasking on the go.Qslide video. Allow me to watch videos as i work. You see, with the screen being 5.5 inches, it allows that. Also  that CPU continues with no lag. On any of these Qslide aps.Quick memo allows me to capture after a swipe down gesture ( ala Qslide gesture ) anything on display at the time. And then annotate it. Or erase my annotation, and start again. That Fed Ex package? I have the tracking number, ad well as what I see sent to my sales rep. He sees what I. See. I can send my \"captured\"  screen via messenger, viber, Facebook, Twitter etc, or save it in quick notes/Dropbox/Google Drive/etcAll in all I \"auditioned\" Apple to Samsung. I then Looked back. Which gave me the best experienceApple's offerings seemed \"Toylike\". Cute. But needy. Tiny. ( I need to be able to look up and do research on my phone, and as I am speaking to,and if need be go on the 'net to verify, and not miss a beat ).So hence, for me, Apples offerings are non-business like. Oh. I need to be able to have storage.  LG PROs come Standard in the USA with 32g. I upgrade + 64gigs and I have 96gigs. Without spending an additional $100!All in all, the G Pro was a \"Treat\" for me that was better than i could have imagined. If I buy something else this year it Will be an LG. But it'll be out of keeping up, not out of necessity.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lg Optimus g pro", "Author": "Ricardo Woo", "ReviewID": "RAWOBBC8CMDA6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is great.

I does freeze up on occassion and the side buttons are not placed correctly to prevent touching them when holstering or un-holstering for a call. I do like the screen size and the processor. Hate the At & t address book as it always commands your contacts and I have found no way to disable this or other factory installed apps which are a great nuisance.

Battery, charger, and microUSB wire are all in new plastic, and all physically marked as LG.

Registered with Consumer Cellular, voice and text are OK, but data using AT&T;  towers is mostly not available in Boone NC.  Too bad.  A buddy who retired from AT&T; told me that AT&T; only concern is the business traveler, so once you are off the main office and travel corridors, do not expect much from them.Battery Life:  Not too good.  As a tablet 5 or 6 hours is OK.  As a phone, not acceptable.  I do not use as a phone, carrying a small flip phone that will easily go 3 to 5 days without a recharge.

It runs just as good as my G did, no lag, no connectivity issues with my DLNA devices and I've had no problems running any of my applications.The battery life on the G was one of my favorite features, since I could get anywhere from 24-48 hours on a charge depending upon use.  The G Pro has a larger battery and improves on the G considerably.  I've had it off the charger now for 13.5 hours with light usage (E-Mail, Facebook, Texting), wireless on the entire time, bluetooth on part of the day and I'm finally down to 75% charge, with an estimated 33 hours left.Overall, this was a good purchase for me.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "awwweeee yeah", "Author": "andy turner", "ReviewID": "R3L98FDEQVEDOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meow i like this meow meow meow is good meow i love mr.
