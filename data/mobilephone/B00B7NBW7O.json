The white version set has the same box and the same accessories as the black version (black charger, black USB able, black stereo earbuds with a mic on the cable, etc.). The only difference is the white plastic body with very cool chrome (plastic) elements that are not really visible on the product's photo but in real life add elegance and value to the image.There is no reason to repeat here everything what I've already covered in my review for the black version. It's all the same.By the way, this one has arrived from BREED if it matters for anyone.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "the blu studio 5.3 11 unlocked phone is it", "Author": "Godswill Oba Okpara", "ReviewID": "RFKRIOL3SNEZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to state here that the blu studio 5.3 11 unlocked phone is wonderful, the actual performance of this phone is beyond expectation. I have used this phone for about five months, & it can be compared to Samsung Galaxy note 11.

Only bad thing is can't find a cover or case for the phone and absolutely no customer service help to find one.

It does everything I need it to do and more. Unexpectedly, I was really impressed with the quality of the pictures it takes.  I use it with free wifi and a pay-as-you-go phone service.  Because it is unlocked and I run without a service contract it costs me less than $75 per year for all of the phone services that I can use.  I have used it trouble-free for almost a year, and I am satisfied that it is a good value and a good quality phone.  Granted, I am retired and I have a very small social circle so my usage is relatively low.  That's why an unlocked phone works best for me.  But I love how the Android platform keeps my calendar and contact lists in sync across platforms including the phone, my graphics workstation, and my multiple laptops and tablet.  The only issue that bugs me is that the little mini-USB port is loose, which makes charging sometimes difficult because the charger keeps dropping out of the connection.  This is particularly annoying when I am trying to charge in the car and I can't keep looking at the charge light to see if the cable came loose.  Otherwise, I love this phone.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone with fast processor", "Author": "Madie Park \"green tea leaf\"", "ReviewID": "R2H37TTUXKT835", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far so good.

After a few email conversations I called the company personally. I talked to the owner \u201cJoe\u201d, as he stated, of the company. This man was so rude to me actually very hateful. He was not concern with any of my complains. I told him that is outrageous because I order the phone from his company and it didn\u2019t work properly and I got the short end of the stick (out of 35.00, paying to return the phone and no working phone actually no phone at all and the company has my 35.00 and the phone). I asked for him to fix the phone or send me a new one and he firmly stated he could not do that. I work in costumer services and the costumer is always right, so I have been told and I have never been talked to anyone as he talked to me. There was more to our conversation that I would not like to go into details but I will not recommend this company to anyone and educated my co-workers, colleagues, family and friends with this company. I really hope that every reads the reviews and listen to what happen and save the hassle, go to a different company.
