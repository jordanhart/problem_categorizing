GPS is accurate using maps and navi.  the battery seems to drain a bit faster than i liked.  Also for some reason i cant install shazam or any music recognition apps, says its imcompatible to the phone :(  Also a friend tried using a spring sim but didnt work, then again sprint uses a different type of cell protocol, CDMA i think, works well with ATT thought here in Cali.  One of the biggest suprises of the phone is that you can use teether and use the phone as a wifi hotspot, i wasn't able to do this on my iphone!pros +clear calls,emails connected smoothlysim worked right awaystreaming with pandora music is smoothTeetheringcon's -battery life seems a little less (still need to test this out furthur though)shazam or any android music recognition isin't supported for some reason, hoping i can find something out there i can usecant handle too much multi tasking, when running pandora and webrowsing it seemed to stutter a lil", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good Cellphone.

I tested the phone at AT&T; and got \"H\" connection, and it seemed very slow compared to my Tmo Galaxy S II, because it was. The antennae on the Dash 3.5 are about, I believe, half the max speed of 802.11b, or about 4-6Mbps. Better than Edge, certainly, and fine for email. The phone itself, while on wi-fi, was a delight. I loved the launcher, which made it possible to change the size of the fonts and icons on the applications screen. I really liked 2.3.6 (or whatever it has in it), more in fact than ICS on the Galaxy, and of course, far more than 2.1 or 2.2. Skype worked great, and the screen resolution was just fine; not as good as the similarly sized Moto Defy but nice and bright and clear enough. They give you two extra backs, in different colors, which is a cute touch.SO. My extra batteries arrived, and guess what? They were the model for the plain Dash, not the 3.5. The Dash 3.5 uses the C654804130T, and no one in the entire hemisphere apparently sells them. (Buy.com sells the other one, the one for the plain Dash. It is model C654205110T. An ebay seller with a phone number (who shall remain nameless) gave me that model# and a link to Buy.com. I ordered them before my own Dash 3.5 arrived.)So unless BLU itself responds with batteries, or Buy.com or its fulfiller finds some, I am sad to say my phone will be returned until such time as BLU gets its act together.The 1-star loss is because of the slow antenna BLU chose to put on this (and I assume on the VIVO 4.3 also), and the batteries being unavailable.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works with consumer cellular (see notes)", "Author": "Jeff Baygents", "ReviewID": "R2GXAWDFWEFXSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Android works great and has a very good performance.  I ensured I bought a high-speed storage card (class 10) so that performance wouldn't be slowed down due to the card.

Consumer Cellular support couldn't see the phone in order to push down the network settings so, I had to do some research.

Mulla", "ReviewID": "R3OK7H4TVOVFR4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What is not to like a adequately priced phone with android and a lot of apps available in the google play store. The default theme is not what I term user friendly for the majority of the users because the icons are huge.  I ended up downloading the lattice theme and was happy with the functionality after that theme was downloaded because of how small the screen is and the icons and text are much smaller with the lattice theme and it fits perfectly for this phone.I was ready to give it 4 stars, but I decided to play around with it a tad longer also this phone  has charging issues and I also was initially missing an usb cable to charge the device.  Instead of returning the unit I was willing to pay for the charger, but  Blu Support  did respond to my question but I wouldn't term them as going out of there way to help you which is probably a major caveat for the majority of users out there. However, Amazon is great and I would gladly give this a 4 or 5 star review but then again I'm reviewing the product and not Amazon. I was able to do an exchange for the same product after I sent in the first phone.The reason being is I attempted to contact them first they did give me an alternate place to shop for the cable but I was not able to find what I was looking for and the site itself didn't look reputable, so I was wondering why they would guide me there instead of Amazon or a site in which they hosted the cable so I can purchase it.I also had trouble charging the unit at times the Cable has to be forcefully inserted in the bottom. The design of the unit should not be that worrisome in which you worry about putting in the charger with force each time and then worry about breaking the phone.I've actually seen the YouTube video on this phone the item they sold me does not have the 3 interchangeable back covers or anything fancy. These are  the factory direct phones which has the bare-essentials of charger, cable, and a cover which I was not able to find in the box the first go around. I am not surprised by this at all especially with the price, but for a person who is tech savvy shouldn't have a problem using this phone with much fuss.I attempted to use the Crackle app but for whatever reason the app didn't work correctly, but I was able to play youtube videos without much of a hitch. Added a 32 gb msdHC Samsung chip in case I ever need to take pictures or music I'll probably will not even take half the space with apps or pictures in the long term because I'm not much of a shutterbug or a music listener.This is my first smartphone I purchased and I did use a Samsung one for my sister briefly, which I managed to lose when I was in India. My sister has an Iphone  now and I'll be honest I wasn't particularly jealous about her phone or cared because of the amount of data mining Apple does and the amount they charge for their products. Google and its ecosystem is no different but at least I'm not getting  ripped off or broke in the long term.To be honest the devices Apple sells and even Google are just toys for the people who have no idea how to use tech, but with the way things are that is the majority of the users in the United States now who do not know the innards of computing or to fix things in general so its just more money in the long run for the tech industry.Update: I was able to find the usb cable that I thought was missing I put it in my laptop bag while I was going to work and forgot it was there. It wouldn't have mattered anyways I bought an extra one at yugster so now I have two. The extra one I bought also came with a car charger which I put in my car.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "JMagnuson", "ReviewID": "R2IGX9RRGTGI5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose to buy this phone because I thought I was the only person in the world without a smartphone.

Occasionally I would have to turn it off and then turn it back on to straighten out any odd behavior. I have been careful with it as I wanted to keep it nice. Overall, not a bad phone for the price.HOWEVER. Just today (22 Sept 13) I was checking the weather and the phone slipped out of hand and landed on the counter top only one foot below, and presto, the phone is now DEAD as it now will not power on.I am very disgusted with idea that this cell phone is this FRAGILE. I've seen people drop their cell phone many times from a lot higher distances and they continue to work. I have even seen phones with broken glass and they're still working. THIS PHONE IS WAY TOO FRAGILE. If a company wants to gain market share the cell phone market they need make a more durable phone.SO, after only 3 months of use, not a scratch on the phone, I have one little accident and now I have to buy new phone.

This is the second Blu smartphone I have bought. Both of them have suffered from \"old age\" very quickly--too quickly for my money's liking. Calls will be dropped frequently and without notice. I will try at times to use my landline and call the phone but get a no response or a busy signal.The primary feature that has made me very disappointed and angry with the phone is the very short battery life. After having owned the phone for a week or so, the battery will literally need charging every day. Also, what I realized was that once you left the charger connected to the electricity after the battery registered \"charged\" the battery began swelling. So in an attempt to save the battery I found myself having to take on the role of battery monitor and guard. That obviously kept me from my actual duties and house tasks.I actually have another phone now and I made sure it was not going to be another Blu phone.

I could see it functioning maybe as a text/call only phone, but the phone itself only has a paltry 100 MB of RAM. Just the required apps to run basic services of the phone take up about half that. If you use Facebook and/or Twitter, expect that to be eaten up way too quick and most processes of your phone to go to a screeching halt.I can deal with the slowness, but it also got the most unfortunate problem after less than 24 hours of use: I would receive duplicates of text messages, sometimes up to 4 of the same message, at a time. I also, according to some of my friends, were sending out multiples of the same text. This is just plain not good. I factory reset the phone twice and the problem persisted. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the way the phone handles messages when its RAM is completely used up, or if it's just a plain faulty phone. I don't know, I'm not an expert on cells.I will give it one huge piece of praise, though. The battery life in this thing is INCREDIBLE! I couldn't let my HTC Inspire sit for longer than, say, 13 hours idle before it desperately needed a recharge. The whole time owning this phone, though, the battery's capacity only dropped about 20%.Bottom line: As a starter Android phone used for NOTHING ELSE other than texts or calls, it works decently and the battery lasts a long time.
