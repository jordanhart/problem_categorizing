{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia Mini Pro (2011)", "Author": "damien-tt", "ReviewID": "RX838WI95RPKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent upgrade to a pocket-sized legend!Previously a user of the X10 mini and looking to purchase something similar, I stumbled upon the Xperia Mini Pro available right here at Amazon! The key deciding factors to this purchase at the time was the cost, features (of which there are many) and the colour. Naturally I researched the specs of this handset at GSMArena.com (and I won't dive into all that detail but merely point you to the link [...]Pros:- Gingerbread (2.3)! Smooth and very easy on the eyes. Quite fast and responsive too!- Front and rear cam with support for skype (gtalk vid chat and a swype-like keyboard among other things to come in the 2.34 update at the end of October) On a side note it includes MSN messenger?! Very nice Sony :)- Supports adobe flash (can be updated to 11.0) as well as adobe air (downloadable)- Sony Bravia Engine (picture quality looks awesome)- And a host of other enhancements too numerous to mention (1GHz processor, 5MP with face and smile detection,autofocus, LED flash 512MB of Ram, Track ID for audiophiles and a host of other features)Cons:- Battery life for me with only wifi and edge enabled lasts approximately 8 or 9 hours (yeah I also play games and listen to music on it). Sony should have provided a bigger capacity battery for it, but then the size would have increased. In my opinion not too bad but it could have been better...no problem charging though.Overall the Xperia Mini Pro SK17i is a must have if you're in the market for a powerful yet small factor android handset. Coupled with the qwerty keyboard, a host of features and enhancements to the previous X10 series and a great design (I am loving the the smooth sort of rubbery design for the battery cover) I have no reservations about recommending it to anyone who is interested.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Where is the quality control?", "Author": "viceversa", "ReviewID": "R3I74C2W2SUJHL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone after returning X10 mini pro (u20i).  I basically was looking for a nice compact Android phone.  As the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy are way to big to lug around.At first glace, everything about this phone seemed perfect.  Up until I started to use it.  While talking to a friend, the person noted that they were getting crickets sounds and clicking sound on their end.  I didn't what to think because on my end, everything sounded fine.A few days later, I recorded a short video using the phone.  Uploaded the video to my desktop and played it.  Low and behold, there it was.  Some electrostatic / cicada chirping sounding noise was heard in the video.  You can hear / see the a youtube sample here:[...]After researching this on the Sony Ericcson forum, it showed that almost all the owner of this phone is having the same issue.  SE released an \"update\" to \"fix\" this very issue.  However, it does not \"fix\" the problem.  The noise is still there, but with the update, it somewhat reduces the noise.  The update is probably just a filter....Another issue with the phone is the electrostatic noise that can be heard from the headphone jack.  Just stick your ear to the headphone jack and you'll hear the electrostatic noise that is also showing up in the recorded videos and your phone conversation.The phone itself is nice.  It's a bit on the THICK side, but that's because of the keyboard.  I do however, like this phone better than the X10 mini pro.  This phone is more refined.  The Gingerbread 2.3 Android OS is awesome TBH.  Compared to what the 10 mini had.The keyboard on this phone works fine.  I have no issues with it.  I did lose a few 'new' contacts for whatever reason. After synching the phone with Google, 2 of my new contacts numbers were overwritten with the old number they had.  This happened twice.In any case, I returned this phone.  I don't see the point of offering HD video recording capability with it includes some crappy audio.For a few dollars more, you can get the Sony Ericcson Ray.  There are plenty of options out there.  No need to get a phone with defects.  And if you read the SE forum, Sony doesn't care.  They are sweeping the issue under the rug.Which is why everyone is looking elsewhere. I predict Sony Ericcson to be out of business soon.  Maybe Sony will buy out Ericcson share and things will get better.  But until then, go with another manufacturer.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely nice small phone", "Author": "R. Vining \"X Rays R Me\"", "ReviewID": "R1AYKPZRP1KHIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I very nearly did not buy this phone because I read a review saying - in all capital letters no less - that it will not work on American 3G networks. I absolutely needed a phone that did work on 3G. I don't pay for a data package. A personal mobile WIFI hotspot (Truconnect) is how I access the internet, and it uses Sprint's 3G network.I don't know what's going on with the other reviewer, but my own experience is that THIS PHONE WORKS PERFECTLY WITH 3G, no problems at all.I bought it for my wife and the small size is ideal for her. Not everyone will like the 3\" screen. It's not big.Slide out keyboard, nice camera with flash, front facing camera also, 1 Gig processor, Android 2.3, this was the best cell phone I could find in this price range.Everything works, we love it.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waste of my money", "Author": "N. Samuels", "ReviewID": "R21QPYPMRKZW00", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone itself would have been great.  I ordered this item brand new from New Generation Products.  The item that was shipped appeared new on the surface. once I removed the back cover to install sim card and battery, I could see the item was used.  It looked like its been dropped and the power button did not work.  The phone took forever to arrive, and when I tried to exchange or return it, the seller told me via email that the time allotted for returns had expired. I wasted $365.

Internet connection is slow at times but what the hell I've been using this for a year now.

Since I have a Droid Bionic in the states which has a 4inch screen, going to this much smaller screen was much different at first, but I quickly adapted to it. The phone is not particularly powerful - good luck playing any games other than solitaire without the graphics freezing up- but it is a nice size if you are looking for something small, and the slide-out keyboard is fantastic. However, I was constantly having problems with the internal storage filling up, even after I had moved as many applications as I could to the SD card. The other thing is that it came with a sticker on the box claiming that it was upgradable to android 4.0 - however, I have as of yet been unable to do so. Both the sony update manager and the phone itself claim that there are no updates available for the phone, and that the current os version - 2.3.4 (gingerbread) - is the latest available for the phone. I have researched the problem and have discovered that the individual product version that I received has yet to have android 4.0 released for it, whereas android 4.0 has been released for most versions of the Xperia Mini. I am unsure as to whether this is true for all international versions of the phone, or just the version that I received - YMMV. All in all, I would definitely recommend the phone as a cheap solution for a short trip, as google maps on it was absolutely priceless when I was trying to get somewhere, and that alone was worth the cost over a simple feature phone. However, the small internal storage, small screen size and poor graphical capabilities, along with inability to be upgraded to Android ICS (on my model at least), prevent me from being able to recommend it as a long-term solution.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Xperia Mini Pro rocks", "Author": "C\u00e9sar Bastidas", "ReviewID": "R3GPXE3T0RHCAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is truly amazing for the price, it does what it should. The user interface is smooth and very good looking, the keyboard is a charm to use, really quick for texting. As for battery life, is not that good, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Stock android 4.0.4 update is very slow, I'd recommend going into xda-developers and search for a custom rom of your liking, I'm using Xperia Ice Cream Pureness and it is smooth like butter plus I get to play games on the device :). I'd recommend this for people who likes to text a lot and is searching for quality products like Sony.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Smartphone with a physical QWERTY keyboard", "Author": "Dustyn Fink", "ReviewID": "R2650BZL4IAAT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after my Motorola Atrix 4G died on me, I was in search of a phone with a physical keyboard as I was sick and tired of using a completely touchscreen phone.  Luckily, this Sony Xperia Mini Pro fit the bill, and the price was decent.It is running Android 4.0 (ICS) thanks to an update and couldn't be smoother.  I am getting used to the smaller screen and still actually use the touchscreen at times for typing emails and messages.  The phone is nice and small and users with smaller hands (such as myself) will really appreciate it.  People with big hands may find the phone too small for use, but sony has luckily integrated some unique features (such as \"app corners\") to utilize all the space of the screen.Sound quality is great (and I use my phone a lot for music and videos).  I was a little hesitant coming from the Atrix with such fantastic sound quality and Android 2.3, but the sony does very well on its own.  The external speaker is nice and loud and is suitable for both music and speakerphone calls.Talk quality is really great and the voices come through nice and loud and people do not ever have trouble hearing what I am saying.  The phone also has noise compensation built in to cut down on background noise during a call.The 1Ghz processor does a great job of playing games, viewing videos, or other resource-heavy tasks and makes the ICS interface really slick.The screen is sharp and the colors are very vibrant.  The touchscreen takes a bit to get used to and does not seem to support multi-touch which makes texting kind of cumbersome (cue the physical keyboard).I have the white version and I must say that the exerior is quite pleasing to the eye.  It has a very modern look to it and seems constructed well.  The only thing i do not like about the exterior is the USB port cover.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to get it off without using a small flat object to pry up on it.  I may end up cutting it off...Battery life is surprisingly good for an android phone. I can get a solid day's use out of it when watching about 2 hours of youtube videos, texting steady throughout the day, viewing emails and spending time on TheChive app (can you tell I'm a university student?)I have taken lots of pictures with this phone and it seems to do very well despite its compact size.  The 5mp camera with digital zoom seems to be fairly typical of phones today and I am very happy to say that this camera does replace my 14mp point-and-shoot...I have yet to upload any photos to my computer, however I assume they would be as sharp and vibrant as they appear on the screen.Overall, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a unique phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard.  It is one of the best android phones I have used to date.  I will purchase another sony phone when this one is out-of-date.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Lil Mobile Phone", "Author": "S.

R", "ReviewID": "R23LN0B12060PE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this baby, it beats many bigger android phone easily. When rooted is even more powerful and versatile.

HD recording is \"good\", could be better. sony Camera's effects are great, night shots are amazing!processor speed runs almost any game smoothly, and memory limitation can be fixed moving apps to SD (must be rooted).

These 2 are of the rare phones where slapping on any case, no matter how stylish, would be a grave injustice.The form factor is excellent. It's very short, yet thick and hefty, so it fits well into your palm even if you have big hands. The plastic backing on the white version is rather slippery though, so you do have to be careful(the black version has a more rubbery, matte finish).Sony Ericcson's user interface is superb. It was recently updated to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, but even if you stick to the stock Gingerbread 2.3.5, you will not be disappointed. It's stylish and slick, much better than HTC's Sense and Samsung's TouchWiz shells (although HTC's weather home screen is by far the best for a weather widget). Even though it's a single core phone, everything moves with grace, style, and zip, even on the more RAM-intensive Ice Cream Sandwich. Although touch-input responsiveness and accuracy will never be as good as the iPhone's, overall, as far as the UI goes, it's the best - the best of the Androids, and better than Nokia's Maemo and Apple's iOS.Web-browsing and video-watching on this 3-inch screen will never be as good as the other phone's bigger screens, and its 480x320 resolution is inferior. However, on that small 3-inch screen you won't be able to really tell, and the Bravia Engine and Reality Display do shine - it's simply a bright, gorgeous screen.Typing on this phone is a dream come true, since it has a dedicated sliding QWERTY keyboard like the Nokia N900. I still love the SWYPE-style input the best, and that is not something you can currently do with an iPhone or the older Nokias. On that end, this phone reigns supreme giving you the best of both worlds.I think Apple's ecosystem is still superior to Android's, but if you want a good second phone, I feel this is the best Android phone for that purpose.Highly recommended!", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small Powerhouse", "Author": "Akinfemi", "ReviewID": "R2PRAIS5XKDWPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a great, compact, device, the interface is snappy and very user friendly.PLEASE NOTE---THE INTERNATIONAL VERSIION OF THIS PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT....NOT SUPPORT...US 3G NETWORKS.
