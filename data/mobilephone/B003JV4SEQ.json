When I turned phone on it needed a password. I stopped at t-mobile and they advised that the operating system had been changed over to Android system, which made the phone inoperable. To say the least this was a problem on our trip and continues to be of no use.I feel the phone was not represented properly. Please advise what recourse we have. Thank you", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very solid phone", "Author": "R.

Ramsey \"RRLEO\"", "ReviewID": "R29LDVJKXE6FE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: The phone is great. I'm using SPB Shell 3.5 Demo 15day trial right now, and I'm loving it. I canceled my Cox Internet because I use HD2 for internet sharing app/its free sharing. There's an app that can make the HD2 5 devices for data plan (handango.com). The music sounds great when I connect to my truck for mp3 music. Videos playing dvd quality also. Pictures are high resolution. Great for entertainment value.Cons: There is a lock up issue. Unplug/battery away from your Smart Phone/computer/laptop at least 30 minutes to reboot. Battery life lasts about 1 day, so keep charger cable/outlet plug near you.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelent product!", "Author": "Alb", "ReviewID": "RJIJ6BNKNUP00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good and not so expensive Android phone, so you will ask: Why an HD2 then? It comes with Windows Mobile not Android OS. Well the answer for this is that the T-mobile HD2 is a great piece of hardware! 1Ghz cpu, 512+ of RAM and 1Gb of internal storage, but lacks of a good OS. Windows Mobile 6.1 and 6.5 are coming to an end as Windows Phone 7 arrives. So I looked at the XDA Developer Forums for a good phone capable of Android and felt in love with this PPC, so if you want an Android phone quite close to a HTC Desire without spending $400-$500 this is a good choise! Plus there's a chanse it could run WPH7 too!", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R36NWDODD5H6M7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice person, would definitely buy from him again.
