{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GOOD phone, that has the potential to be GREAT!!!", "Author": "Jae", "ReviewID": "R2I7RD20BLS1H3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone via one day shipping Nov 5th. I just got back from the post office from mailing it back to Amazon (Nov 9). During my FULL three days of ownership I must say that the phone is indeed a very nice phone. I will list some pro's and con's I found for the phone...Pro's:-Android 2.1 (Eclair) Pretty decent (this is listed in my con's as well)-8GB micro sd card (I did not get around to using this as I have my 16gb card from my other phone.)-Nice bright screen. Also it is rumored that it is made with gorilla glass (so it will be hard to scratch up.)-Sound quality from music and phone calls are nice, although the music volume could stand a tad bit improvement.-When navigating through the phone to find things there is little to no lagging.-Apps are easy to install from market. (Must have internet connection to access it).-Camera and Video Recording qualities are decent.-Wi-fi connection avail... (To my knowledge, per jessica from tmobile, they do not charge you if you use your OWN wi-fi connection, so thats a plus.)-This has a speed of 720 mh so it is close to 1gh like the droid x and other phone models.-Overall look of the phone is awesome, I took it out in public once and got loads of compliments.There are more PRO's, but I cant remember them all, I will update later when they come to mind...Con's:-While the Android 2.1 is nice, everyone on the motorola and mobile forums are waiting for the Android 2.2 update that way simple things such as saving photos and apps to memory card will be easy as pie.-The shutter sound everytime you take a picture. Even if you have it on silent/vibrate and take pictures then, the shutter is always on and loud as heck to boot. This is definitely not the phone to have when trying to sneak a picture of something because it will get you caught,lol.-While the screen is indeed nice, it is also a magnet for fingerprints and smears. I found myself constantly wiping it off. Tried to use a stylus to eliminate fingerprints, and its not calibrated for that, FINGERS ONLY!!! The back of the phone which seems rubbery is fingerprint haven as well.-Your apps save to the phone's memory instead of the sd card.-Your pictures also save to the phone's memory and have no option of being saved to the sd card (trust me I have looked.)-Unless your a programmer and can write scripts, there is no way to get rid of some of the pre-installed applications.-Last but not LEAST the VERY REASON that I RETURNED MY PHONE..... The battery sucks major ones..... I believe I had a faulty battery as I got it on Friday and from friday at 4pm until Monday @5am it has been on the charger for over 50 hours and yet the highest max for th batter was at 54%. I figured the 54% was enough to do a motorola software update (via settings on the phone) BOY was I WRONG!!! My phone has not been the same since. I had it on the charger during the update and the led lights came on, the moto logo would appear every ten minutes or so, but it wouldnt load up... I figured I would do recovery mode, was able to pull it up, but because I was lacking battery juice so I couldnt go through with it. I dont understand how a phone can be on the charger left alone for at least 6hours with no usage at all,and still not even be 15% charged.Aside from the battery issue, as I am absolutely PO'D about because I had to spend $15 to ship it back to amazon, now I gotta wait a whole week or so for them to get it and refund my money so that I can purchase a different one.Not to mention since I was not able to power the phone back on I was not able to factory reset it before sending it back. With the refund I will get another xt720, as aside from the battery issue (which i believe was faulty, plus I will be ordering a backup battery) I liked the phone. I think the phone is just what I want and need in a phone right now..A tidbit for those who are ordering from Amazon. I am not sure if it was just MY PHONE or if they recycle parts or whatever. But you will definitely want to review all of the items and check for usage before using them. As I was packing up my phone to send it back to them I noticed that the manual didnt look that crisp(looked used/handled before), the wall charger they gave me was scratched up and the prongs rusted at the bottom (took a picture of this, not sure how clear it is though.)and, the box itself was not \"sealed\" as most phones are, nor did it look new. I overlooked all of this because I was in AWE to have a new phone, but glad that I was able to check it before sending it back.. My thing is, if I am paying $400+ dollars for a phone, I expect EVERYTHING in the box to be brand spanking new, Amazon totally dropped the ball on this one. From this point on, I will be checking everything from them PRIOR to use.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, Almost Excellent", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1KKRLQCY8E35O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a dedicated Nokia owner for about the past 5 years and 3 handsets, back then I knew that there was nothing that could compete with my N series devices and my predecessor the great E71 due to unmatched hardware and excellent S60 OS. But as time passed, I wanted more from my phone.So after seeing all the fuss in the smart phone market, the two on top were Android and iOS. I never liked Apple as a company but was always inspired by the Innovative Google so I knew that an Android would be my next phone. (Nokia is still lagging behind with an intuitive and innovate phone OS)Since i don't live in the US, it is impossible for me to go to a neighborhood T-mobile or AT&T; and get a brand new phone for free. (Lucky Americans :) no hate) So i was on a hunt to find an unlocked android phone with the best hardware vs. price. After giving considerations to the HTC Desire and the Samsung Galaxy S, I chose the XT720, as there was not much difference in the hardware to warrant almost $200 more.PROS:+ Phone is solid and well built (coming from a mostly metal phone (E71) I did not want a plasticy feeling phone. the XT720 seems to be well built)+ Excellent OS (I just love this Android. beautiful UI and does everything i want and need and more)+ Phone is pretty fast. (comes with 720 MHZ processor that is capable of 1GHZ easily overclocked for great speed)+ Beautiful Screen+ Touch Screen very responsive (i was hesitant to change to a touch screen only phone. but with a little practice i type out texts very quickly)+ Excellent CAmera (Xenon flash is amazing, along with great AF system, and 8 megapixel i can take great photos and will always have an excellent camera whenever there is a \"kodak moment\"; photography has been a hobby of mine therefore this I must give major props for the camera system)+Call quality (excellent call quality i think it's due to moto's Crystal Talk technology. there is a mic on the back of the phone that works to cancel out background noise. works excellent)Cons:-Phone won't be upgraded to 2.2 Froyo (this is a trend taking place with all mobile manufacturers not only moto. they do this in order to have new handsets look more attractive for purchase)-Internal Memory = 128MB. there is limited internal memory which means that you will run out memory for apps some time. (Froyo gives the ability for installation to SD card but unfortunately you will be unable to do so on this phone) most apps are very small and you will still be able to do a lot with 128. plus a 8GB sd is bundled with the phoneIn conclusion, if you need an unlocked phone or you don't want to bound by bloated contracts, this phone is a great purchase purchase. Could have been 5 stars with Froyo.Note: most of the low ratings for this phone is just because owners are mad that it won't be upgraded to 2.2, and not on the handset itself which i think is unfair for such a good machine.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Android and Bad Motorola!", "Author": "Nitin", "ReviewID": "RRZJ08RSF7RVI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have purchased this phone a month back and it took the international logistic arrangements almost 2 weeks to let me use this beauty. I am from India and got it from amazon.com as it was available at 100 USD cheaper cost than what is market rate here. From last two weeks I am completely hooked to the phone and has used almost all the features and installed tons of software from android market place. Before buying a phone I knew that the phone is having Android 2.1 and the version has few issues which google has promised that they will clear them in the next release i.e. 2.2. But After buying a phone, before it comes to me, motorola has published a model wise schedule of android up-gradation. To my utmost surprise, they have denied the upgrade for the XT720 and ruthlessly stated that there will be no upgrade for the device. I will suggest anybody buying this phone to be informed about motorola's upgrade schedule and check their requirements.

Herald\"", "ReviewID": "R22GTRTPRTFESK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OVERVIEW:There is NOTHING about this phone that stands out as \"great\". I have owned it for about 1 month and find it leaps & bounds better than my old LG GX500, but that ain't sayin' much. It has a few nice features such as the 8mp camera, which is among the highest in the cell phone market today. The touchpad keyboard is very nice for thumb typing, plus, I like the auto-fill feature (this is due to Android 2.1, not the phone, but you get the drift). Also, the Motorola Phone portal is a cool idea. To be able to manipulate some of your phone's settings via you PC over wi-fi is a useful concept, but poorly executed here since you are incapeable of viewing, editing, moving, or, deleting your apps from the low 173MB internal memory (some say 128MB, but mine shows 173MB) to your SD card. Android 2.1 does not allow for moving apps from the internal memory to the SD card, and since 2.2 will not be allowed by Motorola on this device it will soon become a problem of, \"which app do I delete so I can add a new one?\".PROS:-The 8MP camera and the Xenon flash.-Call quality is clear even on the ROSHON (Afghanistan) network.-Micro-USB for power makes it easy to find a replacment cable/adapter if ever lost.-HDMI output is a nice touch, as is the Motorola Phone Portal (even though I find it useless).-Battery consumption is a bit better than the iPhone 4. It all depends on how many features you are using and how often you use them, but I have gotten 2-3 days on one charge with minimal use.-Keypad and auto-fill feature is better than iPhone.CONS: (or Other quirks/gripes):-Can't swap apps from internal memory to SD card.-It's *slightly* bulky, a little larger than an iPhone 4.-I find the power button is hard to access one-handed as I'm pulling it from my pocket.-Sending a text is a 2-stage process of composing & clicking \"Done\", then clicking \"Send\", (I would prefer if the \"Done\" step was not necessary).-The vibrate mode is weak and I hate to use a ringtone. I miss calls/texts often while the phone is in my pocket because I do not feel it.-Skype video is not available with this phone.-Not being patched to Froyo (Android 2.2).", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "MILESTONE XT720", "Author": "DANNY BOY", "ReviewID": "R9OEQX5T2IGM5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "THIS CELL PHONE IS GOOD AND DURABLE, VOICE IS CLEAR AND IT'S EASY TO CALL AND ANSWER PHONE.

I believe Dexter has discontinued support and updates for this device (his modded rom), though I am not sure. there is still a fairly large community to assist you if you need any help for updates or run into any issues.Phone review itself:First off I'm a previous Blackberry storm user and I will say I liked the texting on that much better because the keys had 2 letters on them and with this phones narrow screen its hard typing in the verticle position as the touch keys are small and very close together. If you have big thumbs you'll run into a problem.In the horizontal position its a little better but very sensitive. It might be just me not being used to it yet but don't take my word for it.The Camera 8 MP.. but sometimes it doesn't seem that way. In video camera mode there are a bunch of lines going horizontally across the screen like its static-y or something -  so don't plan on recording HD videos on this phone.I used to own a Motorolo Krazr forever ago and it really reminds me of that phone. Same weight, and some material used to build the phone - metal, heavy, and perhaps dare I say some what durable?This isn't one of those phones where you can go to walmart and look at accessories for as this phone is kind of rare and you can only get it online if you live in the United States so don't plan on getting any accessories such as, screen covers, cases, or otterboxes at your local electronics places. Plus, Amazon is the way to go anyway, why else would you be on there?The side buttons do not work very well with the 2.2 froyo version I have and bringing up the camera is kind of slow to be honest with a slow shutter speed.Call quality is pretty goodI'm not sure how I feel about these Android phones... it may take me some getting used to.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone just a defective battery cover", "Author": "L.

I'd like to contact everyone that gave it a good review and see how long they actually liked this piece of crap.I bought one for myself and for my daughter when we upgraded our cellphone plans. Her phone and mine had the same problems. The phone locks up, it has SD card errors, it randomly powers down with no warning whatsoever (even during calls). The flash doesn't work and the camera sucks without flash. It is painfully slow to do anything. There are several apps and games that simply don't work on this phone at all. Text messages are sometimes not received for days on end and then you receive them all at once. When it freezes up it will still ring and it still plays message notification sounds, etc, but it will not respond. The only option is to pull the battery and start over.I called Motorola because the phones were still under warranty - we had all these issues from about the first week of ownership. I sent one of the phones in to Motorola for all these issues and more, for a warranty claim. Motorola's customer service and repair teams are completely useless. After being without my phone for 10 days, I received it back from them pretty much as I sent it. It had the same errors that were listed on the repair ticket. All they did was a factory reset and apparently didn't even test to see if that resolved the issues. I could have done that myself. So, I called them and was promised a return phone call at least 3 times; my call was never returned. Finally I got someone on the line and they offered to \"escalate my issue\" and this time I sent BOTH phones in. I included very detailed descriptions of all the issues I had been having, per their request. Again I was without both phones for several days and they was returned to me in the same exact condition. Not one single issue was resolved. After many, many more frustrating calls and emails between myself and Motorola, they never offered any other solution but to keep sending it in for repair. I gave up.I HATE THIS PHONE. I paid good money for not one but TWO of this terrible product and Motorola refused to stand by it. How can two of the exact same product have all these same issues?

Although searching was still better and easier with the centro.The one major complaint I have with the xt720, which makes the phone not usable, is the battery life.When I first got the phone, I would get one day of use per charge. I'm not a heavy cell phone user, and I don't have a data plan. I only go online via WIFI and that's pretty seldom. I also implemented all the battery saving techniques that I read online (lower the light intensity, no wallpaper, etc).After one month of use, the battery life has gotten worst. Yesterday I took the cell phone off the charger in the morning, and by night it would be down to 5% only - and that was no calls and no WIFI use. The phone just sat idle and whole day, and yet the battery got drained way too fast.I might have kept the phone if there was a bigger battery I could upgrade to. But I searched both Amazon and Ebay, and found no larger capacity battery.I don't know how Motorola deemed the xt720 a viable product with this sort of battery life.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rip off by motorola", "Author": "shedron hall dennis", "ReviewID": "R1KBRWY9RGU5L3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone cant be updated to froyo, and also you cant save your apps to your sd card, so please dont do like me and spend your money on this phone its not worthed", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this phone", "Author": "SpinWard", "ReviewID": "RYGX8Q50K3VOZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Motorola had promised a Froyo update for this phone months ago and only recently posted on their forums that it will remain on Android 2.1.
