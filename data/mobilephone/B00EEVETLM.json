Go to a electronics website like CNET to review the phone.  It's an excellent phone.  I'm in the US and don't plan on traveling outside the US, so all I can comment on is that it WORKS and the phone is excellent.  What I want to say that makes this a superb purchase is the price!  At just a little over $200 (counting tax) less than what I would have paid at ATT, this purchase is a no-brainer.UPDATE:  It does NOT work.  Initially I removed sim card from old Motorola android phone and put it into this phone and yes, everything worked.  After trying to remove my voicemail from Google mail and use the ATT voicemail function, I had trouble with it accessing my voicemail, so I called ATT for help. They said the phone (IME #) needed to be paired with the SIM card. Ok fine, all this does is tell ATT what phone I'm using on their network. Voice mail fixed. What happened then was the phone could no longer access ATT's internet data.  This phone was able to make phone calls and text but NO internet data access. I was told I needed to contact Samsung support. Samsung USA could not help me because they said the phone was built for the UK and suggested I call (overseas long distance) to Samsung UK for support.  too much hassle. So, I just returned the phone to Amazon. So beware ;)  Just buy from ATT next time.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "it is not in spanish", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "R1K0HJGFIO9YZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is just in english not spanish!!
