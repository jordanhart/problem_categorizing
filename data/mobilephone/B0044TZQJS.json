{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for trip to Europe", "Author": "poppy", "ReviewID": "R1R41IX1LV0CW5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for a trip to Italy. Set up was easy - on arrival in Rome, I only had to slip my TIM (Italian phone company) Sim card into the appropriate slot on the phone and follow the instructions for changing my preferred language to English and I was off  and running - able to communicate during my recent vacation there. There was only one glitch when I found I was unable to call my husband's Italian cell phone number. After being assured by the Italian cell phone company that there was no problem on their end, I figured out that the \"Smart Dialing\" feature on this Blackberry was adding a USA prefix each time I dialed my husband's Italian phone no. (I guess based on the fact that most of the numbers in my address book had a USA prefix). Once I disabled \"Smart\" Dialing (not so smart, as it turned out!) everything worked perfectly. I specifically purchased a phone with Wi-fi so that I would not have to pay data charges while in a Wi-fi area. This turned out to be of great benefit, since the apartment I stayed in had free Wi-fi. I would give this product a 5-star rating if not for the fact that the camera sometimes stops working and you have to remove the battery and replace it in order to reboot the phone, at which point the camera works again. The same thing happens on my Blackberry pearl that I use here in the US, not sure why, but this was the only glitch I experienced and I otherwise highly recommend purchasing this unlocked, quadband, wi-fi GSW phone if you are planning a trip to Europe and have a Verizon phone like I do, here in the US, that does not work on any European network. I hope to use it again on many European trips in the future!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "ReReB \"unique shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R1OH6ZNXII9DIA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I was looking for a unlocked cell phone I knew that I had to find one that was compatible with Verizon. I even used the search as unlocked cell phones for VERIZON!!! Since this site came up and when I order this phone I specifically checked the fine print and there was no mention of what cell company this phone could be used for and in the same token it didn't state is wasn't compatible with Verizon.  I received notification that it was mailed on a Sunday and when I hadn't received after a week I contacted the company asking about the shipment.  With no explanation after two days they got back to me and said it was on its way.  I had to request what the reason was behind the hold up...I received the phone only to find out that when I went to Verizon I could not use the phone since it was strictly for use with AT&T.;  What a waste of money and time. It only goes to show me that I should never buy something without getting in writing that it will work with whatever I was hoping to use it with.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Item", "Author": "Soccrchic79", "ReviewID": "R3S4B1X4G62A0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am always nervous to order electronics online.
