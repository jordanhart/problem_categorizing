Was intended as a gift, but the recipient actually wanted a white phone. Upon request, seller accepted to exchange it for a white 8GB model which also matched the description and was shipped in no time. Gift recipient changed his mind and finally decided to keep the initial black IPhone 4 16GB. Seller agreed to have the white IPhone returned and fully refunded.

Calls dropped...heck, they disappeared!  I'd look at the phone while on a call and there would be a totally different screen!!  Spent way more time charging it than using it.
