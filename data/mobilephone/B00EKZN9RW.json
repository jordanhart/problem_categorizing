{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Good LOCKED $99 4G LTE Smartphone - But Has Limited Apps Storage", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R36CDSR75ORXWT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The light, compact MetroPCS LG Optimus F3 delivers fast 4G LTE data speeds at a good price, as low as $99 at the MetroPcs website. In May, Metro released the new LG Optimus L70, similar to the LG F3, for just $49.Weak points:  Limited memory for apps. In order to download new apps you must buy a micro SD card, and move large apps to the card, and you must delete or disable the apps you don't use before installing new apps.Wi-Fi connections can be flaky. Half a web page will download and then the Wi-Fi connection cuts off. However, even with the flaky wi-fi connection, streaming music, such as Pandora or Spotify, works well much of the time.Strong points:  Very good call quality.  When I am in a strong signal area, voices are clear and natural.  And, my text messages are delivered promptly.  An LED light under the home button blinks to remind me if I forget to answer a text.The F3 is a LOCKED phone for MetroPCS prepaid customers. After 90 consecutive days of paid service, MetroPcs will provide the unlock code if you want to switch to another GSM provider such as AT&T.;The LG F3 weighs a very light 4 ounces with a very nice four inch screen.  It fits easily in one hand, being similar in size and weight to the Apple Iphone 5c.The F3 at MetroPCS is locked to MetroPcs. You should enter your address in the coverage map at the MetroPCS website to zoom in and verify the coverage in your neighborhood BEFORE buying a MetroPCS phone. MetroPCS 4G monthly plans with unlimited phone calls and unlimited texts begin at $40 per month including ALL fees and taxes. Your bill is $40 PERIOD.The LG F3 has a dual core processor that provides enough speed for most applications but not enough for the most demanding games. The camera provides good pictures in bright sunlight and but only mediocre pictures indoors or in poor light. The videos are only adequate, not great.The front speaker sounds good in a quiet room but is not loud enough for a noisy environment. Turning on the noise cancellation feature improves the clarity of calls. The rear speaker works well as a speaker phone but is not designed for loud music.Only a tiny 1gb of internal memory is available for installing apps, which rules out installing mega-size games. You can add up to a 32gb memory card for music, videos and photos. Some apps, not all, can be moved to the external SD card.You can free up a lot of memory by going to each app you do not use and uninstalling their updates, unselecting notifications, then selecting delete or disable.Apps most people can remove include Google+ , Google Books, Google Magazines, Google Movies, Google Music, and the Chrome browser. Be sure to uninstall all updates before disabling an app to free more memory.The F3 is small and light but it has a massive battery that will enable many folks to get 24 hours per charge. However, just one hour of streaming Netflix videos over 4G uses 20% of your battery as will using GPS navigation. Wi-Fi connections can be a problem with some routers. I have to reset my home router several times a day to keep the F3 connected. Oddly, wifi is quite reliable with streaming music, but flaky with most websites.Cases for the Sprint/Virgin Mobile LG F3 have curved upper corners while cases for the T-Mobile/MetroPCS MS659 version have square upper corners. Search Amazon for \"case MS659 only\" or \"case T-Mobile only\".Most T-Mobile stores sell the terrific Body Glove Dimensions case.A invaluable feature of the MetroPCS version of the LG F3 is wifi calling that enables you to place free phone calls over any wifi connection in the world.Note:  The newer LG Optimus L70 has a larger screen than the F3 and a much more reliable wi-fi connection.  The L70 sells for $49 on the MetroPcs website.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for your money...", "Author": "DP21", "ReviewID": "R1LHHQJERV5V7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my mother a couple of weeks ago as a beginner phone. My personal phone is a Samsung Galaxy S3  so i am going to use some comparisons from that phone to make my review.The first impressions i got from this phone was how light it felt in the hand. Light and comfortable. The outside cover of the phone is plastic but somehow i think this phone can take a few drops and not fall apart like others i seen. The size and dimensions of the phone are excellent for people who like to use the phone with one hand or simply have a hard time using phones that are too big.So i opened up the phone thinking i was probably going to have a few lags and stutters here and there. Amazingly, i didn't. The phone performs very smooth for the most part. I would go as far as saying that on everyday tasks such as checking notifications, reading on the browser and checking up e-mails this phone is smoother than my S3.Now you might be asking yourself if this phone is so great, why is it so cheap? Well you are going to have to make some compromises with the phone. I would say the display is very mediocre. The resolution is acceptable but not great. The colors look very washed out specially if you compare it to an Super Amoled screen. The camera of the phoen is also mediocre. Photos and videos in dark places are not that good. The videos look specially grainy when taken in low light. Photos in daylight are pretty decent and for every day usage they are fine. In fact, daylight pictures are very similar as the one from the S3. It is in dark places where you will see problems.The one thing that distinguishes this phone from a lot of other phones is the absolutely impressive battery life that it has. I was very impressed with it. It is by far the best battery i have ever seen in such a small phone. I literally removed the phone from the charger at 10 am and did not have to charge it until the next day at around 2 pm. For comparison sake i usually disconnect my Galaxy S3 at around 9 am and by 2 or 3 in the afternoon it is already at around 40%. My average scree on time on this battery was about 5-6 hours before i needed to recharge it at night. My S3 has a max of 2.5 hours (if im lucky).The one thing this phone is not really good at is gaming. The phone lags a bit while playing games like Riptide and other graphic intensive games. The CPU just can't keep up. This phone also packs very little internal storage. Only 1.2 Gb. That is enought to put in a about 10-15 apps and use up some cache. Just don't expect to download big games. This phone is definitely better for beginner users who will use it for every day activities.Call quality on the phone is very nice. I was happy that the phone came with wifi calling integrated with it since the reception in my house sucks. Very happy to have a 20 minute conversation without the connection falling out. It was a bit annoying that i had to call Metro to set up an \"emergency 911\" address before i could use wifi calling.So that it my review. I liked the phone for the most part and for the price you are not going to find anything that is much better. The experience is smooth and frustration free. My S3 cost more than double what this little phone costs and i would not say it is worth it. If you are looking for a budget phone for a first time user this is it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes to the Optimus F3", "Author": "Juju", "ReviewID": "R1I9D9J3RQLJLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are a Metro PCS phone user then you know how terrible their phones can be. This phone is small about the same size as the LG Connect 4G. But!! It does everything you expect a smart phone to be able to do.. and for the price it was well worth it.The battery life is just beyond me. It charges fully from 30% to 100% in maybe 30mins. Usually less. Then it holds the charge for a day and half sometimes. I absolutely love it. I've taken a few pictures on it, the camera is eh.. but the internet speed is really good. I really dont know if there is a difference between buying from a Metro PCS store or buying it from Amazon online, but this is how I'm going to buy my phone from now on.Bottom line, if you want a smart phone that does smart phone things for cheaper than an arm a leg and maybe the shirt off your back.This is definitely the phone you want.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problematic phone!", "Author": "KEVIN", "ReviewID": "R3REK64G0NQB60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Firstly, the phone that I currently have is a second one.

I listen to Pandora, text surf the net, talk on it and the thing just keeps on ticking! Hope it stays that way!!!

Phone is super fast, good mobility and 4 inch screen same as my lumia 521 but it's a less bulky phone. Games like punch hero run pretty smooth with Juz minimal lag only 5% of the time when loading. I would give it 5 stars but memory is hella low. But some apps can be moved to sd card which really helps. Graphics are awesome for the price. Camera quality is just a teeny improved from the motion. Juz minimal changes in quality and light conditions but the loading timr is pretty fast with a obviously faster processor. Battery life is great, Juz keep brightness lvl to 80% and download the battery doctor app and you'll be set, call quality is pretty good in a normal setting.

They have had them for about a month with no issues.  The phone seems pretty fast when web browsing or retrieving emails.  They have not encountered any issues with apps or phone calls.
