Camera is handy, gives clean pictures. Connection stable, sound good. Other stuff is pretty useless (like office, internet browsers, etc), but it's good to know you have it and in case of necessity (for example if your life depends on whether you can read the ms word document or not) you are safe. Trackpad may freak somebody out, and because of it in my case games are impossible to play to. Maybe my fingers are incompatible with it, who knows. Battery lasts long.Bottom line: nice, reliable, good looking cell phone.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'll recommend for all my friend and family", "Author": "Evelyn", "ReviewID": "RGVU5C1GBQ2JO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all is fine for me.... the product is good and the amazon services is so good!!I like it..I'll recommend for all my friend and family...", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cell-phone with lots of class.", "Author": "Rudy Barajas", "ReviewID": "RSEHUPBHW64I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone in my opinion is a beauty. its powerful yet compact.

The box was the original and it has all the manuals and complements. This telephone has worked for quite a while with me, never collapsed, is very portable (small), you can have lots of applications working at the same time and is so much better that previous models.The downside is that the battery only last a day.
