Something to do with the new technology of verizons way of connecting phones is incompatible with some older phones. This is one of them, i contacted zerizon and they tried about 4 different ways of connecting the phone to their service, but nothing worked.i like the older flip phones vs the new smart phones and some still work well. You just cant go too far back. i would recommend the:Motorola V750 Adventure PTT RuggedandLG enV2 VX-9100For inexpensive phones that work well.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006V6436Y"}}
