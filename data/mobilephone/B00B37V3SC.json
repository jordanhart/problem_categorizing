Smith \"Meg\"", "ReviewID": "R1GZE82VYY3BXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my very first smartphone and I am using it in conjunction with a prepaid phone service. So far, I have been completely satisfied with this phone. I have noticed that the download speeds are very slow when using data; however, they remain fairly quick when I am hooked into my home Wi-Fi. I would highly recommend this product to a person who is transitioning from a feature phone and is looking for an inexpensive option to own a smartphone. I have only put a handful of apps on the phone since I read that too many apps have a tendency to overload this phone. All in all, though, I couldn't be happier with my decision to purchase this phone. It's very attractive, works great, has incredible battery power...there's not much more I can say. If, however, you are accustomed to using an iPhone 4s with a major carrier, I would never recommend this phone since it's not capable of high speed downloads. In my opinion, this phone earns five stars. The only reason that I am rating this phone a four out of five is that I have had the opportunity to use other people's phones and have seen the difference. For a first, inexpensive smartphone, though, this is amazing!", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "All OKAY..but wifi problems within just 2 months...", "Author": "ADITYA K.", "ReviewID": "R1NO2SEYXMF3GI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The device worked fine with the wifi for a while..After that the wifi system died.(nothing wrong from my side)..It doesnt switch on wifi & when consulted the samsung store, they say the motherboard must be changed...Now it costs me an additional $80-100.... :(SO buy this product at ur own risk...As wifi is a very important requirement nowadays,its a thing to worry about...ELse rest all other features were working ok..", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "LO RECOMIENDO EXCELENTE", "Author": "marlen moreno", "ReviewID": "R1BKAROOQG6419", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "buen tel\u00e9fono lo recomiendo me llego tal cual como se muestra en la foto, con todos sus accesorios y desbloqueado totalmente nuevo, LO RECOMIENDO EXCELENTE DESBLOQUEADO", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Stuff", "Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "R39WAWZLBASQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I prevously owned one of those imitations from China which was a piece of crap.

I had to turn the power saving feature on on the phone because without it something (I am not sure what) was eating battery very rapidly.

I had it for about two months before it slipped out of my hand and the whole screen shattered, making it useless. I would've thought about buying another one, but I didn't want to spend that much money on it again. It was my fault for not getting a case in the first place. It arrived fast, and unopened. Great.
