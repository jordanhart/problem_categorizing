{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK functionality, terrible at a basic feature", "Author": "Fernando Kijel", "ReviewID": "ROE5X6S3DE791", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned my Nokia 6288 for some 6 months now.  Software is, as it can be expected from a Nokia product, more than OK.  I have almost no negative comments about the telephone functionality in general, but I simply suggest to avoid this model at all costs, since it has a manufacturing/design defect that allows dust to enter the case and stick to the inside of the screen, which makes it impossible to see anything in daylight.Nokia takes no responsibility for it, stores won't clean it under Warranty and it's impossible to take it apart, thanks to the slide mechanism, which has some springs that one wouldn't be able to put together again.This confirms that Hygiene Factors can be proven once again more important than \"nice-to-have\" features.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000SZQTM0"}}
