Clark \"tech geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3KQ2ITIQA5QHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Word of caution - if you buy this from Amazon, it may come in the \"French\" edition, which means the phone will start up in French and the manual won't be in English.  Don't worry - you can change the settings once you translate the startup screens and you can use the phone completely in U.S. English**Let me just start out by saying I'm a very picky guy when it comes to electronics.  I research things until I am absolutely sure I want them and then I wait for the \"dust\" to settle on anything new just as a double check.  While I'm not a huge fan of Windows in general - this phone was definitely worth the wait - it ROCKS!Build quality:  solid and smooth.  The backing has a matte finish, so your hands won't slip when holding the device (unlike the iPhone 3G/3GS).  The weight is just right - not too heavy and not light/cheap feeling.  The battery/SIM card compartment door on the back is metal yet thin.  It's probably not the thinnest device in the world, but if you want something thinner you're better off with a plastic device.  All buttons (including the awesome \"real\" push Windows home button) click confidently.Software/OS:  First of all, keep in mind that this device (as of 1/24/11) does not have multitasking built in.  I'm assuming this will be a software update later on.  All finger-swipe actions so far are VERY smooth - no stuttering as found in my previous Android device.  The tiles respond extremely quickly and, with the Super AMOLED screen, look like water when they do move.  The only issue I have found so far is that if you follow a link to the Windows Marketplace from anywhere except through the \"official\" app, the app freezes and you have to restart the phone.  This issue has been documented and will hopefully be fixed during the next update.  Wireless connectivity was so easy I almost didn't realize that it had connected - it was automatic to my home network after asking for the password.  Overall, Windows Phone software/OS is a DREAM compared to Android/iOS.Battery life:  Compared to almost every phone I've ever owned and considering the awesome amount of work I put this phone through, the battery life is amazing.  Again, it doesn't multitask so I'm sure batter life will suffer when that updates comes through.  I was able to make it through 1 1/2 days of occasional use before it even complained of a low battery life (even with wifi on the entire time).  I would give it at least 10 hours on occasional use - 24 hours on standby.Bottom line:  Let's put it this way - if you don't like tech stuff and you're just looking for a phone to play cute games on and make calls, go with an iPhone.  If you loved taking things apart and putting them back together again as a kid (and you especially enjoyed Transformers), then Android phones are for you.  If you want a phone that will treat you like an adult without being overly complicated and you aren't completely reliant on \"cutsey\" games, get this Windows Phone.  Splurge and pay the extra cost to get it untethered to a network.  You won't get the annoying startup screens from T-Mobile, AT&T;, etc. and you don't have to start a new contract.Absolutely a 5-star device.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone!", "Author": "TheDev", "ReviewID": "R17P6KB5EX6YM6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been reviewing this phone since 2 months and following all the news about so that I can decide to get one or not. I have seen reviews, forums, blogs, officail websites just studying the phone, and then I just made the decision to get it.I have recieved the phone 3 days ago and I delayed my review until I got to actually experience the phone, and let me tell you, This is the best phone I have had in my entire life. I will divide my review into two sections, Shipping and the actual phone review.Shipping:Amazon was great doing the shipping and it was fast, it took almost less thank a day to actually deliver the phone. Although the package containing the phone did not have extra protection inside, but the I guess the phone in it's own package is enough-protected.One thing I have to mention is that there is a seal at the bottom of the phone package saying \"if you recive this seal borken, do not accept the phone\", and it was borken, but I guess this was for security purposes and checks.Phone:This phone is just amazing, it is really smooth and fluid. No lacks, no glitches at. The interface is just amazing and really gives you a wonderful experience that you once used to it, can't revert back to an old icon-based phone.The messeges, emails views are just professional and really makes you want to keep using the phone.The hardware of the phone is just amazing also, the camera settings are great, which has alot of features not available in othe WP7 phones.The SAMOLED screen is great too, gives a fresh look to the phone.When I recieved the phone, it was in English and not french and the keyboard language was both English and Spanish. Plus, the new Firmware was alread pre-installed (F/W Version: 2424.10.11.1) which has proved better enhanced communication stack and better apps performance (specially the Marketplace).Another thing to mention, in my country we have 2 telecom companies, one is called Qtel and the other is Vodafone. Qtel is the primary company since it has been here for a long time now and Voda is relatively new. However, the 3G and Data Connection in Qtel sim card did not work at all, but with a Voda sim card, everything was working fine.[Edit]: The 3G and Data Connection works fine now, I just had to provide the APN info.I take this as a problem from the provider and not from the phone or the OS and yet I have to contact the provider and see what they can do about it.All in all, I'm extremely glad I got this phone and I realized that I got out of the Old looking icon-grid style. This is my primary phone and I would recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the phone", "Author": "Rohith", "ReviewID": "R3DGL859D91A3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the phone few days back I love the phone.

It's a beautiful phone..but it was very quirky as to just shutting off/ TERRIBLE with blue tooth both as to sound quality and JUST connecting to a headset consistently without a lot of fuss. I REALLY like W Phone 7, so wanted to get a better sounding  W7 phone that would not be so quirky and not seem like a beta version product (Venue Pro).This I8700 Samsung has a beautiful screen, it's also VERY responsive..more so than my Dell was. My only complaint is (And I knew this before purchasing it) It won't connect to T Mobile USA 3G, Just Edge. I like to stream Internet Radio..sometimes Edge is not enough..so I miss the 3G. Anyway again I already knew this would happen..so really should not take a star away. However as to connectivity, my Dell had a slight edge in staying connected..and a few less dropped calls, almost a tie actually. The Samsung SOUNDS good..both on talking and listening..another edge over the somewhat muffled Dell. The Samsung could be just a tad louder..but it's loud enough for me. Overall if you like a Windows 7 Phone..and 3g is not a deal breaker..this is a REALLY nice pretty, well made phone,that sounds very good!", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Samsung Omnia 7", "Author": "RahulGangwar", "ReviewID": "R1XBACRI4WVOZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone with a little suspision but I got exactly what I was looking for.Good thing is that upon upgrading to Mango (windows phone 7.5) I could see internet sharing option which is not visible with other brand phones like HTC.

What was even nicer was that the phone was 16GB instead of the 8GB I was expecting. Very nice! Photos and video don't do the screen justice, it is beautiful. I got my email accounts including Exchange accounts set up quickly and easily. I have no Xbox so I didn't bother with that. One word of caution. Be careful of the main Live or Hotmail account you sync to because though you can add accounts you can't change that first one so choose wisely. If you are in to Facebook it is a quick setup. There is an official Twitter app in the Marketplace and it does what is expected. There was an adapter in the box to use the European plug in an American wall outlet. The phone was new. It had all the wrappings and stickers that needed to be peeled off. If you are in to email and text and need your calendar with you this is a great phone. It doesn't have all the apps of Android or iOS but it is an up and coming platform. There is a Youtube app and Evernote and Lastpass. A large update, code named Mango is coming in the fall which will bring many updates to the phone and it is free. I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "beats Dell Venue Pro", "Author": "Jeannie Park \"suffering from Dwell house envy\"", "ReviewID": "R18BYZKQMEUC9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an unhappy camper with Dell.  Never mind the multiple delays before the phones finally shipped out.  Despite rave reviews of how the Venue Pro was easily the most desirable of the WP7 handsets, I was disappointed by the cheap feel of its plastic back and chrome plastic sides.  It was hard finding a case that accommodates the slider, which was the whole point of getting the Venue Pro for me, so I eschewed buying an Otterbox. Reviews of the Otterbox on Amazon pointed out how hard it was to remove in order to take off the battery cover.  And after only two months, I was having to remove the battery nearly every day for a soft reset b/c the phone would simply freeze on me.  After 4 months, I was having to recharge the battery by midday.  Little did I know, however, how fateful the decision not to buy the Otterbox would be ....The other selling point was the supposedly indestructible Gorilla glass.  Now I will admit that my phone survived one drop on to a concrete pathway.  The \"chrome\" chipped off, but the phone remained intact.  I wasn't so lucky one month later, though.  My phone dropped again from the car and shattered from the one foot drop to my driveway.  Thankfully, I had an iPhone film on the screen that held the shards together well enough that I could still make calls and use the capacitive screen - I just couldn't read my screen.Rather than fork over $250 for another Dell - the best they could offer b/c neither Dell nor T-Mobile offers insurance - I decided to jump the shark and buy an unlocked Optimus 7 or Omnia 7.  Ultimately, I was won over by Samsung's Super AMOLED technology.  The difference between the two screens - despite Dell's vaunted curved Gorilla Glass AMOLED screen - is breathtaking.  Plus, the Samsung seems snappier right off the bat.  The home button is more solid.  It goes without saying that Samsung will have the better camera, even if the 5 megapixel specs are the same on paper.Neither Dell nor Samsung offer much in the way of homegrown apps, but that's ok.  The Samsung just seems better proportioned than the HTC HD7 - thinner, squared off, modern, with a solid heft.  And, there's a wealth of third party accessories for the Omnia 7/Galaxy S family, unlike the paltry offerings for Dell.Now that the Galaxy S2 has come out, some would ask why bother with WP7.  It's hard to put into words - the sheer elegance of the OS, the Metro UI, the intuitive flow.  I'm betting that Microsoft gets its act together by the time Mango is released (i know, I know, the NoDo update was botched).  I'm betting that the Zune, Xbox integration make for a solid alternative to iOS.  Android isn't even an option for me - I can't stand its messy look.  I'm just anal that way.I'll be updating the review periodically to comment on battery life.  So far, though, I'm lovin' it.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R29GT3AC91JHWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing device.

You cannot send anything (images, files...etc) using the Bluetooth, it just does not support that.2. During the initial setup, the e-mail account you use will sync with your contacts automatically, which means adding e-mails, pictures..etc to your contacts from your e-mail contacts... which many do NOT like it, however, there is NO way you can stop contact synchronization with E-mail contacts. and the good part is that you canNOT delete the primary e-mail you specified during the setup, the only way to do that is to reset your phone and that will delete everything on your phone.Workaround to above issue is to create a new e-mail account with No Contacts. then after the setup, you can add another e-mail account and just then it will give you an option to stop contacts from Synching.3. most of touch phones has buttons to Call and Hang-up which IMO easier and faster to use instead of navigating to that from your phone menu.4. You cannot set any of your favorite songs as a ring toon, you can only use the ones came with the phone.5. Still no Skype for this phone!6.

Even in better light conditions, the pictures are not good enough and Nexus One[suprisingly an HTC phone with good camera!!!] put this thing in to shame as far as camera performance is concerned.As far as marketplace is concerned, it's smallar and is about 30K. But, frankly speaking, I don't use much apps so no a big issue for me. The phone has solid feel[another surprise this time considering it's Samsung's]. I have never found any hangs or delays whatsoever using this phone. Only once, I had to restart it because somehow, the camera application wasn't been able to open up. That's the only time I had some -ve feelings about this.One major concern that I always have about this phone is the fact that it's Samsung's that's infamous for their slow update push. We all know what happened to the earlier Omnia 7 and Samsung Focus owners when NoDo updates were pushed. Since Mango is knocking at the door, I wish I dont have to face the same problem.

For the most I've been pleased so far. The display is exceptional I must say. The menus are easy to navigate and the touchscreen is very responsive. My only gripe so far is the availablity of apps and most apps do not run in the background, for the exception of the Zune Media Player. Also there is no memory expansion and this would restrict you once a lot of apps are installed.

When my friend's phone was powering headphones few meters away only, Samsung Omnia 7 was able to hit through all walls we found nearby, perfect quality. Wifi is fine too. Camera is fine. Sound is fine.What is not fine: software. On many levels. Starting with the core: it's windows phone. It is a bad OS. I am a programmer and I have an idea. You are just not allowed to do anything remotely useful with provided api. You can't turn on the flashlight (cmon, my 10 years old Nokia cost 20$ and have flashlight!). To light up something with this phone, I start recording video. This way flashlight is on. But any touch on screen and it's off again, argh!Programs can't run in background, welcome to WP7. It is not real OS.There's almost no soft for WP, and whatever soft there is - obviously suffering from Microsoft developer api restriction. To develop programs - you have to pay. You can't set long alarm melody. etc etc etc. Total fail.Just another little nail in a coffin of this device for me: GSM internet, the internet-over-cell, almost doesn't work. I have to reboot my device, maybe few times, before it works back again. Probably it's my local operator or settings problem? Probably. But my operator can't send settings to my phone, probably not supported.Good luck, Microsoft.(disclaimer: i love windows, I'm .NET developer; but WP7 can't be helped)Resume: nice hardware, worst OS.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Omnia 7 Almost Perfect", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15ONZIJP8CHVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung Omnia 7 has almost everything you need and it moves pretty fast with its 1Ghz processor. And the 16M colors super AMOLED display is so sweet. Everything looks great on this display. Lots of apps and games available. The only drawbacks are: no micro SD card slot, can't transfer files via Bluetooth, can't use your songs as ringtones (seriously whose idea was that!), can't connect phone as a mass storage device on the computer (new stuff can only be added using Zune, how silly is that!).Well, those are quite a few silly limitations which may be removed in future updates of the windows phone 7 OS. None of the limitations are Samsung's fault. They are all Microsoft OS limitations. Microsoft made big mistakes with this OS. Nevertheless, the OS performs great, looks great and feels great. It would be nice if certain things were more customizable (like the ringtones) but I still love my Samsung Omnia 7.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Please consider buying a sledghammer and other sharp objects while buying this phone, you will need them", "Author": "Capt.

Like every other item mentioned above it does very well for itself and seems like the perfect value for money during the honeymoon period. Only once you have settled in to a life with it does it yank away the rug from underneath your feat and leave you out in the street like a gold digger wife ready for her 17th divorce. Utterly unreliable after about 3 months it freezes when it pleases and gets stuck on a reboot cycle when restarting. Now Microsoft has this brilliant strategy of restarting in between updates which means your phone WILL get stuck in the middle of an update unable to reboot back into the home screen and after that the best use for this phone is either as a paperweight or target practice. You can plead, prod and pray all you want (trust me I'm a Hindu and we have something like 33,000 gods) but it is as unforgiving as a woman scorned.
