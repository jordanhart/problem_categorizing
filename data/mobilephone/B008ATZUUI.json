But then again I could have been having some bad luck and got a defective one.SO I tried this phone for a second time and I was given almost the wrong model, the second one was the LG-E730f not the E730. and this time the phone would not read any sim card I put in it. Other than that the phone worked just fine.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$260.00", "Features": "Android; 3.8 Ultra AMOLED capacitive touchscreen; Corning Gorilla Glass\n5MP camera; autofocus; geo-tagging; face detection; video recording 720p@30fps.\nA-GPS support, Wi-Fi, MP4/MP3, FM Radio\nDocument viewer: Organizer: Voice memo/dial/commands\n1GB internal storage; microSD up to 32GB", "Name": "LG LG-E730 Optimus Sol Unlocked Cellphone - No Warranty - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wcOUsJenL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008ATZUUI"}}
