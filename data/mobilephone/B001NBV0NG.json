{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exceptional interface, Long Battery Life, a Classic Blackberry", "Author": "Canis Majoris", "ReviewID": "R5PHGMLB3P3H2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know why I'm reviewing this after, what 4 years since this phone has been out? Well I like going to the cheap route sometimes, and this was one of those instances. I bought this new 4 years after it was released, and I can tell you that I can see why Blackberry caught on. This phone has flawless execution, meaning that the menus and options are not implicitly absconded through menus and sub menus, they are easy to manage through and easy to read through.This phone offers all that the new blackberry's have except, well graphics, camera, video, and unfortunately speakerphone and polyphonic ringtones. What you get though is vintage Blackberry. You get the email, memos, bluetooth, web browsing, passwords vaults, and all the usual blackberry antics. The battery lasts for me well over 7 days without usage, and 3+ days with usage. It has great reception and I find it easier to navigate through, with it's simple and basic, but rather outdated menu system. What can I say, I'm a sucker for retro, even if that means 4 years.Are you substituting technology for reliability and simplicity? Yes, but it's worth it.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Choice", "Author": "Patricia A. Perry", "ReviewID": "RH8N89XGALK4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I too bought this \"new\" many years after it's heyday. What can I say. I'm cheap. But after trying and failing and trying some more to get my iPAQ to sync, I decided I needed to bump up to something easier and more reliable. So, I found this Blackberry selling very inexpensively and bought it. I was astonished. The syncing process was almost effortless. The unit is easy to use and the menues and programs are intuitive. I have nothing but good things to say about this unit.Now, having said all that, I admit it does not have all the bells & whistles of the new Blackberry's. But, when this one finally goes to that great electronic graveyard in the sky, I'll buy a \"new\" one to replace it. I could never go back to anything less intergrated than a Blackberry. That would be like going back to a dial-up connection for my Internet or cooking over a fire for dinner every night.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "it's great the qwerty keypad, are so wonderful", "Author": "Walter Portuguez \"RBL linux user\"", "ReviewID": "R19RFKVKOR4VOM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "am bought this item, and i brought to Costa Rica, am so happy to use this.the great experience, is when you begin to write a sms, is so quickly and comfortable.is very very good, if u have to decide, i recommend for u", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not product shown", "Author": "Texman", "ReviewID": "R35KMW6RZJGRS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just recieved the product.

I deliberately shopped for an \"Unlocked\" phone so that I could use it on a vacation trip in Europe after loading it with a SIM chip that was compatible for the country in which I was traveling.  I discovered that the cell phone was barely audible.  I spent a lot of time, running to quiet spots and holding one hand over the opposite ear from the ear that was pressed to the phone.  Even then, I missed a lot of words.  I had to resort to sending text messages as often as I could, which this Blackberry was excellent at doing.  Upon return to the USA, the vendor could not figure out how to correct this problem with hearing the phone.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Better than 7290", "Author": "Vanzini Pons Gustavo Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R3W1OMCO2QBUJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is better than the 7230 but It is only a very good phone and a useful PDA It is OK for me, If I need a camera and a MP# I buy them", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "the RIM blackberry 7290 unlocked phone is not unlocked", "Author": "Michael Williams \"zippy\"", "ReviewID": "R2W3OGEJZE3RGF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "cell phone was not an unlocked phone as advertised.
