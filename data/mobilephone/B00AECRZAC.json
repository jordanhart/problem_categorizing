It feels somewhat flimsy to me, as though it would shatter if dropped on a carpet, but others might consdier it lightweigh or streamlined. There is nothing particularly remarkable or novel about this phone but it does perform OK for a casual user who does not need all the extras and who does not live or die by the speed of his or her phone.Look for a used one and consider this an option as a backup or starter phone.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "ALMOST EXACTLY NEW!!!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3L0YZICI68STK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when it came in i thought well this is odd i bought a used one but it has like nothing wrong with it! only tiny scratches by the charger (expected) but it is an epicly awesome phone i would recomend", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My damn Phone!", "Author": "DANA MOULTRIE", "ReviewID": "R31BVGB7OIJ5AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is too  good to be true, it does everything and Iove it to pieces!
