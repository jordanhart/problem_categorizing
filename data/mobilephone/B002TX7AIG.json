As far as customizing the phone it is great everything from changing what the buttons do on the front to where the menu icons are located in the menu. ability to add music and other things through a sync cable that you can buy from amazon. BATTERY LIFE AND SIGNAL ARE ASTOUNDING! :) this phone is also quite loud. screen is plenty bright and i have not had a problem yet seeing it in any environment, i.e. sunshine/cloudy/indoor. etc.Note: if you have a phone contract with AT&T; already you CAN take you're sim card out of the current phone you have and put it into this phone; So long as all of you're numbers are saved to the sim card you are all set.there is actually 11.414 mb of hard memory in the phone as far as i can see, this is enough to add a few tones and some pictures for the background.Personally I do not use the \"prepaid\" service so i cannot comment on that subject.Con's: the buttons are a bit small, when it comes to texting they are a bit too small but when typing in a number or such under short-term use they are suitable. It comes with a limited selection of tones and extraneous features but that is deal-able. when accessing the menus and switching between menus there is a lag. there is no way to add an external memory chip.Note:Accessories it comes with: (1) alarm clock, calendar, to-do list, notes, calculator, timer, stopwatch, voice/sound recorder, you can sync and backup the data on the phone, i.e. contacts etc. has a speed dialing function. has T9 or text auto-complete. there are 6 different profiles that allow you to switch tones, ring volumes, and vibration.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Prepaid Phone.", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RCZ7L0N9TQ0KK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this while I am waiting for my Samsung Jack to arrive from Texas.Cons: There is some lag when going form one screen to another. When you press the center MENU button, you end up at the Media Mall. This icon should be changed to Messaging or Recent Calls. It is too easy to accidently end up on the internet and start spending your PrePaid balance. I had a hard time removing the back cover and had to take the phone to my AT&T; store for removal.Pros: The ringer is very loud. The keys are large and easy to press. The screen is fairly large and easy to read. The battery stays charged very well. Press the Call button and it brings up your recent calls made. I'm going to use this phone at work until the minutes expire in June. That will prevent wear and tear on my new Jack.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R3DNEU6MTOYL93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a backup and inevitably I broke my smartphone charging port. Usability can have minor issues, especially if you have large fingers as I do. Reception is excellent as is call quality. However slowness of the menu systems and other features which cannot be disabled, (At least I have not found them to be) confirmation tones on loud settings; and the check-mark after changing a setting or deleting a message. One other small issue the chrome ring encircling the screen and soft buttons is already starting to wear badly after only two weeks. If i had to pick two great features, and also reasons to buy this phone, they would be great battery life, and loudness of ringer. Great as a backup, but only that.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simple, functional, cheap = 5 stars", "Author": "Rona Gail Cho", "ReviewID": "R1YKH627DR5A0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old Nokia flip phone just gave up on me (the LCD broke) and I was opting to buy a Nokia E63. I thought about it and realized that a smartphone would only be useless in my hands because I'm really not willing to pay for the monthly data usage/Internet fees. I also thought about getting the new iPhone 4G but I just bought an iTouch last month and I still have a year remaining in my contract with AT&T.; I browsed through all the unlocked and prepaid phones and I thought this  is the best choice. It's only $8 (without the go package) in AT&T;'s website and that totally sold me on this phone. It's not bad considering all I really do with my phone is text and call. I also don't need a phone which can play music and/or take pictures because I have an iPod and a digital camera which can take care of that already. It's sleek looking, it does what a phone should do and it's cheap.I just got this phone today (shipped from AT&T;) and it was better than what I expected. It's nice looking, it's thin and it works! I just put my old postpaid sim card on it and voila!

It's been dropped, stepped on, you name it, and it just kept going.  It still works now, but just started losing speed dial assignments and won't let me reenter them.  The phone itself is pretty solid and not as flimsy as other prepaid phones.  The volume has a wide range and I can set it to where I can hear it well (I'm a little deaf).  Recorded audio comes out much louder and clearer than  other phones I've had.  Being a Nokia, you tend to get a wider range of service area than you get with others, as well.  It doesn't have a camera, but I have a small camera I carry in my purse anyway so I don't really need it.

This phone (after setting in calendar) reminds me to refill my minutes and money before I get penalties for not doing so from att go phone account. Small phone and lightweight. Easy to text with T-9 on.I don't like cell phone bills and this phone keeps costs low. I pay on average $10 a month at most.  I only use calls in emergencies which is like never but it's there if I need it. I get calls from friends that don't know how i use this phone and I just return the call when i get to my landline. Not worth explaining to every tom dick and rich harry friend.Friends eventually get the hint that I prefer text and that keeps costs down.  I don't set up voicemail on my line, that can only add to cost and deter friends from texting me which i prefer. It also keeps cold callers out of my life for the most part.
