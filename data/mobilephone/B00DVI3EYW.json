If you have warranty issues good luck, they will not respond to your email or honor their warranty what so ever. Buy a tablet with support office in the USA otherwise they ignore all your emails related to warranty work. I will never buy any Chinese product that does not have branch in the USA. I have an Archos and I had issue with it called the 800# and sent it to Chicago and the issue was solved with no hassle.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "forest24", "ReviewID": "R1VI3HXE02E51H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so surprised in its quality.
