I had to get an sd card and car charger as it did not come with it. The ETC came with the Droid 2.1 OS. Since there was no contract, I rooted it and installed Cyanogenmod, upped the CPU, and it works AMAZING. So, in short if you're going to buy a phone that's already \"no contract\" why not tinker with it and get it working better!", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "my husband love this phone", "Author": "Beverly G.", "ReviewID": "R2E7XESO5AIBDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this phone for myself an was happy with it but the letter size on the screen was to small for me so i gave it to my husband an he loves it. it arrived earlier than date given. great job seller, i will order from this seller again", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "It works great", "Author": "Ktbug", "ReviewID": "R2CHCZ4K4UKW1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It arrived fast it was in good shape.

The battery needs to be charged every two hours if you are searching the web for any length of time. On a normal day it needs to be charged in the middle of the day, so carry a charger with you. You can get a full day out of it if you just use it as a simple phone and don't use the sync, wi-fi, web, etc.  Very disappointed.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "OMG", "Author": "sa", "ReviewID": "R3ED5XMBM1W4C6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not a person who likes to write review something. But, I have to say that! please do not buy this item. There is no SD card and there is no USB charger (only have Wall charger).
