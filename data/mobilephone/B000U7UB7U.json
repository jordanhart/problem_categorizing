Slick Design.", "Author": "AreYouKidding?", "ReviewID": "R7377DDNZRV38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A long-time Motorola phone user now converted. Not only is this phone lightweight and amazing looking, it's feature packed.Pros:- Crystal-clear calling. No static and loud when needed.- The screen is amazing. The resolution is awesome. By far the best I've ever seen on a phone this size.- This phone is tiny; in a good way. Super-slim and tucks nicely in your pocket. Being that it's a slider, you'll never have to worry about pocket-dialing. :)- The software is very easy to navigate. This is nicely improved over the Motorola interface of my older RAZR.- The MP3 player rocks; no pun intended. The Walkman software lets you sort by Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists and more. This is light-years ahead of the my old RAZR's MP3 player. This one rivals any standalone MP3 device I've used.- The stereo headphones that comes with it include a 3.5mm adapter. While the included headphones sound great, this adapter gives you the flexibility to use your Bose, Shure or other stereo headphones. A very nice option.- Carbon grey and anodized blue color is slick; nothing else like it. The back side of the phone, when in the up position, is where the anodized blue metal is. Amazon doesn't show a photo of it. It is stunning.- Unlike \"some\" other sliders, the camera is protected and kept under cover when the slide is closed. This works great in keeping dust off the lens.- The 2.0MP camera is actually pretty good. It takes great outdoor photos.- I LOVE the fitness/step counter. It measures distance in steps and calculated miles along with the calories you've burned. It also keeps a daily average and each days results.Cons:- No 3G- Sony Proprietary Memory Stick Micro M2 versus easy to find and less expensive MicroSD- No LED Flash or Photo LightIn conclusion, if you are looking for a super-slim phone with great call quality and superb music capability, look no further. This Sony wears the Walkman name with pride.UPDATE 9/27/07: I bought a SanDisk SDMSM2-4096-A11M 4GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) and it works perfectly. 4GB of music!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best phone I've had", "Author": "Tae S. Shin \"ScientificDeveloper\"", "ReviewID": "R1T1B5S6L6UMDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used RAZR, PPC phone, and other \"state of art\" phones. I think this SE W580i is the best phone I've had. Of course, this is from my personal preference. I don't like big and heavy phone with short battery life time - like PPC phone. I don't and won't ever like text messaging or watching video over phone screen. But I like small and long-lasting device with multiple (and useful) functionalities. Following are what I found with the phone so far0. This phone is light and small enough for me to do running exercise with. Its size and weight do not bother my running at all. Handfree headset fits well in my ears so while running, any ear piece does not fall off from my ear.1. Memory Stick Micro (M3) slot with 4GB capacity to store any type of data. With 4GB memory stick micro (about $64 from Amazon) and bluetooth connectivity, the phone can act as wireless multimedia device with 4GB hard drive.2. 2M camera that is far from perfect but much much better and tolerable than 1M camera from usual phone. picture quality of 1M camera was too terrible to use it for any purpose. But 2M camera actually provides enjoyable and sharable(?) quality of the picture.3. Media player is very good. It automatically identifies album title, singer, and other info from MP3 and WMA - Yes it can also play Microsoft wma file. This means you don't have to subscribe anything or download/buy any software to convert your existing music files. You just connect phone to PC with USB adapter or bluetooth, and copy the files into the phone. That simple. About ringtones, as one of reviewer said, you have to make music file size less than 600K to use it as ringtone.4. handfree headset includes 3.5mm (mini plug) adapter. With the adapter, you can connect your W580i not only to any PC speakers but also to car audio system if your car has 3.5mm Aux Audio port. Luckily, my car has the Aux Audio port. I don't even use CD changer in the car any more. When I connect my w580i to the Aux Audio port, I can listen to thousands of songs in the small device.5. Battery life is surprisingly long. Talking life time is about 9 hours as advertised. As I frequently use bluetooth connectivity for various purposes, I always keep bluetooth on in the device. But unlike other phones, the bluetooth connectivity does not eat up battery life that much. In my case, full charge once a couple of days would be enough with bluetooth on.6. Internet browser has been much improved. It is still not Safari on iphone. It can only read WAP web sites, not normal web sites PC can display. But it has nice zoom capability and tolerable speed. Don't forget to subscribe a AT&T; Media.Net program - cheapest one is $10/Month. Otherwise pay-per-connection may cost you hundreds dollars after you download several files.7. Email software is automatically checking email arrivals and let you know.8. Voice Recorder is good enough to record a call session or a lecture.9. Yes, keys are not big but once you are used to them, it does not really matter.10. I love screen of this phone. It's bright and sharp. Still I don't like to watch TV on it but I love to see pictures taken with the phone on the screen.Briefly, this is poor man's iphone.  With 2 year contract with AT&T;, you can buy this phone from Amazon for 1 cent. The price and many functionalities I mentioned might be the reasons this phone is #1 bestseller in Amazon these days.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good overall Phone", "Author": "M.

I am a long time AT&T;, then cingular and now back to AT&T; customer. My own preference was to get an unlocked phone and not deal with the locked version (when i wanted to upgrade, the current selections sucked).I do agree with the previous remark on the keys. They are quite small and from the touch, seem delicate. I sometimes wonder if the keys cracking are due to pressing the keys with a finger nail vs the tip of your finger. Time will tell with this phone. I will remark later if any of my keys start cracking.The OS on this phone is very good, I used to have a nokia and liked the symbian OS, so this feels very similar to that. The Windows OS for the smart phone is not very good. Actually it was quite cumbersome, all the subscreens and white screens of death (oh yes, even the OS's they create for phones have this windows fault).Reception quality has been very good, the camera is ok (no standard flash like the other sony ericsson phones),the fitness feature is interesting (if you exercise enough), Internet Gui is still better the Windows OS version and the phone is very compact.This phone overall is good, not perfect (what phone is), it gets the job done and has the extra bells and whistles to keep you entertained at church.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Features and great call quality!", "Author": "A.

I recently purchased the Sony Ericsson W580i after reading several reviews. The size of the phone is comparable to the RAZR (with the RAZR folded) however I find the W580i more comfortable to hold when placing calls.This phone is feature packed. The MP3 player has a great interface and is easy to navigate. The shake to shuffle feature is also useful, just hold the walkman button and give it a quick shake, then voila a new song starts playing.The fitness feature is what sold me on the phone, over other MP3 capable phones. It keeps track of the steps you've taken in a day, and if calibrated (easy to do) keeps track of your distance and calories burnt also. There is a training log, and easy to use application to keep track of your training progress.The phone has the usual calendar and appointment reminder most phones have these days. But the W580i comes with software and a data cable to sync with your Outlook Calendar also. This is a great tool for those who are shy of needing a more powerful PDA, but could still use some help with weekly or daily reminders.The camera is decent, compared with the RAZR it is fantastic. I do believe there are better cameras out there, but my main concern was the MP3 player, and the camera was an added bonus.I could write forever about the many features and possible uses for this phone. It is easy to customize, looks stylish, good battery life, and so on. But on top of all this the most important part of a phone should be the phone. The W580i has great call quality and good call coverage. Even my callers claim they can hear me better.

This is certainly one of my favorite phones I have ever had!! And I have had many phones that I have used and destroyed in some way or another. I got this phone in an emerald green and I enjoyed the color as much as the phone.  I never stored more than 30-50 songs on the phone, which was okay, because you can always add more on and take some off. Camera takes pictures.  I have never had internet feature, so I guess I don't know what I'm missing there, but it's not necessary at all = cell phones don't HAVE to have internet to be a good phone.I could be a tester for phone durability!  I have done all sorts of things to phones that either impaired their ability to function or killed them completely...sometimes I would be surprised what phones could live through.This phone I had for just under two years, and I dropped it all the time, sat on it in my back pocket and put in a small bookbag that it would be tossed around in sometimes.  This phone was fairly solid!  I loved the slider feature and the up, down, left, and right buttons during texting.  However, a cell phone can only handle so much abuse when it's not a \"candybar\" phone.The screen eventually went black, seemingly off.  Unable to make/take calls.  But it was a ghost phone!  It tried to live after it was gone by sounding the alarm that I had set every morning at 4:30am! The screen would show the alarm, snooze and sound again...But sadly the phone was no longer more than an alarm clock.  I would have purchased this phone again, but my company did not have it available and I didn't think to order online.  If I need a new phone again and this one is still available online somewhere I would get it!", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "There's no skool like the old skool.", "Author": "Matt Da Jungle Cat", "ReviewID": "R2PWSPFSG0SOK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not negative but I have had this phone for 3 years and have replaced it twice, once due to my own fault (I dropped it in a mop bucket full of water!) and once because a flex cable broke on the inside. I ended up fixing it myself but I also bought another used one for $30 so now I have two. Why is this positive that I have had to replace it then? This is because it is easy to fix yourself as long as you know how to use google ^_^ Both software and hardware problems are easily fixed with a little search on Google. Spare parts are cheap and can be ordered online so it is much faster and sometimes cheaper then sending it in and getting a new one.NOW,If all you're looking for is phone and music capabilities, but you want the best for these categories then look no further! This is the phone for you! However, if you are looking for a good camera, video or gaming capabilities, or internet capabilities then keep looking.This phone does everything a phone needs and has good quality, call quality is great I rarely get any static or problems with it! I text all the time and I have no problem with the numeric pad, and prefer it to a keyboard pad to be honest, when it comes to texting but that is my personal preference. YES the keypad of older models does crack after a while however newer models have changed this. Personally I like the cracking, it adds a sense of vintage to the phone. Cracked keys will not stop working because of the crack, hell you can remove the keypad entirely and still use it.The real greatness of this phone lies in its music player capability, sound quality is much better than that of iPods and the Mega-Bass feature is a MUST for bass-heads like myself. I love being able to use the numeric pad to jump to an artist quickly instead of moving my thumb in circles for half an hour to get to another letter.One of my favorite aspects of this phone (and a reason why I \"downgraded\" as my friends tell me) is the personalization. Because the phone uses clips instead of screws the phone is easily taken apart by even a novice. Parts are easily interchangeable so you can order different colors and mix and match! You could even paint the housing however you wanted and put it back on in a snap! This also allows you to replace the housing for cheaper than the cost of one of those cases most people put on their phones. Themes can be downloaded for free or made by YOU using software Sony provides. With a bit of Google searching you can learn to do anything to personalize it, even changing the colors of the side lights to flash through different colors when your music plays!In general, if you are looking for a great phone/music player with a wide array of personalization then go for this phone.

If you are one of the previously mentioned look to the new lg shine cu720 slider phone offering almost all of the same functions in a stainless steel body and keys.

Okay, fine, maybe I had a faulty phone, right? The second one is worse. The buttons fell off and I can no longer see the top half of my screen. Trying to place a call in the daylight is a joke - can't see anything when the sun reflects off the screen.You may be thinking 'well, he's reckless with the phone.' I'm not. Never dropped it, never washed it accidentally, never gave it to a small animal. It's literally falling apart in my hands.I don't even know what to recommend, but it's not this. The Walkman part is cool, but you'll need a memory card if you want to make it like an iPod. You'll also need to pay for the internet connection to use most of the features anyway.Before I bought this phone, I read all the reviews on here. I really wanted it to be a good phone.

It is incredibly weak, and unfortunately no one makes a good phone case so there is no protection available.2: The memory card slot never worked. I didn't get the warranty so I couldn't get the phone replaced. So, no music for me and it will only store about 10 pictures.3: There's a 40% chance it will not work indoors. I've traveled to many places, and this seems pretty consistent. It's not an issue with the phone company because other people with the same carrier and different phones do not have this problem.4: The volume and speakerphone are not loud enough.

I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as \"handsfree\" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red \"jewels\" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "DO NOT PURCHASE!!", "Author": "Nicole Claessens", "ReviewID": "R1VXBTKUQBDLNL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this cell phone from an authorized retailer.

It does random things like turn off by itself.  This was not a referb. and I would recommend staying away from this phone.

Brinkman", "ReviewID": "RZPST61BQDAGM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Original post from the end of August: (amazon wouldn't let me update the star rating for some reason so I had to repost...)I bought this phone as an upgrade for my W600i since cingular has such a horrible selection right now.  I've been a SE owner since they were Ericsson only and have had there phones go off roofs, get wet snowboarding and handle the dust of being a on construction site with no problem.  I'm having to send my phone back in because the keys on the keypad are cracking.  If you search on google apparently the first bunch that went out had a problem though getting their tech support to admit that won't happen, trust me, I tried twice.  What I get for being first in line I guess....Only 3 stars because for an upgrade they sure took away a few of the features of the 600 and some changes they did make should have been more up to the industry standard.Obviously the 600 was a rotating phone as compared to the 580 slider... so that in mind.....-On that note, my slider had a little bit of play in it, maybe it was cause I got a bad phone but that may be an issue later with the shake to shuffle feature.  That was pretty cool but all that shaking might shake it loose I'd be afraid.  Oh and You have to HOLD the walkman button for a couple secconds while in the walkman and then shake it a lil and it'll change.  Figured that one out thanks to the add-in flyer-manual wasn't any help on that one!!-The light from the camera that could be accessed independently of the camera function is gone.  I didn't use it that much but it was nice to have as a last resort.  Other half of that is this phone is MUCH lighter and half the thickness of the 600 so its a trade-off, I don't know where they would have put it.-The Instant Messenger software is gone but that may have been a cingular add-on because I had a locked phone.-The shortcuts on the Nav circle aren't as good because the camera is locked to the top position.  You can change the left, right and down to funtion whatever you want but this is ratehr annoying when I had my 600 set to write a new text when I hit the up part of the circle.  Why they didn't just put independent internet and camera buttons is beyond me.  You can access alerts from the menu or put that as a shortcut if you want.-The alerts button was convienient but much rather it eould have controlled the camera so I could over-ride what was on teh shortcuts at the Nav circle.-I couldn't figure out how to make the RSS feeds/updates work so anybody with experience on this feel free to comment back cause I'd love to know!-The M2 micro card expansion is nice but why not use the SD mini like every other co?  Besides its only good to 1 gig supposedly.-Walkman had no changes but the radio feature you can play over the speaker now.  still have to have the handsfree attached as an antenna, kind of pointless to have it play over the radio if you still have to have the cord of the handsfree attached.-Camera was a little better, should have been from a 1.3 to a 2.0MP now.  Its also one handed operation.  Bad part is unless you put it in panoramic mode you can't zoom in!-The lock feature is annoying.  If you end a call by sliding the phone shut, you then have to re-open it and slide it closed again to lock all of teh keys.-Call Clarity was great, little better then my 600 and seemed to hold a stronger signal.  That may have been because its an unlocked phone and my other was locked.-Big bonus points for downloading all of my internet and SMS/MMS settings when I first started up the phone.  Saved me time fighting with gettin the settings off the old one and possibly calling cingular which I was my only hesitation to getting an unlocked phone.They seem to have a problem with there keys on the W580i and 500 right now if you google it thanks to another reviewer.  Think I'll wait before I buy it again, even at that I'm hesitant after talkin to the customer service for SE who was almost rude and ademant that I broke the keypad when you can find it several places online that a SE spokeswoman admitted it was a problem and some shipments were stopped in transit because of the issue.  They could have done better overall but its a good phone for what your payin.UPDATE-10/12/07-JUST RECEIVED MY SECOND PHONE FROM AMAZON AFTER WAITING A MONTH HOPING THE ISSUE WITH THE KEYS SPLITTING WOULD BE FIXED.  KEYS STARTED SPLITTING AGAIN IN 3 DAYS USE!!!!  SAME AS BEFORE AND AS DETAILED IN OTHER REVIEWERS COMMENTS.  I WILL TRY AND POST THE COUPLE PICS I TOOK OF IT, YOU CAN'T TELL MUCH BUT LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE 4 AND 7 KEYS, YOU'LL SEE HOW THE SIDE OF THE KEY CLOSEST TO THE EDGE OF THE PHONE IS SHINIER THEN THE REST OF THE KEY. WHERE THE GLOSS STARTS IN THE MIDDLE IS WHERE IT SPLIT-PERFECTLY VERTICAL IN THE CENTER OF THE KEY.  CHECK OUT THE OTHER REVIEWERS COMMENTS FOR A BETTER PIC ON THE SAME PHONE EXCEPT WITH ORANGE KEYS IN A LINK.  ANYONE WITH THIS PHONE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT IN A DARK ROOM AND CHECK, THE BACKLIGHT WILL MORE THEN LIGHT UP THE CRACK AND YOU CAN SEE IT IF YOU HOLD THE PHONE AT AN ANGLE TO SEE IT THE KEYS ARE LEVEL ON THE KEYPAD.  3 DAYS USE AND ABOUT 100 TEXTS WITH HARDLY ANY CALLING, WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK AND SONY STILL WON'T ADMIT TO THE PROBLEM AFTER A 3RD CALL TO THEIR TECH SUPPORT.I HAVE NO REASON TO RECCOMEND THIS PHONE AND WOULD ADVISE ANYONE NOT WANTING TO BLOW $300 ON A SHODDILY CONSTRUCTED PHONE TO WALK AWAY NOW. IF YOU CAN HANDLE LOSING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR PHONE, BE MY GUEST, WASTE YOUR $300.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "The worst Cellphone", "Author": "Christopher Duque \"Catracho_Honduras\"", "ReviewID": "R2TTA9ZHQYU9M0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and it last just like 3 months it is very fragile, I was walking and i drop it taking it out of my pants pocket and it fell to the ground, that was the last time i saw it working.So I really dont recommend this phone to anyone, even when i am sony ericsson fan...", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "they gave me the wrong charger", "Author": "sayuri", "ReviewID": "R3W17L34YA2THM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i was disappointed at the service i received, when i opened my package, the charger was not correct, so i called them, and the customer service they provide was bad, the rep was very rude and not friendly at all. overall it was a bad shopping experience.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "shopping", "Author": "goatlady1010", "ReviewID": "R27MLZADQ0AX1C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "phone was what I wanted, but the battery will not stay charged at all.

It really looks smooth and sophisticated. I really dislike flip phones so this was a big selling point for me.-The battery lasts forever for its size.-Has a decent camera (albeit no flash)-Comes with lots of accessories like headphones, USB cable etc. I hate when you have to go buy all the extra stuff so it was nice that it is included. The memory card is not included, however.Cons-HORRIBLE reception. I've never had such a problem with reception in any phone. Ever. It doesn't work inside pretty much any building. It doesn't work at school. It doesn't work at the mall. It will even drop calls if I walk under a pedestrian bridge. My service is the same as with my old phone which worked flawlessly. I even sent the phone back and got a new one and spent an hour on the phone with ATT trying to figure out the problem to no avail. The phone simply has a terrible antenna. Unacceptable.-The card reader uses xD which is annoying as they cost twice as much as normal SD cards.-If you bump the phone or drop it a short distance the memory card will get dislodged and you will need to take the card out and reinsert it to get it to recognize. Sometimes that doesn't even work and randomly hitting the phone gets it to work again.-Keypad is flimsy. The numbers have all worn off after only 2 months of very light use. They feel like they are going to break off at any moment. It's also very easy to press the wrong key when texting or even dialing. Texting is almost useless which is sad since it is AIM equipped.-People complain that even when I have good reception (which is rare) they can barely hear me. I usually make a conscious effort to speak louder than usual to help this.I will be discarding this phone in the dumpster soon and buying a different brand.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Crap", "Author": "Sentry", "ReviewID": "R1YUYLHOWBG9X8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item was not what was advertised the seller had no idea what they were talking about and needs to research before they try to sell what they say they are selling.Very displeased with this item and its seller", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good!", "Author": "Florin Radu", "ReviewID": "RBUKF8TPB5UXS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty nice phone.
