I wasn't going to write this review until the phone started presenting some problems after 2 months of use. Some keys were not working, including the BB key, which gives you access to all he phone features. I had no other choice then take it to the local blackberry shop. For my surprise they told me that this was a used phone, that it had been repaired before and even had some kind of silicone internally from the last repair. Thank God they managed to repair the phone but the technician told me to use it very carefully as it can fail again anytime. I spent close to $100 for the repair.There is no way I can recommend to buy any item from this seller again. I've been thinking about sending a claim through the International Commerce Chamber for this situation. I live in Venezuela and I don't know if they will respond somehow for this deceit. Very sad situation....", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "exelent", "Author": "Lucila", "ReviewID": "R299M5OFXF7L9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi everything was ok , I received my order perfectly and it works fine, it is very nice and it cames with everythin the cd, charger, all.I am very happyYours sincerly", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "the phone is a marvel", "Author": "Hugo Viana", "ReviewID": "R24MMIWRKOKK4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the phone and arrived very well packaged, the new phone well sealed with all tags, along with its latest software installed, I recommend buying this product, very good. thanks to the seller.vVenezuela....................", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!", "Author": "Venezuelan", "ReviewID": "R2C0QIGQOAPFQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was excellent.

The scrolling pad (not sure on the specific name, but it's not a roller ball!) is SO much better than the ball - it doesn't get stuck like the ball did, and it's easy to touch and scroll up, down, side to side, etc..The keys are pretty easy to use to type - I guess if you were to have bigger fingers it might be a little bit harder, but I have had no issues with it really.The phone is very resistant to damages, as I've dropped mine a million times and it still barely has any scratches or 'blemishes' :)  The screen has even held up really well and there are no marks or scratches on it either, which is amazing, coming from a mom of two who always gets her phone taken away and thrown, tossed, dropped, chewed on, etc., by her kiddos.  hahaOverall, a great phone so far, and I've had mine about a year now, if not more.  I'm happy with it, as my main concern with my last blackberry, was with the rollerball, and because this one doesn't have that, I've had no big issues with it.  It's got Blackberry Instant Messenger which I could not live without!!", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "DISAPPOINTED", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RNVK44ZUUABL8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a blackberry from this comapny yes i got it fast but they sent the wrong phone the seller lied to me and then i asked for the white he told me they have many in stock go ahead and order when i did the red came. i did not want the frost blue either. how can you just from a white BB to a Red one. this is DISAPPOINTING i will NEVER order from you all again and i would advise no one to. they only WANT your money.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Gemini 8520 Curve Unlocked Quadband GSM", "Author": "luis leonardo jimenez santafe", "ReviewID": "R1QQ3XYPKVIGJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to Amazon I bought excellent phone, I received it in perfect operating condition and ready for use here in Venezuela in any of the operators ... the same way by the seller.

Pero mi BB tuvo un problema de software y crei que lo habia perdido para siempre, asi que decidi regalarme uno nuevo. Luego de mucho leer, elegi este blackberry y a casi todas las personas que veia con uno igual les preguntaba si se colgaba o cosas asi y todo el mundo me daba buenos comentarios, asi que me decidi y lo compre.
