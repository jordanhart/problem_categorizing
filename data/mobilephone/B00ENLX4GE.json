I bought this for my wife for the upcoming international trip, thus the D310i model for international frequencies.  I don't have a SIM in it yet, but will have one soon in Iceland to test.I have some tech suggestions for the product though.  As everyone mentions, it has a very small amount of RAM.  This isn't as noticeable as you'd might think.  The phone is still VERY responsive and snappy.  The memory is managed well and swapped without notice.  So that is wish item #1, more RAM.  How much would an extra 512mb RAM add to the production cost of this model.The second item on my wish list would be the ability to use the phone as a wi-fi hot spot, WITHOUT losing the wi-fi connection.  So this would require two channels or antennae?  I know my laptop can do this, connect to a wi-fi source and then start it's own hot spot to share it.  I'd love this device to do that as well.The third wish item would be for 3G/4G LTE compatibility.  We are mainly data users and not cell talkers, so most of the time the cell will be chucking data back and forth and not handling an actual voice call.  It'd be great to handle that quicker than as GSM speeds.  We always fall back to wi-fi when available.We have been using the phones as SIP phones in the mean time and they are great.  They work on all wi-fi here, panera, mcds, local laundrymat, on the bus with wi-fi.  The ear piece volume is very clear and loud, even on the lowest setting.  The included mic/earphones work great as well.  Overall I am very impressed.I hope they keep developing this product and continue to release updates so the phone can grow with our usage.  It would be great to see kitkat on this device.Great customer support, reached out to us after our purchase to confirm everything was ok.  I'd recommend they keep doing that, as not many businesses have pro-active customer service and I like it.  We didn't call them or need to, although the exact model bought elsewhere (the second one I ordered for myself) came with an awesome shell/case, which I gave to my wife (who drops things).  Not sure if they were both supposed to come with the shell or not, the one shipped from Amazon didn't have it and the other directly from their company HQ in Florida did.  I don't use a shell, so we didn't bother with it.  The shell is great, and if you want the shell, confirm that it comes with it.  Also they come with a screen protector if you want to use that as well.I turn off wi-fi and other services (airplane) when charging - it charges faster and quickly.  I have been turning off wi-fi when sleeping and shushing the ringer and the phone lasts easily 90+ hours between charges.  I use battery doctor pro to track and 3 cycle charging.  I have been unplugged for 27 hours and I have 74% battery remaining.Overall this is a great product from a company nobody has heard of.  I used gsmarena to compare models and features before settling on the Dash 4.5.  I like the upgrades offered in the other models, but wasn't willing to pay for them.  This phone hit my price point for the features.It would be great if more xda-developers had this device available to them for modding.If anyone has questions, feel free to respond and I will try to answer them.  This is a great device.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mixed review.", "Author": "Trell \"Reader, gamer (paper, board & eGames)\"", "ReviewID": "RJ8L1CGNFBILP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm new to the Smart phone world, so I'm still learning what the phone does vs what \"Android smartphones should do\".- This was the best-featured phone (running android 4+ was key) I found in an more-than-casual search. It would have been nice to find a version that didn't have the 2nd Sim spot. Never going to use that.-I'm using this with Consumer Cellular. This phone wasn't on their list, but they do \"any unlocked (GSM/ used for ATT ) phone\". (it's really using ATT Cingular)-I don't have an SD card in, yet.-touch response is great.-Came with wired earbuds/mike (you need the wire for the FM Radio).-Sound is good with or without earbuds-Works fine for phone, texting.-Bluetooth worked fine-a lot better than the tracfone I was moving stuff off of.-Wifi works fine in some areas, but I think it isn't 'backwards compatible-I can't log onto my 6+ year old home network.-Data (non-wifi) connections are dicey, When it does connect, it works 'somewhat'-so far the ap I'm testing it with, the stock navigation Ap the phone came with- crashes after a few turns. Again, don't know if that's the phone, the plan (disclaimer: if you don't use their phones, Web might not work), or just \"New England's coverage\".-The manual was pointless, little more than a list of features, with no substance. To get the SIm chip in, I had to go  to youtube.-According to my 20-something spawn & his friends, random crashes of any Ap-returning it to the home screen without any message or warning-is a feature of Android-. Perhaps to make Windows users more comfortable?-Expect to charge it nightly, if you use the wifi all day long. I was in the hospital reading/playing on-phone games/surfiing for about 6 hours, and it was dead by nightfall.-Email support was prompt, if vague. I downloaded an ap that displays what sensors it has-and it shows there's a compass (magnetic sensor). I wrote to Blu's TS, mentioning a problem with the compass (Google Sky), they sent me back a screenshot of the same ap (I hadn't mentioned it), showing it had no compass.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it, but I'm old school", "Author": "BajaInsider", "ReviewID": "R3SW7KKU4RBOHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a new phone and this was in the price category I needed.

Getting the back cover off to install sim cards, memory card, and battery is frustrating, difficult, and you will assume you are destroying the phone, and may be right.One of the little 'push' button things on the case cover fell off during one of my removal/attachment sessions, and it was not easy to get in back in position.The phone is OK, and probably good for the price.  I needed an Android phone for some apps related to my job that are not available for my blackberry.  (Wake up, BLACKBERRY!)The dash 4.5 has an adequate operating system and camera to run the check deposit program for my credit union, and also the transflo now app.  (for submitting trucker related paperwork)I doubt I'll use this much as a phone, since I prefer my blackberry, but this is a good backup that runs the office apps I need, and can do so via wifi.  (don't need a sim card all the time)  I may use this as a 'travel' phone overseas, and the sim card from my tmobile bberry will work in this.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good fit", "Author": "charles", "ReviewID": "R1395ITH8S3R4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Dual unlocked phone with two sims. Delivers on its data promise of H+ on the Straight Talk or ATT network. I got up 14.mps. This D310i works best on those 2 networks. Check you carrier's network bands first--- the other version works better on T^-Mobile. I got 7.7 mps on T-Mobile. Screen appears ok.Cons: You cannot move you programs/Apps  to the sd card like like most Android products. You can store pictures, music etc. but you cannot move programs. You are limited to phone internal storage, Thus I have to clean out the cache to get extra space.

Needs more RAM and work on OS config.", "Author": "DV", "ReviewID": "R3G6NALNTAZSUP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Could be a great phone for a great price.Would be 5 stars if it had more RAM, an android 4.3 update (from 4.2.1) and didn't kill apps on a whim.I would gladly add money for more RAM and a better OS configuration.Key pointersThe cons:1. Can't multi-task e.g. when you switch between GPS app and phone app (make/answer a call), GPS app shuts down or if you try to call a number from a website, then try to return to the site to get the end of the number (no option to call on long click) then you have to reload site and reenter any user input you need to get to that page.This is probably due to the system app MTK Thermal Manager, but I can't uninstall it to check since the phone isn't rooted. Also, if the limitation was just the RAM, then memory paging would do the trick.2. The browsers (built in browser, Chrome and Firefox) both crash often, I assume this is due to RAM limitation, since even when I don't have anything but the system running I am left with only 40MB-60MB RAM available. Other apps (Waze, keyboard!) also crash often too.3. Exchange sync misses meetings, I assume this is due to older Android version.4. It is really hard to get the back cover off (to install battery, SIM and SD card).The pros:1. Call quality is great.2. Camera quality is great.3. Price.4. Potentially dual SIM feature, although I haven't tested this yet.Update:I discovered the developer options (settings --> About phone --> click on build number (last item) multiple times) and tried increasing the number of background apps but that didn't help.Update 2:Turning on and off didn't fix RAM/crashes, however, taking the battery out and putting it back in again frees up 10s of MBs, so the problems must be due to a memory leak + soft off button not working as hard off.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Minor Issues", "Author": "chirs combs", "ReviewID": "R2PI9GODXO2OM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone overall works great for the money. The battery lasts about two whole days of use on a full charge. The phone doesn't run too well with a lot of apps open, but you just have to limit yourself on how many apps you run at one time.The big issue for me is the headphone jack. The headphones the phone comes with are cheap, but they work. Although, if you try to use say apple iPod headphones they don't work at all. It's almost as if the headphone jack has to be just a bit longer.\\ALSO, This phone may be unlocked but you must read this:I am using this phone through NET 10. With NET 10 you can place this phone on the AT&T; network or the T-Mobile network. The T-Mobile network does not support the band of this phone, however AT&T; does. I encountered the problem because T-Mobile placed the phone on a 1G network, however once the phone was switched to AT&T; I did receive 3G HSPA+.Overall great phone for the price!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "As usual, manual not up to the quality of the phone.", "Author": "F.
