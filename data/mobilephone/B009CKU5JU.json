When it's translated from Chinese into English by a kindergarten student! Not even a picture naming the buttons. What a pity - this thing seems to have some good features - what a waste. With effort and much guessing, one can do the essentials. I actually like this phone watch - as a phone it works well - as a watch it works well.
