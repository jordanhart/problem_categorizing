I had an xperia 10 mini pro the one with the keyboard.This phone is way better and powerful, you can check PDFs documents. The keyboard is more comfortable although some people say that it sill slide all the time, I didn't have this problem. The camera is OK, remember is a smartphone camera, and it also has a flash. It wouldn't hurt to have a frontal camera too. The speech recognition system is acceptable for english.I also bought a case for it to protect it. So far I don't have any complains about the phone.Buy one!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "working phone ,but old", "Author": "M.
