IF YOU TEXT A LOT THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU!!! Having said that, let me say that I had been looking at this phone for a very long time. One of the most common comments/complaints that you will read is that it is \"hard to use\" or that the spinner is \"impossible to text with\". The first objection is easily overcome. If you approach this unique phone with the knowledge that it's user interface is utterly different then any other phone you've had, then learning to use the Navi-spinner is actually fun. Now, that being said, it is true that texting with this phone is a real pain. Even if you get quite fast/good with the navi-spinner it is still difficult. So, common sense should tell you that texting without a keypad is not easy. So buying this phone and expecting to text a lot with it is digging your own grave. So what's the trade off? How about a phone that looks like absolutely nothing else out there? The mirror surface is fascinating...the navi-spinner lights are amazing...people can't believe that it's a phone! Call clarity is awesome, and the design can't be beat. Worth every penny as long as you know what the shortcomings are.", "Date": "April 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "shiny, but worst phone ever!", "Author": "edgar", "ReviewID": "R1TWNVLG6891XQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is wonderful and shiny.  unfortunately, it is impossible to actually have conversations on it.
