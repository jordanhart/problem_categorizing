I am quite happy with this phone. Yes, I love Sony and I always support them. This phone is battle tested during my 2 tours to China)DESIGN&ERGONOMICS;:This phone has distinctive design and it's not Iphone that everybody around you has. Xperia S lies perfectly in hand, it's easier to hold than Iphone 4S or Samsung Galaxy S2. This phone is good for mens hands. This phone uses Micro SIM only. Comes with preinstalled screen protector.SOUND QUALITY, DISPLAY, CAMERA:Great sound quality for calls, nice selection of ringtones (some of them are very unusual). Display is also topnotch. Colors look more natural than on Iphone 4S and Galaxy S2. Camera makes good shots during outdoor sessions but a bit noiser in low light conditions. Still it's very good camera. I used this phone once to shoot a rock show, results were far from perfect. Sound was very messy.ANDROID APPS, GMAIL, SOCIAL NETWORKINGThere are plenty of apps for this phone. I have downloaded Amazon mobile which works perfectly. Also I have some other apps - Topface, Russian \"Vkontakte\" app and others. Gmail is very well made - it's easy to compose a letter, you can search thru your e-mails. My only gripe is about calculator - there are no M+, M- and MR buttons, which are very useful. Shame on you Sony! Anyway you can download free calculator from Google Play. Social networking is very convinient. I have even downloaded one game - \"Wind-up Knight\" which looks good and fun to play.BATTERY LIFE:I have never ran out of the juice completely but I can tell that usage of photo camera and Wi-Fi takes a lot of power. I am not big fan of smartphone gaming (I have PS Vita for gaming) that's why I can't comment on power consumption in games. All in all you can use it up to 3 days without recharging if you don't use much of Wi-Fi and camera.Another solid effort from Sony. Get well guys!)", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!", "Author": "Natalia", "ReviewID": "R1ZPZKNMJBPXQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed with the phone, I couldn't imagine someone being dissatisfied with getting this phone. Huge screen, awesome resolution, excellent camera, battery last even longer than expected.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A pretty good, non-mainstream phone.", "Author": "Arcadia", "ReviewID": "R3R4F2NZ6ZUO3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After going through several Samsung, Nokia and HTC phones and managing to break almost every single one of them, I decided to shake things up a bit and buy the sleek, attractive Sony Xperia S.Pros:- Ease of use. I bought this phone unlocked and it was incredibly easy to set up with AT&T.; I just brought it into one of the stores and they set everything up at no charge. Beware that the SIM card required is a micro-SIM card, so you will need to get this changed out if you're going to use AT&T.; I've heard that they sometimes charge, but they didn't charge me anything when I went in. The nice lady at the store also warned me that the internet sometimes doesn't work with unlocked phones, but this one works just fine.-Battery life. This phone has the longest battery life of any smartphone I've ever used. I expected it to be around 70% at least by the end of the day, but my charge never dropped below 85%. Of course I use the power saver feature to dim the backlighting and an app killer to keep the running programs down, but with just those two things I was able to preserve my battery for at least two days before I needed to charge it. And that's including dozens of text messages, some light Wi-Fi use and feature-browsing. It also charges very quickly.-Attractive. I love the clear illuminated bar on the bottom. I have gotten several comments on how nice and different this phone looks. The display screen is bright, colorful and most importantly, shatter-resistant. Of course I bought a screen protector as soon as I could because I'm klutz. Also, the Android OS WILL automatically upgrade when you turn on either the data internet or Wi-Fi. It updated just fine for me and I have all of the apps and games I want on it.-Customizability. There are tons of settings and options on this phone to customize just about everything to your liking.Now onto the Cons...-Sound. I found that the speakerphone is too quiet. When I'm in my car, I have to plug it into my iPod jack so that I can hear it over the car stereo because it's too quiet otherwise. Music and sounds play loud enough to shake the phone, but for some reason the speakerphone is weak.-Back, Home & Menu buttons. After a few months of owning this phone the buttons have gotten difficult to press. Sometimes they don't respond at all. You don't have to push them hard to get them to work, but you have to find the \"sweet spot\". Other times you can just hover over them without even touching them and it counts as a key press.-Swipe function when texting. Maybe there's a workaround for this, but I haven't found it yet without having to disable the swipe function completely. When you swipe and go to choose the word, sometimes the cursor will be over the word you want to choose. Like, totally blocks the word so you move the cursor all over but can't actually choose the word. I have to backspace the whole word and retype it letter by letter. It's EXTREMELY annoying for someone who texts a lot, and it makes me want to type everything letter by letter, which I find incredibly difficult on this phone. The keyboard is really tiny for me, even though I have small hands, and I end up fudging almost every other word up.Overall I would rate this a 4 out of 5. The more annoying aspects can be ignored for the rest of the excellent features this phone has. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants something different.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Lintz", "ReviewID": "R2BS6ES214WFIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got everything I was looking for in a phone.

I used the Sony mobile companion's fix my phone utility. Keep in mind when you do this it will reset your phone back to factory and install new software. Have your contacts backed up.

My previous phone was a Dell Venue Pro Windows Phone and it was quite a change going back to Android. As an OS I still think I prefer Windows Phone but I still love the versatility of Android. As soon as I set up the phone there was an update available to ICS, which is a huge improvement. The only fault I can see with ICS is that they removed WiFi Direct but that's not really a biggie. The screen is absolutely incredible and a higher pixel density than even the iPhone 5. The physical design of the phone is what first attracted me to the Xperia S and it is gorgeous! The clear bar through the phone at the bottom is awesome. I love the NFC functionality as well.

The touch screen is fabulous and the camera results are great. Call quality is great and internet browsing is a pleasure. Front screen camera is better than you would find anywhere. Battery life is better than most smart-phones out there.Cons:The touch buttons at the bottom of the screen are a bit moody. Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't. The camera takes a long time to adjust its focus. Some of the settings are hard to change too- for instance, vibration settings are hidden under display settings, and to get to keyboard settings, you have to go through sound settings etc. The speaker phone could be louder.Overall:I would highly recommend this phone.
