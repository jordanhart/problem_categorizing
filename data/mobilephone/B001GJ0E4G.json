{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best and Possibly the Last Classic Blackberry (with a real keyboard)", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "RAK3IMPD0UMAF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using Blackberries since a blackberry was thought to be something you would find in a muffin. The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Gadget-a-holic gives it 5 stars!", "Author": "J. Ehrlich \"music addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3B3K7MBSM3NWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yep, I love it.  So far I am totally impressed. I love checking out the newest PDAs, and this is certainly the best yet.First, the SCREEN.  Absolutely amazing.  I'm always looking over my shoulder because it can be read from like a mile away!  It's much bigger than it looks in the photos, and you can set the font as big as you want.Second, the KEYBOARD.  Soft, bouncy, easy to use.  Next best thing to an actual computer keyboard, I swear.  I am partial to PDAs with onboard keyboards, and I'm really picky about them.  I wouldn't buy the 8800 because I didn't like the keyboard, and the one on the Tilt drove me crazy.  This one's the absolute best.Third, the SOUND QUALITY.  I don't have a home phone, and the reception in my house sucks -- not anymore! When I'm on the phone, this sounds like a land line, and the people on the other end of the call say the sound is great.  3G reception is an improvement, at least where I live.Web browsing is greatly improved over the Curve, and YouTube can be viewed pretty well.  I am finding the Web accessing and viewing to be fairly good and often can substitute the Bold for my laptop.  It's a bigger PDA, so if you like the size of the Curve, you may want to wait for the Javelin.  It is not terribly heavier, and it's still slim, but it IS bigger (which I happen to like - I found the Curve a bit delicate-looking).And then, of course, all the other great things about owning a BlackBerry. This is a great machine.  All pros and cons of all PDAs I've checked out (and there have been many!) considered, this is the best.  A powerhouse.I have found no software glitches or needs to reboot.

In fact, it wasn't even shipped until after the estimated arrival time.SECOND, while the phone stated it was \"unlocked\" it was an AT&T; phone.  Many of the features that originally attracted me to the phone didn't work with my carrier because they were exclusive to AT&T.;  We spent hours and hours trying to get it to work.THIRD, the screen periodically turned to sections of colored lines, making it impossible to see.  Even removing the battery didn't re-set the screen.  While it could make and receive calls (assuming one had everything programmed in speed dial and the speed dial buttons memorized) the screen was rendered useless essentially making the phone useless.FOURTH, returning the item proved a challenge that took over 10 days of my time.  The vendor has an answering machine that doesn't take messages and emailing them as the instruction state has yet (over a month later) to warrant a response.  When I did get a live person to get the return arrange (remember, you can't return an item without speaking to the directly first) the person argued with me when I said I just wanted my money back and not a replacement phone that still didn't work with my carrier!FIFTH, the phone is big and bulky.

First had a problem with trackball after couple of months of use. The other one had dead pixels on the screen. So I am on my third device now.  My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device. So let's see how that goes. I definitely recommend Blackberry Bold for someone who is searching for a device with push email, chatting and light internet use.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Former Palm user Free @Last with Blackberry conversion", "Author": "Jeff Edwards \"RadioJeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1BO9CX3EBW18K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay--right up front, I'll admit it: I have been a die-hard Palm OS addict since I first purchased one of their (ancient) organizers back in the day. I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.About 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.This lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.The Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.The next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...I'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).The trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).One thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.A couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.While I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.All in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.If you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.Kudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.*****UPDATE*****I am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).The battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.The trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...The e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!WiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T; coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).The mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.I downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.I DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.I am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "The one caveat... the Z and Y keys are switched!", "Author": "intersand", "ReviewID": "RUGY6EFBHWEH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone was unlocked from O2 Network, so that is why the keys are switched.

I am trying to switch from Verizon, unfortunately, because daughter wants the Blackberry Bold, which is available only with AT&T.; So I am going through this horrible experience. I believe I am entitled to write this under this product because you cannot get this phone unless you get the terrible service together from AT&T;, so in my view the phone and the service go together.That said, here is the rest of my predicament.I have received the three phones under a family plan for almost two weeks now (recd March 30th, today is April 12th). I am with a company which has a discounted plan with AT&T; for its employees so I have to call AT&T;'s Premier Support for activation. And if this is AT&T;'s 'premier' support I cannot even imagine what their non-premier support is like.I am in Mountain time. AT&T;'s 'premier' support closes at 9PM EST each weekday, so I've been trying to get home in time to try them between 5-7 PM my time, so that our phones don't get cutoff mid-day.Each time, I go through half a dozen prompts to end up in a waiting queue, then after 10-15 minutes I hear a couple of rings like I'm getting into someone's phone, but instead I hear a click and the line goes dead.Been going through this all past two weeks. Was then looking to the weekend when the 'support' would have more overlap with my time zone.Saturday, I start calling at 9AM MST and lo and behold now after the last prompt I'm thrown into a voice mail to leave my number for a call back.I leave my home number because I don't want to call on a line which will be deactivated, so I get stuck with my home phone. Half of Saturday goes by then I try again, leave another voice mail. Did I get a call back? You guessed..  Sunday, same thing..Then, I looked up and tried a different support number to perhaps get to a supervisor. I go through several prompts then I get an announcement 'sorry, we are having technical difficulties' and the line goes dead.I am now trying to convince my daughter that quality of support is more important than a phone and I have absolutely no desire to get stuck with inaccessible support and a terrible company for two years, no matter how good the phone may be.Have been with Verizon for 10 years. Can call their one number anytime and talk to them about anything, changing plan, my company discount, anything, all in one place. And have never waited more than five minutes on line to talk to someone.You can draw your own conclusions....", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Phone was not enirely new", "Author": "DisappointedinDC", "ReviewID": "R2M0MU751SHPRF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was led to believe that this was a new and unlocked phone.
