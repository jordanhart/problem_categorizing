{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice update to the iPhone line", "Author": "G. Lee", "ReviewID": "RNPBIWDYG3935", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been a satisfied owner of both the Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S, I decided to pick up the Verizon iPhone 5 on launch day.  This review is geared toward 4S owners.  If you have any of the earlier iPhone models and wish to upgrade, it's very simple:  this is the one that you want.I won't go into all the specs here.  If you want those, go to Apple's website and they're presented very nicely there.  I also won't go into iOS 6, since this is more of a hardware review.Some main differences between the 4S and the 5 in order of importance (to me of course):1.  LTE.  This is the main reason why I decided to upgrade.  Verizon's 3G service is painfully slow at times, especially compared to AT&T.;  After a few days using LTE, I will have a hard time going back to 3G if I ever break this phone and need to resurrect my 4S.  It's amazingly fast and even faster than my Comcast wifi connection at home.  Though I don't spend a whole lot of time browsing the web on my phone, if I need to look something up, I want the information as fast as possible.  This is a huge improvement from the last iPhone, provided you live in a city with LTE service.2.  The build quality.  Apple finally put an aluminium metal back on the newest iPhone.  The phone is very sturdy and does not feel nearly as fragile as the 4S while at the same time being significantly lighter in weight.  As is typical with Apple products, when you hold and use this phone, it just screams top notch quality all around.  I am very impressed with how this new phone looks, feels, and handles.3.  The camera.  It has the same 5 element lens construction as the 4S, but with a different Sony 8 megapixel sensor.  Replacing the plastic lens cover of the 4S is a sapphire cover which, according to vigorous scratch tests published on popular tech blogs, completely lives up to durability expectations and is very scratch resistant.  The 4S had a very good camera, and in good light most people will not be able to tell the difference between identical photos shot with the two phones.  However, in low light situations, the iPhone 5 does a considerably better job capturing more photons.  I took some comparison photos in my bathroom with nothing but a small nightlight for illumination, and the 5 captures approximately two more stops than the 4S.  As expected from a device this size, it's still not anywhere close to the technical quality of even an average dedicated point and shoot camera, but for most scenarios the camera is more than adequate.  I love taking photos, so this was a big selling point for me.4.  The screen.  Same width, but a little longer.  I actually preferred the dimensions of all the previous iPhones and was not a big fan of ever increasing smartphone sizes to ridiculous proportions.  I want something small that easily fits into my pocket and that I can manipulate with one hand.  The additional length of the iPhone 5 took a little getting used to, but I think Apple came up with a nice compromise of increasing screen size without making the phone excessively bulky.For me, the upgrade from the 4S to the 5 was worth it just for the LTE and build quality improvements.  I was able to get the subsidized pricing and keep my unlimited data plan with my upgrade, so for me it was an easy decision.  Would I break contract or pay the full unsubsidized price to get the 5?  Probably not, but I can't see myself ever paying $650+ for any phone.Apple has made another excellent product in the iPhone 5.  If you want the biggest screen, the best technical specs, and an open system to tinker with, you won't find it here; you want an Android phone.  But if you are a regular everyday person who doesn't care about the technical specs and just want a great solid phone that works reliably, then you can't go wrong with the iPhone 5.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "For owning a plethora of phones over the years, this one is without a doubt the best one yet!", "Author": "Emilio", "ReviewID": "R1YZXPABG88A8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I literally could not have asked for a better phone. I stood in line waiting for the iPhone last year, and bar any stretch of the imagination, it was worth it. I constantly have great battery life, the App Store offers one free app per week, which is great, because I love free anything, and I usually drop all of my phones, but I've never dropped this one (though one of my friends dropped hers from a second floor balcony onto concrete, and it came out unscaved). I would recommend this phone to anyone who just wants a phone that works, is reliable, takes great photos, and has an amazing customer support service as well as some of the best apps in the mobile phone market.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Tawni Williams", "ReviewID": "R2XCHF24KXVY0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great and I have had no problems with it, its light and has a great screen.
