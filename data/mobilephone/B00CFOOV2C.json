But the screen would dim after 9 seconds. Nothing I did prevented this. Yes, there are settings to prevent this and I tried brightness, time out, etc. Nothing helped. Day 2 of using the phone and the cursor took off on it's own wandering around the screen. Then the phone locked up and prevented me from shutting it down. Then magically, it worked fine again. After a few minutes, the cursor started wandering again and once again it locked up.

The Blu Studio 5.3 II offered the best specs for the price (outside of buying direct from China) . I am primarily a business user - not much gamimg at all.  After 3 months of use, overall, I am very happy with this phone, with just a couple issues that keep it from being 5 star.Pros:* Large clear screen, and no scratches with regular use* loud enough phone.* Strong WiFi + easy to connect to a variety of sources, yet seems to use very little power when out of range but scanning for a signal* snappy performance* have only had to do a hard reset once, although I do shut it off every night to clear stray tasks* 1gb storage + 32 GB SD addn gives me plenty of space for appsCons* 512 ram is kind of all for android 4.1. I occasionally get low memory warnings, which is kind of a pain.* I wish volume & screen brightness settings had more gradations, especially on the low/dark side. Lowest setting is too loud/bright for me.* As other reviewers have noticed, the screen will go dim after just a few seconds of idle. I assumed this was an android power feature. When reading or typing I have to touch the screen frequently to keep it bright.* Tough to fimd a good case. I bought a Note II generic case. Phone fit ok, but case is alrwady wearing out.My only other comment is simply a curious observation. Less than a week after getting my phone I bruised the screen pretty badly. After another week of use the bruise went from the size of a nickel to a large, elongated thumbprint! I was very disappointed, bit figured it was my own fault. I had to go out to a camp for a week, so while gone I took the battery out and let the phone sit without power. When I got back, the bruise was gone and the phone had no touch issues where the bruise was!", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Hern\u00e1n Patr\u00f3n", "ReviewID": "RLDDFFDSI5KZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Everyone has always told me, if you like Apple, you will hate androids but if you like androids you will hate Apple. I had an Apple for 4 years and loved it and it was true about hating androids until I got this one to give it a chance. So far, this is the only android I like.Pros:Big screen, great pics, can snap pics while recording, and much moreCons:Only two so far...the screen dims on its own after a few seconds and I dont like that especially when I'm reading something. If anypne knows how to change that please let me know. And second, no cases for it....YET. (other than a little rinky-dink leather pouch!

I LOVE my phone. The battery was horrible but I downloaded this battery app & it's much better. It holds lots of aps & when it starts getting low on RAM the app will tell me & it will clean it so I love that. The colors show up really well & its android ICS. It's huge, I can txt so good on it. It connects to wifi really good. The picture quality is great & i love the panorama (i think thats what its called) part on the camera & It records ok but the lighting on videos arent the  greatest but thats not that big of a deal to me since the pics look so great I think. The speaker phone part sounds mumbly sometimes but not all the time but the regular headset part without using the speaker sounds great & really clear. The ONLY thing that I dont like about it (and idk if it's just my phone or if every one is like that) is that when I answer it makes a weird noise that makes me laugh cuz it sounds like my husband screaming or something lol but its not loud, just like a sound like ok what was that about lol It gets great signal on my straight talk, I get H so its really good, especially since I live out in the woods in a small town. I also wish there was more cases but the case that it came with protects it pretty good. My case they sent me was black. I wish it was pink but I'm ok with the black one. it also has video call so thats really cool. And I love that I can chose between standard blue that the original ics comes with and pink so ofcourse i chose pink since im kind of a girly girl or woman lol Anyways, Im gonna upload pics so everyone can see how it looks. I hope it helps!! And I DEF recommend this phone.
