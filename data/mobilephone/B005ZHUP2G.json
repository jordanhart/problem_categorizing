Just needed a holdover until I got something more to my liking. I had remembered really liking the old Bold, so I bought this. It was a little more beat up I think, than the seller had let on. I know this is subjective, but there was painting and chips on the keys, the battery was a little corroded. The phone DID work however. The trackpad was slightly off-kilter which did affect performance when having to sometimes press it 3 times to click on something. I used the phone for about 2 hours before deciding I'd have to do something else. My cell HAS to work. So, I bucked up and just got another iPhone. I don't really blame the seller.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Haiti4ever", "ReviewID": "R10JZ1L2JHC70Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely LOVE it!
