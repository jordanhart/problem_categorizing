Both came really quickly and in perfectly new condition! I just love using those classic busyness phones even though I have an iphone 4 and I'm 22...sometimes when you go on a meeting or somethimg like that its pretty cool to pull out your Nokia 6310i. I just feel better with it.  If you learn about 6310i Nokia history, you will notice that they never assembled those in Finland (only Germany) and which ever Nokia 6310i says made in Finland - well it's actually China. But again I ordered two of this phones (for the future use - as the time goes by and it gets harder to find it) so they are very-very good quality. Sealed box and all brand new stuff in it.If you are one of those people who cares about call quality and loves this lonely non-mp3 ring-ring sound coming out of your pocket - this is the one. reliability of the phone leaves no comments, it catches the network even where my Iphone nervously  smokes aside...Thank youArtsem", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia at it's best!", "Author": "Robert Galante", "ReviewID": "R7DOEKPSSIQ9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has all the features I would ever want.

Battery lasts for 3 days without any usage except being switched on. Charger plug has bad contact and needs to be wiggled until it get contact and not moved until charged. Buttons don\u2019t respond well at all, to dial a 10 digit # I had to press 14 times. The panel fit is like its made in bad aftermarket poor quality sweatshop squeking when dialing. I owned an original bought in UK 6310i in 2002 and after  5 years the original battery lasted for 6 days with at least 20 hours talk and usage. Does not have the proper labeling like the original Finland made by Nokia. i don't want to use it for 5 years,just to work the way 6310i does...", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Yousuf Ahmad Ali", "ReviewID": "R270UO1AAXK13W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "fast and quick .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. speedy and quick and fast and will order again", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Sure!", "Author": "bent", "ReviewID": "R1XQZJ0PX4RABE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I agree with the previous feedback by Abi, the phone is more to chinca made.. when i checked the bar code on the box by QR application, it give me details of motorrolla phone details !_! more over the battery made in Finland not Hungary as mentioned in the seller product details", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000ZZ96EQ"}}
