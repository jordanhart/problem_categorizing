A lot of people ask me about it what is a pantech they say. I tell them its an AT&T; phone, but I can fit my T-Mobile sim card it is and it works perfectly. The only thing I don't like about it is I don't know how to send picture messages, it won't let me. When I used to own a Samsung it would let me send and receive picture messages, but now with this phone it only lets to receive them not send them. That's the only downfall about this phone. But overall its really good, its small enough to fit in my pants pocket and not look too bulky. Texting is cute kinda reminds me of how the I-phone messaging is.**********************************************************After 6 months, this cute little phone just stopped working. I thought I bought it new, but after reading the reviews I'm second guessing myself. I tried to charge the phone and the phone wouldn't read the charger. When I first got the charger it wouldn't fit the phone which I never understood why not. Now, no charger to fit this phone will read the charger, the phone still comes on, but it won't work. I am very upset about this because I am honestly tired of spending money on cell phones!!! They aren't supposed to be like cars, where you have to spend a lot of money on all the time. I don't know what else to do.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My wife loves it!", "Author": "Hunter \"Peanut Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R332YMNIHRQI8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Christmas gift for my wife replacing her other Pantech phone that she dropped and cracked the screen.

I got her the P9020 for Christmas and gave in giving it to her on the 21st. She absolutely loved it. Then last night for no apparent reason it froze on the opening ATT screen. Taking the battery out to reset it does nothing. It won't even shut off without battery removal. So now I'm struggling with Customer support to see if it can be fixed. I'm finding out that the freeze ups are not uncommon with certain Pantech models.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone is a piece of crap.", "Author": "j\u00f6kull", "ReviewID": "R1GJGON6BK7XEI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Terrible phone. Touch-screen based lock is triggered regularly in my pocket. The phone is extremely slow and only holds a charge for six hours.

Also, after using it for a couple of months the cord connecting the top and bottom part part of the phone can snap, which makes the screen turn white. I noticed that the battery cover can warp, making it easier for water to get in your phone. The sticker that turns a certain color when wet is extremely sensitive, and ended up thinking it got wet because of the humidity.
