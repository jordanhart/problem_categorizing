{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The most elegant phone till date - Honest Review", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "R2YYLUTJFH4FZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the unlocked version from Malaysia.Only a company such as RIM / Blackberry can do this. I can keep writing forever about how great I find this phone to be. But here is a short and quick review..I have been using an iPhone 5 and BB Z10. The Z10 itself was much better than the iPhone in several departments but was lacking some crucial features such as a confusing copy paste functionality and weak battery life.. With Z30's new hardware and OS 10.2, BB has taken it to the a whole new level. The Z30 has the best network coverage. In a basement where my iPhone gives me 1 or 2 signal bars, the Z30 gives me almost full network. The call voice quality is amazingly clear and natural. The speakers give a stereo sound. Off-course you cant compare it with a home theater system, but it is certainly one of the best and it makes the experience of watching Youtube videos, Pandora very enjoyable. The screen resolution though not 1080p is really nice. BB OS10.2 has some drastic changes and improvements. With USB host, I connected a mouse, keyboard and pen drive to it and also connected it to a monitor via Miracast. I was amazed to see how the Z30 delivered in all the departments. BB OS10.2 is way better than iOS7. Trust me on this.. Once you get used to the gesture based navigation on a BB, you would never ever like to use the iPhone. In OS10.2, you can instantly reply to messages through the notifications without leaving your current screen. Lastly not to mention, with moderate usage, my battery lasted about 2 and a half days. This beats every other phone in the competition.Bottom-line: If you are looking for a cell phone with superior sound quality, powerful communication, great battery life go for the Z10.If you are someone who cant live without Apps such as Netflix, Instagram.. then this may not for you. It is for people who are looking for a powerful and secure communication device. I find it a great fun device too.The only one thing that might be a shortfall for some people would be the number of apps available on BB World. A phone is judged by its quality and features and not by the number of apps. You could anyways side-load all Android apps onto the Z30. That said, the BB World does have over 120,000 apps and counting including the most important apps that one would need.Agreed that BB has made some crucial mistakes and has stepped into the game a little late, but its well worth the wait. It takes sometime for a new platform to mature and stabilize and BB OS10.2 has done just that.Don't be surprised if the US starts bashing this phone in their reviews solely because of the lack of apps compared to iOS / Android. Its become a sort of trend here to bash a brand and give biased views.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Z30, Great Phone If You Buy the Right Model", "Author": "HuskerTechGuy", "ReviewID": "R54QGIOMRVWS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Blackberry Z30 is a great phone, but many of the Amazon merchants are selling international models (e.g., STA100-2) that will not work to their full capabilities in the United States.

Need to order Micro SIM since my old smartphone used Normal SIM. Screen is clear and the apps downloaded and installed fast. Everything works as expected right out of box. I like the 5\" screen as the text is easy to read and videos are smooth with good sound. Took some time to find the MAc address so I could logon to secured wifi site.

I'm one of those people that love to take risks and tinker with tech toys. Within a few days of my purchase I loaded BlackBerry's latest operating system leak 10.2.1.1055.The leaked OS allows this phone to load and run android apps with ease. Although most of the apps I have wanted are available in blackberry world, there were a few, such as my local credit unions app, that I knew would never be offered. Very happy that I can run both systems on one phone.To be honest the apps are less of an issue than most people think. (Yes Candy Crush works just fine). The real beauty of this phone is the integration of all the tools that we use daily. Checking multiple emails, texts, social media, BBM and more is always just a quick swipe away. With a glance at the hub I can see if anything important or interesting needs to be dealt with; then it's a quick tap into whatever has caught my attention. It's hard to describe how much better BlackBerry's Hub works... I carry an S4 for work and it is a good phone, but it is not the smooth, quick communication rockstar that the Z30 is.The screen size is perfect. Easy to read, but I can still throw it in my shirt pocket for easy carrying.Battery has never been an issue; even on very busy days I have never seen a low battery warning on this phone.The keyboard is good and fast to type on. (I have typed this whole review on it.) I like the flick feature, but can't help but think that if it had swipe the keyboard would be unmatched by any phone.The antenna in this phone is the biggest reason I carry it. When my company issued S4 loses reception in remote areas the Z30 is still working. When you have a loved one with health issues that is priceless. The Z30 also holds 4G LTE  when my S4 cannot. I have also ran Speedtest side by side on these phones several times in different areas. The Z30 is always faster on upload and download speeds.The built-in browser is also a welcome surprise. On all of my previous phones I have used Dolphin or Firefox because the stock Android browsers lacked functionality. The Z30 browser has the features I like and it is not necessary to get another.Build quality on this phone is very impressive. I like the carbonite back cover and the grip it affords. The speakers are very good, especially if you set the phone down on a hard surface. They seem to be designed to amplify off of the table top.Bluetooth has functioned flawlessly with my car stereo and my home system. I transferred all my music on to the Z30 and never use my ipod anymore.The HDMI port has been great for watching movies that we purchased on BlackBerry World for 99 cents. (new releases!!!) I also used DLNA to wirelessy port videos to our television, but it does not allow copyrighted material. (DRM issues??) I have not tried Miracast yet. The picture quality was good, but not Blu-ray quality.To sum it all up, if you are on the fence about the Z30, I say go for it. No matter  what happens in the future you will have a great quality phone that can do all the extras, but is also a rockstar communication tool.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blackberry at its best!", "Author": "teteme", "ReviewID": "R28209TB3BGYES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say this phone is a well rounded smart phone for Blackberry.

The display is excellent and the acustic is wonderful either if you watch a movie or if you make a call. Battery does last as they say: I used and streamed for about 24 hr continuously and it still had some juice. I have had Blacknerrys before but the OS 10 is a transformation. Most recently I have used an iphone 4s and I liked it, but I missed certain features that remained and remain specific to the Blackberry. The Z30 is perfection: it is a Blackberry transposed in a new world and that exists at a different level. FYI, I bought unlocked, it comes from Canada (Telus) and I have it for two weeks.Some reviews I have seen (also in youtube) say that the phone is heavy, but I disagree. My iphone 4s is heavier than the Z30. Surely, the z30 is a substantial phone but, as I said, coming from an iphone 4s it is actually lighter.

I bought mine online from Canada to get the 100-5 model and I put my AT&T; sim card in it and it works perfectly on the LTE network. When I took it to AT&T; to get a mini sim card, the people at the store didn't even know what phone it was. They had never seen a Z30 before.This phone is amazing. It is extremely fast, smooth and it looks nice. BB hub makes things a lot easier for you so you get all of your new messages in the same place, regardless of what type they are. You can even answer a message in the same window of whatever it is that you are doing, without leaving it to answer. The big screen is a beauty to view videos and take photos. BBM works great, Skype with video on is really good and the BB OS 10 is excellent. The typing is amazing. I added a Russian and Portuguese keyboard to it. The Portuguese keyboard is the same as the English keyboard and if you type a phrase mixed in both languages, it seems to always know what you are going to say and suggest the necessary words for you type, in this case either in English or Portuguese. This makes typing extremely fast. Even faster than swiping in a Samsung. A true joy to type.Although there aren't as many apps for BB as there are for other phones, the most important apps are available. The battery lasts two days using it moderately. If you use it to play a lot, it won't last that long. For the business oriented person, this is a great phone.

It is an amazing device.  Absolutely amazing.If you're into productivity, the Z30 is for you -- very easy to go in and out of apps, cut an paste between apps, share.  It's hard to describe how well integrated everything is.  For one example, when you get a meeting reminder, you can click \"Join Now\" and it will dial in -- including the bridge -- which is just great in the car for hands-free conference calling.  That's just one example.  It's a very nice experience to have all your contacts, communications, appointments, documents, locations and so-on integrated and available to each other the way they are on this OS.Some things that don't get mentioned a lot but are really cool:1) Because of the realtime audio processing, audio quality is fantastic.  Very full.  It sounds good through the little phone speakers, but output through the car or other bigger speaker and you'll definitely wow some people.2) The materials are really space-age.  It's almost impossible to scratch the back, but it's still very supple and soft to the touch. I don't know what this stuff is (BlackBerry says \"glass weave\").  It's very impressive.3) BBM voice and video calling are incredibly high quality, at least from BlackBerry to BlackBerry device.  It puts Skype, Viber, Facetime and all the rest to shame.4) The app gap is way overblown.  BlackBerry World has nice apps and lots of them, and most Android apps run great on 10.2.1.5) People will be amazed when they see you using this phone.

Though I cannot prove it, I believe that I was given refurbished phones by the service provider in both cases due to the packaging and working conditions of both phones when I received them.Finally the third replacement came directly from Blackberry and it works as expected.I have been using this Phone since mid February 2014 and I am quite happy with it; this is why I am updating the review from 1 to 5 stars.What I like:Screen Size: the best as I can use it as a tablet replacement since it is not too small that I cannot see the content property and not too big to become cumbersome; with this Phone your tablet is redundant and a waste of money.Phone Reception is awesome; nothing to add here.Battery Life; nothing like it in the market as lasts and lasts and lasts...Keyboard: outstanding keyboard and beats any Phone keyboard out there; this saves time and time is money; most zealous critics of Blackberry agree it is the best.Sound: the speakers are outstanding; I do not use my desktop computer speakers as much as I use to and I use the Z30 as my loud media player when I want to listing to content.Radio: I can listen to the local radios without the need of the Internet due to the built-in antenna and I cannot do this with my iPhone.Memory Expansion: I can add more memory to the Z30 with and use it as a USB drive via its Mass Storage Option and with no additional software required as the phone works as a flash drive; yes I cannot do this with my iPhone.Apps: It comes with a complementary free office suite with no additional cost to the user.Blackberry World apps are great and there are enough apps for most mature people; I frankly do not need the gazillion useless apps that fill the Apple App Store as I bought a phone not a toy.Privacy & Security: this is what makes Blackberry standout and you real feel you are in control when you use it; I am not taking about blocking NSA spooks or other foreign or domestic intelligence agencies, if they want access to your Phone they will get it as it is their business and it would be a criminal incompetence if they were not smart enough to able to, but being confident that no two bit hacker or a sneaky programmer can remotely access your Phone anytime he or she wants.No iTunes sniffing content and locations bots: what a relief after being tied up to it with my iPhone; you cannot feel the relief until you experience it.When was it the last time your iPhone prompted you that a certain application wants to access your contacts or your pictures upon install even though it is a game app? Apple seems to think that ignoring the security flaws of their phones and computers for years would make them go away and I think that they have succeeded so far in convincing most of their clients; flaws that would have otherwise trashed Blackberry stocks do not seem to impact or affect the value of Apple's and I think that there something utterly wrong with this picture.I do not want to go into a discussing about Android as it is known what business of personal information collection is Google, as is Facebook, involved in.Additionally the z30 can be used as a main desktop computer if hooked to a monitor (just perform an Internet search to see how simple this is); this could well be a replacement of all desktop computers for those of us who use them for office business processing, e-mail access, and entertainment.The Z30 with this feature can also be used as full desktop computer when traveling abroad where access to a PC/Mac is not readily available; I think of hotels where monitors are readily available in rooms but not desktop computers.Cons: none so far.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$429.99", "Features": "GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\n720 x 1280 pixels, 5.0 inches (~294 ppi pixel density)\nmicroSD, up to 64 GB\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct\n8 MP, 3264 x 2448 pixels, autofocus, LED flash", "Name": "BlackBerry Z30 Smartphone Unlocked Import", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512WtbREiNL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FIQSPD0"}}
