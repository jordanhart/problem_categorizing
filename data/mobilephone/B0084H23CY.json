{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good form factor, great phone", "Author": "Steven P. Spinella \"USteve\"", "ReviewID": "R2NPV2D6IDASQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HTC One S is more narrow than other current smart phones. It actually fits the HD screen you see on modern TVs when held horizontally. This means more scrolling when reading horizontally and a smaller onscreen keyboard when swype-ing, so it gave me pause when ordering. Having used it for six months, I can say that I've gotten used to these challenges, even though I do have big fingers and I especially enjoy the form factor.Bottom line is that a phone fits in your hand, and this one fits better than others with large screeens. It is also very thin with rounded edges. Even with a form-fitting cover (see separate review) it fits in my pocket and my hand so much better than the other options. As you know, I carry it every day, so this really matters more than the hypothetical loss of screen real estate.Phone calls are clear, reception is excellent, and wifi works great (I usually don't have a data plan, since when I'm away from buildings I generally only want to do phone calls, read books, or look up information in my databases.My go to app is google mail, calendar, and contacts, all of which are syncing fine between my computer and phone.For reading, I have used kindle for android, adobe reader, and Olive Tree Bible Study app. I am satisfied with all of them. I also occasionally use the built in software to access MS office files (through dropbox) and it has worked fine.I have used the phone to watch you tube videos, but I don't really see a phone as a TV.I do use the camera quite a bit. While the optics are a step down from the larger lens on my Nikon P60, I always have it with me and the resolution is adequate for screen viewing, but not for extensive enlargements. E.g., it's better for memories than for publication.I am totally pleased with this phone. It is plenty fast enough for my mobile apps and it has already served me well for six months. I hope you can get a good deal on one yourself.Technical note: it does take the smaller sim cards. It also has 16 gb storage, but no removable sd card or battery. I have not found this a problem though it was something I considered at the time of purchase, and as you can see, I greatly appreciate the form factor, which benefits from these space saving measures.And if you're wondering, it's so much nicer than any iphone I've seen, just in my humble opinion as someone who doesn't subscribe to the istore game..", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not software supported anymore, not the best One series phone.", "Author": "Michael S. \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R3EIYQL3QGR3NT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone for T-mobile was ok not the best.

From time to time, I take photos in restaurants and need to take closer look under the low light situation.  I found my friends who use iPhone & Samsung do not have the same functions at all, because their photos obviously can not be compared with mine. I dropped my phone several times and got some scratches on the back covers and it is still in perfect condition.

When I play music, no sound; when I use home phone to call my cell, no sound. I look up on internet and find out that many people have the same problem. The solution is to pull out your sim card and insert one more time. So I did it and when I turned my phone on, I hear the welcome sound!BUTafter few days, it happened again so I did the same thing.
