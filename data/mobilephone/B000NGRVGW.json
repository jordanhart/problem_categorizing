Adobe Flash, podcasting, pdf, msword files, wifi, videocalling. This phone will be ahead of the game for a while. The N82 and the N95 are the only units that best this phone but they go for $100-200 more. Dependable and glitch-free. Best phone for the money. Third best phone regardless of price. The stealth phone to have.Caveat: This is a slider phone. Slider phones are not as durable as candy bar units. After 1.5 years of riding in my pocket and only one drop onto carpet, the flex cable broke. SLIDERS ARE PRONE TO FLEX CABLE ISSUES.

We brought it from Dubai at a very high price and thus found the need to use it for this long. It was truly a miracle for its time. Not only did it have two cameras, but one was 3 megapixels. It also had a flash and internet capabilities. Unlike many phones of its time it was very clunky. It was almost like a small brick. It could thereby survive many high falls. Soon the plating covering the front of the phone fell off. It was nothing more than thin plastic. It gave the phone a cheaper appearance. Also, the graphics had some problems towards the last year. The screen became blurred and there was a \"dead\" spot on the right bottom corner. Also, the cameras began to fog up and lose quality. In addition, the speakers were useless and the video camera could not properly pick up sound. It also became very slow.Although the phone had many features, we were disappointed that they were all soon unusable. We were especially sad that the phone was so expensive (at that time) and not that great in terms of quality.Today, I would not recommend it for the previously stated reasons.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love Nseries", "Author": "A.

Being a slide phone, it's never going to last especially given the fact the slide is not spring assisted also it was extremely slow and froze quite a bit even after firmware upgrades. Finally the display went out so I bought an N82, infinitely better phone. All the features of the N80 plus more with none of the drawbacks. If you're considering buying this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the N82.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "Nokia N80 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - slider - Symbian OS", "Name": "NEW NOKIA N80 BLACK GSM 3G 3 MP CAMERA SMART CELL PHONE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RJKmcbf3L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000NGRVGW"}}
