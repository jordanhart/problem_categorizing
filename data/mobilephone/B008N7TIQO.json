I switched to an iPhone 4s with AT&T; service. For a trip overseas to China, I bought this unlocked phone.The phone is slow. What can I say. The Android 4.0 operating system doesn't crash weekly like the old 2.x one did, that's nice. You will wait a couple of 3 seconds for aps to come up, and that's very annoying.The other annoying thing is the frequency in which aps and the OS tries to refresh data, even when it seems it's not needed. It's one thing if you have 3G or 4G and there's no limit on bandwidth....but I was running 2G using WiFi, and it seemed it was always trying to refresh data even when it wasn't necessary.My Suggestion - Go with something with a better processor, maybe a dual or quad - you'll save yourself a lot of frustration!!", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with the dual sim, but not with the photo quality", "Author": "Mariska", "ReviewID": "R3KPUVFOA553MU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The HTC Desire v performs reasonable good. The phone is stable, crashes rarely. The sound is pretty good as well. Dual sim works good.Big drawback is the image quality. Images are real blurry and seem more like oilpaintings. I have not been able to get this any better by changing the settings. But I'm unsure if it is the hardware or the software, as the preview looks much sharper. Only after I've taken the photo, the saved photo is very blurry. That's why I've tried another photo app, but that didn't help much either.My previous single sim HTC Desire made much better photo's than this one. So, don't pick this phone for the image quality.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hardware failed, and does not work with AT&T; network in US", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "R30SJCC66DZJ63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hardware failure resulted in severe overheating during charging.  HTC US repaired it, but demanded a service charge of $75 for a product which was sold to have an \"international warranty\".Doesn't work at all in the US with AT&T;, but works fine throughout Asia including roaming with the AT&T; SIM inserted into the second slot.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a Quality Product", "Author": "karen singleton", "ReviewID": "R1MRG6WZ7NX12Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used this phone overseas for the last year and really liked the dual sim card function. Having two sim cards saved me money making calls to friends/clients with the same providers. It also had good connectivity in a country where cell phone towers are powered by more wattage than in the states. But back in the states I purchased AT&T; sim cards for my wife and myself. Her little samsung often got connection and my HTC would not. After hours on the phone with AT&T; and HTC I reset the phone and nothing improved. I have concluded the problem was the phone's connectivity. I've also had problems with the responsiveness of the phone. It seems to make choices of its own when I haven't touched the screen and at other times I'm hitting a widget several times before it will respond. The on/off button is also not as responsive as it should be. Overall I think the quality of this phone might be worth the present cost of $220 BUT not the $329 I paid for it one year ago. The dropping value tells the story. After using a borrowed Iphone 5 for a few days I was completely disgusted with my HTC. I would not buy this phone again.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this phone - it doesnt work with USA AT&T;", "Author": "KfL \"klaudanski\"", "ReviewID": "R3UADV5FXVHYFE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is phone that is originally destined for Asian market. It is NOT international version. The frequency on this phone are such that they will randomly and unreliably work in the USA. For example, my phone works in Pennsylvania but not in Peurto Rico or San Francisco. According to HTC this phone can be repaired in Asia. The original labels from HTC do not specify that this is international phone. Outside label that is attached over original HTC info confirm it is international phone. I can only suspect that this label was placed by reseller. I have two phones in three month - all of them with the same problems. I double checked with AT&T; and HTC details about this phone. I believe the description is misleading. If you lucky phone will work for you.
