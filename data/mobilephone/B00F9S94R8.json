{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific $49 Smartphone LOCKED To MetroPcs Network", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "RRVWRC4BLCH75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nokia Lumia 521 is a great basic smartphone at its low $49 price at MetroPcs stores. This version of the Lumia 521 is LOCKED to MetroPCS so carefully verify the quality of Metro's signal in your neighborhood using the coverage map on the MetroPcs website BEFORE you buy a MetroPcs phone.  Live in Venezuela, Dubai or Colombia?  This is a LOCKED phone for people living in the USA who have a MetroPcs prepaid phone plan.The Lumia 521 uses Windows 8, NOT Android.  Window 8 provides an easy to use introduction to smartphones for people upgrading from a basic dumb phone.  The Lumia 521 and Windows 8 make it easy to make phone calls, send text messages and check email. The 521 is NOT for the folks who think they need 5,000 apps, or who play 3D action games, nor can it substitute for an expensive camera.  People who are in love with the apps on their current Android phone or their Apple iPhone will be frustrated not finding their favorite app in the Windows App Store.The camera take adequate photos in bright sunlight, but it has no flash for indoor photos. The rear speaker is loud but is designed for use as a speakerphone and it is mediocre for playing music.Extra batteries are available for very low prices. Take two or three extra batteries on a camping trip and go the whole weekend without needing to charge your phone.  MetroPCS is now part of T-Mobile and the Lumia 521 uses the T-Mobile GSM and HSPA network which provides 4G data speeds in most large cities.The Lumia 521 does NOT have 4G LTE, but its 4G HSPA is fast enough to stream Pandora Radio or stream Netflix if you are in a strong 4G signal area.  Again, check the coverage map at the MetroPcs website to verify that 4G coverage is available where you live and work.The MetroPCS monthly plans are the least expensive unlimited plans in America. The plans include ALL taxes and fees. The $40 unlimited plan IS $40 period. Never any surprise penalty charges because you talked with your mom in Wyoming for three hours on Mother's Day or listen to Pandora Radio ten hours a day.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title":

For under one hundred dollars, users get a great smart phone on a great network and in addition, no one is locked down to a two year contract. I tried to cover as much as i could in the video review, but due to file size limitations, i maxed out if i exceed a three minute video review. I am a huge Windows OS fan. I think their OS is great and offers users a different experience. It is NOT the most exciting OS out there, but at the same time, it is a very solid OS and runs very smoothly. It is not a battery hog or glitchy like the Android OS. My pros and cons are below. I know my cons list might be a bit long, but remember that you are getting a lot for the price. Feel free to ask me any questions and i'll be happy to respond.Pros:- Price (A smartphone under one hundred dollars and no contract)- T-Mobile network after merging with Metro PCS- 4G (HSPA Plus Network no 4G LTE but faster than 3G)- Built in Wi-Fi- Mobile HotSport Feature- T-Mobile's awesome affordable plans- Wi-Fi Calling after merging with T-Mobile- Windows OS- Features packed smart phone for the price- LCD display (LCD is brighter than AMOLED displays)- Expandable memory up to 64GB via micro SD card- 720P Video recording on the phones built in camcorderCons:- No HD display- Display is 4 inches (5.2 inches would be perfect)- No front facing camera for video chats- A larger battery- Not a 13 megapixel camera- No flash on the camera- No Starbucks or Hangouts App yet- No 4G LTE (Runs on HSPA Plus which is faster than 3G)", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Cheap Phone on the Market", "Author": "gibby", "ReviewID": "RQG4TT68HIYXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of theses phones for my mother in-law and my niece and they both love the phone and cant believe how much it costs with out a contract.its fast calls sound great and it works great with their windows 8 laptops.. taking pics show up on their computers I no longer need to teach them haw to get photos off their phones..awesome Job NOKIA...", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprised and wowed.", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R20D64ZTN5APRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was expecting only a tolerable experience with this Nokia 521 MetroPCS Windows8 phone. I'd had a Samsung NOTE for almost 2 years and enjoyed Android/Google interface, but wanted to save money so I switched from AT&T; to Metro PCS, and I figured the no-contract, cheapest-offered Nokia (Only $89.00 on Amazon!!!!) would be a low risk entry point. After using this phone for a month I have to conclude that it's easily and by a large margin the best cell/smartphone experience I've ever had. Truly  I wasn't expecting this Nokia and Windows8  to be such a breath of fresh air. Firstly the mechanical  functions of this Nokia are mercifully simple to understand right out of the box. I'd read that some people are confused by Windows8, and I realize everyone's brain works differently, but this interface speaks my language, I guess. It's easy to look at, easy to hold, elegant or nothing fancy, depending on your personal taste. The row of  physical buttons are placed at the lower end of an incline curvature that makes accidental turning off and on of the phone difficult. One of the physical buttons is the camera shutter, like a real camera has, so no more tapping at a touch screen to take a snap. (No flash though, but still manages decent shots, even in low-ish light) The screen is only two-thirds of the size of my  Samsung Note's screen, but the Windows interface places  multi sized app boxes atop each other that scroll/float up and down with gentle swipes.  The boxes are customizable so although my eyesight is only average to getting older I can read what's on the screen without strain, the navigation feels effortless.What don't I like? I became addicted to Words With Friends, which doesn't have a good WIndows8 Phone app, so I had to  convince everyone that I play with to switch to WORDS BY POST, which is a multi phone platform scrabble-like game that works for everyone except  my poor Blackberry using friends (Sorry this is too much information!).  Another thing I don't like is though I can use voice for Google Searches, it will answer me in text, but not with a voice which Android will do.But back to more things that I like: Outlook synced up my PC and phone calendar and contacts effortlessly....and wirelessly.  Notifications of mail, texts and voicemail work great, nice Nokia music and maps apps.  About MetroPCS: I felt genuine trepidation about switching from a top three carrier to whatever rank they are but I actually get CLEARER voice quality now than I did with my AT&T; Samsung. Maybe the superior call clarity comes from Metro PCS, maybe it's the Nokia handset, but what matters to me is how clearly my parents are coming in from Florida and my sister from MA sounds like she is in the next room. Bottom line: I've trimmed $70 off my monthly phone bill PLUS have found the perfect phone for me.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "RZGSK21QJ492U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the phone...... it was an adjustment from android to windows phone...... but I love it and would buy another.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very impressed", "Author": "clamarama", "ReviewID": "R3KUUYI6AMIVZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone because it seemed to offer the best quality hardware on a budget price, plus switching to MetroPcs saved me $10/month over Virgin Mobile. I wasn't crazy about the idea of switching from Android, but figured it was worth a try. Before switching, I checked the Windows Phone app store to make sure that I could get apps that I find essential.I've had the phone about a week now and it is definitely better quality than any of the similarly priced Android phones I've owned, and the Windows OS is far superior to Android. I love the live tiles and the ability to customize the home screen. The interface and animations are so elegant and beautiful - the attention to aesthetics makes the phone fun to use.I had a little bit of trouble with the set up, especially getting contacts loaded. On the surface, it seems very easy - you enter your account info and if you check the box to sync your contacts, it syncs them. My problem was that I have several hundred gmail contacts and only wanted a small number of them on the phone. If I tried to delete a contact from the people app on the phone, it would give me a warning that it would also delete the contact from Google. I asked Metro PCS and Microsoft support how to get around this, and they didn't have any answers. Eventually, I set up a new Outlook.com account and imported a list of the contacts I wanted and had the phone sync contacts for that account only. That worked well, but I was frustrated at how little help I got from Metro and Microsoft. The next day, I got a welcome email from Windows Phone, and it included info about a Nokia app called \"Transfer My Data.\" It turns out that this app transfers contacts from your old phone via Bluetooth. It worked quickly and effortlessly, but I'm so annoyed that they didn't tell me about it when I asked for help!The other problem I had was when I added the Block-it service from Metro. This is a call-/text-blocking app that they offer for $1 a month. After I ordered the service, I couldn't find the app. It took an hour for the support person at Metro to figure out that my phone was not compatible with this service, although it was included on the list of compatible phones. AND, the next day I got an update of the Lumia software that included an app that provides call and text blocking for free. Again, I'm annoyed that the support person didn't know this.Here are some of the things I like best about the phone so far:-Seamless integration of multiple accounts. It shows events from my personal and work calendars (even Facebook events). The calendar color codes events by source account. Office provides access to my SkyDrive files for both my work and personal accounts, and even includes lists of recently accessed files on both my home and work computers, including files that aren't on my SkyDrive. It correctly integrates information on contacts that comes from different sources, even when I use private nicknames for those contacts - so people's birthdays and other info from Facebook are added to their entries in the phone. (You can also write on a person's Facebook wall from within the contact list, without actually going to Facebook. I think you can do this with Twitter, too, but I don't use Twitter.)-The camera is surprisingly good and it doesn't matter that there's no flash. It's not great, but far better than I expected. It has some way of adding light without a flash. When you open the camera in low light, you can see that there's more light in the frame than there actually is in the room. My daughter has a 5MP camera phone with a flash, and the Lumia actually took better pictures in our fairly dark living room. The pictures had comparable light levels, but hers were washed out from the flash in some areas.-The processor speed doesn't look impressive, but it's a good match for the OS. Everything opens very quickly, way faster than on my Androids (I did have cheap Androids, but this phone is also cheap.)-The sound quality from the speaker is very good. I mean, it's still a speaker on a phone, but I find the music listenable on it, which has not been the case with any of my previous phones. It can also get surprisingly loud, both for media and calls. (It also has an FM radio.)-It will read your texts to you. You can set it to do this all the time or just when you have a headset connected. When you turn on this feature and a text message arrives, the phone will ask whether you would like to hear or ignore the message. After you listen to the message, it will ask you whether you'd like to reply. It is a completely hands-free experience and it does an excellent job. Even when my daughter sent me texts with made up words, the reading was flawless. The dictation of my spoken texts was also excellent.-Word prediction when typing is outstanding. It will often accurately predict the next word before I've even typed the first letter of that word. Example - I typed \"Are you working tonight? I have an extra...\" and it offered \"ticket\" as an option before I had typed the 't.'-The media app is great, and I find it much better than Google Music. It's really easy to access both music and videos. I had trouble with video playback on Android.-The GPS works great. It seems functionally equivalent to Google Maps. It's a little more customizable and the settings are easier to access. It has a \"find my car\" feature to locate your car in a garage. This sounds really cool, but I haven't tried it.-When you tap the phone tile to make a call, the first view is of your call history, rather than the dial pad. At first, I thought that was stupid, but in reality, I most often call people who have recently called me or who are always near the top of the call history list. Plus, you can create tiles on the home screen for your most frequent contacts and call them from there, or you can click the \"people\" tile to go straight to your contact list. It actually is rare for me to need the dial pad to dial a number, so it makes sense not to have it be the first thing you see.-You can set the phone to automatically silence when it's placed glass-down.-You can tether without additional software (I think Metro PCS charges $5 a month to do so, though.)-The kids' corner feature seems cool - you can set it up so that your kids can only access specified apps. My kid is too old to need this, but a few years ago I'd have found it very useful.-It doesn't include all of the 'bloatware' commonly found on Android phones.Things I don't like:-You can't set separate volume levels for different functions like you can on android. There is a single volume level for everything.-Some of the apps are not as good. I've found apps to replace all of my favorites on Android, but a couple of them aren't as good.-There isn't an \"official\" (Google-produced) Gmail app. The biggest problem with this is that you can't get push notifications for Gmail accounts. The shortest interval available for checking Gmail is every 15 minutes. I found an app that claimed to resolve this (but not in its free version). The app was so slow and laggy that I didn't want to pay to find out if it worked. UPDATE: This issue is resolved in Windows 8.1 and I now get instant notification of new gmail messages.Overall, I'm very happy with this phone - both the hardware and Windows - and highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "works well", "Author": "Turi", "ReviewID": "RG3HUSEDFX2WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "not sure why there are less than positive reviews.

This phone is my 6th phone with their service not because I was unsatisfied but that I wanted to get to a new level of satisfaction so each phone was an upgrade from a previous one and with no contract its easy to breathe when that bill time comes around because there are no hidden fees. I have had no major problems with their services or coverage areas. This phone is beautiful in every way. I am a team Android player but android lacks unity within the phones and each one differs as far as upgrades and features. I was scared to get this windows phone because of the lack of knowledge and the rumors saying that it was a one trick phone like the iPhone. SO...I mad the decision to try it out and I love it. I still use my android phone like a camera and media input device because some applications on that phone are not available on the windows phone just yet. So I use my windows phone for the unity of the messaging so there will be no outside application that I need to download to keep all my messages in one place. The support for customers is phenomenal and I love the fact of having office on this phone for those last minute class assignments. I love the fact that my email account is also connected to my skydrive which is wonderful in itself.

Sipos", "ReviewID": "R3H31Y68O1JXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't need the latest, highest-tech cell phone. I hate cell phones. Early this century, I bought the cheapest flip phone -- black & white, no camera -- that I could find, and kept it till 2011. I only made calls once or twice a year -- seriously -- and gave my number to no one, so no one could call my cell phone. I prefer landlines and email. I've never texted in my life.After a billing dispute with Verizon in 2011 concerning their broadband wireless card, I canceled all my Verizon wireless accounts, cell phone included. So I've not had any cell phone for over two years. I didn't miss it.But now I might do some heavy traveling (within the U.S.), so I decided to finally get a smart phone, so I could have GPS, internet, and email in my new cities.After my experience with Verizon, I knew I wanted a flat rate plan. I initially got an Android flat rate phone at Staples, but it was more complicated than I cared to figure out, so I returned it. Then I saw this Nokia uses Windows. I've used Windows on my laptops since 1996, so I figured it'd be easy.This Nokia -- with the MetroPCS flat rate plan -- turned out to be a good choice for the cell phone hater in me. It's easy to figure out -- important for those who've never used a smart phone. You can download an easy-to-understand PDF manual from their website.I've yet to download an \"app\", but the ones that came with the Nokia are useful. A GPS that locates where I am -- quick and easy and accurate. Another GPS that provides all nearby mass transit options, schedules, and routes -- very useful if visiting a new city. Another GPS that locates nearby restaurants, tourists sites, etc.There's a Weather Channel app which is easy to use (though not always accurate -- once the app told me there was 0% chance of rain where I was -- even as I was holding an umbrella to keep the pouring rain off my Nokia.)There's a free Angry Birds app, with free Angry Birds movies. I had no idea what Angry Birds was. I learned on Wikipedia that it's a video game. Luckily, it was easy to delete, movies and all.It's easy to connect this Nokia to my laptop, and transfer MP3 podcasts and MP4 movies onto it. (I've not tried other formats.)I have not tried to download podcasts or movies directly onto the Nokia.I find the touch screen to be bright and sharp, with good color saturation (though admittedly, it's my first smart phone, so I've nothing to compare it to).The Nokia's still camera and video camera are easy to use. The images are okay, not that great -- nowhere near as good as the images from my Sony Cybershot, which is 3 years older. But I don't suppose a smart phone's camera can be expected to match that of a dedicated digital camera.Some reviewers have complained that the Nokia's camera lacks a flash. This is true. But then, I didn't get a cell phone to use as a camera.The MetroPCS plan I signed on for is $40 a month, all taxes and fees included. So far, that's been the case. Payment is easy. I log onto their website (via my laptop), and easily find where to pay another $40 for another month. I like that I can control when and how much I pay -- unlike my past experience with Verizon, with their unexpected charges.Since the MetroPCS plan is flat fee, I sometimes use my Nokia instead of my landline. I've had some problems there. Three times I called the post office, and when I finally got through (average wait, 50 minutes), I was disconnected shortly after I began speaking to the postal rep. I wonder if this was the post office's fault, or if my face brushed some part of the Nokia's touch screen that caused it to hang up.I used the Nokia's speaker phone option while the post office put me on hold. So yes, this phone has a speaker phone.The only catch in MetroPCS's plan is that, while phone and text are unlimited, if your data use goes over a certain amount during the month (I forget how much -- 500 MB, I think), then the data speed lowers from 4G to 3G. But I don't download much data, so it's not an issue for me. I mainly got this phone for emergencies when I travel.Not the highest-tech phone -- no flash, so-so camera -- but a cheap, HONEST rate plan, and easy to use for those already familiar with Windows.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not like it at all", "Author": "M.

I've always bought GooglePlay phones, but I saw a cheap nice looking phone that was different from any other phone I've had, so I went on and bought it. Not even 2 weeks after I bought it it started powering off by itself. All the brand new cool apps that everybody has, windows takes forever to get! Like literally four months. Instead they'll give u some knockoff apps that constantly closes down and freezes up! (for instance instead of instagram, windows has instance.. or 6tag, and they are not great, they suffice.) Four months later when they finally upgraded to instagram it was not even worth taking up space in my phone. It had so many technical problems. I stuck with 6tag. With a windows phone or at least the Lumia 521, you are not able to block certain calls or send certain people straight to voicemail.. I've always had that option with my other phones!
