I dropped this phone (in it's case) on a dirt road and (to my horror) watched a full size pick-up truck run over the phone.

I had a screen protector on it and that is a little scratched up, but other than that you would never know it was in an accident.  The case is in rougher shape (tire tracks and dents/scratches from the dirt road) but it cost less than $10 so I won't mind replacing that.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "brenskopf", "ReviewID": "R3H90EJYQ8YX44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome.

I like the phone in itself so far.  Going from a smartphone to a basic phone with features will take a little getting used to.  But as a basic phone, this phone does have a lot of great smartphone features that is part of the package.I only am giving it four stars because when I opened the phone to install the battery, the battery package showed that I had been given a \"re-conditioned\" battery that was last tested in \"August, 2011\".  I was surprised and angry but since Amazon did the fulfillment for the sale, I immediately wrote to them and asked for a new battery.  An apology came back telling me I could either get a full refund or they would refund my account a certain percentage of the cost.  I wrote back and asked why I could not just get a new battery.  Amazon fulfillment apologized again for the mishap and made me the same offer explaining that the seller, Cell-source, has inventory that is changing constantly.  So I guess Cell-source doesn't have any more \"new\" batteries!  Based on their name, I would have assumed they should have all different kinds of accessories.  I am accepting the partial refund from Amazon because I need the phone and don't want to go through all that work of trying to find another one.  Please understand that I realize it is not Amazon's fault but the seller.Do not buy anything from \"Cell-Source\" since according to Amazon, their inventory is constantly changing.  That means, they can't back up anything that you may buy from them.UPDATE:  I have decided to return the phone.  Too many small feature hangups.  The phone kept locking my keypad and then asking me to unlock it.  I could not find any information on how to shut it off.  I couldn't get online with Samsung and AT&T; was of no use.  Wasted too much time on line trying to figure how to fix it.  I spent 2 different hours on the phone over 2 days to try to get AT&T; to help me.Basically as a general phone, I'm sure it is a good phone but it just wasn't for me.

I bought this phone FOUR years ago for my daughter for \"stay in touch\" at school, etc. I don't want a data plan when all she does is use it for texting, and a few calls. Reception is fine.

Sturdy phone - still in perfect shape after all this time. The battery finally died this week.  Four years later.After exhaustive researching, it seems evident AT&T; is forcing us all into data plans by offering the crappiest QUEWTY models available. The only 2 they offer have scathing reviews.

This was my first official non-Tracphone and I got it for my freshman year of college : ) It worked perfectly for me and I had it for about 4 years before I started experiencing problems with it. It seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when I flip it up. This was fine, I just taped it shut, but then I couldn't text or call numbers I didn't already have in my contacts. I read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it, but I decided getting the phone I was familiar with was worth the risk. Long story short I ordered this phone, was super excited that it was new and still in its box, and put my old SIM card in it. This new phone does not charge the batteries. I have used the charger it came with, and 2 of my other chargers and it just does not charge.. it says it is charging but as soon as I unplug it, it goes back to \"low batterie.\" It is not the end of the world though, I have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one. It is a bit of a hassle, especially for long phone calls, but it is worth it too me to have the phone I want. I am sure when this one dies or I get sick of it I will probably upgrade to a better phone, but for now I am happy with it : )", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "As described, promt shipping", "Author": "Cheryl Carolan", "ReviewID": "R8GKW564IHNY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good phone, slipped the ATT sim card and off it went!

The sad thing about it is that I purchased it with the sole intention of transferring my pictures and videos from the old samsung strive to the new one. AT&T; assisted me with this undertaking.What happened was that because the phone had a defect, years and years worth of pictures and videos were lost. I have not been able to retrieve them at all. I am so broken hearted over this because they were pictures and videos I had intended to put on a DVD for the sake of preserving history. Now they are gone and my phone is gone. But I love the Samsung Strive more than anyother phone I have ever used. Would love to have another one. Amazon should replace my phone free of charge, for sending me a defective phone and for it losing my precious photo and video treasures. They are irreplaceable...In addition, the phone you sent was supposed to be new, at least that is what I was told over the phone but when I received it, it clearly stated on the box that it had been refurbishedApparently, the quality control inspector missed this one!!!! Does Amazon HAVE a Quality Control Inspector? All I know is that this was my very first order with Amazon but now am reluctant to order anything else and I really need that SAMSUNG STRIVEOne that is not defective. The Samsung Strive is the phone I know and am the most comfortable with. I have a disability and this phone works best for me. I have tried other phones but nothing compares to the Samsung Strive. Please send me another one. But please have someone check it out before you send it to make sure IT isn't defective too. Do the \"RIGHT\" thing and foot the bill it is only fair. I'm lost without that phone...There are other products I want to order but again, am hesitant. You do right by me on this and I may reconsider.Thank you,Sheryl A.
