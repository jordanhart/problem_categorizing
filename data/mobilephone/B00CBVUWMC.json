This is not true. Luckily I got a refund. Why would I want to wait for the mail when I can go to the store or buy elsewhere and get instantly.

Therfore you never know if they are accurately deducting your minutes.  I ran a test on my mother's phone (she has the prepaid account too) and noticed they kept deducting a ton of minutes even though she only made a few one minute calls a month on average.I ended up switching to a 1000 minute plan being that I tend to make more calls and only about 2gb of data rather than 4gb.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not 10\u00a2 minute anymore", "Author": "Use The Force", "ReviewID": "R2DVWGCGV1ED5U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't purchase from this seller (you can get these anywhere for $30. Walgreens, grocery store, wherever...)But T-mobile only gives you 160 minutes for the $30 card. It used to be 10\u00a2 a min no matter which refill card you used. Now you only get 10\u00a2 min if you buy the $100 refill card.Guess I need to change companies again. That was the only reason I had kept T-mobile this long.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "R2FTACCW1VJ0P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it came a bit different then i was thinking about. it came with the code on a piece of paper, but it worked", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "It brings me a surprise.", "Author": "Xia S.", "ReviewID": "RJZ8IOZJKB13A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got to America  two weeks ago.
