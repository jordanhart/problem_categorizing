I'm stuck with buying older versions of phones. This phone I believe is very close to the latest technology out there and I don't have to pay thru the nose for a huge monthly bill. I am very satisfied with this phone. The camera is great on it, it has a flash and gives great quality photos, the screen is very responsive and what I like the most is that it has a huge screen compared to the other phones I've had for the same price. The screen is the same size as a Samsung Galaxy 2. The software is current too. I paid 130 bucks for this and it's worth every penny.I will never get a iPhone since they have nothing more to offer than a name. The Droid X has just as much as the Apple for a quarter of the price and you don't have to pay thru the nose every month to own it.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone. Hardware home keys concerns.", "Author": "James Anderson", "ReviewID": "R23YOS6VUUX9ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had the phone for over a year now.  Everyone said it was too big at 4.3  inches.  But now large seems to be more beautiful.My concern is with the physical home keys.  The menu, home, back and search keys are all physical.  They are going to wear out before my contract is up.  Better to get sofware home keys in my opinion.The phone has hardly ever failed to install and run well the new apps in the market. Thus it is plenty powerful to keep up with the more demanding apps coming out for newer devices.  For instance, Jan2012 I installed the new Monoply game from the market. There were many cautionary tales in the app comments about the game needing a powerful phone, etc..  But the DroidX came through and rendered the game very well.  It compared favorably to the install and game operation on my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.I recommend the phone.  Just be easy on button use. Battery.  Ahhh.  Dont expect miracles.  Normal use shoud be fine. I purchased extra 2 batteries and 2 chargers. I use the phone alot.  Some days I have to swap batteries 2 or 3 times. When I go out I stick 2 of the little suckers in my pocket.  I use a silicone cover on the DroidX, easy to take off to swap batteries.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than the newer model (Droid X2)", "Author": "AccioFirebolt", "ReviewID": "R3J1P5AXWRSMNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is my favorite phone I've ever had. I bought a used one a couple months ago and I loved it so much, when my upgrade came up, I chose the X2 over the new Droids and Rzr phones.The X2 cannot compare to the X. It is cheaply made and it worked just like the X. So I ended up returning the X2 and kept the X. The battery cover on the X2 broke of into the phone causing malfunctions.If you are thinking of buying the X2, don't do it. Keep the X you have or buy the X over the X2.It is very fast moving from app to app, fast internet even on 3g, and because of its larger size, the touch keyboard isn't that bad at all and I'm starting to get the hang of it. It is larger than an iPhone but smaller than the Samsung Note.It rarely freezes up or restarts itself. In fact, I can't remember it freezing up one time since I had it. I previously had a Droid2 and Droid2 Global and both would regularly freeze and/or restart itself.I have dropped it twice with a silicone cover and it didn't damage it at all.I highly recommend this phone even over the X2.Here is a cheap case that offers great protection and is easy to take on and off to change battery:OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for Motorola DROID X 2 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Okay for a quick replacement. :/", "Author": "Anestacia", "ReviewID": "R3PQD9J8RF4793", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone on November 7, 2013 and I am now replacing it today April 13, 2014 (so seven months).

I have had 2 different android phones and an iPhone. The Droid X has proved to be superior than all of these. The best thing about android phones is that you can update the operating system from the phone. On the Droid, the updates are quick and offer great new features. Every time I have tried to update other android phones I lost apps and sometimes they crashed my phone. The phone is also very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have gotten it wet and the phone still works perfectly. The 8 megapixel camera takes great videos and photos.  The app market offers every app you could possibly want and is quickly catching up to the iPhone market. All the apps that I use, which range from games to business tools, tend to start up quickly and run smooth.Although every once in awhile the app will freeze or force close but those problems get fixed in a few weeks. The only real app that I have problems with is the camera. The camera takes a good 10-30 seconds to boot up and I tend to accidentally snap a picture before I am ready. Another complaint with the phone is that it does not vibrate for messages when on silent mode and this causes me to miss many texts and emails. I have read numerous tutorials and my own knowledge to get this fixed but I still can't get it  to work after 4 months! When it is not on silent mode the speaker is loud and is great to listen to music from.Overall it is a great phone. I would recommend this product to people that aren't great with technology and those who embrace it like myself.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Choose your seller carefully... This is a Great PHONE", "Author": "P. Stubbs", "ReviewID": "RWUPRV78JNHG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DROID XI have purchased 4 of these, 1 was returned (it worked just fine, but it was not new).**Certain sellers sell this phone brand new in factory sealed condition** --beware of the sellers that don't. (just click on the \"used and New from $$$$\" link under \"more buying choices\" to choose a seller).___CALL QUALITY___AVoices over the phone are clear.The microphone filters background noise well.The speaker phone works well (sometimes with a noticeable increase in background noise on the other end).The proximity sensor turns the screen on and off when you put the phone to your ear.Using the speaker phone, the screen will stay on until the display times-out.  If you use the power-button to end phone calls option, you will be unable to turn the screen back on during a speaker phone conversation without ending your call (as long as you don't enable the \"power-button ends phone calls\" option this is not a problem).___Screen___A-The display is bright, clear, large, not easily scratched, and easy on the eyes from almost any angle.  The ambient light sensor correctly adjusts the screen brightness from 20-100% to save battery power (if you want the display to dim lower than 20% you will need to use manual mode... the built-in Android power control widget makes this simple).___Battery___AThe battery lasts all day long.The battery is removable (!!!)There is a built-in lever which pops out the battery (no more broken fingernails trying to pry a battery out of the case).Nothing extends the life of a phone like a replaceable battery.___Camera___B+ (better than the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3)Autofocus works well, you can even use the touch screen to change focus modes.The dual-action shutter (1/2 press to focus, full press to shoot) works just like a real camera!The dual-led flash is a poor replacement for a xenon flash (but way better than no flash at all) but since it also serves as a dual-led flashlight (which is quite bright) I am not complaining too loudly.The cameras photos and HD videos are acceptable, and quite good most of the time.The camera's auto setting works well in most situations, but you will need to use the other settings for action shots, macro focus, etc......When compared to point and shoot digital cameras from 10 years ago this really shines, and from that sense it preserves and captures memorable moments very well!...Although it pales in comparison to our modern (and expensive) dedicated camera we usually use our Droid X phones (this was not the case for some other phones we have had).___Android 2.3.4 \"Gingerbread\" OS___A-The Android flavour this phone uses is great.  There is very minimal bloat.Motorola includes \"profile\" support so you can switch screen layouts between home and work and other.Google is very well integrated right out of the box.  We have a family google account we use on all of our devices so that when one family member adds a contact or calendar event, all of our phones are likewise updated (and we don't have to pay for the same app multiple times... buy it once and install it on every device).There are some really useful features that are missing from Gingerbread (like a running application menu) so a supported OS upgrade from Motorola would have been nice.___Connectivity___AMicroSD - the phones came with an additional 2GB MicroSD card, which worked fine, but were replaced with larger capacity versions (16 & 32GB).  If you plan on using your phone as a dedicated camera/mp3/video recorder/player the option to expand your memory is simply crucial.WIFI - is another must have.  It does not seem to overly drain the battery, but provides much greater data speeds than 3G without using up your data plan.  There are plenty of built-in optionsGPS - The dedicated GPS works independant of the cellular tracking system, and is much more robust.  It integrates with google maps very well, eliminating the need for constant map updates.  It is not however, a replacement device for my Garmin (which has much more features)MicroHDMI - this enables a Doc Interface which is actually quite useful.___Durability___(a/b?)No durability concerns.The metal encased display is particularly solid.The texture and size and weight of this phone make it less likely to be dropped than others I have had.  The phone is very solid, so I do not recommend a solid plastic case, but the softer TPU Gel cases work well to cushion the phone when dropped.________OVERALL________AA++This is the best phone for your money right now if you want to use the Verizon Network.  Motorola has gotten a lot of things right with this phone... Stellar Product!

Overall I have been pretty happy with the phone. The sound quality and reception is not as good as my old phone, but is not bad. The phone has plenty of memory for apps and runs the well with occasional freezing or force closes. Sometimes the freezing seems random. There are a ton of great apps and games that are free. The phone comes with some useful apps, but does have some useless bloat ware that you cannot remove.Phone is easy to operate. The only thing negative that I have to say would be the sound volume and camera. The sound volume is not very loud and the speaker is not very clear. This isn't an issue with games, but not very convenient for listening to music or ringtones. Since ringtones are not loud, it can be tough to hear phone ring if there is any ambient noise around.  My only other complaint is the camera is slow to open when trying to take quick pics and when leaving the settings on automatic, tend to not come out well. It records video well.Overall it is a pretty good phone and I prefer if over some other android phones I have used.Update: The problem with pictures not coming out well has to do with the lens having any oil or dust on it. The lens is very sensitive. The pixel quality of the pics is very good, but colors are not as good as other phones.lately they phone loses signal or 3G service alot. Pain when trying to play games like hanging with friends.

My original was the best phone I've ever owned and the new 1 is shaping up exactly the same. It's not the fastest or best phone out there right now but it is rock solid and reliable. Verizon has capped it at Android version 2.3.4 but 99% of all apps run on it without issue and the phone has enough RAM and internal storage for loads of them.  The performance is steady and reliable solid graphics keep you going with videos and games.  The antenna is top notch and it keeps up reception wise and speed wise with the iPhone 3 and 4 though the 4s picks up the processor end enough to beat it out.  Still I spent almost every day with my blue tooth connected and Pandora or Amazon mp3 streaming all day at work.  Not to mention emails, web browsing, and facebook.  The battery isn't the best out there but spares are cheap on Amazon and I always carry 2 with me plus a car charger.

Box has many scratches on it, and when I opened the box, above items were missing. There was warranty booklet, and it has several wrinkles on it which tells this one is definitely a combination of different used parts. If you buy a new phone, everything should be in clean and pristine condition. No wrinkles on your manual booklet !!!MOST IMPORTANTLY, the inside of battery cover has several black fingerprints and black marks. Maybe dirty hand tried to fake the used phone with some poor craftsmanship into a new one, but no, you can't fool customers like that. I took a photo of this fingerprint. Hope I can post it on the item webpage so that no one should be fooled by this vendor. Plus, the battery seems it's recycled one.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R2OBA80V5SROV1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone, purchased from Cellphone Zone but fullfilled by Amazon arrived in two days as promised by Amazon Prime and was packed in a sealed box that appears to be a Motorola although country of origin does not show up.  Funny, the label on the box said \"new\" which is what it was supposed to be but is unusual on a product box.  The phone was packed with a battery, bud earphones and a wall charger, all appearing new but lacking any brand identification.  After charging the battery I took the phone to be activated for my Page Plus service.  After starting home I attempted to make a calll and noticed that a display kept flashing onto the screen constantly, making it very hard to dial.  Later this when trying to use other features of the phone, a bouncing display, different one this time kept appearing.  I returned to the store where I had taken the phone to be activated and had them take a look at it.  They told me that the left hand key at the bottom of the phone was jammed on, although not due to the key itself, which still functions.  They then examined the phone closely and compared it to an original Motorola Droid X and advised that I had a chinese knock-off of the real thing, nicely made and probably containing some real parts.  The clues:  The seal visable under the battery had been removed and was not glued down and no manufacturer's label on the right where it's supposed to be next to the label with the seriel number.  Also the little round dot below the slot for the memory card was white, not red as in the real Motorola.  Also the battery was the correct size but without the Motorola Logo or name, conclusion, not a real Motorola battery.  The phone's outer case and screen appear new.  I don't think the phone had been activated before. I don't know if it is a totally new knock off or one with both knock-off and real Motorola parts.  Bottom line:  the phone is not a real Motorola Droid X as built by Motorola and has a built in flaw due to an internally sticking key.  If it didn't have the flaw, it probably would have worked fine.  Another reason to buy from Amazon, even if it costs a little more.The bad news, I have spent money, gas and time on this phone to no benifit.

I added a memory manager and it now scrolls ever so smoothly.Also added a case (Otter) because it is not an easy phone to hold - large,(YES!) thin and square. The case makes it easy and protects your investment. Probably the worst thing I can say about the Droid X it is the video recorder. The camera is fine. The the video is vanilla.

Otherwise we were just on a basic phone plan).  Since my contract period wasn't up yet (my parents were with Verizon just like us so our contract periods carried over), I needed to purchase either a used phone or find an older style phone to use that was brand new.  Not even 2 weeks after I received this phone the power button sort of broke so that it didn't pop out again.  I was still able to turn the phone on and off on my own, but I REALLY had to press on it and hold it down for a couple of seconds.  I could've sent it back to the seller but they would've just fixed my phone and mailed it back to me and I really didn't want to go through the hassle of being without a phone and sending it back.  So I kept it because really, I'm not that picky about phones.  After a couple of months, my phone stopped letting me add/delete contacts.  Pretty soon after that, it wouldn't even let me click on a contact's name to see their information.  Anytime I tried, it just returned to the home screen.  If I wanted to make a call, I had to first pretend like I was creating a new text message, then I had to copy their number and call it, or attempt to use the voice command service to say that I wanted to call a specific person, but sometimes that would back out on me as well.  I also had some other issues with the camera not saving the pictures correctly.  It would say that it took the picture but when I went in to view it, it had said that it wasn't a viewable file.  SOMETIMES it would magically work again after I restarted my phone but there was definitely a good 6-8 week period that I wasn't able to get my camera to work at all.  I'm still not sure what finally got it to work.  Anyway, I purchase this phone last year in April and I now have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and its MUCH better!  My husband got so sick of watching me attempt to do something as simple as make a call.  I thought it was pretty funny....in a really annoying sort of way.

I'm not sure if the processor is slow, or if the operating system is poorly written, but apps run much slower on this phone than they did with the HTC.My second biggest complaint is the battery life. I currently have the setting on maximum battery life, which turns off all data after 15 minutes of inactivity. When that works, its fine, but sometimes it doesn't and I will get 4 hours on a charge. At a minimum I have to charge the phone twice a day with lower use, and 3 times with more. The HTC usually gave me a whole day.One thing I like about the phone is the memory.

Love the clear sharp screen images and photos from the wonderful 8.0 mp camera.  Sound quality is great.  The battery lasts at least all day to a few days depending on how much I use it and what settings and features I am using.  I Love the swipe option for typing.  I'm in my mid 50's and any phone style that I've never used before for a while is difficult for me to navigate till I get used to it's phones features and icons.  For me it was the smart, practical choice since, I love this phone,  am used to it, have all it's accessories and just popped in my old Sim card making it an easy choice to order an exact replacement.  I was careful to order a Verizon compatible phone so I could just log onto my Verizon acct. clicked on the menu option \"Replace or Switch Phone\".

It even fell off the top of my house and survived! This phone should have been built ALOT better to take at least a TWO FOOT DROP onto a wooden surface. I really like the phone and its features but I will NOT be getting another Droid X since it is about impossible for anyone to NEVER drop their phone. I need a more rugged phone that wont break so easily.

They gave me enough of a credit and told me directly to purchase a certain used Droid X. This Droid X just failed after only a couple of months of use (conveniently past the return date of course), with half the screen no longer functional.

After updating the OS to 2.3.3 the camera basically stopped working. It either deletes the photo I've just taken or saves corrupted photos 90% of the time and the pictures are grainy and of poor quality. Sometimes it saves over other photos in my gallery! Total FAIL. This also is the second Droid X I've had, the first one stopped working so I got a warranty replacement (The first one had the same problem with the images too). OS. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy any Motorola phone. Motorola phones are of poor quality.

The processing power on this Droid is so weak that all its capabilities fail to be enjoyed.  Don't count on this phone to record and save photos and videos.  Every once in a while, my pictures and videos become corrupted.  A lot of people say it's just a bad sd, but I've replaced it and this problem persisted.Constantly slow.  Lagging, locking and freezing is what you'll get from this phone.  On my first call, this thing froze and I could make a call.  Seriously, this smartphone couldn't make a simple phone.  I had service and nothing was being working in the background, and the only way to get it to respond was a real hard resent... opening the back panel and remove the battery and put it back.Forget it.  Wait until it's cheaper or get something else.I can assume that's why Motorola release the Droid X2... it's cause the original one was too weak in it's processing.Also, I mentioned tradition.  I know several people with the original Droid and mentioned how quickly the quality diminish.  Not by better, newer technology advancements.  No.  If you Google the problems of the phone, you'll noticed that the smartphone had a deteriating problem for it's cameras.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "1st I was (ARGGH) then I was :)", "Author": "D.

One day though it just wouldn't turn on no matter what I did. I called both my carrier (Verizon) and Motorola, and found out I was ONE DAY, over my warranty expired. Verizon was nice enough to replace it with a \"pre-owned\" replacement phone. Again, THREE DAYS after my warranty expired, there were black lines or blacked out pixels all over my screen. (This also happened to my brother who has the same phone, but usually his goes back to normal after a few days.) The blacked out lines wouldn't go away though, so I had to replace my phone again. This week my phone got the same black lines over it that wouldn't go away. Again, this was NINE DAYS after my warranty expired. I had a horrible time with Motorola's customer service as the woman was very rude and inadequately educated about the product and the proceeds at Motorola. I will never buy from Motorola again because of their poorly designed products. I take very careful care of my phones, but they still managed to break.
