Here is what worked for me:Hit Wifi buttonTurn Wifi on (blue button lit up)Should recognize your personal network then turn it on (blue button lit up)Hit your personal network button (mine was belkin) and scroll down. Enter requested info: Security Code, IP/DNS Setting (change this setting from AUTOMATC to STATIC), IP Addy, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and Primary DNS.The IP Addy, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway & Primary DNS can be found by going to your device (computer, tablet etc.) that already connects to your wifi. Go start menu. In the run box type cmd (enter) black screen comes up type ipconfig/all (enter)All the info you need is THERE!!! Type it into your phone.Pls NOTE::::: The IP Addy needs to be changed. The last number should be increased by one number for example if the last number is 5 change it to 6. I continued to get a \"unknown host\" in the browser until I did that! Why? don't ask, it works!Once all info is input save and go to the browswer to get out on internet. MAKE SURE THE BLUE WIFI SIGNAL IS ON BEFORE YOU HIT THE BROWSER!!!! Otherwise you will be charged minutes. To date I have not been charged anything - LOVE IT!Another thing I encountered while on the internet is that my fav pages wouldnot load because they were to big. I downloaded Opera Mini7.1 which provided me a much better internet browsing experience. I've checked my yahoo mail, browsed the internet with ease and success. I'm no computer guru so if IIIII can figure this out ANYONE can. With that said I encourage yall to try this or use your own discovery methods to see if you can get your personal wifi working with this phone. You might be pleasantly surprised.I'm currently looking to find out about directly streaming from radio stations. If anyone comes up with a soluction, pls share. I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I wanted to share the success and of course I know others would have done the same!

Battersby", "ReviewID": "R1HXPZ4MPPGD2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Tracfone.  I stepped down from a AT&T; smart phone because spending $200 a month on cell service just bothered me.  Do I miss some of the functionality -- absolutely.  Do I miss it $2400 worth a year.  No.  With the triple minutes bonus I think I've cut my cell phone bill annually by $2000.  Well worth it.This phone was easy to set up.  It joined my wifi network on the first try.  That makes the web surfing portion more manageable because it doesn't use the Tracfone minutes when attached to a wifi.  I was able to export my contacts from my Droid into the Tracfone -- took two tries. The texting keyboard is actually better than the smart phone.  The touch screen is very responsive and it's big enough for older eyes. That battery life is incredible.  I was used to charging my smart phone every night.  This thing runs for days on one charge.  I did use the music player a couple of times and that does shorten the battery life a bit.Initially I set up all of my email accounts on this phone, but the quantity of mail I receive makes it impractical to pick them all up here as Tracfone charges .3 minutes for every message.  It was going to be expensive when I was away from my house.  Now I'm picking up only my business mail and that works great! The message here is the phone of capable of multiple email accounts but you might not want to do that for cost reasons.There are very good instructions on the internet for setting up the features and importing documents.  I've downloaded a couple of applications, but the java apps are much slower than what I was used to with the iPhone.  So I haven't much use for those.Over all I'm thrilled to be saving a lot of money this year with very little inconvenience.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok phone but not happy with the limitations by tracfone", "Author": "Caligirl", "ReviewID": "R2IX8BB10CZZOY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone seems to work fine as a phone.  I paid for a more up to date phone though, where I could get gps if I needed, get online for coupons if I needed etc.  I do not plan to use it a lot for these services but I did want to be able to have access if needed.  To access these services though, requires quite a few credits being deducted.  I have full coverage in my area so connection is not an issue, but the phone seems to run slow.  It takes longer to find a web page than I think it should.  My son has ATT which is also the source of the service for this phone and his is much faster.  He also pays a monthly data plan so that could be why.  I just assumed, if we are accessing the same service, he paying a monthly fee and Im using minutes purchased through tracphone...that it would be the same.  It just seems to run slow period.  Tracphone makes you go online on your phone to purchase the ringtone and whatever else you want to personalize it.  I don't know, maybe I am expecting too much for a no contract phone.  I have used tracphone for several years and been happy with my other phone.  I just wanted to upgrade a bit so I could access coupons or gps if I got lost.  As much as it costs in units, I don't think I will use it for that now either.It seems to be a sturdy little phone.  Its solid.  Definitely heavier than my older tracphone.  The screen dims fairly quickly unless you are touching something on the screen.  It has the regular apps on it, calculator, tip calculator, camera, music player, tasks, contacts, etc.  Its ok.  Glad I got it on a triple minute sale plan.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a real smartphone", "Author": "Michael Hahn \"x\"", "ReviewID": "R351FSNUTL2BEH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The LG 840G (LG840G) does not have--and cannot be upgraded with--an application to block spam calls and messages. You can't even upgrade the phone by downloading a very simple application that permits you to block unwanted text messages. With the LG840G, whenever you get a text message, you have to open it and read it before you can determine who it is from. If it is a spam message, you have no way of blocking that person (or spam robot) from sending you more spam text messages.Most phones do come with the ability to recognize who is sending you a text message, and the ability to block messages from unknown contacts. In fact, the previous version of Trac Phone (the LG 800G) actually DID have a feature that permits recognition of who a text message is from, and the ability to block phone numbers from unknown contacts (spammers). My suspicion is that TracFone deliberately did not add a text message blocking feature for the LG840G because they do not want you to be able to block spam calls and messages. This missing basic feature will cost you a lot of wasted air time answering calls or opening text messages to see who they are from--only to find out it is another spam. Moreover, such an application is very simplistic and would be a very simple add-on application for a a Java programmer to write. But since this basic application is (STILL) not a feature of this phone, it is probably an intentional way for TracPhone to rip off people who own the LG840G by permitting them to receive countless spam calls and messages.Too bad that TracFone does not sell a Android smartphone that can have air time replenished by buying airtime cards. Smartphones with the Android are very popular because teh Android operating system permits access to thousands of FREE applications to download. Many people would drop their contracted monthly subscriber phones for a smart phone that can be replenished with air time cards.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my NEEDS...enough for my WANTS", "Author": "E. Gelasi", "ReviewID": "R1K587YWVZKGC3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using a \"smartphone\" on a family plan for several years and paying what amounted to be about $200 a month (along with 2 family members) I decided I didn't really use a phone that much after all. My total voice minutes amounted to an average of 100 minutes a month or less (text was almost non-existent) and I was using the smartphone for web browsing and email checking when I was already at home or in an area that had wifi.So I \"cut the cord\" and took my phone off the family plan and saved about $40 a month right off the top!This phone is the one that makes Tracfone viable because I can use it to check email or web surf (a little crudely implemented software, hence the 4 stars instead of 5) either on wifi OR through Tracfone (where it cost me minutes).The phone has some useful \"apps\" like alarm clock and calendar. You can text with it (each text in or out costs you a third of a minute). The camera is only 2 megapixels so I only expect to use it in a pinch.I have had this for about a month and used about 100 minutes so I am very happy with my decision. I let my budget dictate what I want to spend on phone use and this is the best thing going for my needs. I suspect there are plenty of people out there who don't use a lot of voice minutes or texting (or only use it \"because it's there\") and could save a LOT of money.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Happy With It - Just Wanted to Write a Review", "Author": "Robert R.

After researching several phones & plans, picked the LG 840G through Amazon with Tracfone plan.  I'm pretty sharp, but not your hi tech type guy either.  Couldn't possibly be more pleased!My needs: having a laptop, web searching wasn't a priority, although it does that well too.  I reside in a poor reception area based on previous plans and visitors commenting the same. Didn't want constant monthly expenditures & didn't want to spend $600 for a phone.  Didn't want something I had to call my adult \"kids\" asking how does one do XXX?  Well, certainly got what I wanted and more!  So what did I get?First, got the phone in two days. It has great reception, voice clarity even when on the road, is sharp looking and very easy to use.  Txting & all programs are a snap.  Amazon has the same phone for $30 with $20 for a 60 minute Tracfone card, but also has a $49.99 option with phone, charger, manual (very clear) and 600 minutes with triple lifetime minutes!  Tracfone applies 90 days before needing to purchase more minutes & rolls over unused minutes beyond the ninety.  That was such a no brainer and as I said, couldn't possibly be more pleased. The touch screen is great.  Have had it seven days and after initial charge, battery still reading full and love'n the phone more every day.  Sure the camera could have 3 MP instead of two; a flash instead of none, but it takes great pic.s and I do photography as a hobby.  Phone came with a 2GB card installed and compatible with up to a 32 GB card.  Life is good!!!", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Revising my opinion slightly...", "Author": "A.

ADDED: Since writing the review, I have discovered that this phone DOES NOT WORK WITH FORD SYNC. The two systems seem to talk to each other but the phone drops the SYNC connection frequently and does not allow the phone to be used handsfree even when the connection appears to be operating.

LG says Tracphone writes the programs for the phone. Maybe that's why you get triple minutes with this thing. It uses 4 or 5 minutes of your time every day without you even using it.

Smartphones are essentially tiny pc(s) that run on an operating system. This is everything shy of that, no operating system, hence NOT a smartphone. It does play mp3s & mp4 compression rate video. It is not advertised as such but will in fact act as a video player for unencrypted files with the MPEG4 standard @29fps/30fps w/ a 320x240 compression ratio. In lay terms: rip your movies to unencrypt them and use a conversion program to achieve the parameters previosly listed and you can have a video library of your favorite ripped movies or shows. You can expand your sdhc card upto 32gbs! It works out great and as a media player is awesome, making the phone a wothwhile purchase as a media player alone. It has a few quirky things about its operational use- but as a product it outshines nearly all previous Tracfone models in terms of quality and specs.

It's the \"poor-man's smart phone\", and TracFone doesn't lock you into contracts- which is really great. Pay as you go with 90 days of service when you purchase a minutes card, and your minutes roll over! This one comes with a 200 minute card($40 value on its own), which triples upon activation to 600 minutes... and if you activate online, be sure to \"google\" TracFone promo codes as you will get extra minutes! I got 80 extra minutes with the code I found!I don't know how much I will use the internet and wi-fi, but it's nice to have it there if I need it. It has lots of different ring and alarm tones, takes pics and vids(low quality- only 2.5 megapixels), and you can make voice recordings. You can also add music to it, and it will accept up to a 32GB memory card(comes with a 2GB card). Lots of fun features at a very good price.So far, I don't have any complaints about the phone itself. I would recommend getting some sort of protective case or wallet to keep it in nice condition.On the downside... TracFone's customer service is absolutely horrible. If you ever have to call them, expect the following: call center is in another country; you'll have to repeat your problem numerous times; you'll speak to more than one person and repeat the problem to each one of them. Don't use your cell phone to do this as you will end up being on it for 30 minutes to 2 hours- I kid you not. I finally had to call their escalation center to get a very simple issue resolved, and in my book, that is simply unacceptable. Make sure you tell them you want minutes added to your phone for the inconvenience, and they will most likely do it.The other thing that kind of stinks with Tracfone is that you can't make cell-to- cell calls to ALL countries as of yet- in fact, I don't think you can call Great Britain at all. Also, their \"International Neighbors\" service is available only for Mexico. If you just want your cell phone for local calls and calls within the U.S., it's perfectly fine.Other than that, I am happy with the product.One last thing...please remember to be responsible and don't text/talk and drive!  :)", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome lil phone", "Author": "Eb's Mom", "ReviewID": "R15UVC5LV7HY3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone to replace my old phone.

One of neighbors had Tracfones for their family and we lovingly teased them about their lowbrow taste in phones. But they had no complaints and were spending hundreds less each year than we were. So we decided to take a harder look. In the end, we decided it was worth a try and if we didn't like it we could go back to a big carrier and wouldn't have lost anything. The big upside to these phones is price. We have saved a lot of money. These phones have lots of great features and we like to call them our \"almost smart phones\" or our \"not really dumb\" phones. There are a lot of things right about these phones but you can read them on a positive review. And I have to give Tracfone credit, they got all of our phone numbers ported when none of the big carriers were ever able to get that done when we changed. On the downside, my phone has never worked properly. It started off with a \"can't read SIMM card\" or something like that. It took HOURS over DAYS to work with customer service on the phone about the issue and they kept telling me I had tried to alter the phone which I had not. I didn't even know what they were talking about, so I was insulted and annoyed that it was taking so long to get my phone working. Finally, they sent me a new simm card and the phone worked. But I was without a phone for DAYS. I was not happy. Even now, if I drop the phone I get the same message. And I just turn it on and off until it starts working again. I put piece of tape over the simm to keep it from shifting. It is just a mild annoyance now. The other thing that happened is that my phone would never send or receive a picture. At first, I thought I just had a bad signal and should try later. Then I thought the file size was too big. After all of the time I had already spent getting my phone working,  I was not looking forward to calling customer service again. I waited too long and they said that I couldn't get a new phone to replace my phone but they would send me a refurb phone. I had just bought a \"nice, new phone\" and now they wanted to send me a reject from someone else to have trouble with. Again they spent hours on the phone trying to fix the problem remotely. In the end,  I decided I didn't need to send a picture that often. And I kept my shiny, new phone. Things changed and now people want to send me pictures all of the time. The problem is that the phone doesn't tell me who the picture message is from since I can't download it (but I do get time deducted!), so I don't even know who I am ignoring and it has hurt some friend's feelings that I didn't respond...Ok... a few more things. You don't see a name when you get a text, just the phone number (until you go back to the list - then it gives you the name) - I know so few numbers now that my phone stores all of that - that it is a confusing way to get a text.  There are some typing/input issues that bug me but I hear you can download a patch or app or something to fix those. So my phone has been a bust.My husband has found that his work has started calling/texting his cell exclusively over the past year and it is really eating his minutes. This type a plan is no longer going to work for him. So he will change when he runs out of minutes. But had his need for minutes not increased, he would be happy with his phone and his plan.And my teenage daughter thinks the phone is just not current enough for her. --- But she is not paying the phone bill. So she will get more input when she has more money!

My main complaint (Buyers be ware) is that when you call someone, it will deduct 1 whole minute for each call after the 2nd ring, when none answers or no voice mail!!! Also, incoming calls deduct a whole minute or more. It would be nice if Tracfone only deducts you 0.3 minutes for calls that none answers, as long as it the call is less than 30 seconds or 20 seconds.Also, when you text, keep it short and simple, and it will deduct 0.3 minutes. Longer messages it will deduct 0.6 minutes and messages with pictures will deduct a whole minute or two.To get the best of your money: don't call other people you know won't answer (because they are working or at a doctor appointment), and don't have people call you, because all of the above deducts a whole minute or more. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a prepaid cell phone, even for those of us that use it very limited. I will probably get into a whole plan in a matter of months.

My smartphone usage is not as much as I think and this will do the trick for half what I'm paying on contract.  The first time I tried to activate this Tracfone it didn't seem to take.

You need to buy several screen protectors--the first one I messed up putting it on--it's a big deal-to have it dust free and keep it scratch free. The second screen/glare protector scratched while I was learning to open the phone-so I need a couple more-You also need a soft gel type case for the phone to protect it. I got a nice one on Amazon.My  wish is that they had a promo code for use on Tracfone site.Also the camera in this phone is great-but the directions in the booklet are just how to turn it on--so if you are like me, new to the tech world you might need someone to show you advanced features.

Great upgrade! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they need to have a protective case that fits it. This is a big disappointment, but not enough to regret our purchase. Love the size of the screen and the ease of use. Well worth the money. I am now pay ing in a year, what I used to pay in a month for a cell phone.

The large touch keypad, compared to the flip phones, is a great improvement. For a tracfone, you can't get any better.  At triple minutes, this is a great deal.  Now the phone itself. The LG840g has some fundamental flaws.  You get what you pay for ($60 vs $300 for an Android).  In the browser, zoom settings are not persistent. Lanscape/portrait must be set manually and is not persistent. Typically none of the text boxes or button on a web page will work without zooming at least one level.  The touch keys at the bottom of the phone turn off after 10 seconds and there is no way to disable that. The \"widget select\" button at the right above the menu button has no business being there.  Always gets tapped accidently. No way to change the shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. WiFi sucks. I'm 3 feet from the access point and it is not being detected; randomly works.  Watch out because when the browser cannot get a WiFi connection(it's free) it will use 3G and YOUR minutes!  Range is very poor.  No way to secure access to unwanted apps (cannot delete or lock them out).  Browser is very limited.  I know there is the Opera browser, but that is just as bad(its a java app).  In short, only buy this phone for voice calls...but even that is not so good since the voice quality is mediocre.
