I am just your average everyday technology-using non-...uhm, techie. So what you'll get here is just a superficial review based on my observations. Ask me what certain programs are for, your guess would be as good as mine. :) So here goes...Exterior - Don't judge a book by its cover for sure! The Samsung Omnia has a very simplified, sleek look. Just three buttons on the front: accept call, end call, and for navigation.The Touch Screen - The screen is adequate. The touch screen sensitivity is fine, although sometimes you need to tap two or three times. But then again, being the phone is new I suddenly find myself with a very light touch.The Keypad - Portrait-oriented, the keys are narrower even for my small fingers. But I typed 'the quick brown fox...' sentence with only 3 errors. Landscape-oriented, the keys are much much better.Battery Life - This is the only area with which I had a big problem. I researched a lot about this phone but somehow I missed out on this one important factor. It turns out this phone's battery can only last an average of 5.8 hours. I charged it one whole day and the next day I had to recharge it twice again, and after 3 hours it died on me. This is NOT good. So I looked up ways of saving battery life and hit on this - [...] The topic is about HTC Diamond, but the advice works on Omnia. Right now I'm up to 75% charged after 1.5 hours. Believe me, I'd rather have that than charging it for a full day. I'm still researching for other tips on saving power. :)Wi-fi - Since this is an unlocked international phone, I don't get the advantage of 3G network here in the US. But with the battery life issue, that's okay with me to just use the internet while I'm at home using wi-fi. This might seem very discouraging to some, so you can always avail of the Omnia from Verizon. It can access their 3G network.Text Messaging - I'm a text fanatic. I give Omnia 100%! The only thing I don't know how to work out yet (or this might not even be possible) is how to make the messages in my inbox just reflect the sender's name in the front-view of the folder instead of a snippet of the message. I don't know, I just feel uncomfortable with seeing snippets of messages at a glance. :)Camera - Really really nice!!! 5mp with auto-focus, flash, smile-focus, image editing, and a lot more. :DVideo - Pretty decent for a phone.Synching the Phone to PC - Really haven't figured this out yet. I popped in the CD and followed the steps but I think I missed something since after synching it, my phone alerted me its memory was low. I checked my media storage--I had downloaded almost every file in my computer from pictures to music to videos! That's a looot of memory! I had to hard-reset my phone to erase everything. Good thing I only had it for 1 day at that time. :)That's it for now. Will be updating if I have any more info to share. :)", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Does everything very well", "Author": "W. White III \"ww111\"", "ReviewID": "RPQCBAMOWXCUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a tough review to start... So I'll just say that I'm now leaving my camera and laptop at home when I travel for business.  I've had this phone for about 6 months.  The phone itself works well on the AT&T; network in central New York.  I have no complaints about the receive or transmit sound quality or the ability to maintain call quality in areas of poor reception.  The 5 MP camera is very competent and good enough for all uses except very high quality portraits and very close macro work. 16 GB internal and 8GB card capacity mean plenty of room for audio or video or work documents or photos.  Windows pro 6.1 means lots of available applications for everything from photo editing to voice command.  I have partnerships with 2 computers and had a problem syncing contacts on one of them but it was solved by a re-installation of Activesync.  Internet and wi-fi functions are great and trouble free.  GPS is very impressive and has gotten me back home a couple of times.  Great integration with Google Earth.  Bluetooth has worked with everything from my laptop, car, headset and Garmin Zumo. Battery will last about 12 hours of hard use, 24 of light use, and 36 if it just sits.  I would buy this phone again.  If it weren't so expensive I'd have another as a back-up.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Neat Phone", "Author": "S. Huntley \"AkWingnut\"", "ReviewID": "R3C4JUVWMBT273", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung i900, is it or is it not a great phone? That is a good question allot of people might ask themselves. Me personally I think its a neat phone, great phone I think it falls just short of that. There are allot of wonderful points about this phone, Small, Thin, Stylish, 5MP camera, Flash, Space, EXTRA SPACE (if you really needed more), WiFi, FM Radio, Speaker Phone, Great Color, even the appz you can get for it are great. Is it worth 600+ bucks, well maybe depending on how you look at it. I mean its a phone that is UNLOCKED, meaning you can take it to any provider, AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint, and even over on the other side of the world. Since this version of the phone is an Unlocked International Phone. So yeah in my opinion yes its worth the money. Any other unlocked phone of this type would run you about the same in costs. I have a few things I dont understand about it yet but hey its worth learning about. I hope this review helps some people out making a choice on if they should get this phone or not so please the biggest thing I can say is read the reviews before you purchase a phone.......", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice, but there is better available", "Author": "Rachel Romano", "ReviewID": "R3PQ5OTCVK6B40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The display with touch sensitivity on this phone is nice, but doesn't match that of the iphone or htc's g1 (or similar phones on this standard).  The camera/video recorder is above average and beats htc phones handsdown on color hue.  Only the newest iphone (3g S) records videos, the first two iphones do not.Overall, this is a nice phone with a beautiful display, good camera (great media uses in general including radio, mp3 and video player), touch display, and nice user interface.In my humble opinion, if you want a phone with better flexibility in software options (easy software store, lots of choices), go with the iphone or an android based phone. :)", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Had great hopes...now so disappointed.", "Author": "Val Cosmos \"Citizen of Universe\"", "ReviewID": "R2RT4KEDS52OGU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung i900 Omnia for about 2 months. Then it bricked when i tried to hard reset it. It became useless and since it was bought on internet and officially not a US version i sent it to Korea for repair. Another month and a half-no news. So no more Samsung for me.Then i did the research and bought myself a SE Experia X1. What a difference folks. The screen is more responsive, extra keyboard, much better feel and finish, hard ware buttons glow in the dark, better resolution of the screen, doesn`t freeze up as much, better sound, ...and it`s made by HTC.So folks do yourselves a favor, get SE or HTC and be happy. There will be no more wasted time and money on rubbish like Samsung or Nokia. Nokia used to be good 5 years ago. No they simply fail to keep up with technology, and they are completely not user friendly. My N82 died on me after less than a year of use. I re-installed a firmware, it didn`t work out. What a waste.That was just my humble opinion. Please no offense or aggravation taken.

On paper, the OMNIA is a wonderful piece of technology, but I have to think that it was designed BTI - Before The iPhone. The iPhone is in its 4rd generation now, and still we have these Window's Mobile phones that simply don't measure up. That's also true of the Blackberry I have to use for work. When will these companies realize that the cell phone paradigm has shifted, radically, since the launch of the iPhone?The OMNIA is a smidge smaller and a tad thicker than the iPhone. It has a nice touch screen, but it requires the use of a stylus which for the life of me looks like an eyelash brush. The interface is Windows Mobile 6.1, an OS I'm familiar with, having had two previous WM phones. Even so, I had a devil of a time getting the most basic things set up to my liking. I freely admit that my trouble and frustration comes in part from seeing how easy things are on the iPhone.The feature set on the OMNIA is nice, including Wifi, a nice touch screen as I mentioned, Bluetooth of course, and the ability to play back movies. It also has a very nice 5.0 Megapixel camera, a microSD slot, GPS, and the whole Windows Mobile Office suite. But again, how important are any of these features if they're too arcane to get to or use? Amazon is currently selling this phone for $530 without a service plan. Verizon sells it with a 2-year contract for $200. AT&T; sells the top-of-the-line iPhone for the same price with a 2-year contract. `nuff said.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "The product is good.

I love it!!!  I have had it since December of 2009.  Absolutely no complaints!!!  It has a 5 MP camera, with a flash, that also takes video.  It has Microsoft Word, along with the Office Suite, but I mainly use only Word.  It has Google Maps with a GPS.  The only charge is for the data sent over your 3G.  I have home security cameras from Cosco that I even uploaded the software to my phone so that I can view the cameras before I pull into my garage using my home Wi-Fi.  I love using Internet Explorer from my phone.  The phone has multiple digital keyboards and even a transcriber.  I love that I can write in cursive and my phone understands!  It saves all of my text messages over the past year categorized by sender/receiver.  I have tons of mp3s on it that I enjoy listening to over the speaker in my office.  I prefer to use Windows Media Player.  There is so much software pre-loaded on this phone.  If your not a Microsoft person, you can use other programs.  You can set your shortcuts and the buttons on the side of the phone to do different functions.  I have set one of mine to be the task manager so that I can easily close applications because clicking the x simply minimizes, but does not close the program.  You have so many choices on this phone.  I have mine set on a Today screen that I think is more user friendly for me than the one in the product picture.  I also love the number of alarms that I can set.  I am a teacher in a school with no bell system.  I have an alarm for the end of every class, an alarm to wake up, an alarm to go home, an alarm to get the kids in bed, and still room for 5 more alarms!  The calendar and reminders are great!  I also use the 3G internet connection sharing for my laptop when there is no Wi-Fi.  I can see where if you are not tech savvy, the phone might be intimidating, but I absolutely love it!!!  I have been dreaming of a phone with all of these functions for 10 years, and now it finally exists and I have it!!!

Crashed a few times, but nothing a reset didn't fix and there was no data loss.Only issue I have with this phone is that you'll need to find a better 3rd party GPS that works without the internet since I don't have a data plan in my country for the phone, so getting the internet all the time can be expensive. If you have an unlimited data plan then you wont have anything to worry about.All features on the phone work well. The Samsung keyboard took a little getting used to since it had XT9 but once you figure out how to disable it then you'll be fine since having word completion can be a bit annoying at times.The Transcriber feature is really good, but there should have been a way to do a test(calibration) so that it can learn to recognise your handwriting since everyone's is different.The finger mouse feature is nice for one handed use, so that would come in handy for most users who multitask.I personally think this is a great phone for anyone who, like myself, loves alot of functionality and features.This is a great phone for the price and has all if not more of the features of the high-end, high priced phones in the $800-900 range.At the time I bought this I had issues with the 3rd party seller with shipping to an address and the apt number was missing and they refunded me within a few days, I would advise all users to make their purchase directly from Amazon since their service is more superior than some 3rd party buyers.Another thing to note is that I purchased the 8GB from the 3rd party at $399.99 but after being refunded I decided to go for the 16GB that was being sold by Amazon with better shipping prices (including the Free Supersaver Shipping) for only $402.I hope you do consider buying this phone since it's a great investment for any of you looking to have fun and functionality together in a phone.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok, not at fast as I wanted..And check compatibility...", "Author": "A.

The camera has a good flash, 5 megas with autofocus, smile shutter, good for what I need in that. The touch screen it's as sensitive with your finger like other phone I had before, so sometimes I have to get the stylus to better performance. Like other window mobile devices, you should close other programs not using to prevent slow performance. But is a nice option IF your like windows mobile phones.

A friend of mine had an iPhone and it was very cool, but I'm no fan of Apple so I went for the Samsung. I bought my Omnia about six months ago and gave it a good try for about a month. I really, really wanted it to be great. But after those four weeks, I was so frustrated that I put it away and took up my old Samsung slider phone. Then a month ago, I thought I'd try the Omnia again. After all, it wasn't cheap ... and it looks so cool! But I hate to say it ... it's junk! There isn't enough space for all my complaints. It started with the battery - I need a knife or a coin or something to lever it out. The touchscreen is just dreadful. You never know what is going to happen. Sometimes you have to press very hard, sometimes hardly at all. Some of the symbols you need to press, like the volume control, are so small and so close together that there is really no way to do it without using the stylus. The screen goes from vertical to horizontal orientation with very little movement (i.e., when you don't want it to). The finger-sweep function may scroll the screen or it may launch an application - you never know! Some menus are closed by clicking a tiny x at the top of the screen, others you need to press an Exit button at the bottom. I can't discern any reason why there isn't a common way of closing applications or screens. You have to drag the widgets out of the sidebar to use them, then put them back. The navigation bar at the bottom of the Opera browser window is sometimes covered by the tool bar from the Windows Mobile interface. I cannot figure out how to adjust the number of times the phone rings before it transfers to voice mail (it switches after three rings, which means I miss most calls as I struggle to get it out of my pocket in time). Maybe there are solutions for all of these issues but you will not find any in the instruction manual and I have so far been unable to find them in the various Omnia forums out there. Anyway, why should I have to spend hours trying to figure out how this thing works??? It hurts me to say it, but the iPhone is way, way better.

After 2 months of using it, the phone ringer wont work at all.  I now have to wait until I feel the silent vibration notification that I'm receiving a call.  The touch screen feature has a built in time delay so that nothing is real time, you gotta wait for the system to respond; the result is that you end up pushing buttons over and over, which disrupts the system's operation.  Amazingly the phone did not come with earphones, so I had to buy those extra.  The radio does not work.  The dialing feature is clumsy and does not respond properly.  The menus are not intuitive.
