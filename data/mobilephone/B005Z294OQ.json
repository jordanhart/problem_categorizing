{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SVP G13 Cell Phone watch", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R1OGX2W7ZV9F9I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The SVP G13 Cell phone watch work perfectly so far.  I originally wanted this watch for the Media functions at first....and as I started to read reviews on other watches I thought I would give the phone portion a try.  I have Sprint so I didn't have a SIM card to toss into the watch and I didn't want to have 2 full phone bills.  I decided to go to T-Mobile and get a pay as you go plan...and this is totaly working out for me.  I pay $30 every 90 days and I get 160 minutes of talk time and it cost me $.10 a text message and $.20 per MMS message.1. Still/Video camera... not the best, but it will take an OK picture in good sunlight and the Video is better is good sunlight also. You can review you pictures and video through the Media player...keep in mind that the screen is tiny and if you are outside the daylight will make it harder to see the tiny screen. One thing, I downloaded a couple of MPEG-4 files and the watch could not play them back without being choppy.2. Adio player... works with either the headphones or the built in speaker.  It's not that loud when you are in a noisy area, but when you are in a quiet area it works rather well. The headphones are proprietary, so you can't plug in your own headphones...there is no 3.5MM headphone port.3. Phone... The phone actually works very well and with the included BlueTooth Headset.  The watch has a built in speaker if you would like to have everyone notice that you are talking to your wrist, or you can use the included stereo earbuds.Conclusion, I love the functionality of the watch/Phone and would encourage any gadget freak to try it out.  when using the Blue Tooth headset I was told that the call quality was good and clear.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than expected - Great for the price", "Author": "MR2012", "ReviewID": "R1ZSSLWBB6ERW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the G13 watch 2 days after I ordered it. I also ordered the MQ988, both from Victor LLC. Now i am not about to say I am the sharpest tool in the shed, but as for the compaints on the manuals broken english, I have to say. I did not even look at the manual until after I had set up everything to see if I missed anything. The menus on the watch are pretty intuitive, but to be fair in this review, I have not set up the phone since I dont have my Sim card or blutooth connector. For me the phone is a secondary feature and I mainly wanted the watch for all the other items. So on with what I can say about the watch: Note: Everything starts as 5 STARS and goes down if lower than expected.1. Customer Service - Victor LLC has respond to all my requests, and to me, has gone above and beyond normal  customer service. I had a few issue, but that was because I did not read the description clearly on both issues and on every email they responded and were willing to help. (5+ Stars)2. Menus ease of use - Very easy to navigate and set up. Stylus was easy to find (dont understand how some could not find it) Menu responds well to touch. (5 Stars)3. Putting in the SIM and Memory card - Very easy. Some are complaining they could not get the memory chip in. Here is where the manual is a little off. I had to raise the metal bracket and slip the chip into the metal bracket and then close it. I could not simply lay the chip on the metal leads and close the bracket and slide up as the manual says, it would not fit that way. The Sim chip fit without a hitch, although it was not an active one yet. (4 1/2 Stars since the manual was off)4. Charging\\ Battery life - takes about 10 hours per battery for a full charge - Normal use it has lasted me all day and I plug it into my computer to charge at night. I have recorded about 15 minutes of video and taken 20 pics. I also watched a 1 hour and 30 minute MP4, seems like I have about 20% battery life left. Dont listen to music that much will be able to update more after a couple of weeks. (5 Stars - Battery lasted beyond expectations) My expectations were not too high on battery life, but then again I am not planning on watching multiple movies or video taping 1.5 hours at a time, so mileage may vary.5. USB connection to computer - connected it to different computers, multiple times over the past three days, no issues charging or seeing external drive to transfer files. (5 Stars)To Application review1. Video Player - I can play all my MP4 movies after I have converted them to 160x160 and lowered the bit rate. The picture quality is above expectation for being on such a small screen. No complaints (5+ Stars)2. Video Camera - Ok, not professional quality, but then not bad either. you wont be sneaking into any movie theaters recording movies with this watch :o). I did post a video sample on youtube under g13 phone movie. Its a standard 640x480 video at max-resolution. great for quick vids, times when you need a camera right then and you know you will miss the moment running into the house to get the camera. The sound is awful if the subject is more than 5 foot away. I dont know why, but I was expecting a little better (4 stars)3. Camera - Its what was expected and even has rapid shot, I posted a couple of shots in customer pics. Standard 640x480. Its expected and easy to use. (5 Stars)3. Photo editor - very basic, but a plus cause I didnt really expect one to begin with. (5 Stars)4. Photo Viewer - Expected5. Calculator, Stop watch, Alarm, Currency convertor, Alarm, Health calculations (BMI), Audio player. All good additions and some beyond expectations (5 Stars)Style -As i said before, I also bought the MQ988. The 988 is so BIG, I could not wear it, it would look ridiculous on my arm, maybe good on a teenager. For myself, i needed something a little more undersized and after wearing it for a while, its perfect.What was not tested:Phone - I will test this out later, but I did not buy the watch for just the phone. I understand the phone works well from other reviews and youtube videos.WAP - I dont plan on using this to browse the web - but once I get the SIM in, I will update the review.Burn in testing - I did not put this through a burn in testing to see exactly how lon it would record, how long it would play, if i could stess test it.After three days - Watch seems good to go. The band is a ruberized plastic that I am not sure will stand the test of time. We will see. I have not gotten it wet or banged it on walls through normal use. Would i buy it again? It depends how long it lasts, if I get a good year out of it, sure would.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful, but with 2 major design flaws...", "Author": "C. W. Sayre", "ReviewID": "RO1A8LR20AQD2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon Verified PurchaseThis review is from: G13(with micro32GB) Black Touch Screen Camera MP3 GSM Watch Cell Phone~ unlocked~ Quad-band (Wireless Phone Accessory)This is a fantastic watch phone, and after using the G13 for the last few months, I can never go back to a regular cell phone. The G13 is just too convenient, easy to use, always there, and so darn \"cool\".However, as shown in the picture I uploaded in Customer Images, the G13's plastic case has cracked through-and-through (on both sides of the watch), and this is after wearing it for 3 months -- a weak, poorly designed case.Another MAJOR issue is its TOTAL lack of water resistance. \"Big deal\", you think, \"I'll just keep it out of the shower and the rain\". It's not that easy, because even the slightest perspiration, laden with corrosive salts, works its way quickly into the innards of the G13, damaging it over time. And with the watch band and the case being made of plastic, you sweat under the watch quite a bit (at least in the Summer).I love this watch, but these two issues are so show-stopping that I'll probably have to purchase another brand of cell phone watch when mine falls apart or stops working, which looks like it will be pretty darn soon.UPDATE:I contacted Slim Sharp's (the vendor) customer service, described the above issues, and they were kind enough to replace the entire watch. So five stars for Slim Sharp's CS -- they stand behind their product!!", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great watch/phone, but not for people who want a full featured smart phone.", "Author": "Unknown.usr \"corpbot\"", "ReviewID": "R3OC6WVBM3CZSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great device for people who want something handy with the ability to access minimal internet sites.

Upon arrival the start up was fine and relatively easy and it performed well enough the call and receive call functions. However I have the following problems:The volume of the speaker on the phone was low (my son had to put it next to his ear to be able to hear)which is why I believe it comes with the included blue tooth, however I was not able to make them work together.The package said it included an additional charger so that both included batteries could be charged simultaneously, it did not come with the package so I can only charge one battery at a time (and for that I have to installe it on the phone).Aside from the above, my son was happy to use it and test all its features which were easy enough to use, but limited to the watch form factor (vga camera, etc).", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "a movement of the hand", "Author": "gadget saul", "ReviewID": "R491C4QONTICR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a watch I purchased as a backup cell phone. It does everything a normal cell phone does but on a smaller scale. It does blue tooth for your car ,dials and calls people, and most important, their is customer service that response to your emails quickly. VICTOR LLC is the distributor of the watch and they are very helpful. I once got a phone call from overseas to answer my question but normally I have been happy with the email response. I must say that I am a large buyer from amazon on all items and gadgets are foremost in my mine. I consider this watch a gadget, backup cellphone, a dress watch and a showpiece.

And it's more for the guys, I suppose..... for me, I bought it because it was fairly interesting and it's convenient when I go for a walk, go riding, etc. and it serves its purpose for that.A few cons:*  The watch band doesn't appear to be removable.  If you want a new band, you may have to cut of the band and velcro it to a single piece replacement band.*  The keyboard is fairly small but with some practice, you can do it without a stylus.*  There's no MUTE option on the phone.*  I can't use the WAP browser on the device, but then I never use WAP.*  It's not sized for the ladies, so to speak.  It's more for kids and probably acceptable for guys, I suppose.Still, a few really good parts about this:It works!  And it works fairly well.  The sound quality is very good over bluetooth.  I paired it with an Rocket Fish bluetooth stereo headphone from Best Buy and the phone quality was very good.  No one complained about not being able to hear me.  It takes micro-SD card but I wouldn't use it to play music unless you have nothing else.  I still don't know how to get media onto it without taking off the back and taking/replacing the SD card.Also, another good thing is that when a phone call comes in, this thing rings immediately.  No real pause, nothing.  It just rings immediately and usually a full ring before my other cell phone does.Still, I've gotten better at it that I can dial without the stylus and I can even get the keyboard working albeit slowly, but it still works decently enough.Also, the USB port is non-standard, but it comes with a cable.Camera is OK.... nothing fancy and nothing spectacular, but in a pinch, it serves its purpose.Still, it's a novelty gift and good enough for carrying a phone with you without actually carrying a phone in your pocket.

Both function exactly the same.  It includes the core features: Phone, Camera, Video Camera, Sound Recorder, MP3 player, Calendar, Calculator, etc.  Great device, but will take a few tweaks here and there to get it working as you would expect.  For instance, there are settings for the picture quality (Video and Camera) that you'll need to setup with the highest resolution, set the SD Card as the primary storage, Bluetooth (Set this for Stereo, assuming you have a BT headset - I use the Motorola S9 and it's perfect at the gym).  Someone here also posted instructions for setting up the Internet connectivity, those instructions work fine (couldn't find them anywhere else).  This phone uses a GSM SIM so in the USA you'll need AT&T; or T-Mobile Sim cards to use it.  I use a pre-paid AT&T; card so I don't have a monthly bill and use this as a backup phone primarily.  Takes about 30-45min to charge in the morning and it's good the rest of the day.  Very pleased with battery life, though honestly I don't use the phone feature very often.  Easy enough to crank out a few short text messages in a pinch.** Beware ** of the new \"G14\" model.  Bought one from another website, they removed all the \"other\" apps. that I used frequently (Calendar, Alarm, Calculator, etc.) and replaced them with a single app. for a Pedometer (which is junk).  So, if you're looking for the best model stick with this one (G13) and skip the so-called upgrade to the G14 (Which I'm in-process of returning).
