It has fallen apart in 3 different places already. If you notice the clock in the pictured phone, it's different than the one they sold me. The box was a generic v8 box of sorts. The 'Gold' pieces are falling off of this phone and I've handled it with great care. This leads my wife and myself to believe that this is not an authentic Motorola Luxury phone. THEN, I told MASTER CELL STORE AND THEY THREATENED TO SUE ME!!! They will not give me any information regarding Master Cell Store or even give me a single name of who I was emailing. ALL OF THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE I WAS RIPPED OFF AND THAT I ALSO BOUGHT A KNOCK OFF PHONE. I WILL BE PURSUING A CLAIM HERE. THIS IS REALLY BAD BUSINESS HERE. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!!

I didn't check product upon delivery, thus didnt know that device delivered was of poor quality and monitor didnt work. Since I missed the deadline to return this item - I decided not to carry it back. I was impressed that the seller agreed to replace this device beyond the return deadlines if I get it back to them. Unfortunately my family already trashed it - since it was not possible to fix it. Thus, the seller was OK to deal with and willing to resolve this issue, however, overall I am not happy with my purchase and will not recommend it to my friends. It was lost of money.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "All That Glitters Isn't Gold", "Author": "The Standard", "ReviewID": "R31E03U5BPQKT1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone from the recommend sponsor letstalk1 and I had problems with it immediately on arrival. I was going to send it back after a long process getting the display setup because it wouldn't receive text messages. Called AT&T; a couple of days later and they helped to get the text message working, but then it wouldn't allow me to download pictures or music sent by text.  The gold circle icon on the back began to come out of place from just my pressing on it to put in my SIM card.  The speaker phone reception was spotty.  Letstalk1 gives you only 7 days to return it, and you need an RMA number from them to do so.  I requested one by email them and contact on their sight, but never got one.  A great looking phone, but the looks are deceiving.  Don't be fooled.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty cell with bad battery", "Author": "Eduardo S.

Many of the features do not function, and for the life of me I can't figure out why the sample photo's, screen saver, backgound include pictures of David Beckum and one of a BMW automobile, that you can not delete. I lost my phone and wanted to replace it without having to get one of the newer phones that are data based and would altimately cost me more money per month. The only reason I do not consider it a complete waste is that I can make a phone call.
