Not sure why there isn't as much love.", "Author": "Zombieflicker \"Biff\"", "ReviewID": "R2MUK4161UJGJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had test driven the HTC Vivid, Samsung Galaxy 2 (and Skyrocket) at the AT&T; store prior to making my decision to purchase the LG Nitro HD.  The Nitro by far had the best screen and the functionality of it was on par with them well.  Some reviews knock the design of the phone down a couple of pegs stating that it's rather plain.  I don't know about you, but when I invest in a phone, a case goes on it immediately.  So yeah it's a little plain, but I'll never see it now that my case is covering it.A little history.  This was my first Android phone purchase.  Prior to owning this phone, I had an Iphone 3G, an Iphone 4, and a Windows HTC Surround.  The HTC Surround is what I was using before selecting the LG Nitro (for those that like the Zune player, there is a music app called Ubermusic that looks almost identical to the Zune player).I was seriously thinking about upgrading to a Nokia Lumia as I did like my HTC Surround.  I am so glad I didn't.  There are so many things the Android can do that the Windows phone can't even touch yet.  To list the differences, it would take all day.  Trust me.  I've used the Windows phone since it came out, and although it's functional, there are just too many limitations on it to compete.Here is what I like:Great screen!  HD looks great and has the best display I've seen yet for a 4.5 inch screen.  I don't have any issues with response times or any glitches with web browsing.  I already own an Android tablet, so downloading and installing previous apps was a painless process.  This thing is fast!  It's my first 4g (no 4G LTE in my area yet) phone, so the download speeds are night and day to me.  Some people have bashed the LG custom configuration to the screen, but as this is my first Android phone, so it doesn't seem different to me in any way.  As far as storage capacity goes, there is 4 gb of internal memory and comes with a 16gb Micro SD HD card installed.  I already replaced it with a ScanDisk 64 gb card and the phone recognized it right away (It states it only supports up to 32 but 64 does work).  The camera quality is the best I've had with a phone.  To me it's just as good as my daughters Iphone 4 (with more features).  The video quality is excellent as well.  Also, I made sure that AT&T; confirmed that ICS was going to happen for this model, and it is.Cons:Surprise!  The battery doesn't hold up as well as the Iphone, but what else does?  Not counting the first week of heavy usage (because it's a new toy), a standard days use will now end up with about 25% left in the tank at the end of the night.  I have plenty of chargers around, so to me it's not much of a hindrance.  The bloat ware that comes with the phone is kind of irritating, but most of it can be uninstalled.  The one that cannot be uninstalled and makes me angry is Zynga Poker HD.  I wish I could uninstall it, but it won't let me.  Maybe some day I'll root the phone and do it but don't want to void the warranty as it is still new.Overall, I'm very happy with it and am surprised that it is not as popular as other models.  That's mainly why I wrote this review, to spread the love I have with my phone.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life is no excuse for a 1 star review", "Author": "Dillon Welch", "ReviewID": "R2V25M38RTEP8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this (no contract) from eBay, and I think this phone is amazing!I upgraded to this from another LG android, the P506 (LG Thrive,) and the Nitro is leaps and bounds ahead of it. The Thrive could hardly play music (sometimes it took several seconds to manually switch to the next song, much worse than anything other reviewers are complaining about,) while the Nitro can play any 1080p video I want, with no problem! There is no match for AT&T; phones at this price.I saw another reviewer saying that they have to press several times to get a response, and I only notice that I have to press HARDER on the screen than I did the Thrive, there's really no problem with the digitizer.And it get's even better if you can manage to get the Android 4.0 leak installed. It's tough to do with the latest 2.3 update (the new update can't be rooted,) but it can be done, and it's worth it.Other reviewers, please don't give 1 star reviews for the smallest things (like the battery is too small, or you have to press the screen harder than you want to, or it starts talking about you behind your back, whatever.) It makes your reviews look petty. If you REALLY can't stand the battery life, drop an extra 20 bucks on an extended battery. the 3800mah batteries is nearly triple the life of the stock battery, and they even give you a new back cover for the thicker battery.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nothing Wrong with this phone!", "Author": "Deonsdreaming", "ReviewID": "R3W0UULQAIIYDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've own the LG Nitro HD since it came out also, and I think people are quick to give it a bad name. Sure it's not perfect, it dose get warm but I've owned several phones that did the same. So that's not a big if you know better. The next thing is is yeas the battery life could be better, but everyone should know that WiFi drains the battery faster than anything! I love being able to download things while surfing the web at the same time. You also have to consider the larger screen that's in HD! It's going to use more power than a screen that is smaller and not HD! It's a no brainier issue! I love that this phone is thin, and light weight, the iphone can't beat that yet!So a few people got a bad one, you know what? That happens with iphones too!

Loved the phone...great size, weight, screen clarity.  Then, 48 days into it, the battery suddenly died.  The phone would not come back.  So into Best Buy, repaired, return.  Since then, and it has been \"repaired\" five times to no avail, it dies without warning.  Sometimes the battery is dead, sometimes the battery is fine.  Doesn't matter what app (and I'm down to almost no apps...battery life IS a separate, significant issue). I'm now on the second battery in 10 months and it crashes an average of 1.5 times a day. I have to take the battery out to restart...IF it restarts. If you buy this phone (please, buy mine) make absolutely certain you back everything up everywhere all the time.

An hd screen 1.5ghz dual core and a gig of ram should make this phone amazing. The problems come quick though. The battery life is really horrid. Its bad enough that you are afraid to do much on it. The screen is really pretty but is very unresponsive. Tapping a second or third time gets annoying fast. The phone also force closes very often and randomly turns off on its own. The browser particularly was unstable. It also never seemed very quick for having such a powerful processor. It felt like using an old computer where you clicked something and had to wait for something to happen.I really wanted to like this phone but it was just disappointing in too many ways.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can I give a zero-star review??", "Author": "John Wikman", "ReviewID": "R2CM3TZGEKCINP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Pros: + Gorgeous display + Fairly speedyThe Cons: - Everything else.  Literally everything else.I got this phone when it came out.  Four days later my first Nitro was dead; cellular antenna went out on it.  Replaced.  That one lasted a few weeks before it started draining its entire battery in less than three hours.  I could actually sit and watch the battery gauge tick down...about a percent a minute with the display on lowest setting. If I ran the GPS and left display on, a 40 minute drive would put the battery under 50%. Took it back to local ATT store.  Manager was not happy and didn't want to do anything since it was outside of normal return window, but finally exchanged it for a new one.  That one has lasted about 3 months, and now has a couple issues. A 10 minute phone call makes the handset noticeably hot (not warm, _hot_.  Like too hot to hold against my ear) and drains 20% of the battery.  It's also started chewing through its battery, though not as bad as the 2nd one did.  This one will go through about 15% an hour in total standby with wifi and bluetooth turned off.Side by side with my wife's iPhone 4 running the same application, she'll drop 2% of her battery and I'll drop 15% or more.Stay far far away from this piece of garbage.Oh, rumor has it that it _might_ get the upgrade to ICS late in 2012.  Maybe.

I have had it for only 5 days and I am ready to go back and and return it.  The most problem with the phone is that it gets very hot with just 5 minutes or so of using it. Just as mentioned before in another review, it does not get warm it gets HOT.  Also, the battery life is very short.  I don't use my cell phone as much as most other people and even when just doing regular calls I must charge it on a daily basis.

But, you can still use it while charging. I have dropped my phone in water, retrieved it quickly, opened and was completely dry and still worked.

Couple of things to note - first, I use this with Straight Talk's prepaid monthly plan - unlimited everything for $45 through Walmart. Second, it is operating on AT&T;'s network (Straight Talk has deals with AT&T;, T Mobile, and Sprint and will use one of those networks depending upon your phone and the area where you live). Because I use Straight Talk, I am unfortunately limited to HSPA+ speeds and cannot comment on 4G speeds. I knew this going in, and it's just a carrier limitation - not an issue with the phone. In any case, I typically get 4.5mbs download speeds in my area and am happy with that, but 4G users will likely get much faster download rates. Third, I immediately upgraded the OS from Gingerbread to Ice Cream Sandwich when I bought the phone, so everything in my review is based on the experience with ICS.First, the negatives. The only potentially glaring issue with the LG Nitro is battery life. In my experience I have to charge my phone every night minimum, and often times under heavy use I have to charge it during the day to keep it going. I hardly every use WIFI because I have a good strong signal where I work & live with good data speeds. I also keep GPS turned off unless I'm using the navigation features while driving, which mostly happens only on longer trips. I keep my screen brightness around 30% most of the time. In other words, I work hard to maximize my battery life. Still, I find the battery life to be annoyingly short. Most days under mixed use of lots of talk & texting, a moderate amount of web browsing, and a few short periods of gaming (maybe 20-30 minutes total) I can make it from the time I get up (7am) until I get home from work (6pm) and I might be down to about 20% or less - doing all I can to conserve battery life as mentioned. I deal with this by having a couple of spare batteries charged & ready, and keeping a usb & wall charger on me all the time. It works, but I'd love to feel more freedom maxing out my phone capabilities without being nervous that it will conk out if I do. I've talked to friends with other Android phones and all of them complain about battery life too, some giving similar reports of their own experiences with their phones, but by most accounts the Nitro HD is on the weak end with battery life.Fortunately, that's the only REAL negative in my experience. The design is very straightforward and perhaps plain, but that's a matter of taste and I like the low-key aesthetic just fine. The build quality is good - lightweight phone but it feels solid and has survived numerous drops (though I do keep it in a minimalistic plastic snap-on case). I've read complaints of the phone getting hot, but that has not been an issue with mine. It can get warm around the top of the back of the phone depending on what features are being used, but never enough to seem problematic or disconcerting. I have had some occasions where the phone freezes or resets, but those experiences seem to be caused by software programs I've installed and have so far been fixed by uninstalling the offending programs. Other friends with different Android phones seems to have more issues with freezes and shutdowns that I do.Aside from battery life, I pretty much like everything else about the phone. Call quality is very good, I can hear them great and they can hear me. Speakerphone quality is also good. No dropped calls aside from those caused by a loss of AT&T; signal when I drive through the boondocks. The HD screen is wonderful - very crisp, very bright, looks as good as or better than any other one currently out there including the Retina display. The camera is pretty good - takes very sharp pictures outdoors or in well-lit environments, but low-light shots aren't as strong (to be expected on a phone camera). The video quality is even better. The HD videos look really sharp with very fluid motion and surpass my Canon point & shoot camera's video. Not a perfect camera but pretty darn good for a phone. The dual core processor is quick and has no problem keeping up even when multitasking. The touch-screen is responsive, though I am not a fan of typing on the virtual keyboard - but that's nothing to do with the phone and everything to do with my stubby fingers. The LG interface is perfectly usable and very customizable.In the end your consideration of this phone ought to come down to battery use. If you want a phone with stellar battery life, keep looking. But if you are generally within reach of a charging source when you need it (like me), or if you use your phone mostly for talk & text with lighter reliance on web, GPS, etc, then this is a great choice. Quality build, good camera, incredible screen, capable processor - lots to like here & definitely worth considering.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone for the price.", "Author": "mar", "ReviewID": "R3V6UO7AQKP28T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone about two weeks ago and am pleased with the phone.

You have a LTE phone with a large HD screen and WIFI and GPS and Bluetooth look people see how much you have draining the battery. Yes the Skyrocket gets a little bit more battery life but it does not have the awesome HD screen that the Nitro has. If you want more battery life then spend $20 for an extended battery and back. I can't believe some would give up one of the best screens on a phone for something so simple to fix.2) Yes you will get some bad phones with serious problems but even the so called great iPhone has that. Just look at the problems they had with the antenna placement. I have just sent back a Samsung skyrocket for the Nitro. Now don't get me wrong the Skyrocket is probably a great phone. I am not judging it by the clearly defective one I had ( because the one I had was a complete piece of junk,with a blank screen and dead wifi) I was just drawn to the HD screen of the Nitro. Everyone says OH the retina display on the iPhone well the Nitro has a slightly better display than the iPhone with a 329dpi.I think I am really going to like this phone. I know I will be able to see things better on it and that is one of the most important aspects of a phone. People just check your options out and do a little research to see how simple it is to fix minor short comings before your so quick to judge. The main complaint of the Nitro is it's battery life but perhaps LG could have put in a larger battery but that is probably the fault of the public in general since there is such a pressure for sleeker and thinner phones over functional they had to give in to demand.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Discription Not Right", "Author": "Baseman", "ReviewID": "R3DZYCLXRMF20W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this phone from another carrier.
