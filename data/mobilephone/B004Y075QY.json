{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Good, the Bad, and the Basic", "Author": "Kevin L. Nenstiel \"omnivore\"", "ReviewID": "R2GZCLGEIQYLN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good basic phone for users who don't want to bother with technological do-funnies or electronic complexity. It has no app store, no high-speed processor, no HD reading or video capabilities. It just makes a good phone for voice calls, texts, and a camera. Its lack of features makes it perfect for young kids who don't need distractions, old fogies who don't want clutter, and people like me who resent having the electronic leash anyway.That said, this is a basic phone, with all the good and bad that entails. It has a pretty basic antenna, so be prepared to break up in rural areas. I've had to struggle with reception through the concrete and steel of a big box discount store. If you choose to pick up the mobile web bundle, don't expect to get great resolution or do a whole lot of lickety-split surfing on this small, no-frills display. This is a phone, not a data system.If you're willing to accept these limitations, this is a pretty good phone. I use it to keep in touch with home, work, and my students. They know not to expect complex content from me on their smart phones, because I want my phone to be my phone and my computer to be my computer. If that's you, then this is your phone. Keep in touch, just don't expect magic and spectacle out of this basic, utilitarian baby.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for someone who has a small monthly budget", "Author": "Kristine", "ReviewID": "R2CLIVZDB7A0HS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my 63 year old dad, who is not into smart or android phone, (he does not even want to learn to use a computer).

Bye bye!!!I tried one of the Big Box Store prepaids with customer service based somewhere in Central America. The phone was nice but I got absolutely no reception in my house. Big problem. Worked great in the Big Box Store parking lot. Hmmmm. I literally had to drive down the street to get any reception at all and there are three major cell phone towers near my house. The CS was HORRIBLE if you could get them at all. It was like playing a game. They finally (via e-mail) told me to put my phone through a few tests, I reported the results and they e-mailed back telling me there was nothing wrong with my phone or service. Gee thanks.So I researched other prepays and finally went with Virgin (Sprint) and was able to get a great deal on the Kyocera S2100. If it didn't work I didn't lose much money. I had a bit of a problem setting up the service on the internet. So here was the BIG test. Calling customer service. I was scared. I got menu after menu that didn't really apply to the problem but then I just said \"service agent please\" and within 10 seconds I had a human being. Very impressive. Of course they were in India but I have to say I understood them perfectly, they were VERY polite and friendly and they saw the problem I was having and fixed it immediately. Best customer service from India I've ever had. I had to call them once more for another reason and they were just as nice. A few US based CS call centers could learn a few things from them.Now for the phone. Yes it's very basic but IT WORKS IN MY HOUSE ... YEAY!!!!! The reception is even good when it shows no bars. It has nice big keys which my stubby fingers like. No problems at all with reception. I can hear them and they can hear me. The screen is on the small side ... umm waaaay on the small side. Not great for data or even reading texts. Not a great phone for that but fine for talk. It's not an Android folks. It doesn't even try to be.  The menu is easy to figure out and has more features than I expected. The ringtone selection is minimal. The ringer needs to be louder, much louder. Even when it's turned up to max you won't hear it if it's in the next room or if the cat has pushed it under the bed. You need to keep it in your shirt pocket. The battery life is astounding. Seems like I never have to charge it and yes I do use it. Now, I see people complaining that it doesn't light up like a Christmas Treet when you open it up to use it and they have to wait forever. True, it's slow but how long does it take you to get out of bed in the morning? BUT all you have to do is hit any key and it wakes up ... HELLOOOO... Okay here's a hint if you have to get the battery cover off. You all know how frustrating that can be, breaking your nails, hitting it on the countertop, yelling at it? It's easy. Just drop it on the floor. The cover will fly off and the battery will come out and fly in the other direction. I seem to do it daily and nothing has broken yet but it does seem like it's cheaply made but hey it only cost $12.00. What do you want?So in summary:The good --- IT WORKS. Customer Service is surprisingly good, just don't try to use their menu. Saying \"service agent please\" gets you a human. Be nice to them and they'll be nice to you. Remember that people. Reception is just fine, even in my house. It has big keys. Battery life is unreal.The bad --- flimsy construction, ringtone choice and volume, falls apart when you drop it (I'm going to try duct tape), tiny little screen.Conclusion:Don't blame your problems on anyone but your own impatience. The phone is great for talk but just for talk. Be grateful that it works. I'm going to upgrade to something with a bigger screen just so it will be easier to text and for data. Be grateful that it costs much less than a contract service ... much less. If you don't like it then it probably doesn't like you either.THANK YOU VIRGIN!!!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kyocera Clip S2100 paylo prepaid (Virgin Mobile)", "Author": "Jane Austin", "ReviewID": "RAL1CNAU0RWWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works great.

Jackson \"Curt\"", "ReviewID": "R2BDQLPO6APHW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well just received my second S2100 the first one was defective when you closed the lid the back light would not shut off occasionally and drain the battery also when you opened the lid sometimes it would not come on automatically and you would have to push a button to get into the menu. Haven't completed the setup process yet but as soon as I do I will amend my review. just be sure you get a good one before you complete the activation process at least check the things I mentioned. You will have to activate it to evaluate the call quality. One thing I did not like was the ring volume seems to be much lower then their cheaper Jax which is considerably louder. The one ring tone that is fairly loud is the classic so after turning the volume all the way up if you need more volume try that one. Also read somewhere that it was mentioned that this phone doesn't support a call record well it does just press the bottom of the navigation button when you first open the phone NOT from the main menu and you will see the following. Missed Calls Received calls Outgoing Calls All Calls and Call timers.updateOne other thing I don't like is how small the fonts are for texting I mean if you really like to text unless you have really good eyes this phone may not be for you thinking about possibly returning this one for something better, can't beat the 12 dollar price though.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "sanginez", "ReviewID": "R3N05YBCIVH69U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good Product AND QUICK DELIVER.
