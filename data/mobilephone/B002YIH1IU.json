When it arrived the phone was NOT unlocked, as stated.  We had to pay to have that done.  The instructions to use the phone are practically unreadable.  So, generally speaking, we must learn by trial and error.  The phone is in good condition, but NOT being unlocked and unreadable instructions are a real problem.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Tocco Lite cellphone", "Author": "Hugo", "ReviewID": "R2LT8QUOF256I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product arrives in perfect condition, very well protected.
