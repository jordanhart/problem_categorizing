{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Galaxy S2 Skyrocket: leader of the pack?", "Author": "The Guardian", "ReviewID": "R47O4OYGTFXXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having been a Blackberry user for several years but also owning an iPod4 64G, I finally decided to replace my 2-year old Blackberry Curve with a smartphone and went for the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, cheaper than the iPhone and has had generally positive reviews from users.I've been using the Samsung now for a couple of weeks. Before getting into details about a few of the amazing features of this excellent phone, here is a summary of what I really liked about the Blackberry Curve and how the new Samsung compares:1. It was easy to type text on the Blackberry because it has a physical keyboard which even a user with big fingers can cope with. I was put off on-screen keyboards a couple of years ago by the truly appalling and virtually un-usable Blackberry Storm, but the Samsung is really OK in this department even though its keyboard appears on-screen because the key points are so large, and when you finger a key a larger image of it pops up to confirm which key you have activated.2. The Blackberry's party piece was very easy and intuitive email management, which I need to use all day long for business messages. Well, the Samsung is surprisingly good here too, with the added bonus of a huge screen and the facility to enlarge or reduce text size with a sweep of the fingers, iPhone style. The text clarity is first class.3. The Blackberry has very long battery life and typically I'd only need to charge it every 4 or 5 days, even with heavy usage. The Samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an iPod-like music player is important to you, then this Samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).4. The Blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the Samsung is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screenHere's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my non-techie perspective:* The AMOLED screen on the Skyrocket is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iPhone or iPod. Designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length* Despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iPhone for example is around 20g heavier)* All functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the iPod4 with a similar feel* Calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is OK. The ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls* The quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)* The Samsung has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-USB port located on the base-edge of the phone. Finally manufacturers have chosen (not before time) to stop ripping-off their customers by making them buy new chargers with every new handset and begun to standardize - FINALLY!In summary I'd say if you're looking for a smartphone, the Samsung is a very serious contender. It's beautifully designed, its screen is absolutely amazing - you need to just use it for a couple of minutes to appreciate how good it is - yet it's lightweight. The menus are intuitive and easy to master; it has loads of optional software and aps (mostly free to the user, unlike with Apple); making calls and managing email is a breeze. It's a weather forecaster, a GPS street-finder and a web browser with astoundingly clear screen definition unlike anything I ever used before.Possible cautions include barely acceptable battery life, and for this it drops a star: if you're a current Blackberry user you'll really notice this, and especially so if you use it as a music player. Also the Skyrocket might be intimidating if you're a technophobe who just wants a simple phone to make calls. But it compares very well in all essentials against the iPhone: it's lighter, cheaper and the screen is better, and most of the aps for which Apple charges you, you get with the Samsung for free.One final point: make sure you buy a good robust case and a screen protector for it; there's plenty of choice and most of them do the job OK.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "This item is not Galaxy SII Skyrocket", "Author": "Tariq", "ReviewID": "R2G3SZCLALS3AZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Seller is not describing this item correctly, most of the specifications listed are for Galaxy SII Skyrocket which is SGH-I727 but if you pay attention to model it is listed as SGH-I777 which is what you will get if you order it from this seller.

Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R1GAJWP54H4ZPN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oct 23, 2013 WAIT before you read my original review I have new data. I was unable to lock onto an LTE signal using this phone. I went to the T-Mobile store and they said that is correct, that unlocked phones usually won't work on T-Mobile's LTE network. I then contacted the vendor Extra Virgin Tech and they sent email back confirming the weakness. I'm checking now to see if I can return the phone.I have read, for those brave enough to delve into this world, that you can \"jailbreak\" the phone and correct this issue. While I am tech savvy and feel I could pull this off I'm not willing to do so because I'm simply evaluating the T-Mobile coverage and am not sure if I will continue down this path.Original Reivew...We are in the process of converting over from Verizon where we've been using simple feature phones for a few years. T-Mobile offers cheaper plans and we are converting to smartphones. This Skyrocket purchase is part of that conversion.I received my Skyrocket from Extra Virgin Tech the next day as promised by the Amazon Prime next day service. It was packaged like new and proved to be brand new when I opened and examined the contents of the box.This phone is labeled AT&T; at the top but was supposed to be unlocked as I want to use it on T-Mobile. I took it to the local T-Mobile store for them to help me switch my service from a Nokia Lumia 521 running Windows Phone 8 (more on that later) to the Skyrocket. I had to buy a new SIM card because the Nokia has a microSIM while the Skyrocket has a regular (full sized?) SIM. Unfortunately after the store tech switched my account we discovered the phone was locked.I emailed Extra Virgin Tech for an unlock code and, after waiting for the weekend to pass, they sent me a code which worked. I'm now able to use the phone on T-Mobile and have both sent and received test calls. I have also been able to use the T-Mobile 4G service to use the internet.This is a lot of phone for the money.Weighing 4.66 oz. it is only 1/2 oz. heavier than the iPhone 5S which only has a 4\" screen. I notice the extra weight in my pocket because I've been carrying an iPod Touch 5th gen in that pocket for about a year and it weighs only 3.04 oz. I'll get used to it. At least I will only have to carry the Skyrocket now rather than a feature phone and the iPod Touch.The Skyrocket is beautiful with a great AMOLED display, although it is lower resolution than many newer phones. For some reason, perhaps it is AMOLED technology, the display won't turn down as low in brightness as I'd like.The volume out of the rear speaker is loud enough but distorts at max volume. I found I could get more volume out of the phone by going into the equalizer and turning up all frequency bands.The camera works great although there is quite a shutter button lag. I swear it must be about 1 second from button push to capture. The LED flash is very bright. I haven't done a full evaluation on the camera quality yet.Buttons:The power button is located on the upper right side and the volume rocker is located across from the power button on the left side. I find this not to be ideal. When I want to use either button it is too easy to push the button on the opposite side. If I'm holding the phone in my left hand and trying to change the volume it is too easy to turn the Skyrocket off for example.I do like the four touch sensitive buttons below the screen. Some like a physical button but I like the touch sensitive button as I think it will be more reliable over time. I've had, as others have had, problems with the start button on my iPod Touch devices.The phone has a user replaceable battery, the only way I'll buy a smartphone. This proves to be important because one of the biggest weaknesses of the phone is it tends to burn through the battery quick enough that I think it may be challenging to get through a whole day. I am a heavy user but don't make too many phone calls. It's mostly internet usage over the WiFi at home. Just today I left home with the phone 100% charged and one hour later, with no usage, the battery had dropped to 88% - and I had the WiFi turned off at the time.As I said we have been using feature phones and iPod Touch iOS devices for a few years. So we have quite a bit of experience with iOS. There are things I like about Apples operating system but the lack of user customization really irked me. I would recommend an iPod Touch, iPad, or iPhone to someone who isn't too tech savvy, like my sister. Someone who is more tech savvy though could be frustrated as I was with iOS. iOS 7 was a huge disappointment to me with the new \"flat\" design. It was time to move away from Apple.I found T-Mobile has some very interesting plans. For the exact same Verizon $90/month we've been spending for three feature phones with no data, we can now have phone/text/internet service for three smartphones. T-Mobile's cell coverage has been weak but that has changed in 2013. It still doesn't have the coverage of Verizon or AT&T; but it may just work for us.I first purchased the Nokia Lumia 521 from WalMart for $99 to try out the T-Mobile service. It has Windows Phone 8 which I liked, and I liked the phone too. It took only a few minutes to figure out the Windows Phone 8 user interface. I figured out 100% of the phone in about two hours. Unfortunately Windows Phone 8 isn't ready for prime time. Give me a break the brightness can only be set to LOW-MEDIUM-HIGH with no slider. Also there is a single volume control for all functions (radio/mp3/alarms/ringer/etc.) But the killer was there were two or three critical apps that are not available on Windows Phone 8 so I had to make the jump to Android.Android WOW!I'm blown away by the user customization of the Skyrocket/Android. I've spent many hours with it and I think I've discovered only about 70% of what it can do.A big issue for me is how easy it is to control the screen brightness. First keeping it low saves battery power but of course I have to make it brighter when using it outside and I like to turn it all the way down when I use it in bed at night. I found an option Settings->Status Bar->Brightness Control that lets you change the brightness by sliding your finger across the Status Bar. For me this is great.I spent quite a bit of time duplicating the way icons and folders were set up on my iPod Touch. This may or may not be ideal but it is the easiest way for me to transition from iOS to Android. I was mostly able to pull this duplication off. The difference is the apps, from the same organization, don't work the same way on iOS and Android. For example the USA Today news app is quite different on the two platforms while it could be identical. I think the iOS version is better. I don't understand why there would be differences.As I've only had the Skyrocket for 4 days now I will have more to add after I've had it for a while and will report back here.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It didn't work", "Author": "Jerry Orstead", "ReviewID": "R2S6WC08J0IJBY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The headline of this review is not the full story.

It comes with CyanogenMod installed over Android.  That wasn't mentioned in the product ad, and I think it should have been.  I have had some experience with CyanogenMod in the past, and I'm happy with it, but others may not be.  That's why I think it should be mentioned in the advertising.  It wouldn't have been a deal breaker for me, though.  One issue I have with it is, Bluetooth doesn't have the option to auto answer the phone when active.  You still have to manually acknowledge an incoming call, which almost defeats the purpose of hands free operation.  The Android system does have that feature, but apparently CyanogenMod has either eliminated it or hidden it.  I can't find it.The battery life is about what I expected for this type of phone.

I already tried Nokia Lumia with windows OS, which was a complete frustration. I already had a Samsung galaxy mini tablet, so I knew that I would like the galaxy phone as well. The file manager in the Android OS is a real comfort. Just connect your device with USB cable to the computer and copy paste your files! Forget about the hassle of dealing with iTune or similar approach of windows phones!But why I give this a 3 star ranking:1- unlike the Samsung galaxy tablets, the battery runs low rather quickly, if the peripheral equipments, such as camera, music player & ... are used.2- I'm used to listen to my musics by Bluetooth headphones while exercising, running or biking. The Bluetooth connection gets disrupted, sounds going on and off, frequently. That means a poor Bluetooth module!3-GPS built in antenna has a poor performance.

Nothing is perfect!", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, but do not buy from EXTRA VIRGIN TECH!!", "Author": "Vaughn \"The answer man!\"", "ReviewID": "R3H1SUDUTKNDU0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update: THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED!After flashing the phone and working the stock rom and doing some research I discovered that the phone was never truly unlocked.  This phone is advertised as an \"Unlocked\" phone, but this is a lie.  Extra Virgin Tech did not truly unlock the phone but tried to subvert the network lock by installing a custom ROM (Operating System).  This is why the phone was having a problem working on the AT&T; network, which is the network the phone was originally locked to.  After installing the stock ROM, the phone has worked fine on AT&T;, but it could not be used on other networks and required a network unlock key to unlock the phone.  After talking with some Android phone experts, I was informed that flashing the phone with a custom rom (installing a new OS)does not truly unlock a phone because the network lock is part of the Firmware of the phone, not the Operating System software of the phone.  Once a phone is truly firmware unlocked, it will remain unlocked regardless of how many times the phone is flashed with new roms.Extra Virgin Tech never unlocked this phone and should be sued for saying they did.  They still have not answered my emails.  Amazon should be ashamed for allowing sellers such as this to sell through them. I give the phone 5 Stars, but EVT 1 star and Amaxon gets 1 Star for letting EVT sell through them.Original Review:I bought this phone on amazon from Extra Virgin Tech (EVT for short).  The phone is great, but EVT had loaded a custom Operating System (ROM) on it called CyanogenMOD.  This ROM was a bare bones ROM with limited functionality and it had a \"KNOWN\" problem of not working with the AT&T; service. I tried calling EVT only to find they have no phone number. I got an email from Amazon and and sent them an email, which they never responded to. It took me two days to figure out what the problem was.  The only way to fix the problem was to flash the phone with a Stock ROM from Samsung.  This took a long time since I had never done anything like this before.  My first two attempts resulted in the phone being stuck on the start screen (Which scared the crud out of me).  After hours of more searching I found how to fix that and now the phone works fine.I love the phone now, but be warned; DO NOT ORDER IT FROM EXTRA VIRGIN TECH!!!!!!.  They put crappy dysfunctional roms on their phones and offer no tech support or customer service.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Pablo Moreno V \"Pablox\"", "ReviewID": "R3GIR0MO47L2XH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good Phone as described in the page, arrived just in time.

Mischler \"TM\"", "ReviewID": "R3X86PLKTLMMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading all the hype about the S3 that just came out, I wasn't sure if I would be happy with a \"lesser\" model. Plus I have been lusting over the huge screen on the Galaxy Note, and wondering whether to buy one of those. I am happy to say that I cannot imagine being happier with either of those two phones. This phone is amazing - it's fast, it has a wonderful display, and the voice recognition software is excellent. The seller did a great job of shipping the phone and the phone arrived exactly as advertised.The only problem I had was with AT&T.; I live & work in Egypt and came home for the summer. So I went to AT&T; with an older phone (the S2 had not yet arrived) and asked for a SIM card and whatever plan they could give me to keep me connected for the next two months. They hooked me up with GoPhone and said I could add the data plan when my new phone arrived. When I got the S2 I put in the SIM card and called AT&T; to add a data plan. After about 12 hours I still couldn't connect, so I called AT&T; - they said that since this is a 4G phone they had no 4G data plan through GoPhone. So I went to the local AT&T; store, where it took an hour to get hooked up with a regular account and not lose the money I had already spent. I finally learned that I could have gone to several other pay-as-you-go carriers for about half the price. Needless to say, when the summer is over I will not be interested in working with AT&T; again.The only other complaint is the crapware AT&T; adds to the phone - I'll have to do some research to see how to get rid of it; they don't offer an uninstall feature for most of it.Bottom line is this phone is everything I hoped it would be and more - I recommend it highly.

I dread the idea of being locked into a 2-year contract and paying high monthly service fees. I use PureTalk USA, which I have been very pleased with. They piggy back on the AT&T; Go Network (GSM) and offer a lot more for your money. I upgraded from an unlocked/rooted HTC HD2 running Jelly Bean (which developed a bad charging port) and it was like moving from a Prius to a Porsche with respect to performance. I paid $380 for mine (at the beginning of January) and used $200 in Amazon Rewards, so I picked it up for $180. If money was no object, I would have bought an S3. To be honest, I probably would have bought a used one on eBay for $100 less, but I wanted to use my Amazon Rewards to bring the price down. But used ones can easily be over $300 anyway. In the end, I was glad to have a brand new one rather than a used one. Enough of that about shopping. I'm super happy with this phone.I was glad it arrived as it was described. Sometimes with products like this you don't always receive exactly what is listed. I would recommend contacting the seller first to confirm and ask questions. For example, if the phone wasn't unlocked it would have been a real pain to deal with. (FYI - there are several different versions of the S2 out there, both GSM and CDMA. Know what you are buying.) While I was waiting for it to arrive, I scoured the forums at XDA Developers for how to root it and install custom ROMs. As soon as the phone arrived and it was charged up, I rooted it and installed the newest CyanogenMod 10 nightly (which has been extremely stable for me). It went like a charm and took about 15 minutes. Jelly Bean is smooth and fast! I then put on a screen protector.Considering my move from a dinosaur, I haven't found anything I don't like yet about the phone. The screen is amazing. I like the slightly larger screen of the Skyrocket compared to some other models of S2 that are out there. The phone seems to hit a sweet spot in size. It's starting to look a little small compared to some of the newer phones coming out, but it's still very portable and you don't have to start thinking about how you are going to carry it around. You can go to the store and actually see what they look like since it's still for sale. I can use the screen in bright sun. It's not great, but it's visible. I generally like that it doesn't have hardware buttons, but I sometimes wish it had a button to end calls. Other than that, I like the smooth clean front.The camera works very well (8MP). I haven't spent much time with the camera so I can't tell how it compares to a real camera, but when I want pictures I normally use a real camera and to me phone cameras are just for quick snapshots. The front camera (2MP) works fine too. I've got plenty of free memory with my added 32G microsd card. BTW, the phone has a 2G partition that it takes from the internal memory for installing the OS and programs, which I find is more than adequate. I'm impressed with the sound this cranks out. It almost sounds better than my Vaio laptop. If you are concerned about battery life, it seems to be about average for a phone like this which means you need to start the day with a full charge. Juice Defender is an app that can help stretch it out for you.After three weeks of using it, I have found the call quality to be generally very good and clear. The earpiece volume could be a little bit louder, but I use speaker phone a lot anyway. This might vary depending upon what OS you are using. Some calls aren't so good, but that's probably the network connection and not the phone. The phone does register as HSPA+ on the PureTalk (AT&T; Go Network) which is like 3G+ and provides data speeds that are fast enough to be useful (doubtful for streaming video). There are several companies that provide similar phone service on the AT&T; Go Network. I think it would run at full 4G speed if I wanted to pay AT&T; more than twice as much for regular monthly service.PROS:Flexibility being unlockedScreen is big and bright and clearSound is loud and clearCall quality very goodCamera is goodFront facing camera does work with Skype (I tested it)Fast and smoothCons:4G speed only available with AT&T; or T-Mobile. It will work with T-Mobile, but do some research on how to set it up.[Note: I read some places that the phone uses a micro (mini) SIM and that confused me because other places said it used a regular SIM. Mine uses a regular SIM and I think they all do, but I could be mistaken. There is a tool you can purchase to cut it down to size if necessary. Also, I could take this phone overseas and pop in a local SIM card and it would work just fine.]", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good item", "Author": "ton", "ReviewID": "R2C6F3DWAYZB0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good Phone as described in the page, arrived just in time.
