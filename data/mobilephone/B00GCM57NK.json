Almost as good as a regular point and shoot.5. 32 GB of internal storage.6. The buttons on the back are great once you get used to them.Cons-1. Can be difficult to operate with one hand.2. Software bugs.3. No MicroSD card slot or removable battery.4. Quick Remote can be much better.5. LG launcher could be better.6. It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don\u2019t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the \u201cnight\u201d mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don\u2019t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn\u2019t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn\u2019t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can\u2019t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don\u2019t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn\u2019t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Battery life", "Author": "Damasterjj", "ReviewID": "R1D31Z4O2D0609", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone directly from verizon when it was release and let me tell it is the best phone I've ever had. The battery life is amazing I can easily get 2 to 3 days of standby time with moderate usage.  This phone has better processor than Samsung galaxy S4(US version) and HTC ONE. It actually has the same processor as the samsung galaxy note 3.The only significant annoyance that I don't like is the proximity sensor is too sensitive if you turn on the using the power button and sweep downwards for notification screen. the sensor will randomly turn off the screen. I also wish the speaker phone is a little better, callers reported they could't hear me very wellThings that I miss from my previous phones is SD card slot and off screen navigation buttons. I don't mind having the power and volume buttons at the back, it actually makes adjusting the volume easier when the I'm talking on the phone.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best deal on smartphones out there!", "Author": "cliffhokie", "ReviewID": "R3HN437JW37M3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several smartphones, going back all the way to the original Palm and Blackberries to present day.Regarding this phone, here are the few negatives about this phone so that I can move on to the reasons I LOVE this phone.Cons:  the back is glossy and while it doesn't look bad, it is slippery. I didn't mind this, because I knew I would put a case on, but if you are one of those that likes to have a clean phone w/o a case, just beware.This is mostly just a Verizon issue, but Verizon being Verizon, they changed this phone ever so slightly to accommodate wireless charging.  This can be a pro if you use wireless Qi charging, but otherwise, what this means is that you have much fewer case options than the GSM versions because the phone is just a hair thicker.  Literally not enough to notice with the naked eye, but just enough so zero GSM (AT&T;, Tmobile, and any international carrier) cases fit.  That's because no one else on the planet uses the Verizon version and don't find it worth making one just for verizon customers.  There are some good cases by Incipio, Diztronic, etc., but Seidio, Poetic, etc. are lacking.Finally, one tiny con is the viewing angles aren't the best I've seen. Not bad, but not as good as Super AMOLED phones.Pros:  Here's where it gets fun.  The first positive about this phone is almost funny because the reason is due to lackluster sales.  That said, it's the price!  Most of us use contract subsidized pricing, and due to that and it not selling as well as the Galaxy S4, HTC one, Note 3, Iphone 5s, or even the Droid series, it started selling for only $50 only a couple months after it went on sale.  That is a bargain, and here's why:This thing packs pretty much EVERY premium internal hardware and camera feature known for an entry level price.  We're talking Snapdragon 800 quadcore at 2.3ghz, 2 GB DRAM, a sick GPU, 1080p 5.2\" screen with what most consider the best color reproduction yet (think Super Amoled+ color vibrancy on an IPS), all for the price of entry level smartphones at Verizon.  This thing has a better processor than the Galaxy S4 and HTC One, and rivals the note 3.  This is pretty much the best you'll get for processing from Verizon.  This thing blazes through apps and everything you throw at it.  I have downloaded and had several apps open without any issues, all lightening quick.  Touch response is instant.The camera is great!  13mp with physical OIS (not digital like the iphone).  This camera makes great photos in bright and dark situations.  LOVE it.Did I mention the screen is amazing!  Well, while its not the prettiest phone, does it really matter with a phone case on?  And that said, the only part anyone sees is the front.  And this front is AMAZING!  The top, bottom, and especially side bezels are basically non existent.  Even though this phone has a 5.2\" screen, larger than even the S4, it is the same width and height. The front bezels are much slimmer than the iphone, HTC one, and S4. The phone is practically all one sexy super high resolution screen.  Turn it on, and it is GORGEOUS, pictures literally pop.Regarding overall design, for whatever reason, this phone does not look as good as it does in real life as it does on photos online.  I think it's because of the way the camera catches the odd angles on the back, and the subtle nature of the phone.  I got mine in white over the black.  It isn't a beautiful phone like the HTC one, but it is nicely built, solid, and has subtle tasteful design.  Also, as mentioned, everyone uses cases, which means you only see the front anyway.The buttons on the back are odd, but honestly, after a week of use, they are second nature and a non factor.  The don't really help with anything that I can tell except taking self portrait shots (\"selfies\").Finally, one of the other main reasons I purchased this phone, the battery life!  I have read in some places it is second only to the Note 3, and I honestly think they are correct.  At 3000 mah, it is a huge battery, but more importantly, combined with the SD800, it sips energy.  Depending on the day, I go between a heavy user and a medium/heavy user.  I have never not gone through a day with at least 10% juice at the end of the day, and that was with 2+ hours of navi, several hours of graphic intense gaming, surfing, phone calls, videos, etc.  Most days, I have at least 25% juice with heavy use, and almost 50% with medium use.  On work days, I can go two days easily.  I have my phone at 65% brightness, and wifi and bluetooth permanently on.  Other than removing some bloatware widgets that came with it like the Amazon widget, I have done nothing to optimize battery life.  I haven't downloaded juice defender, etc., I haven't turned off any bloatware, and I even have three widgets constantly going. You just don't have to worry about battery saving \"techniques\" with this phone like you do with an iphone or HTC one.  Think droid MAXX, but with a much better phone.Bottom line:  The phone is blazing fast, long battery life, gorgeous screen on a thin and very manageable phone, great camera, all for one heck of a price.  If you care more about function than aesthetics and having the \"it\" phone, this is for you.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Larry Bangs", "ReviewID": "R2HMQ4VJIWYMDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the phone for a month now.  The battery lasts all day.  The phone is much faster than my old Motorola Bionic.  The transition from my old phone could not have been easier.

The phone arrived two days after ordering, I called the 800 number that Amazon had sent me after ordering the phone and just like that all my Google contacts were in the phone.

I am very happy with the size of the phone. I like that it is a little bigger than most, because I can see everything better. The rocker button on the back does take some getting used to. PS, it can also be the button you push to take a picture if you don't want to use the one on the screen. Another neat feature is you tap the screen to wake the phone up. The large clock also has a timer feature which I use for cooking all the time. I love that it has 32 gigs- it will take a long time to use those up!! I have encountered one drawback on this phone, and that could be operator error. I have a lot of trouble when the phone is on speaker with the screen going to sleep. This is problematic when trying to navigate those annoying phone trees! I must say call clarity isn't always that great, but I don't talk on the phone much, so it's not a big deal for me. I play with the phone a lot since its my first real smartphone, and the battery lasts all day. I only charge it at night.
