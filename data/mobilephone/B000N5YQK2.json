I cannot wait to get a new one, because this one is so bad. First of all. There is no screen on the front which is just annoying because you can't see who is calling you or what time it is until you flip the thing open. I get horrible reception everywhere I go, and zero reception in a lot of places. The phone I had before was fine in those same areas. There is no predictive text for text messaging which makes sending a short message a tedious chore. The back cover falls off everyday. Over all it looks nice, but when you get down to it, its just not practical considering all the other phones out there. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Decent cheap phone but a little dissappointing on somethings", "Author": "BH \"BH\"", "ReviewID": "RUP4UJ33K7N1I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall a decent cheap phone, however there are a few things that bother me.1) No external screen to see incoming caller ID and no external time display2) FM reciever is cool but it requires the headset to be plugged in to get reception so even if you want it on speaker the head set nedds to be available.3) The feel of the buttons are very numb, tough to tell if a button was actually pressed or not, not a big deal for dialing but in games it kinda sucks.4)Over all the phone has the awkward feel of the first in the RAZR series and really I don't like that, it's thin sure..but they make up for it in making the just a little too wide for my tastes.5) Reception is ok.... so far it is getting the same reception range my old v220 did with a cracked antenna. Not impressive for a phone that is a much newer release.Again these are just the things I was disappointed with and if these things don't bother you then I am sure it will make a good phone for you. But for me I was a little disappointed. It met my expectations but it certainly did not exceed them in any area.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone Ever!", "Author": "Donna Ible-white", "ReviewID": "R1OT6DSW9E6LYX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst! Worst! Worst! I wouldn't buy this phone for a toddler if I had to... I'm serious! It's reeeeeaaaally slow, sluggish, less than a half MB of available memory, the volume goes and comes, has to charge every day, if it goes off for whatever reason, then it's hells to get it back on at times, I'll type a text message then have to wait and watch the letters come up one by one seconds after like an old typewriter... and I can go on but I wont. I am not trying to pull down the phone, but I really can't find any whistles to lend it. It's really horrible. Buy at your own risk, but if you should ever ask my opinion, I'll tell you plainly- NO! Oh, there is one pro (lol)--> the design is not bad, cute. Lol.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horrible phone", "Author": "M.
