My husband and I looked at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small screen.  I do not eMail, text, surf the internet or listen to music on a phone so do not want a data plan, just a simple phone that can hold my address book.My husband was in an ICU when the my first Nokia 6250 finally had to be replaced.  I put the sim card into my husband's  Blackberri and used it for a frustrating six weeks:  The tiny keys were difficult for my arthritic fingers to use, it was not nearly as comfortable to hold as the Nokia, and I'd never use most of it's features.  I finally gave up on it and found this phone on Amazon.I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use.  I then purchased a mini iPad with a data plan.  It is SO much easier to read and use than the \"smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse.  For me, this is the best of both worlds!", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Flip Phone.", "Author": "Jim Bybee", "ReviewID": "R2BH2Y02NPH1A5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had another brand with a touch screen that didn't work well.  If you touched the phone, not even the screen, it would disconnect the incoming call.  Couldn't carry it in my pocket.  Slightest movement would make the phone do who knows what even with the touchscreen locked.  Gave up on touchscreens after the manufacturer of that phone replace the original and still had the same problem.  Had to discontinue my unlimited data plan because the carrier (AT&T;) didn't care about the problem with the new phone.  I had it over 30 days and that was enough for them .  This is an unlocked world phone.  That means I can use it with any carrier anywhere in the world.  When my contract with AT&T; (yes, they gave me the other phone for a penny when I signed a two year contract, phone doesn't provide what I paid for but the contract is still in effect), I can use this same phone when I switch carriers.  The only thing I don't like on this phone is the inability to delete unused icons from the menu screen, or to put icon shortcuts on the screen that you do use.  Have to open an icon (My Stuff) then scroll to a menu item  (Tools) then scroll to Recent Calls to see who called you when you were unavailable.  Would be nice to have that menu item as an icon on the main screen.  RECEPTION IS GREAT.  Have to emphasize that feature.  I'm in a rural 3G area (4G coming soon, or so they say) and the other phone from AT&T; had two, one or no bars of service.  This phone has either four or five all the time.

I've even used prepaid phones that are superior. Let's get right to it, shall we?- The battery cover comes off if you even look at it the wrong way.- The paint is flaking off the cover, the plastic cover is coming off the screen, and the thing is just generally falling apart. I used the phone lightly, and my previous phones held up fine after years of such use.- An incredibly simple function like changing your ring settings requires navigating through about four levels deep of obscure menu options.- Other basic tasks, like adding a new contact, are similarly laborious.- Ditto for checking your voicemail.- I knew I was getting T9 texting, but still, basic stuff like entering numbers and special characters are far more difficult than they need to be.- One of the buttons on the side is a Push to Talk. I inadvertently push this about four times a day and have to close out of it.Maybe these all sound like small things, but this adds up to enormous frustration in using this phone, which is barely still in one piece.

Click an option and it seems like it didn't work.  But if you click again, oops you went too far...Waaaaaay too many useless apps pre installed and they can't be removed.  If you don't have a data plan, 80% of the features on this phone are inaccessible.  All the apps seem to be from AT&T.;The PPT button.  Way too easy to press, then you have to wait for it to tell you there's no data service (if no dataplan).The volume button is way too low, you have to hold your phone halfway too low to use it with your thumb.Would be great if they moved the PPT button and slid the volume up.You can't hold the phone in your right hand while charging.  The cable sticks out the side making it very difficult to hold.My phone seems to have a problem with turning off randomly for no apparent reason.  I don't know if its just mine or a common issue.  It appears to be truly random.  Lately it seems to not even want to turn back on, or it turns on and vibrates but immediately turns back off (It's fully charged).You have to hold the power on button far too long just to turn it on.The menus are just too annoying to use.  Menu, My Stuff, Tools, just to get to common basic applications like the alarm or calculator.So sloooooooow switching menus!Sim card holder is a bit wonky but not too difficult to get used to if you don't use it often.I've always liked nokia phones but this one is going back.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Angela Adams", "ReviewID": "RMNKB73K0VX7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was purchased for my father who had not changed phones in ten years.
