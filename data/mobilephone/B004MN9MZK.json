Awesome apps market. It does take a while for some apps to load but its not the end of the world if it takes an extra second to load. Very Happy with this phone. And it came unlocked just like stated and so far no issues battery life could be better but then again it is a smartphone bein used nonstop.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent phone for the money", "Author": "Dibby Blandford \"Dibby\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q3GFWXL4OILS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was advertized as new but didn't seem to be when unboxed.But it works well.  The camera is very good and has all the features of a standalone 5mp point and shoot.It's android 1.6 and can't be upgraded as Samsung has declared it an orphan.But there's lots of apps for it on Android market.  Plays videos smoothly and the resolution is better than the low-end smartphones T-Mobile is selling.  Wifi is good, seems to have better range than low-end phones I've compared it to.Battery seemed to run down fast but I found a new battery for $4.00 and that seems to last a lot longer.  My impression that it was a used phone is now pretty sure.  There was no GPS app on it but a couple free ones on the Market work very well.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Purchase of the telephone Samsung SGH-T939 Behold 2", "Author": "comprador 1", "ReviewID": "R2GSZJRAIDAZI8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I give him a star because I had problem with the telephone on having bought it they it sent without free hands or original loader the telephone parecia that was re-promoted despues communicates with the seller me respondio with responsibility and rapides every execpto re-put the manual that appears in the photo me sending a manual of rapid guide and the telephone has not even 6 months that I it change and already on the part where it connects to load appearing problems to load for one month apparently this one as mop the connector of load of the telephone to be a new telephone not deberia this fault and the battery to present me salio bad I had to buy other one", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is a piece of shist. don't waste your money like I did", "Author": "danij", "ReviewID": "R28UKI2XZSF4KZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone gets 1 star. The camera/video are excellent.  Battery life is excellent.  It's a good thing that the back comes off very easily because it is needed to take the battery out, then back in because the phone constantly freezes. What's up with the airplane mode coming on at random? Hellz if I know. Sometimes the phone gets hot. These were suppose to be brand new phones, but could possibly be refurbished. The phone came with a quick start up instruction manual, but did not come with the actual booklet. Is that the way new phones come nowadays? No booklet? The headphones that came with it? One line for ears is wayyyy longer than the other. Is that how they are made these days? It's been a few years since I have bought a phone.  I have downloaded a few things on my phone, like pandora music. Out of the blue, one morning as I was getting up, The phone blasted out music. Scared the shist outta me.  I began laughing because I was feeling a little down, and the song that came on was, \"Keep your head up,\" by Tupac Shakur. Perfect timing. Made my day lol.  There is something called Picasa, that I have never heard of which is on the phone. It plays music @ random also. LOL good tunes. I accidentally learned about a new radio station. Sometimes the voice dialer comes on to dial someones number. One day, there was a button that popped up, which tells you how to use the phone, but I was busy. Went to check it out later, but can't find the darn button. lol jokes on me. Guess I could go online to download some freakn instructions or go to T Mobile and ask for a book, which they will probably charge me for.  Sometimes the phone does a random dial. I can't figure out why because it has an annoying automatic security screen lock that can't be bypassed.  What is really annoying is my 73 year old mother constantly calling to tell me that her phone is acting up. I have to guide her through on what to do. Two phones, $139.00 a piece. Don't make the mistake of buying it, unless you want to use the phone as a camera or video. There are other things, but I am too busy to write more. I hope you future buyers get the picture.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone for friend", "Author": "Frank A.
