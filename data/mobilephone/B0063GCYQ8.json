{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Keypad unlocks way too easily", "Author": "Steven Martin", "ReviewID": "R1JSJM441VFQRE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I transferred my home land line number to one of these Go Phones as a way to save money. That part is working fine. But this particular phone has a major flaw. The keypad unlocks way too easily when you don't want it to. To unlock it you push one button followed by another button. We found this two-button combo was being constantly pushed accidentally when the phone is in our pocket, backpack, or purse.We came up with a trick to help with the problem but it's a major pain to use all the time. We set up a 4-number security code on the phone that we have to put in before the phone will turn all the way on. So now, when we want to put the phone back in our pocket or whatever, we have to power the phone all the way off, then turn it back on without putting in the security code. That way the phone will be on and ready for the 4-number security code to be entered. Pain.If the phone could be set to require the security code before each unlocking of the keypad, that would be cool. But that simply isn't an option. So we have to power it all the way down and turn it back on after each call or text to add that extra layer of keypad-locking.As for the rest of the phone's performance, it's reasonably good for a bottom-of-the-barrel, no-features phone. Sometimes it locks up and we have to take the battery out. That always sucks. But overall, we'd be fairly satisfied with this simple phone if it weren't for its pocket-dialing ways.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A piece of junk", "Author": "Amy S", "ReviewID": "R2MRRXSDBCKSHJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone  is the worst cell phone I have ever owned. It has a short battery life, an SOS feature that allows me to pocket dial when the phone is supposedly locked, and after I tried to reset the PIN setting, I got locked out of my phone. It asked me to enter a new PIN, then to confirm the PIN. Then the phone tells me The PIN is not valid and I have so many tries until I am locked out. I am ready to get a new phone that doesn't drive me bonkers. This phone was a waste of money.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible cheap phone", "Author": "momof2", "ReviewID": "R2KGK62JKNJSPU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is a cheap piece of junk.

It may not have been able to hold a charge; it would not turn on for more than a second at a time, and that not reliably.Amazon accepted it as a return for refund.What I had missed in the fine print is that this is not an item sold by Amazon. This means you cannot return it for replacement, but must buy a second. There are two other like items sold for $28.79 AT&T; U2800A GoPhone Prepaid GSM Cell Phone and $35.79 AT&T; U2800A GoPhone Prepaid Cell Phone None of these are sold by Amazon and from what I can tell, none are sold by AT&T;I suspect that this is an out of production model and the various vendors are selling off overstocked remnants from other companies. An indicator was that mine arrived in the usual heavy plastic clamshell, itself a pain to open; plus a diabolical plastic device that was impossible to remove. This additional security makes sense if the item is hanging on a display in a low end brick and mortar store but has no use in a mail order operation.A little more shopping and I have another Go Phone with better reviews on order. This one comes with a prepaid card which brings its cost down to the same as this item. Depending on the results of that selection I will review it later.I cannot recommend the U2800A cell phone.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for what it is", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R2HCKTL3DJCBX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't understand the bad reviews, because this is perfectly adequate for what it is. It lacks a camera and any modern features, but it is a good phone. It needs a charge twice or so every week, which is amazing considering the puny 900 mAH battery.Call quality is phenomenal.The keypad works well enough, but is poor for extended typing. Of course, this isn't meant to be a heavy texting phone.I've dropped the phone a few times, but nothing bad has happened.I'm in loud environments a lot, but the speaker is good enough to cut through the noise. The vibration motor is good as well.I inserted my AT&T; SIM and it was good to go, but it's not possible to send or receive MMS. It's a nice, small phone and the battery lasts for a good while.This is a good phone for those who want just a plain old feature phone, with very basic features.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "P.O.S.", "Author": "WEBBORG2000", "ReviewID": "RWF4RWY0QL1U3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is a cheap piece of plastic. You can't do much besides make the occasional call or txt.  Its not possible to even update the display pic or have new ringtones since there is no driver available for this phone.
