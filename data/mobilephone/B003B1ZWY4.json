Most of the good apps are not free. Only a few good ones are free, such as KAPLAN's GRE word app and Dictionary.com's dictionary and thesaurus.Operating system: It comes with 5.0 version of the Operating System but you can upgrade it for free to version 6.0.Memory: It doesn't have a lot of memory so you will DEFINITELY need a memory card if you want to store more than 4 songs and some pictures on it. It comes with 35MB of storage space for music and that is woefully inadequate for today's phone user. There is much more space for apps though so you won't have to worry about that.LOOKS: The phone is not very big but it is not small. Please buy a phone case and a screen protector so you can retain your phone's value and look for a long time. The keys are small but because they are kinda slanted you should not have a problem typing.Warning, this phone takes FOREVER AND A DAY to boot up so please don't turn off your phone unless you absolutely have to.BBM and BIS: You will have to dig into pocket when you get this phone if you intend to do anything with it because all IM apps, e-mail and such have to go through your Blackberry e-mail address and you will have to pay for Blackberry Internet Service in order to get the e-mail address. Depending on the carrier you use, you might have to spend about $20 extra per month for the internet service. I think that's because you have to access RIM's servers and you need to pay for that.CAMERA: The camera takes pretty good pictures. I've seen better but this is pretty good. One thing that I've never seen on another phone, so far, is the video light. The video light is rather unique and is brighter, I have tested it, than the flashlight on a Nokia phone.BATTERY: The battery life on this phone ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!! It cannot last for more than 12 hours or so. I have to charge my battery every single day and that is not cool.CALLS: You can make calls from a lot of places on this phone. The calls are not that loud but it's ok. Speakerphone is also available. You can makes notes about what happens on each call and I like that a lot. You can also do pretty much anything on the phone while you are on a call. Also, if you want to make a call and you are, for example, playing a game you can just jump out of the game, make your call and jump right back into the game without losing your progress and that's awesome!All in all, this is not the best phone ever (HTC has that) but this is a very good phone to have especially when it comes to keeping social.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "ANGELBIS DAVILA", "ReviewID": "R3LCQZKZIT8GQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good, excelente producto lo recomiendo, de gran calidad, mejor de lo que suponia.Very good, excelente producto lo recomiendo, de gran calidad, mejor de lo que suponia.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "bueno", "Author": "Humberto Jose Cordero \"humberto\"", "ReviewID": "R1D4UM3MQU7OYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "el articulo se recibio en perfecto estado muy buen servicio seguire haciendo negocios con este proveedor en el futuro lo recomiendo", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone is great, the seller is not", "Author": "Sebastian Danon", "ReviewID": "R1ZHK2KEGL3WLC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought my phone from SellPhoneStop who delivered a refurbished phone that fell apart when my little daughter (2 feet tall) dropped it.
