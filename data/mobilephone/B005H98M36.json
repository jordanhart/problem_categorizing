The first time, I dropped it down the stairs, so I thought that was responsible for the lagging, freezing, and shutting down. I went and got a brand spankin' new one, and the problems persisted. This phone always shuts off and freezes. It's really annoying. Save your money and buy a more reliable phone.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone 4G Rocks", "Author": "Mark V.

I wanted a fully functional web browsing smartphone.What I got has been a decent iPhone imitation, I suppose.  It's pretty much a low-end or smaller Galaxy.  So it's probably a pretty standard demonstration of the Android OS - lots of apps available, and some that you can't remove even though you'd really like to.  I have relied on it extensively for email and quick information look-ups (addresses, maps, store hours, etc).  It will also take video and voice recordings for as long as you want, according to the limits of the memory or SD card.The photos and video are decent, though they have that annoying periscopic (I think that's the right word - all angles exaggerated) lens that's more or less pervasive in almost all tiny cell phone cameras (except perhaps the Sony Xperia that I tried).  This makes all the photos rather inaccurate.  Also, the audio is pretty crappy for recordings, but it's not like it has a decent external microphone or anything.What really annoys me about this phone is the on-screen virtual keyboard - that I still make a lot of mistakes even after a year and a half of use.  This is after optimizing the keyboard settings and even downloading a better keyboard.  I detest it so much that I'm willing to can the full screen entirely for my next phone, and get one with a good real keyboard - as few options as that leaves me these days.Also, the phone has a habit of intermittently freezing.  This often happens when someone's calling and it won't let me answer it, or when I'm selecting the person I want to call, but it spits me back out into the home screen.  These two behaviors happen a lot, and I have to reboot the phone to get it back to normal.  It also sometimes says it has no signal when there is normally plenty of signal available - again, annoying, and another reboot fix (if I'm lucky).The apps on it, do generally function pretty well.  Facebook, though, started draining the battery so much - even when logged off - that I had to remove it entirely.So in summary, it performs all the apps and features of a decent Android smartphone pretty well, but its basic performance ability has become increasingly unreliable, so it could really benefit from a firmware upgrade, or SOMETHING.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "one of the cheapest 4g phones available at the time", "Author": "J.
