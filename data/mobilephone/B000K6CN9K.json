Very noticeably warped. Almost ready to explode. I threw it back in the box as quickly as i could, sealed it back and now i have to return it which will probably be such a hassle. I guess i could just purchase another battery to keep from having to go thru that headache. Motorola is really at fault though.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "horrible", "Author": "malsvig", "ReviewID": "R2ZA3CLP5I6BCX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed a phone to replace the razor I had because I'm keeping the same basic, slow (2g), phone only service I had before. Received as expected. I just transferred the sim chip. Just make sure your service is the same or similar to the original carrier for the phone. About 2 weeks after getting the phone it started rapid cycling on the phone volume. Couldn't hear the phone! Opened the phone up, a thin copper ring supposed to be around the camera eye was stuck on the lower back part inside the phone, I believe this has a shortng effect on the phone. Had another of same phone  has a thin metal antennae bar across bottom inside of hone and saw shorting marks there after it died. Suspect keypad faults also for continuous press of keypad repeatedly accessing  phone volume. Buy carefully after review suppliers feedback. I did get a red one from don't recall vendor that worked good..", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "samuel", "ReviewID": "R25ZFIUHY5EAEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i using like iha all over with calls all over the world; i love how it will last not smart phone those break easy and they are expensive and never have have an 1 year warranty ever", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Have battery charging issue", "Author": "Rajeeva Gupta", "ReviewID": "R1UGZEMS7GW00O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery is not charging.
