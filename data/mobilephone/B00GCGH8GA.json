The shipping is super fast!!! The reason i didn't give this phone 5 stars is because it does have a couple of down sides; it downloads apps, etc. Slowly most times, the camera quality is not that great ((especially the front camera;very poor quality)), and for some reason it wont let me view youtube videos ((to view videos i have to request desk top site and sometimes it still wont load after doing that)). But over all it is a pretty good phone for the $180 dollar price. And it does work everywhere unlike the at&t; samsung galaxy note i had (that was 4G)this 3G phone is pretty good, everyone thinks its a samsung....lol... little do they know! --p.s. not a dual sim phone...i have at&t; go phone (no contract) pop the sim card in and go!!!", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good.....", "Author": "Nicky Holsey", "ReviewID": "R37S87ZPVYQYTL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone arrived from HK to USA in ten days which was well within the estimated delivery time. The phone was well packaged. Unfortunately within a couple of days it wouldn't charge, there was a problem with the charger port. I contacted the seller, they were very understanding, gave me suggestions as to how to correct the problem, in the end they arranged for a replacement to be sent to me, and after I sent the faulty phone back to them they reimbursed my postage costs to HK. I received the replacement within two weeks, so far it works as it should.I only have good things to say about the seller, their service was second-to-none and I would highly recommend buying from them (Masaistore). As regards the phone, it seems to be almost exactly the same as the Galaxy Note 3, which my friend has, there does not seem to be or many differences, but there must be considering the difference in price ($700 for the Galaxy compared to $160 for this one).The touch response is quick, it has excellent picture quality. I have downloaded all my apps without any problems. I put my Simple Mobile SIM card in and it worked straight away. I decided to buy the two-year warranty offered with the phone in case I have problems down the line (like the charger port again! hopefully that was just a one-off) but for now, I am very happy with my purchase and extremely happy with the seller.If I can get two years use out of this phone, I will be more than satisfied. By the way the Galaxy Note 3 cases fit this phone, which is great,  and gives me lots of options for when I get bored with the one I have.

I was ecstatic to find a cheaper version of the Galaxy Note, but now I realize that cheaper isn't always better. After only a month, this phone is already going to crap. The home button randomly stopped working, the screen is very touchy and doesn't always respond correctly. The description states that it is a 13 mp camera, but it clearly isn't. I would hardly even classify it as 6 mp. Although the screen is nice for browsing, it is way to big to fit comfortably in your hand. So dissapointed that I just barely missed the time period for returns.
