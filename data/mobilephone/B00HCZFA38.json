MA", "ReviewID": "R2Q6Y5L2UY043O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second smartphone I purchased (my first one is the same phone, in black).  After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use.  I got this one from PriceAngels.  Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay.  The seller was very prompt in getting back to me.  For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level.  The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones.  Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1.  The FM radio is very clear.  You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2.  This phone has a built in GPS.  I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone.  The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more.  If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all.  For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3.  Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese.  This does not bother me.  I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4.  The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company.  This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me.  This is a great phone and the price is great.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "hello", "Author": "Juan Antonio Guerrero", "ReviewID": "R2MBV7R38KTEB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent good happy phone arrived earlier than expected I recomiendo this phone is great good quality good performance very fast if you want a big elegant white fast this phone is .. all you have is that this does not come dipositive is Spanish and I am from Dominican Republic .. acostumbro on me but I love is great I recommend it to all .  battery lasts a long bino has good performance one but it is great", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing phone i loved it", "Author": "vence flores", "ReviewID": "R3POZ6UYVFUJMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the phone is good i liked it its amaizing a loved it the only thing that i oreder in white and they send mi in blackbut is an amaizing phone", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HCZFA38"}}
