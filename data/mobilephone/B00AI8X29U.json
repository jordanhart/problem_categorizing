{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No Storage!", "Author": "Noelle", "ReviewID": "R25S0TMJ7VDPZE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Less than 48 hours after purchasing this phone through Radio Shack on the Net10 network, something popped up saying low storage.  I had only a couple of apps that I downloaded.  It is now a month later and every day this pops up.  I currently have NO apps downloaded and no pictures on the phone.  After speaking to the manufacturer, I was told this is something that will happen with this phone and there is nothing that can be done as it comes with limited storage.  She suggested I delete my contacts. I asked her how I was supposed to use the phone if I did not have peoples' contact information.  My phone will not allow me to download a single app on this phone.  How can one advertise a phone as an android, if you are unable to download any apps?  Even with no apps downloaded on my phone, the low storage continues to pop up.  Do not buy this phone!", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone...bad smartphone", "Author": "plasticbob", "ReviewID": "R1VBPRQZ1U6L8R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The reviews are right. Not much memory. Akthough if you want a phone to just make calls and text, its great. Thats were it ends. Dont expect to download more than a few apps.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great (updated)", "Author": "EW \"emmmw\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKW9A93OSGYK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to use as an extra phone to do run some apps that could only be run on an Android platform.  It has operated well enough on Net10 that I will be moving all our phones to Net10.  I realize this review is about the phone itself, but unless the phone performed well I would never have thought to change service.  This phone is cheap and cheaply made.  If you remember you purchased a cheap phone and expect it to perform as such, you won't be disappointed.  I have had no storage problems and no problem at all downloading several apps.  It can not compare to my iPhone but it also didn't cost $600!  The screen is clear enough for me but couldn't satisfy my son's desire for great graphics and fast processing.  For my needs it is perfect.  I use my tablet for heavy graphics use so this is a phone for me!  Works trouble-free.UPDATED:  Still works, but I too have run into the lack of memory issue.  At first it seemed fine, but now I cannot read an e-mail without getting the \"full\" emblem with no real way of moving or deleting items... and I've loaded very little on this phone.  I will stay with Net10 but willl change my phone to a better phone.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone.", "Author": "schaf-susa", "ReviewID": "R3P9NDGUS7A0J0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I liked the product okay but I have net 10 and I had problems setting it up.  They shut off my phone twice and the second time they gave me the wrong phone number.  When I would call and ask why something wasn't working, they would tell me I would have to call from another phone and then they would tell me they would fix it but all my contacts would be erased so I would have to reprogram it each time.  I still don't have gps because I know I will have to go thru the same hassle.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.99", "Features": "Android 2.3 Gingerbread Operating System\n3.2 inch Touch Screen\n3.0 Megapixel Camera & Video Recorder\nBattery Talk Time up to 6 hours; Standby Time up to 6 days\nIncludes Battery, Charger, Activation Card, Service Guide and User Manual", "Name": "LG Optimus Dynamic Android Prepaid Phone (Net10)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416l3ZD4kvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AI8X29U"}}
