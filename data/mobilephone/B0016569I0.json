Though locked and useless in the USA, it was cheaply and easily unlocked by the Motorola dealer once in a country where locking phones is illegal.From then on, it worked great, with good battery life even on an old battery and stronger signal in weak areas than most other phones. I was sorry to have given it away when going to the USA - it took me a while to find a handset I likes as well.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disposable starter phone, will not hold up under intensive use", "Author": "DarthRad", "ReviewID": "R2WDIXAA8B37WR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a very basic phone with no camera and no bluetooth capability.  That would have been fine for me except that this is also not a very rugged phone.  I myself have gone through about three of these over the last five years.  My kids have gone through even more.The reception and sound and ability to store small bits of music is good.  It has always worked well in international travel.  I have the Motorola software to install all this stuff onto the phone.  These are the reasons that I give it two stars.Last year, I finally switched over to an LG CU515 phone, which has a camera and bluetooth, but very limited capability of transferring the photos to a computer.  OK so far.My son's V180 phone broke again recently  - it stopped sensing the battery level correctly and would not charge.  And then, when I tried to fix it, the screen went black (or dark blue).The most common killer of this phone is when the display stops working, usually manifest as just a solid dark blue nothing.I am staring at a bag full of some NINE, count 'em NINE dead V180 cellphones - and these don't include the four or five that my oldest daughter have managed to destroy.  Almost all of these have bad display screens.  Several have vibrators that stopped vibrating, probably the second most common defect.  Not charging or sensing the battery has happened at least once before also, so this is not unusual.I have used this bag of parts to try to fix these problems by using parts from this bag of dead phones.  I succeeded today, as I took a previously  malfunctioning phone from my son, one where the vibrator had quit but where the display was still functioning, and took out its electronics board and put it in his current phone with the bad battery charging.Fixing a dead display, however, is almost always hopeless with the V180, and I have never succeeded except briefly.  Today it dawned on me that the problem is probably not with either the color LCD screen or with the display driver in the electronic board that is the heart of the cellphone.  No, the problem is almost certainly in the plastic connector BETWEEN the electronic board in the body of the cellphone and the LCD screen.  The plastic connector contains the multiple thin wires that drive the LCD screen.  And it has to flex each time you open and close this clamshell cellphone - flex without breaking the wires.  The phone vibrator is glued and soldered onto this plastic sheet wire connector on the LCD cover side of the phone just beyond the hinge of the cover.So the whole wire connection between the body with the electronic board and the cover lid with the LCD screen and vibrator gets stressed more than it needs to be.  The weak point is probably that the vibrator is glued right on top of the connector wires.  Each time the cellphone is opened or closed, the tiny wires in the connector get flexed - in time, microscopic cracks probably build up.  Each time the vibrator fires off for a phone call, the stressed points probably get vibrated wider.I wish these phones were better - I don't think Motorola makes them anymore, so I'm not sure where these phones are coming from, especially when they are supposed to be \"new\".", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Working great in Thailand", "Author": "Vic M", "ReviewID": "R1KRCZYYNDAZX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this phone as a gift and it works well and is easy to use.

But, a couple of days ago the internal screen went blue.  Can receive but not make calls.  I looked on here and saw some refurbished ones for $9.99 (plus about $6 for shipping).  Well, I put it in my cart one day, then the next day I looked and saw it was no longer available from the supplier, so I looked again and Wow!! the price jumped to $25.00 for used and $39.99 for refurbished and $149.99 for new.
