{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Old School phone but has a nice slick look", "Author": "Alii", "ReviewID": "RBUXHCVR7OO6N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its impossible to find a basic phone without a data plan anymore, so this was a good find.  I love the look of it it is unbelievably light and very thin, so it doesnt look like an old phone.  My only complaint was that the text messages cannot be organized based on the contact name, your texts just go into and inbox and outbox folder, with all of your text convos mixed up.  Another issue I had was that the phone was not receiving incoming calls.  So I called verizon and after ten minutes it was fixed.  Basically they had me reprogram it making sure that my old phone was completely turned off because sometimes if you leave your old phone on it messes up the activation.  Overall i'm happy with this phone, its old school but looks real modern.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool phone, horrible battery", "Author": "squirreljuice", "ReviewID": "R905E7289YKVO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like this phone. I love slider phones and this one i had owned previously, so i decided i would try it again. I forgot just how badly the battery life sucked. I literally cannot go more than 16 hours on a charge with light use of about 5 text messages a day. If you are willing to carry a charger around with you everywhere, then this is an awesome phone. The phone itself is pretty quick. Its no smartphone but it can get the job done. The thing that takes the longest to load is the videos menu. If it had a better battery life it would have a 5 star rating, but the battery life killed it for me and i went back to my LG Cosmos (which is a horrible phone but has way better batter life). I wish the EnV 1 wasn't so expensive or i would get another one of those.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "oldie but goodie", "Author": "REBECCA", "ReviewID": "RKUKTZIJZ3XF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was used but appeared almost new. i was very happy with this phone and i would purchase again.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "OLD SCHOOL BUT STILL A GREAT DESIGN ..", "Author": "peter christian", "ReviewID": "R1Q96FBAKZJ6N7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Replacement for a dear old dumb friend .Perfect for those days when all you need isa life line in your trousers without any bellsand whistles", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review of my Verizon Samsung Sway U650 Sllider Phone", "Author": "Alina Novo", "ReviewID": "RPOIEHGT95U1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I liked it very much, it was also in very good condition...I used to have it before, but then one day the push on keys did not work..
