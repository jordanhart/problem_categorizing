Remington", "ReviewID": "R2FXHQEYYJIQ3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung S4 cell phone is the hottest and newest phone on the smart phone market.  This Android device has gotten much press and rightly so.  In terms of specifications, the S4 has a lot going for it that has it as the leader of the pack over many smart phones.  But at first glance, this new phone looks and feels much like its predecessor, the Galaxy S3.  So what makes this phone different and why should you be interested in purchasing it?  This review will explore those issues and help answer that question.When you have a good thing going, why not start with that as your baseline.  Samsung has done just that with the S4.  The S3 and the S4 are very similar on many levels and very different in key areas.  Their size is essentially the same at 5.38\" x 2.75\" x .31\".  This actually makes the S4 .7mm thinner than the S3.  Its weight is 4.6 ounces, .7 ounces lighter than the S3.  Comparing the two, Samsung has increased the size of the screen to a 5\" display that offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels.  While other phones offer similar resolutions, none have the same quality image that comes from the Super AMOLED screen offered on the S4.  Side-by-side comparisons with phones such as the HTC One find the S4 shines with more prominent resolution and richer color tones.The screen also has improved capacitance over the S3 and previous Samsung offerings.  This improved capacitance supports phone use while gloves are worn.  Those who live in cold climates or those who are fashion conscious and wear gloves will find this enhanced capability helpful.  While this capability is a nice addition, it takes some getting used to.  Because it is more sensitive, it's easy to falsely register a finger press if you hover your hand over the screen in the just the right way.  Hopefully Samsung can correct this performance flaw with future software upgrades.Regardless, the S4 screen is a remarkable technological creation.  Its visual performance makes it like a smaller cousin of much larger HD televisions.  It is a beautiful piece of work and the highest quality screen of its size presently on the market.At first glance, the camera appears to also be the same as the S3.  This is, in fact, not the case.  The S4 houses a whopping 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel, front facing camera.  The rear-facing, 13-megapixel camera image is excellent.  The imaging capabilities of both cameras extend past the raw hardware with added features built into their associated software.  There is software to do most anything you can think of with the images taken.  Software even uses both the front and back camera to offer all kinds of imaging effects from panoramic images to slow motion videos.Much of the new hardware, software, and extended features built into the S4 place heavy processing demands on the phone's engine.  Because of this, Samsung has integrated a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor to help keep things purring along smoothly.  At the time of this review, this makes the S4 one of the fastest smartphones on the market.Coupled with this increased processing power is an expanded memory card slot for additional storage.  Samsung is selling the S4 in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB configurations.  For those considering the S4 with 16GB of storage, this may be a bit limiting.  Approximately 6GB is eaten up by the OS and installed apps, which leaves a scant 8-9GB of storage.  This is 2GB less storage than the S3.  The S4 supports the installation of up to an additional 64GB using a Micro SD card.  If you're considering purchasing this phone, you might want to add a Micro SD card to your purchase and expand the base memory, or purchase an S4 with a higher amount of integrated storage.Keep in mind that the more data you add to your Micro SD card, the more information the S4 has to parse.  If you have a 64GB SD card packed with pictures and videos, when you open the Gallery to view them, even the quad-core processor will crank itself silly to host them for you; it will take time for them to display.  There's no working around this.  It's the nature of the beast.  Just accept this as a current limitation based on processor speed and storage mass.The front of the phone contains a number of additional sensors that monitor eye movement and proximity so the phone knows how far it is from your ear.  An infra red blaster is integrated into the top of the phone to enable it to act as a remote, with the appropriate app installed to function as a remote.  These sensors and the infra red blaster offer many new features not available with the S3.  The phone can act as a remote control for your television, CD/DVD player, A/V receiver, and even home appliances that support remote control.  The eye sensor offers additional features that control screen dimming and auto pausing when you look away from the screen.  Likewise, when you look at the screen, dimming and auto pausing resume their normal operation.Applications available to support the additional sensors include Air View, Air Gesture, and Smart Scroll.  While these features are futuristic and helpful in theory, they aren't flawless in practice.  They are also rather complex to learn and use, which detracts from the concept of simplicity when it comes to operating the device.  Take this into consideration when adopting the phone for your use.  Not all the features have to be used at once.  You may find some features helpful while others are an annoyance.  They are all highly configurable and it will take some time and practice to set them up to your liking.Like the S3, the S4 supports Samsung's S Beam and near field communication (NFC).  S Beam allows two Samsung phones to be placed back-to-back so they can share multimedia content such as videos, music, pictures, etc.  The devices only need to be placed a few centimeters from each other to link, and, unlike Bluetooth, no pairing is needed.  Communication is provided by WiFi Direct, which makes transfer speeds quite good.Samsung has received many user complaints over the quantity of polyurethane used with their phones.  They are plastic centric in construction and many consumers feel this detracts from a robust, solid feel.  The S4 seems to have taken this into consideration with the addition of a flat metal bezel around the side edge of the phone.  Much like the iPhone, the S4 has a metallic edge that augments its former plasticized edge construction.The case itself is similar to the S3.  The rear cover is easily removed to reveal the battery, SIMM card, and Micro SD card.As for battery life, the S4 stock battery is 2,600mAh compared to the 2,100mAh S3 battery.  This is a 20% increase in battery size with no added thickness to the phone's form factor.  In fact--as stated earlier--the S4 is .7mm thinner than the S3.  This added battery storage is required due to the increased screen size and additional features and applications.  Each person's use is highly personalized, so it's difficult to gauge how this battery will perform with your personal use, but, in general, it seems to be an adequate amount of power storage for moderate use.  Still, it will more than likely require daily charging.  If this is a concern to you, you might consider an extended-life battery.  These batteries are freely sold on Amazon and other locations, but most of them require an aftermarket back to the case that will replace your stock rear cover.  Extended batteries mean heftier weight and added thickness to the phone.  Another option is to purchase an additional battery as a backup for when your primary battery discharges.Out of the box, the S4 comes equipped with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and a huge amount of software.  If there's one complaint about this phone it is in relation to the amount of features and software bundled with it.  The S4 has a mountain of software that, at first glance, can be absolutely overwhelming.  It will take time to sort out and learn everything this phone can do, so pencil in an evening or two to explore, configure, and learn what's new and how to use it.  The list is far too extensive to cover in this review, but it should be stated that every feature the phone has is supported by associated software.  In addition to this software, Samsung has packed new applications to satisfy every possible type of user.  You may find it all useful, but this is doubtful.  Most likely, you'll use a subsection of all the software installed and make it your own.  One could say Samsung has given the consumer the benefit of choice by adding so many features and so much software.  Sometimes it's better to have too much than not enough, and this is true here.  Rather than be overwhelmed by it, see it as a library of possibilities that supports a healthy amount of functions.  Decide which functions are useful to you and learn them.  For those functions and applications that hold little interest, leave them alone for now.The S4 is an enhanced deconstruction and reconstruction of the S3.  If you currently own the S3 and are considering an upgrade, take stock in the added features and capabilities of the S4.  The S4 will give you the latest Android has to offer; a larger amount of storage space; a fabulous HD screen; a high-quality, 13-megapixel camera; huge amounts of added features and software; and a fantastic processor under the hood.  If these things are important to you, then the S4 may be an exciting upgrade.  If you're happy with the features and performance of your current S3, then you may want to save your money and stay with what you have.Overall, the S4 is a brilliant device.  It's not without its flaws and there is always room for improvement.  While Apple performed wonders defining the modern smartphone, Samsung has helped take the concept one step further.  If you're looking to upgrade your older smartphone and break into the Samsung Galaxy world for the first time, the S4 is a fantastic selection.  It is, arguably, the best Android phone on the market, at present.  Some may say it's the best smartphone, period.  Each person's decision and opinion is highly individualistic.  One thing is for sure, Samsung has pulled out all the stops to ensure consumers get the most for their money, and they have set the bar even higher for newcomers to take the mantle of achievement to a new level.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung S4 Battery malfunction", "Author": "cesar", "ReviewID": "RY7OZFLDCO5W6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Three months ago, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB 4G/LTE Black Factory Unlocked, International from you.

This phone is not intended for US market.This review is written form the perspective the phone's use in USA. I considered, but did not buy this phone. My review is based on the phone's specification and my research.I had multiple motivating factors for spending big buck and get this cutting edge phone:1) I wanted to buy my own phone and keep it as long as I like.  I am tired of being locked in two year contract.2) I would like my mobile phone to be compatible with multiple carriers.  I would like to shop for mobile service independent of my phone being from a specific carrier.3)  I wanted my phone to be unlocked. Sometime the carrier unlocks it for you to use the phones overseas, but not with the competitor here in the US. The price of the phone is built in the monthly bill.  It is not free. Why is that  I am not allowed  to do whatever I like with my phone, at least after the contract has expired?4) I want my phone to accept a SIM card. Some phones form some carriers in US, such a Verizon, do not have SIM cards and effectively you cannot use them with any carrier other than Verizon, inside or outside the US. Of course, Verizon now have some phone models that accept SIM cards that can be used overseas, as long as Verizon unlocks it for you. Why not all phones come with SIM cards, like many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America?5) A Fourth Generation (4G) technology called Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is growing in coverage and that will be the cutting edge mobile communication that will replace the old 2G and 3G technologies. I wanted my new phone to support LTE.6) In many countries outside US, the phone networks use widely accepted international standards; therefore, the mobiles phones can be used with any of the carriers in those countries.  That is what I would like to see here in US.Let me come back to the review of the Samsung Galaxy S4 International version offered here at Amazon.It meets all my requirements except the following:1. The phone can support LTE networks; however, the LTE frequency band used by this phone is not compatible with those used by mobile carriers in the USA.  It means you cannot take advantage of the high speed provided by 4G networks (LTE). You have to settle for 3G. I did some research and found out that for LTE communication,  AT&T; uses 700MHz; T-Mobile uses 1700MHz; Verizon uses 750 MHz; Sprint uses 1900 MHz; and MetroPCS uses 1700 MHz.  Theses frequencies are different from the LTE frequency bands supported by the phone. Then, what is the point of buying the latest mobile phone if it is not compatible with your carrier's latest high speed network?2. For 3G side, some users have mentioned that the phone is not compatible with T-Mobile`s 3G in the USA. T mobile uses 1700 and 1900 MHz frequency for 3G. If T-mobile uses 1700MHZ in your area, the phone will not be compatible to use T-Mobile's 3G network.I do not recommend this International phone for USA users. The best alternative is the T-Mobile version of Samsung Galaxy S4. That phone supports LTE on the following bands: 700, 850 1700, and 1900 MHz. That means it will work on the LTE networks for AT&T;, T-Mobile, and MetroPCS. A search on Wikipedia with a search key \"E-UTRA\", lists that LTE networks in Canada and Latin America use 1700  and 1900 MHz bands. That means it will also work in Canada and Latin America LTE networks. My understanding is that T-Mobile unlocks their phones if you paid the full price.Currently, 4G (LTE) networks are not fully deployed everywhere yet. They cover only major cities in USA.  Many countries have not deployed 4G yet and even if they have, it is possible that some are using frequency bands that are not supported by your phone. That means, it is still important to have the 3G connection working. The T-mobile's version of the Galaxy 4 phone, supports the WCDMA version of 3G system which is compatible with AT&T; and MetroPCS 3G networks in USA and many other 3G networks around the world. WCDMA, also referred to as UMTS, is the most accepted International 3G communication standard. Note that CDMA is different from the WCDMA even though they share similarities. Carriers who had CDMA based networks are converting their networks over to WCDMA. Verizon and Sprint use CDMA for 3G communication, instead of WCDMA(UMTS), which makes their 3G networks incompatible with International phones. At this point, Verizon and Sprint networks are the list compatible with US or other international networks. They seem to prefer the \"Locked-In\" approach with less freedom to switch to other carriers.In summary, here in USA, we are not there yet where your phone will work with all the carriers; however, the T-Mobile version of Samsung Galaxy S4 comes close. It gives you flexibility, freedom from a contract, and compatibility to other networks here in USA and overseas. I think this is a starting point to freedom.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Forget the Iphone, you can't go wrong with the S4!", "Author": "Jo\u00e3o Henrique Couto e Silva", "ReviewID": "R2H93VQHBKBM78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone in the market for sure, awesome screen, fast, thin and light.

It so happened that I started to suspect the battery was the cause of the issue, as the battery is now swollen and there is a slight odor coming from the it. After doing some research I came to realize that the battery I have is fake (made in China rather than in Korea). Now with a swollen battery that causes the screen to lift off the phone slightly and shuts down when making a simple phone call, I am left highly dissatisfied. Who is to blame here?

When it had arrived I have noticed that there is a small space between touchscreen glass and body of the phone (about 0.5 mm) from both sides. Also plastic back cover was not closed properly. I have put small pressure from the sides of the phone and those spaces have gone. A moment after that I put my Otterbox cover on the phone and did not remove it till this month. I was mistakenly sure that the issue with the spaces was fixed, however when I removed my Otterbox case, I saw that the spaces are all the same dimesion and if I do not use any case dust comes into the phone! If I try to apply some light pressure on the sides of the phone, the spaces come off for certain time and then come back again (I can just assume that the touchscreen glass is U-bent and assembling was not conducted properly). Moreover, when I came back to Ukraine (I am not planning to come back to USA at this time) I have found out that my Galaxy S III does not have possibility to connect to Internet via cell operator service and needs to be re-firmwared. I am sure you understand that it was my intention to buy Unlocked version of the phone to avoid such problems in my homeland!I have visited numerous diagnostics servises who tried to adjust settings but without any success, also they advised me that these spaces between the glass and body of the phone are factory defects for sure. I have also visited Samsung Service center in my city who told me that the guarantee is covered for the goods purchased only in Ukraine and to change firmware will cost about $20-30 and to fix the issue with spaces - around $200-250 (change of touchscreen glass).I like my Galaxy S III but I cannot enjoy it in full because I think it is unacceptable to know that the dust can easily enter the phone without any mechanical damage done from my side and to bring such a big screen phone without access to Internet. Internet connection with T-Mobile in US was ok.After contacting My Wish-List  I was advised that there is nothing can be done in this case and I should stay with my problem alone. The only thing I was offered is a small amount which was their profit part \u201cas a gesture\u201d what did not solve the issue at all.Thus, guys, be aware that this seller does not provide guarantee for the supplied goods (the Guarantee voucher is also supplied without any stamp or other evidence when you bought it and you will stay with your problem what ever it is on your own.Hopefully something will be changed in near future.Yevhen Ivchenko/An Upset Customer Of The Above Seller.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its not as described..", "Author": "mehmet ay", "ReviewID": "R2EGTZUZS4SZDO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It must has been international factory unlocked but it wasnot..so I had to return it..I was disappointed.....please check them before selling", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "4G does not work in Brazil", "Author": "Clusio M.

I had the Toshiba computer and the Kindle (bought from Amazon as well) carried with me as well. 1) After a couple of days that it was working fine, I had a problem connecting the Galaxy S4 to the hotel WiFi (other products worked fine). It did not recognize a (definitely) correct name and password given by the hotel. I try to change setting. Nothing help.2) So I have decided to do a reset to the \"factory set up\". I had backing up my data (not sure it is working).This process erases all the telephone (application used, telephone numbers etc.) set up to the \"factory set up\", as per the phone instruction. When completing and turning on the S4, as per the factory \"setup\" all was written in Korean/Chinese (probably), not a place to change the language (as per some video instructions on YouTube..) So I couldn't do any setting for connection or gaining minimum functionality.3) Sending mails to Amazon, I am refereed to different Amazon site. No where a place to get any help on such issues.4) Selling Electronic equipment requires a minimum technical support. It is not like selling books, cosmetics, cloths etc. It is time for Amazon to address this issue.I am surprised that Amazon don't test basic feature (minimum having obligatory the English language as a default language).  And don't have a basic Quality Control on electronic product it is selling directly from manufacturers or from suppliers it is working with.

It was easy to reconfigure for English but there are a number of applications in German that of course stayed in German and to me are not usable.  The other issue is that the phone will not work in LTE mode, and to be fair to the vendor this (and only this) was declared.  This is something to do with frequencies used in the US.  However the phone does run in H+ mode at 5.3 Mb/s which is more than adequate. I have no regrets with my decision albeit the German was a bit of putting at first.  I think the vendor, Global Mobile and or Amazon should give a paragraph explaining the German and the absence of LTE.

I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty! I am amazed at their utter lack of customer Service.UPDATE: 10/8/2013:An updated NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvTriggerGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

It will be under the NETWORK heading. For instance ATT in the US uses 850 and 1900 for GSM and 700,1700 and 2100 for LTE. Do a tiny bit of research before posting dumb questions.This phone was a tough choice over the HTC one.Reasons over HTC were:Removable battery ( a must for modders at times)Super AMOLED screen is amazing with a great resolutionCamera is very good even in lower light settingsSound quality is not terrible at all.This phone also weighs less then it appears which is a nice feature.International- any network, anytime, to include LTE.For the average user they will surely love this phone in how smooth it is stock.I also recommend this over the i9500 for the faster cpu with longer lasting battery with the snapdragon processorThe only bad thing was a lack of a search button which now appears on nearly every page.If you are into modding. With Foxhounds rom and Adam's kernel found on XDA i only lose about 9% battery on extremely limited use with wifi and several widgets(including temperature, humidity, cpu temp speeds music player, notepad and power toggles.)On very heavy use to include music, a few games and texts while on WiFi the battery only dropped about 30% after 3.5 hours.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.
