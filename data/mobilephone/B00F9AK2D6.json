I haven't got my sim cards yest for mobile, but did install Groove IP and google voice works great over WIFI.  Other reviews have said slow on the internet, I don't see this issue.  It seems faster than my droid 2 global.  I bounced around CNN and google for at least an hour without any pause or waiting.  I'm using this as a test phone before I spring on 2 of the bigger BLU products, then daughter will get this as replacement to Samsung brightside.  She already love it.  I will update to a 5 if it really gets T-mobile 4g (we are on the 1900 freq in my area).", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not smart enough", "Author": "Anthony M.", "ReviewID": "R3IU7IGJ40OH5F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone it's good enough for people like me who are just looking for the basic, for the price it worth, I'm not going to bother into details, I have 3 days using it, and I have found only one mayor issue that is the reason to give it 3 start, this phone doesn't have enough storage space to do anything but the basic, so, it isn't so smart. Once I installed Whatsapp and google maps there where not enough ROM left to install even a single game (The operating system and the pre installed apps drained the storage space).If you are wondering why not to use an SD card to solve the issue, it won't work, I already tried, most of the apps can just be installed on system memory (fortunately facebook it's one exception).I'm keeping the phone cause it solve my actual needs, but would have been great to have enough storage space to at least make a system update, I actually had to set off the automatic updates in order to save the phone the trouble of searching anb trying to download.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "value.for.money", "Author": "Mia", "ReviewID": "R19NTQBPCMQJFZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am not one of those people that needs an expensive name brand phone.
