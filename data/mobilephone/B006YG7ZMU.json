I had prepared myself for it not coming until after Christmas.  This seller sent the phone right away and on a rush so I could get it for Christmas.It's a nice phone.  My son is very happy with it.  We had a little bit of a problem getting it set up but that was Sprints fault.  Sprint wasn't happy that we didn't buy the phone directly from them.I'm happy that we have found another solution to getting cell phones rather then signing a new two year contract. Also, my teenage son hasn't been too careful with his cellphones.  So, I'm very happy with this option.I will definantly be buying from this seller again.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nexus Rating", "Author": "Sammy", "ReviewID": "R1OR0RE2PL6YPH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone.

It had a little damage here and their but the screen was perfect, phone was a little outdated but it was a deal to get it in this shape.

However, when we brought the phone to Sprint shop, we were told that phone number can't be transferred even if it was unlocked phone.  There seem to be a layer of information that was stripped when it was in the process to become unlocked.  We ended up upgrading and contracting again so my daugher can get a new phone.

It has call forwarding and visual voice mail that you can read on the phone or online.  I love the weight and the bright screen. Very fast and responsive.  Clear calls and ok camera and videocamera. I streamed a TV show and was delighted. Responsive software, many apps, and fast wi-fi.

No contract. No strings attached. Just pure Google. I contemplated between an unlocked Nexus S vs. the Sprint no contract one but really this was the best decision, when considering the price was considerably less and I don't plan on getting a contract with any phone company. I call/text for free  (voIP) through gvoice and talkatone and sync all my data through my Google account to the phone seamlessly.Updated Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0.4) is a blast and the phone's original battery lasts surprisingly long. I recommend buying it New or used but \"Like New\" just to avoid any scratches or dents on the phone that might annoy you. Overall, you can't go wrong buying this phone.

Great customer service and quick respond to questions before purchase. This is such a great phone for the price! Did I say that already? This phone was released 2 years ago and runs like a top of the line smart phone. It came preloaded with ICS (Android 4.0) which makes the phone run smooth. But once I got it, I unlocked, rooted, and installed JellyBean (Android 4.1.1 latest version) and this thing is much more buttery smooth.  Very Impressed! Been running this phone for over a week and had No problems. The colors on the screen are vibrant (installing a custom kernel can improve this too), camera is good, no dropped calls, 4G speeds work (great for tethering). The only cons would be: there is no external SD card support (16gb internal is still good enough tho), attracts alot of fingerprints, and just average battery life (but I solved this buy just buying a backup for about 4 bucks here on AMAZON) but these are all minor cons to me.

As a now older phone, one must keep expectations in check.  It's a lightweight decent quality phone with  a clean Android operating system.  I have a Nexus 7, so I liked the setup.  For the money ($75) it's hard to really complain, considering that any large step up would cost significantly more.

It was filled with lint and something else that was sticky. Then, after charging the phone, we called Sprint to activate the phone only to find out that the phone did not have a Sprint registered ESN. I contacted the seller to get the correct number to activate the phone and was asked to provide all the numbers on the phone which I did. The seller promised to call Sprint and never replied that the numbers were ineffective however having worked for a wireless company for 3 years, I found that this phone would never activate through Sprint. I returned the phone according the return shipping instructions via USPS and the seller supposedly has not received this phone, even though he promised to refund me for the phone. I will report it lost or stolen so that the seller will not be able to sell this defective phone to someone else, thereby doubling his money. This company is a scam and a rip off and I am seriously considering not using Amazon anymore either.
