{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pros and Cons", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "R3U7MZXPTDRIFY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony Xperia UGeneral:The Sony Xperia U is an entry level Android device at a very reasonable price point of $219 (Although I find the price constantly fluctuating on Amazon).  Keep in mind, if it's not already clear to you now, that this is a very small/thin phone.  Using the iPhone as a reference, the Xperia U 3.5 in display is NOT like the iPhone's 3.5 in.  Xperia U's display is taller but thinner (considerably so, which you'll notice when the keyboard comes up and how tiny certain icons such as battery, service bar, and general font), which still satisfies the 3.5 in, but keep that in mind when purchasing (I personally like small phones, not into the whole mini-tv in my pocket kinda thing).  The phones I've owned in the past couple years are the Droid Pro Plus, Mytouch 4g, Blackberry Curve, Mytouch 3g slide, and the original iPhone.  This is to help give the reader a sense of where I'm coming from and what I'm comparing to.  I really enjoyed the Droid Pro Plus, which was my last phone before this phone, but I sustained a little bit of water damage on a hiking trip so I figured I'd try something new.  I'm pretty picky, so the things that bother me might not bother you, but here goes:Pros:1. Fast  a. The phone is very responsive with the Dual-core 1 GHz processor  b. Very little lag overall.  Using Angry Birds as the reference, cuz everyone's played Angry Birds, there's slight choppiness with the background enabled in the game but it's perfectly smooth with it disengaged.  It's never really stalled even with background enabled, only the FPS has dipped a bit and it's a bit noticeable, but other than that no issues.  c. Browsing with the phone is also a nice experience (in regards to speed).  I've browsed through CNET, Gizmodo, and Slickdeals, which all have a lot of stuff on their pages.  The pages load pretty quickly (on wi-fi - I've noticed most of the time the bottle neck is the phone not the connection, so even on wifi I've had phones that took a while to load pages) and when scrolling, there's a slight millisecond lag with every scroll, but it's consistent and smooth enough for me.2. Crisp Display  a. The clarity of the screen is very nice with 480 x 854 pixels, 3.5 inches (~280 ppi pixel density)  b. You really can't see any pixels with the naked eye3. Dedicated Camera Button  a. Makes it much easier to take pictures, there's a light press, which autofocuses, and a strong press, which actually takes the picture.  b. The key also allows you to take a picture outside of the lock screen in case you need to take a quick snapshot at something and don't feel like unlocking your device, finding the camera app and then taking the picture.  Nice little touch  c. In my opinion, the 5MP camera is good enough for the phone.  It's certainly not the best camera out there, but it's far from the worst.  It's just average.  A little noise here and there.4. Swype  a. This is really the first time I've really used Swype.  I don't know what changed, but before I didn't like using it, now with this device I love it.  I don't have particularly large or small hands, but this phone feels better with one hand than using it with 2 hands, just imo.  So Swype really saved it for me, but you have to download it.5. Front Facing Camera  a. Honestly, I haven't used it yet, but it's a nifty feature that I haven't really had on other phones so it's a plus for me. Skype and taking pictures of myself I guess.6. Phone/Voice Quality  a. Now this phone doesn't really beat the Droid Pro Plus or Blackberry Curve in loudness and clarity of voice, but it's by no means \"bad.\" It's just something to keep in mind and not get lost in all the features, forgetting the fact that the device is (or should be) primarily a phone.  The sound levels peak a bit when at its max especially when using the xLOUD function which enhances the loudness of speaker.  But nothing really new or surprising to me since most of the phones I've owned had similar issues.7. App Stacking  a. Move an app over another and it stacks into a folder.  Nifty8. Screen Protector  a. Comes with it in the box, that's nice.Cons:1. Texting  a. Now let the reader understand, my critique is not the texting experience overall, but this is where my pickiness really shines.  When adding a new contact to text, you have to click the Write New button (indicated by a pencil and + Sign) then you have to hit Add Contact (Plus sign with a portrait) then you have to type in the Name which will eventually auto-populate, not in the bar but in the scrolling section below.  Then you have to click the name itself then press done.  My goodness, my other phone, all I had to do was press Write new, Type the name and it would usually auto-populate in the bar itself, in which case I can hit enter and I'd be done with it.  So rather than 3 motions, it takes about 5 motions to text a new buddy.  My hope is that I don't have to text new people often, luckily once you have a thread going, it's easier to get to in the inbox.2. Service Bar Indicator  a. I've never really experienced this problem before, but the service bar indicator is often inaccurate.  Sometimes I'm in a place where I KNOW there's no service, but there are 2 bars.  I go ahead and test text and lo and behold, no service.  Tricky.  That gets on my nerves a bit.3. Light Bar  a. There is no built-in way to turn the light bar off.  It's cool...for the first 5 minutes, but there's no way to adjust brightness of it or turn it off in the system.  Luckily, the way to remedy that is to get an app called \"Screen Filter.\"  You click-off the Enable soft-key backlight in the App settings and it goes off.  But the app will constantly stay in your notifications bar.  I'm a bit OCD so I love clearing the notification bar, but unfortunately that little Screen Filter notification will always be there unless I want the light bar on.4. Battery Life  a. As some have indicated, Battery Life isn't the best, with a Li-Ion of 1320 mAh.  What I do to preserve the battery is turn off the live wall paper, dim my lights, turn off the light bar and limit the number of widgets.  It lasts me about a day and a half, but really, I just charge it at night... why have your battery run out the middle of the next day, right?5. LED Notification Indicator  a. The LED light is WEAK.  So weak in fact, that the blue indicator cannot be seen in daylight unless your face is 5 cm away from it.  It's quite useless.  Luckily, there's another app fix (sort of).  Light Flow Lite allows you do change the color of the LED light for notifications.  Customizable between e-mail, calendar, SMS, MMS, etc., so if you happen to get the phone, do yourself a favor and change your notification lights to RED as I noticed it's the strongest light that pierces through the screen.  (Still dim though.  Let's put it this way, if you're across the room and you have 20/20 vision and there's a remote light source in the room, trust me, you can't see it)6. Vibration  a. Vibration is WEAK as well.  Maybe I'm spoiled and the Droid Pro Plus and Blackberry Curve has always had strong vibrations that I could feel in my pocket, but this... doesn't really cut it for me.  I've always relied on the sound of the vibration itself rather than any sort of chime, but this phone.  I gotta have the sound on or I don't notice my texts.  Not a huge deal breaker for me, but it still kinda bothers me.7. Camera  a. I know I had this primarily as a pro, but there was this one little thing that sorta bugged me.  When going into camera mode outside of the lock-screen, you hold it down a few seconds and let go.  The thing is, it takes a picture immediately as you let go rather than going into camera mode, allowing you to actually preview what it is you're taking a picture of.  If you have a good sense of what's in front of you and what will be on the screen, good on you, but everytime I've engaged the camera, I've always had the first accidental fire of my legs or random wall fixture followed by taking the real picture.  Just something to keep in mind.8. SD Card  a. There is none, so you deal with the space given.  b. Not a deal breaker for me because I don't generally keep my music on the phone.  And I can always take pictures off the phone after I've uploaded it to my computer.  So even though I don't really mind, the lack of it today definitely makes it a con.So there are my little tid-bits about the phone.  Overall the phone is a great phone for the price, the cons don't really outweigh the pros for me.  If I could, i'd give a 3.75 rating, but, just rounded up cuz it def. doesn't deserve a 3 star rating.  I've yet to try a phone that really fit everything that I wanted, and this phone has many pluses... and with the other stuff, ah I'll get used it.  Oh and if you're triyng to figure out why MMS doesn't work, Click Settings > Xperia > Internet Settings and it'll d/l whatever it downloads to active it.  Android 2.3 is nice and all, but I will be expecting ICS to come out for it soon.  Sony's working on it, so stay tunedThanks!", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEVICE", "Author": "Cec", "ReviewID": "R1FCOW8VQK9FV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great phone, I was looking for something new, modern, fun, elegant, and sophistic.This is the phone, its actually and medium end device by the new generation of Sony smartphones, but this is one is what great for anyone looking for something catchy, durable and well made. Sony created a phone no so expensive like the others brothers from same family, this one has what you need on any smartphone, It will keep updated and you will be able to do all you need on today world.1- Is fast and works smooth on any application2- Ready to be updated to new android is fantastic, no bugs no problems at all.3- Has an interesting durable, fancy and resistant material on case, looks good, feels good.4- The screen has everything you need, bright, deep contrast, great sutured colors, HD. Not really great for finger prints marks but is very resistant for scratch... If you buy some screen protector you dont have to worry for dust or finger prints.5- Yeap I know just 8 gb internal memory, but thats enough for apps music, HD Photos and more, not a bad thing.6- The camera works great and does the job not really fancy but what you need for you phone at any good moment.7- Very sensitive at touch works fast.8- Very personalized, the light on the bottom and the changeable cap is very cool.UPDATE ( August 22, 20 days of use)The phone is amazing, after all this time, I have no complains about it. No bugs, No problems.I want to add something about the battery, this phone has a battery Standard battery, Li-Ion of 1320 mAh (not a big issue), don't know why they didn't put something better, but is ok, if you install some apps like: Defender Juice and specially Easy Battery Saver, any android phone will last longer, like twice the time. This one last about One day or two days; I use Skype, whats-app, badoo, news apps, weather widgets and more, so all together are battery drainers.Still happy!I recommend it for today's price and quality, and of course functionality.Final update September 19!

Although you have to charge the phone every night because the battery runs off quickly.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Freedom and customization of Android", "Author": "Mohammed K. Hassan", "ReviewID": "RLNM8OOO3SFX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a tech geek and have used many mobiles over the years. I've used Palm, Blackberry, WinMobile, Webos, Ios, Meego, WP7 and Android. So I know the differences. Having used many of them, I have made Android my primary phone. The reasons for me are simple - I like to be in charge of my device. Customization is a choice, it is not mandatory. Many iphone owners will say oh you have to tweak your Android phone to make it useful. Nothing can be further from truth. It is entirely up to the user. There are many cool things you can do with Android that you never can on any iphone.- A proper file manager/USB storage: what is it and why it matters? If you used any USB flash drive, you know how it works. You just plug it in and it shows up as a drive and you can drag and drop ANY file in it. Android works the same way. There is no special itunes/zune-like software you need to manage your phone. It's sad that Apple charges so much for higher capacity iphones yet the storage can not be managed in any way YOU please. It's strictly designed to be a consume devices - music and video.- \"AirDroid\" - simple and free app for Android that allows you to do nearly everything from a browser interface without even touching your phone. this includes file transfer, app management, send/receive txts and much more. this is very convenient because you can have your phone in your pocket.- \"mysms\" or \"mighty text\" - these are also handy as they allow you to send/receive sms without even touching your phone as long as your phone has working signal. pretty awesome in office environment.Mind you, 90% of Android customization can be done by anyone irrespective of tech knowledge. There is no rooting(aka jailbreaking in Ios world) needed. Iphone users will tell you once you jailbreak an iphone, it can be made to work like Android. Again that's completely false. Jailbreaking idevice allows a little customization but it's nowhere near Android. And you still can't do anything you want. For instance- you still can't properly manage that storage on your idevice even after jailbreaking. Because jailbreaking doesn't change the core OS or how it behaves.Pros:Great battery life. Charges pretty fast. Mine charges fully in roughly about an hour.Highly portable. very lightweight.Openness + Customization of Android.Better reception - I've tried using my SIM card on my LG phone which drops signal but Sony was able to retain at least one bar.Stylish - sure it's not made of aluminum but still looks and feels great on hand.Cons:No expandable storage. Again if you are a light user, it should not bother you. Mind you all iphones never offered expandable storage yet they are very popular. So it really depends on your usage. I'm a heavy user and for me, the device must be flexible. And this is the only con I can mention about this device.Final words about Android. As Android is platform agnostic, you will find low end to high end Android device. You can't really judge an OS by using a crappy Android device. Xperia U is above average/mid-range phone. It's of course unlocked so you can use AT&t; 3G in the usa and worlwide.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool Phone for a while.", "Author": "K.J.", "ReviewID": "R2H271UHXNOHOP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's nice and affordable. The price tag was the number one reason that I got this phone.  I thought it was a great deal compared to other phones with similar specs.The software runs smoothly. I have to remember to type  with my finger tips and not my nails. I wish Sony would hurry with the Android update to 4.0. The battery last a day for me (the Joys of a smartphone). I believe the internal memory is adequate for me since, I can always transfer files to my Galaxy Tab for storage.I have been using it for 10 days and I love it.UPDATEI stopped using this phone in Jan 2013. One night it decided not to charge and the phone would not turn on. Then certain areas of the screen were becoming unresponsive and I decided it was time to get rid of it and get a Samsung S3.

My daughters white phone came with Yellow cap. You can also buy additional bottom caps in different colors.There is really nothing to complain about this phone at this price point.

Did not plan to do a lot of browsing.  This fit my budget for a 2012-release phone and the Xperia phones have good customer satisfaction.  It came down to the U or the P, which is a fair amount pricier but the same phone (processor) with more memory and an SD slot plus a slightly larger screen.  ignored friend's advice that I get the pricier phone for the additional memory (he's a gamer), and so far I don't regret it.  Lots of memory left ovcr for the several apps I have installed, and no need for an external SD card if you aren't into video or music.  Even then, there's the Cloud if you have wi-fi.  Reception is good and calls are clear.  typing is definitely a little cramped on the 3.5\" screen, but it has an auto landscape mode that makes it acceptable.  If you are a texter or use a huge number of apps, the P might make sense.  I'm good with thisUpsides:  great price for the CPU and graphics.  great look and feel.  comes with a sony screen protector but no case, which is needed as it is a delicate little thing.  would be a great phone for someone with delicate fingers, I get by. says you can upgrade to ICS but I have enough trouble figuring out 2.3 so until it is clear the upgrade is needed I'll stick with itDownside: battery life is limited.  My old flip phone used to hold a charge for most of a week, and this one needs daily feeding, more if you leave the wifi on. I am sure the color stripe (which has no perceivable useful function and cannot be turned off) has some role in this, but a 1200 mA-hr cell doesn't go far .  Wonder if it will accept larger cells.An excellent phone, would buy again.  Comes with a 12 month Sony warranty in original box and shrink wrap.  Nicer than the Motorola Atrix I demoed, despite having a slightly narrower screenAddendum: have seen other reviewers comment on damage to the phone.  This is a fairly delicate plastic-body and screen phone.  One would be foolish not to clad it in a case + screen protector.  The Ecell case (available on Amazon for about $5) is really nice as a minimalist case, and will protect as well as  make it less likely to drop the phone.  There are also some beefier cases out there.Addendum #2\"  I wear Carharrt pants with side-leg cell phone pockets and even with the case, this phone fits in there like a glove.

Presently, 7 months later:1. Phone book and dialer takes 30 seconds to load. In a moving vehicle, or when the phone's not in the 'mood', it takes even longer.2. Camera would hardly respond while on the move. It seems to have a mind of its own in any case so loading speed really depends on its mood. In general, one needs to press the button real hard and forget about it for a while for the camera to load.3. Message takes a long time to load and sometimes hangs too. Pretty useless if one is in a hurry.4. Photo viewer hangs just like that.5. Pathetic photo editor...ruins an otherwise good photo if you try to improve it.6. Google Maps just hangs when you need it the most.7. Does not allow any upgrades to the OS. We did it once and it almost stopped working so we had to factory reset it.8. Camera flash. I cannot call it a flash since it's just  a very weak light that goes on but does not really work.9. Takes a long time to take pictures.10. Most importantly, it's battery is just too weak to keep 3G on, or data on or wi-fi on. So, if any one of these is left on, the phone dies in like just  a few hours. It dies at the rate of 10% every 15 minutes or so. With all of these off, it stays for a couple of days.10. The only things good about it are its sleek feel, appearance and size. Music player functions well. So, it's really an MP3 player...not a phone.All in all, a waste of a phone since dialer, phone book, and messaging just don't function well enough.

Haven't bought any music since August 2012.Smaller than I envisioned, but it is not as much of a pain in your pocket as many others.Upgraded to Android 4.0 in a timely manner.Noticed a bit of a lag after the upgrade, but the added benefits outweigh any other concerns, especially the ability to configure proxy settings for wifi based corporate/university environments, and also of controlling the amount of data used.Use on At&t; with perfect functionality.The 3D camera is probably the most awesome feature that comes with it, although it is getting to be more common now.The design utilized by Sony has got people constantly noticing my phone. It's nice to be noticed in the sea of Iphones which choke my university.The timescape feature is kinda cool, sometimes it has issues loading, especially from facebook, but twitter is much more my style anyways, so that's not a big deal. I almost removed all the facebook stuff a while ago, but decided against it for now.I wish the timescape feature had instagram... if it had Instagram I would be a massive fan.I use it for everything from Music Unlimited, to intense emailing (4 accounts), calendar synchronization, Any.do for tasks, camera, social media, keeping up with Arsenal and Carolina Hurricanes, weather, finances, skydrive, OneNote, oh yeah.. it has a phone in it too, haha. It handles each of these tasks quite well. When I'm really pushing multi-tasking I do have to be careful not to overload it. I definitely recommend finding threads online which give tips on freeing up some RAM.one last thing that does catch people's eye, is the LED bar at the bottom. I got an app that will light it up when I get notifications, which I have customized for my preferences, but when that starts going off, my friends will be like.. uh dude, you're phone is pretty awesome.

I don't live in an area with 4g, however even though it doesn't have the 1700 band I still get 3g outside of my house and otherwise I usually get Edge, which to me is still good enough.I tested using gps and data to setup directions to somewhere and it was generally helpful.

Plus this had a decent price tag, and since it wasn't tiny like the HP Veer (which I had initially chosen and ultimately returned), I thought it'd be the best fit for me for the money.Looking at it, it probably isn't the most visually appealing phone on the planet. It is rectangular, relatively slim and fits pretty nicely in your hand, and the clear strip toward the bottom of the phone lights up depending upon the color theme you choose. The bottom of the phone has a removable color cap that you can choose to pull off and replace with another color (I bought the black Xperia with an optional white cap). I only recently learned how to remove the cap, but I don't plan on putting the white cap on--don't see any importance in the matter. There's also some kind of green bulb on the back--cosmetic purpose?This phone has a front and back facing camera. I didn't realize I was in for this kind of treat when I bought it. Though I haven't used it yet, I am capable of face chatting with people using this phone. In order to get the Sim card in, you have to pull off the back of the phone and insert it in the side like you would an SD card (and this does NOT have an SD card slot--disappointing). I like for my phones to back up as mp3 players, and the fact this did not have expandable memory almost convinced me to return it. I thought I'd give it a fair chance. However, I do appreciate not being forced to turn my phone completely off in order to insert/eject the sim card. It tends to restart itself once it realizes you have inserted, but it is fully functional even without a card, so you can still use your phone if you pull it out, unlike some other phones.It comes with Gingerbread, but it is capable of running Ice Cream Sandwich. With ICS I feel there's some sluggishness. Either I've adapted to the speed or the speed has improved.I have only had this phone for a few months, and I'm having some issues with the battery already. I thought using Power Management (this turns off data traffic while the screen is off, but turns it back on when the screen is on) would be a huge improvement. It turned out not to be. I turned off Power Management yesterday, and I actually see my battery lasts longer without it. I have no emails or accounts syncing, my screen is at its lowest brightness....I'm going to see if the Mobile BRAVIA Engine (quality enhancer for pictures/videos) was the issue.Overall I love this phone. It's a great purchase for anyone looking for a GSM unlocked at a good price or someone who wants a good Android and doesn't need tons of space for much more than apps.
