The reception is very good and battery life is outstanding but most importantly it is unbelievably durable. Numerous drops, scratches and other usual disruptions have had no effect on this phone. Then tonight my wife did the laundry with my son's phone in his jeans pocket; a full wash and dry cycle later (the phone fell out of the dryer when it was opened and was so hot I has to let it cool for an hour before playing with it) I wiped off the battery then charged the phone and it works just fine!!! If you are looking for a phone that has good battery life and can take a beating this is highly recommended. Not the coolest phone but extremely functional and durable.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great, durable phone!", "Author": "A. Johnston", "ReviewID": "R2K6S10OKRYYCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for one of my teenage sons.  He loves the phone.  I was worried that the slide mechanism might be fragile but it has been very robust.  He goes on very long hikes and his phone bounces around in his pocket along with his keys, sand, and other debris.  The outside of the phone is scratced so much that most of the paint is gone to reveal the metal underneath.  The screen is badly scratched and looks terrible when the phone is turned off HOWEVER, when the phone is on, the screen is so bright that the scratches disappear! This phone has been severely abused about 10 months and yet it still functions perfectly!I bought a 4GB micro SD card that works great in the phone and I expected him to use it for music but he mostly uses it for photos and video.After seeing how durable this phone was for my older son, I bought one for my younger son who adores it!  He doesn't abuse it quite as much and his phone still has all of the paint and no scratches on the screen. He really enjoys being able to have music on his phone. It's a very reasonably priced phone that's small and fun to use, perfect for teens.  Personally, I'm using a Sony Ericsson slider that has a few more features that I love (also very reasonably priced).", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little phone", "Author": "the worry rock", "ReviewID": "RHLM4Z9BZ72MO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 2.5 years now (I'm bad at upgrading). The call quality is not the clearest and in some places (like inside stores, especially in malls) the signal disappears entirely. However! This phone has served me well over this time and I find it exceptionally easy to text with (I got used to t9 a while ago). I've dropped the phone many times and I think it's designed to sort of fall apart so as to not \"break\" which it does pretty well - the back and the battery always pop out so I just pop them back in and it works fine. I have since damaged one of my keys and am hoping to replace this phone with an identical one.

It is a slider, so it doesn't make a loud snap when you shut it like a flip phone.  This phone is easily worth over $100 used.  I have owned mine for a year and had no issues.  I bought one for my mom's birthday as well.  They can be found used online almost anywhere, and most people can't complain about them!  I Love this Samsung A737 slide phone.

After about a year we both upgraded to iPhones. Then we had upgraded to Samsung smartphones. after owning 2 smartphones i started hating the extremely short battery life and the size of the smartphones....way to big. If youre a woman and carry a purse its not so much of an issue. So yesterday i decided i had enough of the smartphone and decided to charge up one of my a737's and swap the sim card. The phone powered up just as good as the day i bought it. There is one really neat trick. Even though the owners manual says that you can add a micro sd card for added storage but only up to 4GB in size. Well i was able to over ride the card size and inserted a 16GB micro sd card. In order to do this you must first format the card on a computer and instead of doing a FAT 32 format do an NTFS long format, then insert the card in your phone and you now have a great amount of storage for music, pictures and video etc. The mp3 player is really good. I know someone gave this phone only 1 star and complained about a popping noise after tracks. His phone must have a defect or something cause i've never encountered this. I have the Jambox bluetooth speakers in which work like a charm with the a737. Also, you can send files from your phone to your computer and vice versa using bluetooth file transfer (download the Samsung PC Studio 3 to your computer). My only complaint about this phone is that there is no shortcut button for the camera. you have to physically go through the menu to access it. Other than that i love this phone and its size is very comfortable in your hand. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because there was no shortcut button for the camera.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD phone", "Author": "Brittany Ensley", "ReviewID": "R14ZGN57R21P3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone this is the 4th one like this I have had.

Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3IAM0LIZOJN4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is exactly what I wanted! Let me preface this a little bit.  Increasingly people are carrying tablets with them as well as smartphones to add to their arsonal of mobile devices.  Some new Android smartphones are nearly as big as a tablet! And ask their owners what the battery life is for phone calls.  I posted a youtube video of my girlfriend's ATT Flipside (ATT version of the Droid) and watched the battery go from 100% to 15% in an 8 minute phone call with no apps running in the background.  I know others with the Droid 2 for Verizon that have the same problem.  As phones most smartphones simply don't work.Another problem is all of these devices require their own data plan.  I litterally know people that pay for home internet, iPhone internet, iPad internet, and blackberry internet (through work).  Its crazy!The Samsung A737 address all of these issues.  First off the battery lasts days if you don't talk much.  And its plenty to get you through a day with lots of talking.  Secondly, it is a breeze to tether to my MacBook Pro.  AND unlimited data with ATT for a non smartphone is only $10-$15!  ATT doesn't even offer \"tethering plans\" for non smartphones, I just did it, and it worked.I reckon the ultimate phone would be very similiar to this one.  It would be crazy slim, and light to fit in your pocket, have great battery life and easy connectivity.  It would be great for talking on the phone.  However it would also have easy connectivity for all your other devices.  It could provide a data connection for your netbook, laptop, or tablet so you'd only have to pay once for data. And it would be so slim and small it wouldn't be a burden to carry it around with you (it'd be a non smartphone)  I don't think this vision will ever happen because people are crazy willing to pay for slow mobile internet but until then, the Samsung A737 is the best option you can get.  Did I mention its tiny!?", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great phone at first, absolutely awful later", "Author": "azurasglow", "ReviewID": "R2NTL8IWPOWSH5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will not lie, in the first year this phone was amazing.  Great battery life, very very easy to use, and pretty good sound quality.  Too bad its basically a rock after only 2 years (if that) of use (and I'm pretty easy on my phones).First, while I used to only have to charge the phone once a week, I now have to charge it every other day, if not more.  The battery life is completely shoddy.  Its pathetic.  Even if I only talked only 2-3 hours that day, the phone will die right there in the middle of the call.Second, you'll be lucky to get a call or text to go through, from senders or the receivers end.  I've had people text me and call me, and the calls and text won't arrive until hours later.  At first I thought it was a service problem, but my brother lives in the same area with a cheap 30 dollar phone, and his calls and text go through crystal clear.  I also have the worst time sending calls and text.  I've had to call people 5 times or more because the call wouldn't go through or the call would drop as soon as the person answered.  The same goes for text, it takes a good three times before it goes through.Third, the sound quality is awful.  The person on the other end can just about never hear you, and it sounds like their calls are breaking up all the time.  So texts are the way to go, if you can send them.All in all, this phone is just not worth it in the longterm.  Like I said, this phone was amazing for the first year.  But when the second year came around, this phone became just pure hell to use.

Other reviews complain about durability and battery life. So far mine is not broken, and I agree that the battery life is short. That will put me in the habit of leaving it connected to the computer overnight to recharge (using a USB cable). It's nice to be able to charge it from USB rather than carry an AC charger when traveling. Indoor use is better than my previous phone (Sony Ericsson T610), which did not work well in my home.A useful feature that is not listed in the manual is \"AIRPLANE\" mode: it disables connection to the network, so that you can use the device on an airplane, for example to play mp3s or backup the phone's address book to your laptop.I don't have the data plan. If you're going to pay the exhorbitant monthly fee for data, you should get a smart phone that makes better use of it.Many features that require a data plan clog up the interface even when you don't have a data plan. For example, if you press the AT&T; logo (select button), it pauses, says the connection failed. You then have to press OK, then Back, then confirm that you want to exit from the browser, 3 different button presses just to cancel the unavailable feature. This button is prominent on the phone and I had to learn NOT to press it from the main screen. I wish that the phone knew or learned it had no data plan, and kept data-dependent features from getting in the way.On the other hand, there is a convenient configurable menu on another button from which you can select the features you actually use. That does soften my complaints in the previous paragraph - except for the AT&T; logo button starting the browser.A737 AS AN MP3 PLAYER: 1 starAs mp3 players go, it's nearly unusable.I have a nice pair of standard earbuds (Koss \"Plug\") plugged in through an adapter, and they sound decent when the music is playing, but not as good as on my inexpensive but old Creative Zen Nano Plus mp3 player.There is a LOUD *POP* at the beginning and end of each songs - that means two loud pops between tracks. It usually cuts off the first half-second of the song. Every time I push buttons to navigate the menus on the phone, there is the same LOUD *POP*. Between songs, there is a pause - sometimes short, sometimes long, and sometimes it is stuck until I push some buttons.The volume control has only 5 steps over a wide range from too quiet to too loud. I have to use step 4 even though it is louder than I prefer, because step 3 is much too quiet.I would like to play songs in a Music folder in the order they appear when sorted (my songs include a track number), as I can do with my Zen, so I can play an album in its intended order, or arbitrary mp3s in an order I have chosen. The only way to do that is to create a playlist for each folder. Without a playlist, you can play by Album and by Artist only.I was hopeful when I saw that I could rate each song as it was playing, but this feature is useless. I played two hours worth of songs and rated each of them. The ratings are available on the phone, but I can't transfer the ratings back to my mp3 library with any of the three mp3 transfer mechanisms - Windows Media Player, the included Multimedia Manager (which has a column for displaying the rating but apparently no way to set it), or the mass storage USB setting using File Manager copy.The battery life for playing music is poor: perhaps 3 hours, about the same as talking on the phone. If you play a lot of music on a flight, you won't be able to use the phone when you land.MISC COMMENTSThe phone came with a charger and nothing else. I had to buy adapters to connect to USB (to charge, and to transfer data), and to use standard 2.5mm (1/8\") stereo headphones. You will probably want to buy a lot of accessories to make the phone practical. They would be cheap except there is high postage, and no one seller has them all.Contrary to some reviews on Amazon, I CAN use 4GB Micro SD chip in this phone; the Kingston chip works fine.The 1 megapixel camera will sometimes come in handy when I don't have my real camera with me. The quality is on par for mobile phones, but not comparable to using a dedicated camera.The AT&T; plan I have includes SMS text messages. People can message me by emailing 10-digit-phone-number@txt.att.net, which is convenient, but I cannot reply to them without a data plan, except using SMS to their phone.The alarm clock and address book applications are fine. The included PC software works, albeit with a non-intuitive interface and text and help file written by someone who does not know English very well. The Multimedia Manager takes much too long (average 2 minutes each) to transfer mp3 files to or from the phone.The three included USB modes support the Samsung PC software, Windows Media Player protocol, and accessing the MicroSD (if present) like a USB memory stick. There is a choice to \"ask me when connecting\" - but it greys out all but the Samsung PC software, so this setting is useless.SUMMARYThe phone is ok for basic phone features. With the exhorbitant price of data plans, if you're going to pay that much monthly, you should invest in a phone that can make better use of the data features. The crippling problems in the MP3 player render it nearly unusable for that purpose.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
