{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An extremely nice surprise.", "Author": "Reinaldo Torrales", "ReviewID": "RA0UJWMVJENLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for an unlocked Android 4.0 phone. After doing some research, reading some reviews I narrowed it down to this phone. On paper it seems to have all the features I wanted: Android 4.0.4, large screen, unlocked, dual SIM and an affordable price. I must say, I see people who order things from China and I was a bit skeptical. So, I took a leap of faith and I ordered this phone. It took about 5-6 days to get the order confirmation. Once the order was processed it took a few more days to get the package out and delivery took around 7 days. Not bad if when the estimated delivery date was somewhere in or after October 10th. I got my phone after Labor Day holiday (Sept 4). So, very pleased with the delivery and the packaging was good too. It came in an envelope but inside the envelope the original from factory box was wrapped on layers and layers of bubble wraps. It's worth to mention the factory box was also very sturdy and capable to resist bumps and heavier objects, in short, not your typical cardboard box many electronic ship these days. That was a plus considering the long trip from China. About the phone, the phone came with two batteries, wired earphone and microphone, charger with USB cable, plastic clip-on shell(it gets keep a better grip as the phone fairly thin). The cable for the charger also works as USB cable for the PC. The phone came loaded with Android 4.0.4 dated to August 2012 (no bad!). The screen is huge, it feels you are holding a mini-mini tablet. It feel sturdy and well built. This was one of my concerns when i ordered, but once I opened the box I was very satisfied with the built quality and materials. I like the big screen, it's crisp , bright, very responsive, no dead pixels or lag. Multi-touch works great. I installed my T-mobile SIM and it worked without any additional action. I also used Wifi to make internet calls and it works good. I installed Viber and Imo and they both work good for internet calls. Viber seems to have better sound, but more attenuation, Imo seems to have better connectivity but the sound is way lower (maybe smaller data packets?). Of course, I installed Angry Birds, the big screen makes it great to play. The phone has two cameras, both worked flawlessly. I was able to switch cameras and take pics without any problem. The quality is acceptable considering the price, I mean, i hear people bitch about bad quality pics from phone's cameras and they seem to forget, its a phone not a camera. Ok, back to the review. The phone comes with GPS, I haven't tried it. It comes with TV and even small antenna. So far it seems to have capability for analog, in USA that's pretty much useless as all TV signals are digital. Not sure if there is an app or if the phone will allow digital signal. Anyway, i didn't buy the phone for that reason. It would be a nice to have but not a must have. Calls are nice and clear. No dropping no problems. I only noticed it gets a bit warm after 15-20mins of use during a call. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would certainly recommend. One last thing, just for reference, the phone seems to have great similarity with Samsung Galaxy Note.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny!", "Author": "M. Mickey", "ReviewID": "R35A7IHJJ9V0QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The seller was great as well as the phone. Had mine working in 5 minutes after I charged the battery.The first thing you need to do is set ENGLISH as the language if thats what you speak. Otherwise everything is in Chinese. There are sever web sites on there from China and you can delete them. Google shows up in the China version but all you need to do is change the ending fron .CN to .COM same for Yahoo.Phone quality is clear and crisp. Camera works better than most others I have seen. I would recommend that you install a mini SD card and put your downloads on it rather than taking up phone memory.Phone is thin compared to an I phone. Battery is easy to get at and you will get 2 batteries , a cover and an installed screen protectoe if you get the expidited shipping. It is only $14 plus you will get the phone in about a week.All the features work very well but the TV is useless in the USA. Manual comes with it but it could be a little better but you can say that for most every phone.I would get another one like this if I needed it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a bigger screen and doesn't want to get sucked into another 2 year contract. Once you put in the SIM card you are good to go.I was asked  which supplier I purchased my phone from, it was the Super Saving Store. I hope that answers your question.I have had this phone for several months and still think it is great. I did want to add some additional information. The phone is a knockoff of a Samsung, has almost all the same features and looks like a Samsung Galaxy BUT , Samsung Galaxy batteries will not fit this phone. I keep my phones for a long time. I did get a second battery with the phone but figured I should get a couple more just in case one went bad. I found that the batteries for an N8000 , which this is, are available from DHgate.com for about $12.00 for 2 including shipping. Takes about 4 weeks to get them but now I feel better with extra batteries in hand.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has its pros and cons", "Author": "DevonKate", "ReviewID": "RMUPZ4R3W6RK7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the phone for a little over a month nowPros:-Box comes packed with accessories. Two batteries. Car charger. Regular charger socket (I requested an Irish and American one and they were happy to oblige). USB cable that fits the socket. Earphones (mine were broken). Instruction manual. Plastic case. 8gb micro SD card.-Screen Protector already fitted.-Runs latest version Android (Ice Cream Sandwich)-Looks very good-Dual SIM function very easy to use. I have both an Irish and American SIM card in at all times and it flawlessly works both at the same time. I receive messages and calls etc. from both when they come in. When sending messages or making phone calls it asks which SIM you would like to use. I have it set to default for one of them (depending on which country I'm in) so it doesn't bother me by asking.-Battery lasts a decent amount of time. I am a hardcore phone user, generally flicking through images and videos online and texting non stop. Battery lasts me for about 6 hours of solid use so should last all day for normal use. The included spare battery is very handy.-Takes micro USB charger (International standard charger)-No problems with signal or dropping calls like some other users have reported.-Speakers are very loud, great for playing music.-Takes panoramic photos. Difficult to get used to but a great feature when used correctly.-Resilient. I've dropped it a few times now and it hasn't been damaged yet. I've been trying to find a case for it but haven't found any that I like on Amazon as of yet. Some other users recommend Samsung Galaxy Note cases for it (they fit when the plastic back is on it according to some reviews)Cons:-Doesn't charge while in use. When I have it plugged in and I have the screen awake the battery percentage doesn't increase (nor does it decrease). I charge it overnight for this reason so it's not a big deal.-Sometimes shuts off when I unplug the charger but turns back on then.-T.V. function is for analogue T.V. only which has been replaced by digital in most countries worldwide so I haven't been able to use this function.-When I received it the home key button was actually scratched pretty badly. The rest of the phone looked flawless though and this didn't bother me enough to request a replacement.-Occasionally the touch screen misbehaves or becomes unresponsive. I find this happens frequently with the charger that was included. I just use an old Samsung charger that I have. The included charger is a bit short also.-The charger port is a little loose. I find that my Samsung charger falls out when moved at all. USB cables fit it perfectly though (which doesn't really make sense as they're supposed to be the same size..?)-Camera and flash not very good. My previous phone also had a 5MP camera with flash and in comparison the Star takes really low quality photos. The flash is the worst flash I have every seen on anything. It is literally just a light. A very dim light at that.Biggest pro is obviously the price. That cannot be beaten!Biggest con is the camera/flash.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "N8000 Good Buy!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R3FDNH1UYSUDKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "N8000 Clone Note 5 inch came in and looked like someone had ordered it and returned had phone numbers in itthe volume button was a little loose and the camera flash was loose being that I needed a cell phone asapI tightened the flash lens with hot glue problem solved. The phone that came was not the same pictured no TV really who cares about that and the camera was on the left top corner not as the description pic in the middle OK still no big deal. Outside the camera takes good pics for what it is inside up close good far away not so good, flash works good and there is an app in the phone for a flash light pretty cool. Screen fine works nice for the price and it is fast I would suggest putting in an app to increase volume that helped a lot. Speaker phone is oknot the greatest but, neither is my husbands $600.00 phone. Now lets get to the dual sims love love I haveSTRAIGHT TALK GMS ordered a sim and put it in put in APN settings it sounds hard but, it's not and I had service in 10 minutes so, all the ones that watched you tube trying to find out if it works on ST it does as long as it says in the phone description GMS 850m/1800m/1900m 3G UNLOCKED and because it is dual sim you can have two numbers just go to a pre pay WCDMA provider and there you go two line switch back and forth.Remember this does not have all the bells and whistles the $600.00 phone has it still is a nice cell it comes with two batteries which is nice ( Ok battery life when not using wifi, bluetooth turn off and install an app killer and adjust screen brightness will help)  and the wifi connected fine the phone found it put in my password and I was off and surfing.

REVISED:now quite happy", "Author": "DJ Bayer", "ReviewID": "RYA4IMF668BK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was accustomed to using Android 4 on my rooted Verizon Thunderbolt and wanted an unlocked phone that had those features. Naturally this one stood out in that regard so given the solid reviews I jumped. After a couple of weeks using it I don't regret the purchase but had some rough moments. As I look back those were caused by my lack of familiarity with getting a phone going with a sim card (Straight Talk) on a network I hadn't used before (AT&T;). The Straight Talk telephone support was not helpful (they weren't familiar with the phone) so I suffered through on my own, finally getting into the 3g network, where I have been since.The phone came as advertised. All software/firmware functions worked well. I was up and running with my google play account right away through wireless. All my apps downloaded and ran without a hitch. The phone size and weight are great. I typically carry it in a shirt pocket. Display is good (but don't expect amoled), battery life quite good for a smartphone (more than my Thunderbolt with an extended battery). Screen protector is a necessity--no gorilla glass here. I put in a 32gb micro SD and transferred most programs to it. The lights next to the front camera never worked, but I can easily live without them. I read in a review that the camera flash wasn't much anyway. Certainly the camera isn't up to today's smartphone standards. Grainy pictures that aren't near as clear as the ones taken by my Thunderbolt. But I typically use my tablet for taking pictures anyway. Video streaming (netflix, youtube) work well. I both read and listen to books and am pleased with the screen size and sound. I use Go apps for calling, texting, and contacts, and they work fine. All told, while I can relate to the frustration of the reviewers who gave the phone a 1 rating, your experience would very likely not be the same--but be ready for it just in case.REVISED:Now that the seller informed me that there are no led lights or camera flash on the phone (very odd for a smartphone) I'd like to change my rating to five stars. This phone is a very good deal--android 4, double sim, pretty good controls, nice weight and thickness. Worst feature is the camera and that's fine for quicky shots when quality isn't important. I am recommending it to my friends.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone for a good price", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R1HQYMUHKWZY2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Star N8000 from lolbuy on Nov.15 and recieved it in the mail on Nov.23. The phone says its 5\" but its really 5.3\". There is no case for this phone so i ordered 2 GALAXY NOTE N7000/19220 cases from amazon one hard case and one silicone case to see how they would fit. For the hard case just type in (White and Hot Pink Dual layer hybrid cover case and kickstand for samsung galaxy note N7000/19220 $3.62). For soft case I ordered(Pink cassette tape silicone case for galaxy note n7000/19220 $3.80). The hybrid case fits my phone pretty good but the case covers up the power on button and volume key which is fine cause I just press the middle button to turn my phone on and i never really use the volume button. I can charge my phone up fine and take pics using back camera with case on so thats all that matters to me. The silicone case fits good too you can easily press volume and power on button. I am with tmobile prepaid $30 100min unlimited text and web plan I downloaded skype and pay $3/month for unlimted talk thats my way of getting around the 100min tmbobile gives so I only pay $33/month and pretty much have unlimited everythang. Put sim card in and it works pretty good. I like this phone because it is compatible with tmobile,att,straight talk,and simple mobile. So if you get tired of one company you can just buy a sim card for a different company and pop sim in phone after activating. what I like most about this phone is that it has video wallpaper, so you can set any video on your sd card as your wallpaper. You can use this phone as hotspot. Volume is very loud when playing movies. You can easily sinc movies/music from computer to phone using usb cord, some phones wont do that. The camera and camcorder isnt that good but it'll do if you're around alot of light. All apps I downloaded so far seem to work like facebook, youtube,angry birds, temple run etc... The phone works pretty fast when on the web without wifi although youtube runs very slow but thats because I only get 2g speed with my tmobile plan but works very fast with wifi. Also if you want phone in white after you order the phone just go to contact this seller under myaccount and tel them you want phone in white in the email and they will send you a white one thats what I did. I would definately recommend this phone for the size and price you cant beat that. I love my phone thanks DANIEL CHEN", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Chun S.

I admit I was really skeptical of buying out of my country but I took a chance on this phone and it came perfect.  The packaging was great and looked like it could survive a couple of rough bumps which was great considering the long trip it had to the states.  If you are thinking of buying this phone do not buy from anyone but amazon.  They will keep your information safe and monitor the entire trip.  However it would have been nice to have tracking information available but I did not worry about it.Receiving the phone and T-Mobile coverage:In the box I received a phone, 2 batteries, a wall charger, 3 screen protectors (one already installed), a usb cable and a set of headphones.  Everything was in excellent condition and worked great!  Immediately when I got the phone I installed my t-mobile sim card and inserted a 8gb micro sd card which I recommend because the internal memory tends to get crowded pretty quickly.  It took me about 10 minutes to get my plan and service going and about 6 hours for the internet to start working.I thought it was great how t-mobile noticed that i could not use the internet so they sent me instructions on how to set it up.  It took me about 5 minutes and after I had full functioning service.  I noticed without the wi-fi on, the phone internet is kinda laggy but still faster than most phones I had in the past.  Be sure that whatever service you plan on using that it works in your area.About the phone:This phone is easy to maneuver and very responsive.  I like how it was not overstocked with pre-installed apps that I would find no use for.  The only one that I find unnecessary is the television feature.  Although it would have been nice to have, we do not have any use for it in the states.  It does have an antenna but its located inside the phone and actually looks like a stylus pin from afar.The battery life on this phone is great. It does take a while to fully charge, but even on 50% I tend to get about 6 hours of battery life before it dies on me.  I think its great that 2 batteries are included so your phone should last a while on one charge.The phone comes with the goggle play store already installed and was amazed at how many apps come included.  I got apps that even my old virgin mobile phone could not get!  A lot of the apps are free and I suggest you put them on your sd card so can enjoy all of your apps without having to delete them off the phone to make room.The phone runs on android 4.0.4 which allow for a great browsing experience when you are playing with this phone.  I get 3g service in most places in my area which I think was great considering I paid under $200 for this phone that looks like it could be worth $500.The camera on this phone is decent for the price.  Even in dim light I can take great pictures with the back camera, however the front camera is grainy sometimes even when there is light in the room.  I think it is great also that this phone takes screen shots (just hold down the top power button and the down key on the volume button)Accessories and the cons:When I first got this phone I immediately looked for a case for it and got nothing.  Instead I took a chance on a galaxy note case that was made of tough rubber and it fits great.  Not like a glove but I know my phone is not going anywhere.  Although the buttons are off,  there is enough room in the case where I can just simply press and it will work fine.  But if you wanted to use your headphones you would have to take the case off.There is only one con about this phone I noticed in the few days I had it is that when I am charging the phone and I try to use it, the buttons tend to have a mind of its and decides to do what it wants.  When I take the phone off the charger it works fine again so I try not to mess with it while its charging.  This is the only reason the phone does not get 5 stars but it is still a great phone either way.Overall I really like this phone.  I feel that I made a great purchase and had a great seller also (thankyou abettershop!) I would recommend this for anyone who is a beginner android user or if you just want a cheap android phone with great features.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW Amazing!!!!!", "Author": "elisa wood", "ReviewID": "R1V5BZVO8QVTNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone else who did a review before me hit the nail on the head.

And i am writing this review after placing an order for another one for my brother who wants it too.I was searching for a big screen android phone( not tablet anymore) when i saw this phone. i had my doubts about the quality when i saw the low price. To save time , this phone is a smaller samsung note 1 with a different name and a dual sim. My friends have the samsung note and i have used it too. I have no regret buying this phone and i have bought it again. Pictures on the screen are not as crisp as they are on the galaxy note, for the price difference i dont mind. it works so well in my country nigeria, only the tv won't work and i wouldnt bother.  The camera and flash works well but picture quality is not superb like the samsung.  Since you can access the android play store you have acces to the same applictions like any other android phone.  About the dual sim, this is your take home as it works so smart.you have the option of choosing a default sim to use for your voice calls, messaging, data connection or selecting which sim to use each time you want to call or send a message.  The data connection speed is very good.  I have a 32gb card on it and its running fine as i need a big memory for my movies.  You can use wi fi and wi fi hot spot and usb tethering.

The phone has a very solid feel to it, and there is nothing flimsy about it. The screen is HUGE; it dwarfs my iPod touch. It came with a usb charger, a cord, 2 batteries, a pre installed screen protector, a plastic back cover type case, and a cheap set of headphones with an inline mic. The battery life isn't bad if you make sure to manage the wifi, GPS, brightness, and bluetooth settings. Obviously if you leave them on all the time, battery life will be almost non-existent. This phone does support tethering, and it works well for me. I was able to use the phone's internet on my laptop with no problem. The maps are good, but the phone sometimes has trouble in buildings locating the GPS signal. The rear facing camera takes good to very good pictures, but sometimes has trouble focusing correctly. The front facing camera isn't great, but it's only used for skype anyway, so no complaints. The proximity sensor that shuts off the screen when you have the phone to your ear works fine for me; I had read somewhere that it would hang up when you touched the phone's end button against your cheek, but that hasn't been a problem. Also, this phone does have an accelerometer, aka gravity sensor, so games like bike race work well on this phone. This phone is really fast, too. I can stream music while playing games without a problem. The flash is about as bright as the flash on other smart phones and the touch screen is really sensitive. Ice Cream Sandwitch is nice, it works perfectly on this phone. The phone does act a little funny when it's charging on the included charger, but it works fine with other micro usb chargers, so no worries there. The main speaker is pretty loud for a phone, but the speaker used for phone calls could be louder. I activated this phone with Straigh Talk and had my old tracfone number ported to this phone in less than 2 hours. The stock keyboard leaves something to be desired, so I recommend that you just download Swiftkey 3, which costs about $4 after a free one month trial. In all, this phone is really great, especially when you consider that an unlocked Samsung Note costs around $500.UPDATEThis phone is still going strong after about 3 months. Sadly, after having it for only a couple weeks, I dropped the phone on its face and the camera stopped working. Since I'm not much of a picture taker and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it, I figured I could live with it and kept going. A couple days ago I fell off of my longboard with the phone in my pocket and the screen cracked, as would any phone when the weight of a human sand witched it against concreted. This phone is so good I'm just gonna buy another one to replace my current one. Seriously, if I wasn't so rough on it it would still be functioning just as good as when I got it; it's not any slower than when I got it.

I really liked the look of the large screen---it is like a combo phone/tablet.  I received this phone yesterday and am very disappointed.  Trying to do the simplest things are incredibly frustrating.  When I dial a number to make a call and the phone starts to connect, the screen goes completely black.  NOTHING will turn the screen back on until the call is disconnected.  But the real frustation is that I can't disconnect the call.  I've tried pushing all the buttons and even tried pressing the power button.  NOTHING will disconnect the call. This means that if I mistakenly dial a wrong number, I can't hang up.  The call goes thru and the person on the other end has to disconnect.  I am assuming this phone is defective, because otherwise this would be a seriously stupid design flaw.Also I tried logging into my Yahoo email account, but had the most frustrating time getting the phone to select the right letters/numbers to log in.  It repeatedly selected the wrong letters/numbers when I touched the screen.  I have pretty small fingers, so I would think it would be easier. I don't know how someone with larger hands could get it to select the right letters/numbers either.  The manual says you can use your thumbs to type, but it simply does not work correctly when I tried this. It types every other letter or number besides the one I want. Also, since I typed in the wrong login/password, Yahoo then wanted me to type a verification code.  When I tried to tap that small Verification Code box, it instead hightedlighted the \"login\" button.  So with no verifcation code, it tried to Login and of course, it does not work.  It then wipes out everything I had typed and I have to start all over.  I tried for a very long time last night and was never able to log in my email. FRUSTRATING!  The more expensive version of this phone comes with a stylus pen (I thought this one was supposed to as well), and believe me it is needed.I assumed that I needed to calibrate the screen to get it to work better.  The manual says to \"See Calibrator\".  However, there is no section in the manual about calibrating the screen.  I found a setting that appears to calibrate, however the only thing it said to do was lay the phone on a flat surface while the \"levels\" calibrate.  It did not tell me to tap the screen to calibrate the touch or the screen as other phones have done.Since this phone is so large, and does look a little stupid held up to your face, I assumed that it would have a speakerphone.  If it does, I can't find it.  Of course, my screen goes black when it dials calls.  Maybe if that didn't happen, I would see a selection for a speakerphone.The User's Manual is absolutely horrible.  It is obviously written by someone in which English is not their first language, so sometimes it just does not make sense.  In addition, the manual is very small.  One page has a list of Icons with a description of what they mean, but the icon in the book is so small, you can't even see what it is.There is no diagram with explanation of keys. For instance, under Making a Call, the manual says to end a call, press the \"Hang Up\" key.  However, there is no diagram to tell you which one is the Hang Up key.  I've tried the 3 keys across the bottom, the ones on the side and top and, as I said earlier, none of them will disconnect a call.Also, I had a REALLY hard time hearing the person on the other end of a call.  I pressed the toggle up button on the side but it did nothing for the sound.  Most phones show a volume slider so you can see if it is on the highest volume setting or not, but the screen stayed black, so I couldn't see if it thought it was increasing the volume or not. The manual says nothing about changing volume.I am currently trying to get a better manual.  Maybe there is a way to fix the above.  If I can't get a manual, this phone will be going back.Perhaps you get what you pay for and I will be forced to buy the more expensive version.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone", "Author": "Jarek F \"Jarek F\"", "ReviewID": "R192INTKCRN7Y7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the phone now for 3 days and I though I should comment, because the phone is amazing. I am a software developer, I bought this phone because it has Android 4.0 and  I use it with prepaid T-mobile service. In this moment it is a pleasure to use it. It was way cheaper then Samsung, it is fast, it has a beautiful big screen, it is almost perfect.One potential problem I noticed is the low range Wi-Fi. The phone couldn't detect my router from 10 feet range, I had to enter ssid manually and it works now. Also the phone doesn't seem to detect many other routers around my house which I can see on my android tablet and also on windows laptop. The other problem is the battery time, I was surprised to notice that the battery was almost completely drained after 15 hours on standby mode. All services disabled (WiFi off, GPS off, screen off etc) and this phone can't even last 24 hours with a fully charged battery on standby mode (specification claims it should be 10 times that), a comparable Samsung phone can do this for 3-4 days.Overall, the pros (almost everything) well outweighs the cons (listed above).

The phone first off says 4.0 but is actually 4.1.1 its very big but not to heavy touch screen seems to work fine with no problems, got the phone because im sick of 2 yr contracts from the big boys as i am not a heavy data user outside of wifi so i will be using on net10 or st. But as i am still on contract i havent signed up with anyone yet, so the phone came popped in my girls net10 sim and the phone fired up immediately, made a call with no problems. Now one issue was the call volume was on high but the other end was kind of low, could be a problem in noisy areas other than that it is fine. google play and other apps work fine will need an sd card though,phone comes with 2 batteries 1 set of earphones and a plastic cover for the back of phone for protection.  Phone also comes with a screen protector on it. played with it for awhile and the phone has long battery life but it took 3 or more hours to charge from around 30% so defnitely make sure you charge it overnight. camera takes ok picture not the greatest but not the worst either, wifi sometimes you have to/be close to the router to get full signal other times i have been outside the house with no problems go figure. Also if youre going to go with st i would suggest you go with att sim card as a lot of people have problems with the tmobile ones although the att ones can only be bought offline from amazon or ebay for around $40 on up, but straight talk has unlimited data compared to net10s 1.5 gig per month as they say if you go over they.will shut your data down instead of throttling it.

I was never into buying phones from providers, getting ripped off in the process.  A lot of people don't realize usually people would be paying 1.5 to 2 times the actual amount of the phone just from signing up for a new contract, minimum data plans and what not.  A lot of people think they're getting a deal with those \"subsidized phones\", ha!  Lots of sheep out there I tell yah.  Never used Android phone before, but I'm very familiar with the platform since I do have it on my tablets.  So I knew what to expect.  The phone itself was, surprisingly, very well built.  Sure, it not made of polycarbonate or brushed aluminum like a lot of branded phone have.  But for the price, it was more than I expected it to be.  Plus I have dropped it a couple times already, my daughter even at one point threw it to the ground from about 4 feet high (mind you, I don't use any case or jacket), it only got a scratch and everything else still worked.  No cracked glass like some phones out there after dropping it just once.  OS is snappy and comes with a lot of usual bells and whistles.  I wasn't happy that the GPS does not work offline, something I might have misunderstood reading the description when I placed my order.  I used to like using my phone as my dedicated GPS unit as well, less clutter in the car.  And I'm not going to bother using data for my GPS.  But for how much I paid for it I was willing to forego that part.  Camera is so so, but I kinda expected that.  A couple cons though, the description stated it came with an analog tv feature, granted I can't use it around here, but the unit did not come with it.  You could see cleary in the picture the antennae at the bottom of the phone, mine didn't have that.  A little false advertising there.  And if I remember correctly, forgive me if I'm wrong, it also stated that it comes with a free case, again not on mine.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, actually I did already.  Even bought my wife something similar to this.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like most everything except a little too big to carry", "Author": "Rlam", "ReviewID": "RUUESIBKG6HWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this over a month ago to replace a non-smart 2G AT&T; phone I have been using for about 7 years.  I tend to hold on to gadgets for a long time as long as it serves a purpose.  But with the 2G phone it comes to a point where I am not getting signals in places where at one time I did get signals, talked to AT&T; people they are basically telling me my phone is getting too old to be supported by them since 4G/3G towers are replacing older towers.So here's what I was looking for to replace the old phone (love the older phone that has days of talk times and not have to charge everyday, but with smartphone nowadays being a mini-computer daily charge is almost expected):I want a GSM (so I can also use overseas), unlocked (prepaid seems to be the trend and I do believe it saves money), user replaceable battery ( I have a 4 year old IPOD that original battery finally lost charge and had to replace and APPLE wanted too much, I did find local battery store replaced for $45).  Also I want additional memory that can be added (16 to 32 gb SDHC card) so I can transfer most apps into it without worrying about running out of memory.As far as 4G, LTE, NFC all these latest and fastest stuff I really do not need.  I think today's BEST will always become next years second best.  In my opinion, I am not interested in chasing the latest and best in everything.  You get what you pay for and besides I DO NOT want contract phone (which is where you find the Fanciest BRAND NAME wares) but it will cost you $600-$700 if buying it outright or stretching over 18-24 months subsidized upfront by Carriers they will make you pay dearly on monthly payments.So about this phone and seller:Seller-- bought it from LOLBUY as mentioned by many others.  Absolute no brainer, the best service.  Took 10 calendar days to ship from Hong Kong.  No anxiety and no worry about buying overseas.  Came nicely packaged and contents as described by others.  Though I tried using the charger that came with it and found it does strange things to phone while charging, so I just used other standard mini USB chargers I have & worked like a charm.  And also because of less than $180, it really is not a risk to me, in fact, I am not even wasting money to insure this phone as compared to something that cost $6-700 bucks.Phone:  Basically a generic Samsung Note clone, per reviews here and Amazon.com.UK this model was rated quite high because of the value.  For $179 you get:Big 5\" screen which I do like but after using for a month, it is cumbersome to carry for a man.  I put it in a Reiko brand leather pouch and belt-looped it around waist.  But it is rather large to carry.  I suppose for women they can put in the purse and that might be better.  Though I love the 5 inch screen, everything is easy to read.  The trend with smartphone seems to be getting more toward \"Phablets\" territory.  Don't be surprised to see Samsung Note 3 going to be 6 inches.  Definitely getting harder to hold in one hand and swipe the screen at the same time.  Not to mention discharging phone quicker because big screen uses battery the most.Dual Sims:  It can be useful for those who carries 2 phones.  Or when I take this overseas, I can just put my US SIM into the second slot so I dont lose it and put the foreign Sim into the first slot to use while there.Carrier:  Being GSM means either AT&T; or TMobile or their various MVNO.  I chose Straight Talk pre-paid which in my area is AT&T.;  Funny thing is when I put the new SIM in together with my old SIM from my non smart phone using the N8000 in rural area I can get signal via the Straight Talk SIm but not my ATT SIM (as I mentioned before the 2G SIM is getting useless in many areas).  For $45/month I get unlimited voice, text and data (supposedly one gets toggled down after 2gb, but I do not even come close to that usage).3G \"H\" speed when available, sometimes can be \"Edge\" speed is acceptable for my use.  The \"H\" speed came closed to Wi-Fi download speed where the \"E\" speed can be slow.  But I use this phone primarily for voice calling, sometimes texts, occasional internet surf through the day.Battery:  came 2 in the box.  After the initial charge/discharge cycling, the battery life actually improves somewhat.  With Wi-Fi and data connection turned off, no Blue-tooth, just phone ON, it lasts good 8-10 hours with some to spare.  I only turned on WI-Fi and data connection when I needed them.  Initially I had left WI-Fi & data on and battery drains pretty fast.Voice call:  this is a little bit weak in volume.  If there are much background noise, I found using an earbud set plugged in is the best way to talk and listen.  If there aint much noise in background then phone is fine to hear through.Android: Ice cream version is pretty update and useable for the next couple years. I am sure Google will have newer version (K, L, M etc who knows?).  Considering there are still plenty Androids out there using ginger-bread,this one is quite update. Apps can be downloaded pretty quickly through Wi-Fi.Camera:  front and back but I always have a dedicated camera that shoots better picture/video when I travel, so this is just for everyday snapping away, not expecting super quality.  It does support Skype which is nice too.Overall quite please with this phone for its price, I think it is an excellent value.  Certainly cannot compete with IPhone 5, Nexus 4, Galaxy S3 etc on specs but it suits me well.  Some may think the plastic back is too flimsy but for a phone this size it is fairly lightweight.  I've popped the back open many times to put battery, SIM cards, SDHC card in and it snapped back solidly.  The smoke plastic back that snapped on the phone fits nicely and together with my Reiko leather case (Samsung Galaxy Note Pouch $2.30) it fits perfectly.  Screen protector that was already pre-installed temporary prevents phone from getting too scratched (it obviously does not have Gorilla glass) but I am looking for a more durable replacement screen protector.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "S.

I purchased unlocked in June, I highly recommend to avoid this device.  I am on my 3rd time sending it back due to a known device error in which you can not charge the device with the usb.  At this time I was fed up, my husband took over this device and headache from Sony and I purchased this phone due to customer reviews all over the internet, just not amazon.I purchased Saturday and received the phone last night, via prime.My husband and I decided to let our AT&T; contract go, due to the excessive fees just for having a smartphone, even if you barely use the data plan, which we don't because we rely on wi-fi the majority of the time.We decided Net10, which uses AT&T; lines.  I purchased the sim card (and Net10 comes with 3 different kinds which mirrors AT&T;, T-Mobile and one for the iPhone), then purchased the 50.00 prepay card.  I followed the directions, slipped the sim card in this phone, configured the APN settings and was up and going in 10 minutes on my home wi-fi.  Also, tested the connectivity of the phone and got 3G signal.I deleted the chinese apps, as it is not applicable to me.  Loaded my favorite apps, no issue.  Tested the phone for skype usage with my niece, comes through like a charm.  The rear camera is better than the front camera, but that is not an issue for me.  Configured all my email accounts, everything runs smooth.The size of the phone is large.  I have a kindle fire which is a bit larger but not really that much.The resolution on the screen is great.  This is a perfect knock off of the Galaxy Note in just about every aspect with the exception of the amole screen.  The OS is 4.1.1I am still reviewing much of the settings, etc., but you can not beat the price of this phone, period.  With many leaving contract plans due to over prices for the data, wanting a smartphone, going to a pay as you go plan, this phone will suit your needs in every way, especially your pocket.Lastly, the phone has duo sim slots.  This is GREAT because before my AT&T; is up tomorrow, I slipped the sim card in and used the android app copy2sim and downloaded my contacts from my AT&T; card to my phone, then took the AT&T; sim card out and copied the contacts to the Net10 sim, voila, up and running!!!1/31/13 - P.S. this phone is currently available from Sears, saw it online!!!  Enjoy everyone, but get it from amazon it is cheaper than Sears!!!2/2/13 - Hard to find a case, though this is a knock off of the galaxy note, many cases configuratiion are slighty wrong for this phone.

The phone came promptly (4 days) and it was well packed and seems to be of good quality.  I purchased a t-mobile prepaid 30 buck 100 min / 5 GB data plan (from walmart) and a twenty dollar phone (also from walmart).  Activated the cheap phone and then swapped the sim card into this one.  Then transferred my previous verizon number to the new account.  It's working great with the following caveats.  1) t-mobile is in the process of upgrading their system to the standard 1900 mhz this phone uses.  It's already happened in major markets and is expected in my town this year.  Until then I am on 2G which is pretty slow for data. 2) this is a 3g phone so even when the upgrade is complete i will not be able to take advantage of 4g speeds.  It's worth it to me.  In six months the savings vs verizon will pay for the phone.  I use it on wifi when i can and the phone itself is snappy and quick.  I love the big screen for email and facebook and expect to use it for that much more than my previous droid incredible.  The battery life is great, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use, and, it came with a spare battery.  android 4.0 is not the very latest thing (4.1 i believe) but at this price i can upgrade again in a year or so and in the meantime plug local sim cards in when i travel.  great phone!  i'm very happy and would recommend it.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE", "Author": "Renato Donoso", "ReviewID": "R32RI1NZM7IXEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone works just fine and it is just as described.

When I first got it, it was awesome for me since I was an amateur at using smartphones. However, keep in mind that things are cheap for a reason. The quality isn't that good. The front-facing camera really sucks, very grainy and unfocused. The home button stopped working too, it just won't react when I press it. Additionally, I had a very hard time turning it on. Once I turn it off, it seems like I can't turn it back on no matter how many times I press it. I had to press the power button for a long time before it turned on. Not only that, the whole entire system just sucks. I have to wait a long time for the phone to load after turning it back on, and it's hard to make outgoing calls sometimes. The phone started having more and more malfunctions after using it, and I had problems with the charger. It just wouldn't charge, and the battery would die out really fast. It's even worse now that I've had it for a year. When I start charging, the screen freezes and turns completely white. I'm planning to buy a new phone now. This phone is okay for beginners at smartphones, but it can't last a year. As I stated, this phone is cheap for a reason. If you're willing to take the risks, then spend the money.

I'll keep you all updated as I make a leap of faith myself. I have researched for about 2-3 weeks and decided to buy this phone based on the reviews I've read so far. Once I placed the order, I emailed the seller to request that they send me a white phone since there was no option to select from. I must say I'm amazed at the excellent customer service. Today is Saturday and I wasn't expecting to hear from them though their page says I'd be contacted in about 12 hours of the request. Amazingly, I received a response in less than 5 hours, confirming that I'd be sent a white phone and assuring me of a great buying experience. The seller I purchased from is \"Pro2011\".I know there are many people out there who are still considering to buy your first phone from China but quite skeptical about it. Well, I took the risk today and will write a full review when the phone comes. I have Amazon Prime with the two-day shipping, so I'm expecting to receive the phone by Tuesday March 19th or the 20th. Stay tuned and I'll keep you updated with as honest and thorough review to help you make a decision too.This is my revised review on Tuesday March 19th,2013.....I received the phone today but wasn't quite happy at all. I don't know if anyone had the same experience but I suspect the phone I received had been used before. I mean there isn't anything that shows the phone is coming from a manufacturer's store. Removable factory screen protector has scratches. Batteries have scratches and show signs of wear. The extra back case that came with the phone seriously has dust particles and scratches, which indicate the phone has been slightly used. My best guess is that it was sent to someone who didn't like it and returned it. In fact, the manual that came with the phone has been read and soiled with some yellowish stain and the one that struck me the most is the fact that the inner part of the top cover of the phone's box has been tempered with, which kind of made me curious because I paid for a NEW phone and not a slightly used phone. I contacted Amazon and seller just under 2 hours from the delivery and hoping to return the phone tomorrow. I really don't want to use it, so I have repackaged the item and ready for return shipping. The only accessories  that were sealed as one would expect of a NEW phone were the charger and earphone.Aside this rather disappointing experience, which I surmise may be an isolated case peculiar of the seller I purchased from, I think the phone looks good. Amazon's customer service is beyond excellent. While in the process of writing this review, they responded to my query in less than 5 hours and have already issued a refund and promised a goodwill gesture of a one-day shipping on a similar item.I guess things sometimes don't work out pretty good when we have so much expectations. The other thing that baffles my mind though is the fact that the phone shipped from Las Vagas, NV when all this while I though it was coming from China or somewhere in Asia. So again, it might just be an isolated situation and more of a problem with the seller I purchased from. I haven't given up though. Once I get my refund, I'll order from another seller and hope to receive a new phone this time around. If everything was okay with the phone and I had no doubt whatsoever that it had been used, I'd have been very happy with my purchase as this phone is a rivalry to the Galaxy note and you can't beat the price!", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not great, but okay", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R31BTFBZVWSZA6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to love this phone, but no such luck. I wouldn't consider this a Samsung Note knock off. This is simply a less expensive note phone with half the quality of most name brands. I was able to use the AT&T; Straight Talk sim and get the same signal as on my HTC. I only have an HTC Status and a ZTE Warp to compare this to right now.Cons:WiFi- Horrible- I don't get a signal if I'm more than 7 feet away from the router. My other phones get the full 54mbps with excellent signal.Camera- Terrible. The pictures are horribly grainy and fuzzy. There are lines that run vertically that you can see before and after you snap a pic. I don't know if this is because the camera itself is crappy or if really is 5MP as advertised. I used Gtalk to vid chat with a friend that has a Samsung S3 and she looked amazing and clear, but my pic looked bad.Screen- Weird. Pictures viewed in a browser are great, however this depends on which angle you are holding the phone. While in upright position, viewing it from the left makes it look very dark and viewing it from the right makes everything look extra bright, almost white.Internal Memory- Sad. There is only 500MB!!! Even the cheap lower end phones have 1G or more. Sure you can expand by adding a micro sd card, but it's still ridiculous.RAM- 512MB as advertised, but I have around 160 with ONLY stock apps running.Available Memory- Soooo Low. According to Advanced Task Killer app I only have 127 available memory. Facebook uses about 40MB so there's no way I'm going to be able to install it. \uf04cApps- I'm having a hard time finding a browser that works on it. There have been a lot of force closes. It always resets my default keyboard  (Swiftkey) back to the Android keyboard when I turn it off.It always shows the signal bars for the 2nd SIM card slot even though I only use one, and notifies me that I don't have one in the first slot.The color and items it comes with depends on the seller you buy it from. I received this in white with 2 batteries, earphones, usb charger, hard case for the back, and a screen protector already on it.Pros:-good battery time. I was only down to 85% after being on for over 12 hours. However that was with minimal use.-comes with 2 batteries-large screen-actually came with Android 4.1.1 (jelly bean) instead of the 4.0 (ice cream sandwhich) as advertised-screen protector was already on-ringer and notification sounds were loud-boots really fastOverall: Not worth the price. You're paying for the large screen and the fact that it's advertised as a \"note\". This phone reminds me a lot of the $100 tablet I bought from walmart. The screen and camera quality (or lack thereof) is exactly the same, which was one of the reasons I returned the tablet. The Pros don't come close to outweighing the Cons.

Had to go to Straight Talk website and reconfigure some settings on phone to be able to fully access my phones features but once I got my mobile web working the wifi issue became a non-issue anyway. Overall, really like this phone. Except for the wifi issue it is a real bargain for the price and a very attractive phone.

I'm not very smartphone literate, so it's taken some tinkering and googling.This seems like a substantial phone for the money and overall I'm happy with my purchase.  Only thing is I wasn't sure which sim card slot to use for TMobile service in the US.. instruction manual was no help...hence the Googling.  I've tried both sim card slots and unless I turn on TMobile data, the phone will give me message that I am out of 3G range.  I am in the city so I am definitely in 3G range.  What does turning on the data connection have to do with making a phone call?  And trying to download a 1.5MB app from the google app store didn't work.  Ended up having to use WIFI.Also, another reviewer said that their call volume was very loud.  Mine is very soft even with the call volume level set to Max.No analog TV channels in my area...I think all of U.S has upgraded to only digital. Haven't tried the camera yet. :)Update 2-1-2013:  TMobile somehow noticed that I was having trouble making phone calls and sent me an automatic app that set all of my phone settings for me.  Thought that was pretty amazing.  But unfortunately still can't get 3G data, only get Edge.  Went to TMobile store, one rep told me phone was GSM/GPRS (according to what was printed on front of User guide booklet) and that meant that phone was only 2G capable, but another TMobile rep told me that this (international) phone runs on 1900 mhz, and that TMobile has not finished upgrading LTE service here, and that by the end of March I should be able to get 3G on this phone.  They also told me that since this phone is a clone and also was not purchased or authorized by TMobile they really couldn't offer me any support for it.  So, it remains to be seen if I'll ever get 3G or not :(Update 5-10-2013: Still no 3G data.

Then again, I did not set a high one base on the reviews. The key reason I bought these phone is that I travel a lot country to country and the Dual SIM card will help hotswapping and potentially losing a SIM. And for that, this device is fantastic. No issues putting and recognizing a SIM Card from UAE and Afghanistan. As for the OS, this was my first official ICS cell. I have always used test ICS ROMs prior and with a dedicated, stable one I was able to truly experience the benefits. It is fast and full of features such as swipe capabilities to running apps. But what impressed me the most is the battery life. At first I was skeptical with this item because it came with two batteries; inferring that the battery life was disappointing. However, luckily, that is not the case. This phone had an amazing standby time. I had it sitting in my bag for 3 days without use or charge and it still had about 78% life left. I used it none-stop to play games and it lasted the entire day before needing a charge; which is amazing for having a 5inch screen. I have yet to depend or require the second battery pack. As for the analog tv receiver, I was not impressed. I was able to get a couple channels while in Afghanistan and none in Dubai but I did not get it for that. And when I did test the ability to watch, it was difficult to pickup a station indoors (as expected of course). It was too cold to be outside to test. But when I did pick up a channel or two, the station came in acceptably clear and the volume/sound was clear and loud. The antenna however feels flimsy and seems like it will break easily; I haven't used it enough to use it to the extent. The biggest disappointment, however, is the WiFi which I was hoping to rely on. At times it cannot pick up a signal that is full strength compared to the strength represented on my laptop. And when I am connected, it sometimes does not retain if I blackout my screen to save battery. I guess that may be a good thing so I am not running the WiFi constantly in the background, if we are talking about battery management. Another disappointment, which is not a big deal, is the camera. The software seems to make images darker than normal. It could be because I had it set to HDR mode but I haven't yet considered testing out other settings to see which is best. I am surprised and happy it has a panorama and HDR setting at all. Lastly, I was often spoken of as having a \"Big @$$ phone\" because many are not use to having a 5inch screen. This though is actually smaller, thinner, and sleeker than other 5inch devices such as the Dell Streak (AKA Dell Mini 5). It fits well in the hand and for the purpose I use it for it is perfect; taking notes in replacement of using paper and pen. It fits nicely in my pocket without giving an uncomfortable bulge or provide an obvious appearance. So it will depend all in all on one's expected use of this that will vary the ratings. For a phone with dual SIM capabilities and proper size for notetaking it is fine. For others, it is simply below standard.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A well-priced knock-off of the Galaxy Note", "Author": "WAYNE WECHSLER", "ReviewID": "RYYDA2LOT9G7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks and feels like a Note, but missing the punch of the amoled display.

At first things worked out okay.  Now I am having all kinds of problems with this phone.  I have never dropped or shattered the screen yet the digitizer on the phone is bad.  I have several dead spots on the touch screen.  Currently I can only text and take pictures when the phone is in Landscape mode.  NOT COOL!!! Also the phone will just randomly shut off and I have to reboot the system.  I will contact (LOL Buy) the seller to see what if anything can be done about this.  I will make a repost regarding the result of contacting the seller. I would say if you only plan on using this phone for one year then this might be the phone for you.  However if you would like it to last longer then that then I would look elsewhere.Dec 30, 2012I waited to write this review to see if the phone was good or not.  So far so good.  I only gave it 4 stars because the phone instruction manual is a joke.  Once you boot the phone up there are more icons that you will see than what is listed in the  manual.  I even tried to google to find out what some of the other icons meant-Nada!! No info about this phones icons.  I had to just keep messing around with the phone until I could figure it out on my own.  What's in the box: Two batteries, 1 phone case, one wall charger with a usb cord charger, on the phone itself is the clear screen protector and head phones. Durability: NO CRACKS.  I have a shell case on it that came in the box.  Service: I use T-mobile.  The Note 8000 is a 3g phone.  It says it on the box so I wasn't expecting 4g.  It works on T-Mobile's 4g network and uses 3g and edge.  The only problem that I had initially with dialing was that I needed to switch to the other sim slot.  Once I did that I've had no problem since.  I can't wait to use the TV when I travel out of country.  In US this feature is a no go but it's a big crowd pleaser when showing the phone to friends.  FYI: It is important to turn the phone off for at least 45 seconds everyday.  When I don't do this I notice the phone doesn't function as well.  Treat it like you would a mini computer because after all it basically is anyway.  Overall not a bad purchase. Accessories:I recommend trying online.  There are not that many for this phone.  Don't expect all Galaxy Note accessories to fit this phone-you will be disappointed.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rather nice", "Author": "Dmitry Cheryasov", "ReviewID": "R4I42RK3HV6XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone works well.

Android works flawlessly, and I just love its five virtual screens. The application store is great, as always. There are 2 slots for sim cards and one for a miniSD card. The phone max volume is very loud! I can hear it from 2 rooms away. WiFi gets an excellent signal, and browsing the web is really fast.

I tried to play with the sensitivity settings and it doesn't matter really it does the same thing when ON the charger. BUT off the charger it's just fine.- I went through ATT/Go Phone plan and it worked just fine, the only thing is even though my fiance had the SAME plan thru the SAME company and a different phone... his reception was MUCH better... which doesn't make too much sense but something to consider.- Another thing I noticed is the fact that this is a KNOCK OFF of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE I717/i9220. I know this because i do now have an authentic Samsung galaxy note ( NOT bought on amazon) and i compared them when i got it.- As far as cases, I could NOT find a case for this knock off phone because the dimensions on this knock off are smaller both height and width wise and the placement of the camera, mic, headphone jack etc are slightly moved around so trying to buy anything for it was impossible. I bought a hybrid case with kickstand that I thought would work but the knock off was too small. Now, that same phone case is FOR the Samsung Galaxy note, which fits snuggly and perfectly in every aspect for the Original phone. I would give the cases 0 out of 10.  (Also, If we're talking more comparisons, the Original phone has an \"S-pen\" for it.... the knock off has an Antenna which in my opinion is placed awkwardly and doesn't even work. They advertise that you can get basic channels but no matter where I went there was nothing around. So as far as \"free channels\"... I wouldnt count on it.)-The battery was alright for normal use but I found after about 2-3 months of regular normal use the battery life faded and I found myself always needing to charge it. They DO give you a second battery in the package BUT.... same result. So i'd give that a 5 out of 10.-The camera is surprisingly good-fair quality. Compared to the original, its about the same but not AS good. Still if you're looking for decent camera quality, it'd give it 7 out of 10.- Call quality is decent. (besides dropped calls mainly because the reception wasn't great) 7 out of 10-The screen quality and clarity is good as well. 8 of 10One thing I will touch on though and it's on both ends. The reason I had to get a new phone was because I dropped the phone flat ( accidentally) from a height of about a foot and a half maybe less and it COMPLETELY shot the phone. The Touch mechanism went out. I could turn it on, but no luck trying to get anything to work. Strangely enough, if i had it turned on or the battery just in the phone, the alarm would go off... but it's none that I set. Random times which was irritating so i just took the battery out. So I took the phone to a cell repair shop and they took it apart to see if maybe it's just a wiring problem and said the wiring is fine but twisted in a weird way. They couldn't find a physical reason why the touch went out but upon further inspection there is NO factory Reset button ANYWHERE and there is absolutely NO way to reset it if your touch goes out. It then becomes completely useless. The only thing i could recycle ( give to them to use again) on the phone was the battery. Otherwise they said there's nothing that can be done besides sending it back to the people I bought it from and although I considered it, I know it can be pricey and I am not willing to pay that or Wait because I needed a phone.- All in all, the phone is a good phone for functionality, calling, apps, downloading, internet and I know I didn't go through every single little detail about it, but please feel free to ask me questions because I remember better that way.  I personally would not buy this phone again purely because I found the original is sooo much better and you get what you pay for, basically. If it's something for a teen or starter smartphone and you don't want to pay BIG then I'd say it's okay but if you want the guarantee authenticity then it's not for you. Ultimately I recommend reading others reviews as well and make your own decisions.

When I turn on my phone I like the way it starts up with the little Android thing.2). It came with this cover for your phone.3). Came with 2 batteries.4). Came with a screen protectant.5). I like the messaging conversation look. It's not bubbles like with an iPhone or with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.6). You can throw this phone on the ground as hard as you can because of how bad it will irritate you and it won't crack. It's plastic!MY HATES:1). My AT&T; sims card was too small so I went to Radio Shack and spent $25 on a bigger sims card & then I went to AT&T; and got it activated. It now works so it's alright now. But that was pretty irritable.2). I don't know if in the description the seller said it was pink. Maybe I didn't read it. I don't like the color pink. I thought it was white so that upset me. What if I was a boy? I would have returned it.3). The ear phones look and feel cheap.4). I bought this yesterday and this already is freezing up on me when I try to text. It hasn't been even 24 hours since I'v actually started using it.5). When I'm texting someone and I want to erase the whole text message that I was about to send I would hold the backspace button down to erase faster and then the keyboard just goes away and I have to swipe up to get the keypad back up. So you have to individually, for each letter backspace.6). When I'm in a phone call I can't use my phone at all. My phone goes black and I can't do anything until the person on the other end ends the call. I can't end my calls. The other person has to hang up because I can't. So I can be in a phone call with my mother and then I can't hang up. What if my boyfriend says something inappropriate before I got to hang up?7). It feels cheap in your hands.You don't need a case for it. It's plastic. I've actually thrown this phone on the ground twice as soon as I started using it because of how bad this phone is. It doesn't even deserve half of a star rating.8). When I'm texting someone I have to be careful because I'll be texting and then all of a sudden the keypad goes away and its hard to swipe the keypad back up.9). The phone has 2 sim card places so if you only have one sim card in the phone it will keep on asking you if the 2nd sims card is ready to use in the notification area.The only reason I'm keeping this phone is because I've had my wait to get this phone.

I got the one, such item. It worked for about three weeks and then, the touch-screen failed. However, I hate the seller, InnoMate Digital. The company lied on two grounds (1) that I did not return accessories associated with the product and (2) that I had used the unit for so long (45 days), that IT COULD NOT RESELL THE RETURNED TELEPHONE. InnoMate's complaint alarmed me, because, it implied that, if the accessories were in the returned box (and they were), the seller would probably repair and resell the telephone, without indicating that, it was a repaired item. No company should RE-SELL AS NEW, a defective product, returned by a customer.As someone, who lived in China for many years, and still visit the country, for extended periods, I am aware that Chinese transactional legislation has not adopted the Western ideas that (1) the customer is presumed to be right, most of the time and if, s/he is not, the merchant grants the customer a benefit-of-doubt, at least, to establish good relations with the buying public; (2) Chinese merchants do not agree that, goods are returnable, within reasonable time, even if, they have been used and, especially, if the product has a defect, damage, dysfunction, or inconsistent with claims made for it.While in Shanghai, in December 2010, my friend purchased for me, a shaver, which would not work in the United States. Within ten minutes, we returned to the store, and requested an exchange, for one, with dual electric systems.The merchant demurred, insisting that, the sale was final and if, we wanted the other brand, which was more expensive by, as much, as Rmb 150, we should pay for both.I refused, called Chinese Police, and was taken to a local precinct, where a European-trained officer intervened and \"ordered\" the seller, to exchange the merchandise, by which time, we had spent an entire morning and mid-day, haggling over an issue that would have been concluded in two minutes, in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States.I had a similar encounter in both Nigeria and Ghana, in 2012 but, this time, I inquired, before buying.No one should buy goods, that are unreturnable; no one!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "WHAT PHONE!!!???", "Author": "CC", "ReviewID": "RN7KJECZY0HP2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "NEVER GOT IT.

I have found however, ( the same as in the youtube video), that when the phone restarts - this value is not saved and you have to do this again.Another probem is the wireless (wiFi) connection. Everytime the phone's screen turns off, I have to disable and enable wifi, even if I did not move the device from within the wifi range - it looses connection when the screen turns off.So, I will proabably keep this phone as a second/backup phone.Not the best there is, but for this price, it's a 'better than nothing', backup phone.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Dirg", "ReviewID": "R2JGR95DMYXPEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far my experience is great..

It was my escape from Sprint and their awful service in order for me to pay less money on my wireless plan.I am giving this product 2 stars. 1 star being terrible! A half star because you get an inexpensive Android device with Ice Cream Sandwich and another half star because of the 2 sim card slots giving me more flexibility.Pros:Shipping from Hong Kong took 3 days to get to me in Los Angeles. Came with 2 batteries and a screen protector already stuck on it.Runs Ice Cream Sandwich, so you get all the features that you would expect from that OS.2 SIM card slots. I can take advantage of T-Mobiles $30/ month plan for data and unlimited text. With those 100 minutes they throw in I shopped around and got a secondary SIM card for more, cheaper minutes. 2 SIM cards = 2 phone numbers.Huge screen.Totally unlocked! No bs software. Made for developers and hackers because you can really dig into the phones code if you wanted to.Cons:T-Mobile claims that this phone doesn't have 3G, so they dumbed it down to 2G \"EDGE\". Complete bs!The light sensor went wacky! Usually when you receive a call like I did on my previous HTV EVO 4G, the screen will go black once you put the phone up to your ear, then the screen will light back up when you take the phone away from your ear. Well, once I make or receive a phone call, the screen goes black and no amount of button pressing will get it back! The little sensor keeps flashing a red light at me, but it's barely noticeable. So that part is defective. It's annoying when I make a call because I can't use the screen to enter numbers if I have to call a company's automated system. AND if I call a friend and it goes to voicemail, I have to leave my message then tell them when it's over. Sit through the voice prompts telling me to press 1 or 2 for whatever and I cant hang up the phone!Stylus' aren't compatible. I trie using a Nintendo 3DS pen as well as other stylus' and none of them work.The antenna is useless in America. We use a digital tv signal here so the analog antenna receives nothing. AND if you wanna use the FM radio, you still have to plug in headphones.It has corrupted my mini sd card twice now. I think it's from dropping the phone. Even though this morning I dropped it on my carpet from about 2 feet high. I think that's what causes this problem.The phone is super slippery! You have to use 2 hands.The wifi is awful.The volume on the ear piece is super low.That's about it for now.This device makes for a great back up phone or a wanna be tablet.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not 3G", "Author": "R.

My initial fears were the same that most people have; am I buying an inferior product, is this too good to be true, and will it be compatible with Android features in the U.S.? All of them are legitimate, but gladly none of them are well founded in this case. If you are worried about some compromises between this phone and the Samsung Note II, then here is a bit of a run down. First, the back of the phone is not as durable as it could be. Also the screen isn't Amolded or anything like that but it is still a fairly good quality. Second, I don't believe that it carries the same \"beam technology\" that you will find on the Samsung S3. The phone was under $200 bucks...big deal. Third, you will definitely want to buy a memory card because the memory on the hard drive is almost non-existent. The camera quality, especially the front facing camera is...well...its bad really bad compared to other phones I've had, but in the same breathe its not the absolute worst either. You will have to decided on that.All in all the phone was a wonderful buy, and if you use the right seller you will have an awesome experience and your wallet will thank you. My friends were so jealous over the quality and the price of the phone, it just makes sense to me to NOT throw hundreds away for the sake of a name and a few bells and whistles...***Update***Ok so I used the Straight Talk ATT compatible sim with the phone and the call quality was...okay not great. BUT the stupid phone goes completely blank when placing or receiving calls!!! Others have complained about this problem. I tried adjusting phone settings...nothingSo although I liked the phone, this is TOTALLY a deal breaker, but I am an optimist and am going to try a replacement, I will update you on that soon.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low Quality phone", "Author": "beryl okyere-twum", "ReviewID": "R2YR6O6OQP3EC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is beautiful and that's it.

Even though i do not actually receive 3g speed and i am always on edge its not really much of a problem for me because I'm constantly near WiFi all the time.

I am really glad I got this phone because, I must say that it is pretty fast. The one thing I have to stress is that on the box it stated that it ran android 4.1 but it actually runs android 4.0 the ice cream sandwich not the jelly bean version. But, it's still pretty fast, and I was able to set up service on t-mobile with the $50.00 a month plan, because I do use my phone quite a bit for school and, for work. The display is pretty bright, and the sound quality is solid. I've got my blue tooth headphones paired with this phone,and I was able to transfer my music files over to the phone, so now I've got my music going as I write this review. The playback quality is amazing, clear and crisp. The phone came with a case already which is nice and, the headphone set, two batteries, and adapter with usb cable. I know there are some people who bought the phone and, they have problems finding a case. I bought two samsung note cases, and what I've done is put their case on, plus my case on top to give it a more secure fit. Because if I just fit my galaxy note case on the phone it's a bit loose, but the phone won't fall out. However you want to fit it is up to you. However if you want the phone to have a more secure fit then this might be a better option. I used the white flexible case with kickstand.

The ability to have 2 SIM cards is useful for those who have 2 numbers on the same carrier, or numbers with different carriers. The SD-Micro slot handled the 16GB card from my previous phone with no issues, and the operating system allows you to store some of the downloaded programs and content on the SD card with no issues as far as I found. You can also set the card to be the primary storage for the camera, and for clips recorded from TV.Many features of the phone are due to the SOFTWARE. The operating system (Android) is available on many other phones, so many of the features will be found on other phones, such as the ability of the phone to upload camera images automatically to your Google Plus account as soon as WiFi is available (you can also set this option to happen over the cell network).Now the bad: The hardware itself is really not great - the camera takes muddy, mushy images that look fine on the 5\" screen of the phone, but look interpolated and blurred on a computer screen. This phone sucks battery life like you would not believe. If I didn't have a charger in my car, the phone would be dead most of the time. What's worse is that this is not predictable. There are times when the phone has been left alone, and the batteries show very little drain for hours, and there are times when the phone seems to be busy doing something in the background, it gets hot, and drains the battery in less than an hour. I can't figure out what causes it - I have even tried shutting down all non-essential services including WiFi and Bluetooth, to no avail.The unit ships with 2 batteries. One of mine was dead after one use. The other is chugging along, but I live between chargers, which is not good.The speakerphone is only audible in very quiet rooms, and the wireless services are very short-sighted. The bluetooth typically drops off just over 1.5 metres, and the WiFi reception is also fairly bad unless you are within 3 metres or so of the wireless router.It's not a bad phone for exploring Android, but really, keep the wireless devices close, and the charger closer.Even better; save your money and get an iPhone.

The phone I received didn't have the TV antenna which is no big deal since I am in the US and we don't use analog TV here anymore. Also the phone ran Android 4.2 not 4.0 which is an upgrade so it was a plus.Now I researched this particular phone for weeks before I purchased it. I knew there was a risk but after reading many reviews I decided to click buy. What i received was not what i researched so I was a bit upset but the phone looked great so I tried it out for about a week.The phone itself looked very nice. It didn't feel or look cheap. The screen looks great and way better than expected. Andoid 4.2 ran flawlessly and never had any lag or freezing problems in the week I had it. I was really surprised on how great the phone ran since my expectations weren't very high. The resolution on the display was bright and sharp. Most apps worked fine.Now I will explain the bad and why I returned the phone. The camera. It's bad. I have always used my phones as my primary camera since it's always on me and I have 2 little ones so I am always snapping dozens of pictures per day. The back camera was OK in very good lighting but still one of the worst phone cameras Ive seen since having about 5 different smartphones in the past 5 years. The front facing camera was so bad it was totally not useable. I also couldn't get mms to work on the phone which could have been a service thing (straight talk.)  Some apps did not run well. Youtube streamed fine but netflix would not play videos. I couldn't video chat at all with any capable app. Now what was a main deal breaker for me was the earpiece was absolutely terrible.I could barely hear anybody at the highest volume setting and it sounded very staticy.

I got my phone i was really surprised on how fast the battery drained but after a couple of days, the battery life was longer. It lasts for a whole day and i charge it overnight.03. SOUND - speakers are really bad. I personally don't mind because I like using my headphones. Its okay.04. PERFORMANCE - it was really good, a bit laggy sometimes (but its okay since it's not a perfect phone) I really liked it! I could Call and Text, use my 3G data plan and wifi. It resets by its own for no reason! It happened a couple of times. LATELY its became more irresponsible (like when you want to use task manager on your windows xp) and today its on a reboot loop (Its stuck on that animation where the worm crawls then forms the word android).

Choi", "ReviewID": "R3721363HI3G9O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already put a positive feed back with the seller (i bought this phone through lolbuy).  I received a defective phone when the phone first arrived.  The menu and return key stopped working all of a sudden.  I was skeptical like all other buyers that I may not be able to do anything and my money will go down the drain.  Luckily the seller is very responsible and he sent me a replacement after I mailed the defective phone back to him.  So I would say received a excellent service from him.  Due to business reason, I need a phone right away and can't wait another month for the replacement I decided to get an original Galaxy note and this phone I'll let my daughter use this phone.  The signal is good, I live in a worst signal place and the old phone I got 2 bars, I actually got 3 bars with this phone.  The volume is loud enough and my daughter actually want to turn down the volume.  The camera - it's true that it's not as good as the original one, but it's decent enough and I don't buy phone because they have good cameras.  The color of the screen is great, and honestly I think it's better than my Galaxy note, it's fast and responsive.  It's true that it doesn't get all the bells and whistles that the original Galaxy note has but it's good enough for day to day use, you can just download the apps that you need from the play store.  The battery life may also be not as good as the real one, but the seller is providing 2 batteries and that's very nice. The screen protector and case is also provided and that save the buyer some money too.  It would be nice if the seller can provide an extra case, since it will be very hard to find a case elsewhere.  The pricing is really good, if you have the extra money to buy a Galaxy note ($500 right now) or ($700 for Galaxy note 2) then go for it, they are really nice phone too.  You are only pay a fraction of cost of the original phone, the among you are saving on the phone itself and you do not have to be tie to a 2 year contract, you are actually saving over $1000, that means you can change a new phone every year.

I received the phone way ahead of the 3 week delivery date.  I got it in 5 days after I ordered and it was packaged very securely.  The battery life is very good.  It works on my ATT gsm pay as you go contract.  I also find the dual sim helpful, especially for when I'm on call (for work) and can plug in my work ATT blackberry's sim in the 2nd slot.  I love not having to carry 2 devices around.  Another plus is the teathering hotspot feature.  Great for hotspoting my son's cell phone so he can use my data when we are out and there is no free wifi around.  His cell phone plan is talk and text only.  but when he is with me and my phone, I can hotspot him (giving him my data access).  I also like that Skype works on this phone too. Overall great phone.  I'm looking for a case, would be great if Amazon can get some cases for this phone.  The only down side I'm finding is that the speaker on the phone is not as loud as I would like, even when turned on to the max.  Speaker is fine for youtube videos, game and music sounds, but not for when I receive phone calls.  Which is fine, since I prefer using earphones when talking on the phone.

I really don't get why the big companies lag so far behind.  Anyways, the phone has some good points and some bad points.  As all phones do this is no different.  I also have some unknown things if it is my phone or the services I use.  I use straight talk so it's one of the cheapest services.Pros:1. The phone comes unlocked so you can put it on any service.2. Those who like big phones like almost tablet size this is it.3. Comes with plugs for other countries besides United States mainly Asian plugs.I used these for places like Philippines.4. GSM phone so works on most anywhere except with the moron companies in United States like Sprint/Verizon.5. The clicking seems to work and the battery life even with this big of screen last one day.6. The phone is cheap and has a newer android.7. The phone is compatible with google marketplace and can load plenty of apps on it.8. Wifi works well9. Blu Tooth works as well.10. Typing is pretty good just as easy as other smartphones.11. 90% of the time no problems with anything but if you use phone as your lively hood this is not good enough.Cons:1. The phone doesn't pick up your voice unless your mouth is really close often causes hangup since android hangup is there.2. The phone's speaker is very low volume for the ear piece during a phone call, I always have it at max and still very difficult to hear.3. The phone has no way to update or root it unless you can read Chinese which is the native country. They say you can on internet nothing listed or sent to me works.4. The phone has a big problem which I don't know if this is Android fault or Phone.  When you receive a call the screen goes black.  Why?  I want to do something so I move my face away it doesn't get bright all the time it stays dark I don't have any screen, If I hit the screen it doesn't respond.  Yet other times it stays lit and I hangup on people cause mouth is next to hangup. Stupid design the hangup should be a slider to hangup your moron google.  Also it's front camera perhaps is the problem detecting light or dark since it is so poor.5. The phone is unlocked but not rooted so you can't get rid of 2 Chinese crap programs only disable them also you can't install programs I consider important like firewall/some full backup tools/anti-virus.Universal Grips:(Networks or Phones)The phone has TV ability yet this is pointless in the United States we don't use analogy anymore so radio would be better.The phone plug in for power often falls this is a common theme for mini-usb it's alot of phones.The phone sometimes must be restarted or network restarted sometimes to get internet reestablished especially if you have not done that in over 2 days.The phone also sounds like robot scrambles sometimes when answering.  I hangup and redial it works fine. That's been happening 1/10 phone calls.  Maybe NSA who knows.Cons for Android:1. The phone often hangs up since android is so dumb to put a hang up next to your cheek.  If you push your facenext to the phone to hear or speak into the mic it hangs up yet you must to hear.2. You need to design a slider for hangup also don't go dark when on phone call.3. When you put a lock on Android the phone starts up in the morning starts ticking why?  Why? WHY!!!I want to know why android makes a ticking sound after it boots and drains all my battery as it doesn't turn screenoff this is when you have your phone encrypted if you don't have it encrypted the phone just starts up in the morningand screen goes black yet it ticks like a stop watch on boot if encrypted.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It dosent work and the Company wont send me a correct return mailing adress they keep sending me a China adress", "Author": "Philip Lovato", "ReviewID": "R24L6PSJY4RHDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPS from two locations have told me that it will cost 150.to send back this phone that dose not work, this phone is not worth 150, my location is Denver CO.

Needless to say I got no response. Fine. I have a second battery. Well 3 weeks later, the second one has stopped charging completely. I plugged it in to my charger last night and woke up with 13% battery.
