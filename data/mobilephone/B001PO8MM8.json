It's been 4 months in my possession now and has seen some tough times, including putting me through the most embarrassing situation of my life. I work as an IT Manager and required a cell phone that would take a licking and keep on ticking. I brought the Tundra with a clip-on holder for the phone and my thinking at the time was quick access instead of a leather case that would wear down in no time.The Tundra has fallen many times in the short 4 months and in one case while passing between two people, one was holding her door open with her elbow sticking out. The Antenna on the Tundra somehow managed to hook on her elbow and fall out of the holder. I should have simply let the phone fall to the ground instead of trying to prevent it from falling, to the ground. I honestly don't know how I managed to grab a hold of this woman's ass three, or four times in the process of trying to catch my phone mid-air. Clearly, I was red with embarrassment and I could see she felt sorry for me and now I don't have to be on that show, \"I Shouldn't Be Alive!\"The Tundra's software, though basic is very well thought out and easily allows you to select the desired functions without needing to guess at the next step.The Tundra is hard pressed to loose signal and I have never missed a call. In Network Settings, the Tundra allows you to turn on Service Tone which alerts you when the phone has either lost signal and regained signal.The Tundra also allows you to set up to three different Alarms with very flexible parameters, including days of the week, weekends, etc.The Tundra's contact address book is not at all disappointing and gives you the ability to enter a wealth of information on your contacts while integrating itself very well with both incoming, outgoing and missed calls.Now, while my colleagues point, laugh, and joke about how I have to find a corner to answer my phone, I'm comfortable with the idea that the Tundra accepts and knows it's primary function is to be a Cell Phone and a tough one at that. I'm down with that.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Bcentsale \"bcentsale\"", "ReviewID": "R1IO3V9FTJXHBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my Tundra for almost 3 years, and plan on keeping it as long as possible.  No, it's not razor-thin, but with regular use I've gone as long as a week between chargings, while my work-issued Samsung Galaxy barely lasts a day with every configurable feature turned off.  Additionally, with the external antenna I still get 2-3 bars in a datacenter filled with servers and other interference, in a geographic area where I hear constant complaints regarding reception OUTSIDE the building.The call / reception quality is amazing, as is the speakerphone function.  I have a pop-out cup holder in my dashboard (German's are not big on their venti grande lattes while driving) which serves as a dock for the phone if I need to talk while driving.  On AT&T;'s network it has a push-to-talk feature, but I have so many unused minutes I think it's stupid to pay extra for that.I purchased the phone when I was a logistics manager in a warehouse, and it has been been dropped on every surface imaginable, without a scratch.  The buttons are large enough that someone with big hands (like myself) or someone wearing gloves can still make a call or even send a text message.  My two children (as of this review, ages 1 and 3) have gotten hold of the phone numerous times, and even used it to teeth, and it still looks / works like it's brand new.Yes, it only has a 2mp camera, but I own more photographic equipment than I can keep track of, and pocket-sized digital 'daily-shooters' start at a such low price for still-decent quality that there should be no reason to take pictures with a phone.  Ever.  I can't make a phone call with your Olympus E-3, and you shouldn't take a picture with your phone.  I hope when this phone goes that AT&T; still offers something like it.  This is my 3rd Moto clamshell phone (what can I say, I'm a purist!)", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my husband who breaks everything!", "Author": "Michelle R.

I have had it four years. This is my first experience with Motorola. I have dropped it on the concrete garage floor from 3' up; it still works. I have dropped it in the toilet; it still works. I have accidently stepped fully on it (200#); it still works. I have ran over it in the garage; it still works. It is surrounded with rubber so that, when it falls, no matter which angle it lands on it rolls over, the phone isn't even scratched, and it still works. I bike a lot and keep my phone in my pocket. As I pedal, the motion works the phone out of my pocket. It has landed in the middle of the road, bounced and rolled over but, you guessed it, it still works with no physical or internal damage. It is awesome!!!!!!", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone for the money", "Author": "Rian L. Peters \"technician\"", "ReviewID": "R2SDG172W3MBP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As this is one of my fourth cell phones in the last 15 years, it has lasted the longest.  My only complaint is the static on the line during 1/4 of the incomming calls.  I think this is more to do with the local cell tower, because there are no static problems in other areas.  I am so pleased with my Tundra VA76r, I am ordering another today.  I can not find a compariable phone on the AT&T; web sight so I am purchasing a new phone with no new contract on amazon.com.  AT&T; only offers two rugged phones and one is out of stock.  I have a rugged snap on case, and have dropped this phone many of times.  It is bluetooth ready, so I would like to try an ear piece.  I am on my third battery, so I will try an order a spare, as this phone seems to becomming obsolete.  I do not like the need for a data plan so this is also a good reason to pay full price for this phone.  My original VA76r cost $100.+ so paying $200.+ for a phone is simple math.  At $30.00 a month for a data plan it only take a few month to pay for this phone.  Hope Motorola or Samsung reads this as there needs to be some more options when it comes to those of us whom need a rugged phone and no data plan.

Unfortunately, Motorola stopped manufacturing the phone and AT&T; stopped selling it. I'm so happy with the phone that I decided to purchase a brand NEW backup Tundra to keep as a spare for when my current phone finally stops working. The way it's still working, I'm expecting to get several more years of usage. But now I'll have my NEW backup phone available when nedded. I really don't understand why Motorola decided to stop manufacturing it. There is no current replacement on the market built to military specifications that withstands drops, accidents, and is waterproof. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a rugged phone built for long term usage. Be aware that the phones offered on this website are way overpriced and some are NOT new. I bought my brand NEW phone in original AT&T; packaging on another website whose ititials are \"eb\" for only $169. I checked \"eb\" today, and the same seller is now selling the same NEW phone for $219.
