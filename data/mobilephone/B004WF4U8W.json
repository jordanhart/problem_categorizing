I have been using Amazon for years and this was my first awful experience. Do not buy anything from Just Cellular, their products are not as advertised. I purchased what was suppose to be a NEW Samsung Rouge (as listed in their description), yet when I got it in the mail it was quite clearly a refurbished phone, there were finger prints all over the phone including fingerprints inside the battery compartment, also it did not come with its original box or owner's manual. I contacted the company and they basically told me that it was a new phone and they get it from their distributor and they have to trust what the distributor says. I asked them if it was possible that the wrong phone could have been shipped, and if they could check their inventory and see if a NEW Samsung Rouge was available, and we can switch it out. She became very argumentative and said she had no way of checking that. When asked if I could speak with someone that might be able to, she stated and I quote \"The only one you are allowed to talk to is me. If you don't want the phone send it back.\" I asked how long it would be to receive a refund, and once again she became very insulting and stated \"We refund you when we get the phone back\", I said I understand that but once you get the phone how long does it process a refund, and very rudely she mentioned \"when we finish processing the refund, it could take up to three weeks.\" Quick to take your money, but not so quick to give it back when they don't meet you expeditions. Terrible customer service! They should not be trusted and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon, you have been warned.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Rouge Smartphone Trickster", "Author": "katie<3", "ReviewID": "R3LBTPOCPKHYUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the advancement of technology, people continue to look to the most popular phones that are capable of doing functions that are completely mind blowing.  Who would have ever imagined technology would allow us to unfold a minicomputer from out of our back jean pocket?  However, even with the tasks of normality our phone offers to us, doesn't it ever feel to be to much? Don't you wish you didn't have to read the user manual to determine how to turn the phone on? Don't you wish you could opt into a cheaper monthly phone plan?  There are several basic feature phones to a Smartphone. Verizon's Samsung Rouge is a great user friendly phone and a great alternative to a smart phone.The Samsung Rouge is a touch screen slider with a slide out QWERTY keyboard connecting to a 3G network.  The Rouge's 3 mega pixel camera makes it fun to capture memories and with the memory expansion can store up to 16 GB of memory.  The Samsung Rouge is also just a touch to all of your favorite social engineered sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.  Though the phone is unable to access applications downloadable to the phone, it is able to access to features such as GPS Navigator, Rhapsody, Music streaming, Bluetooth capability, and many other useful tools to help simplify one's life.There are several pros to owning a Samsung Rouge.  The light touch screen with instant access to email, social sites, and music gives this phone a taste of having a Smartphone.  The QWERTY keyboard offers texting advances from earlier flip phone styles.  The phone is not only very easy to learn and use but is also very durable from the software and the hardware used to construct the phone.  The Samsung Rouge does not require a data plan in order to operate so it can essentially save families money on their Verizon bills.  The phone also operates on a sensor technology which allows it's users to maneuver an alarm clock snooze, control games, and slide through photo albums with a tilt of the screen.The downfalls of the Samsung Rouge is the phone is not operating on  4G network, so when accessing the web airtime will take a bit more to load thoroughly in comparison to a new Smartphone.  The phone accessories seem to break very soon after purchase.  The camera does have a delayed reaction so often cherished moments are lagging a few steps behind from the captured moment.  This phone model does not allow downloads of applications.The Samsung Rouge is a great multimedia phone.  It offers functionality of basic Smartphone without getting into the complexity of all the gadgets.  Voice control helps the phone keep drivers hands free in a call and the GPS Navigation can help to allow us to always find our way home.  The Samsung Rouge is a great user friendly phone allowing customers to save in their current monthly billings and still having a touch of a technically advanced features phone.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, solid phone", "Author": "muckydee", "ReviewID": "RW4P85WJCRMJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 2 years and it has always been solid for me.

Much of the interface, and almost all of the feature extras included with the phone depend on this touch screen, and getting that to function properly has been maddening.  The screen will either sense no touch, or completely misinterpret the input and register too many touches in all the wrong directions.  Tried the built-in calibration tool several times, never with any benefit.Dropped the phone onto the pavement once while getting into the car, a trivial plop to the ground.  Result - a surprising number of gouges and scrapes.  Both my other smart phones suffered ten times worse (at the hands of my two-year-old) with barely any scratches.  Gorilla glass this is NOT.Side button to lock the phone also UNLOCKS it if pressed two times, so pocket dialing is easy and frequent.

It was fantastic! The touch screen, the slide-out keyboard, the camera was even superb. However, after a year or a year and a half my touch screen became defective. I would try and push something on the screen and it would push another button, and because it was touch screen and the way the keyboard was set up, there was no way to reset the calibration or perform any functions on the phone (text, call, answer, take pictures, use calendar, set alarm clock, etc.). I was so bummed because it really was a great phone! I did drop it a few times so I'm sure that didn't help, but how many of us let our phone slip through our fingers on accident once in a while?

I had a chance to try out the Rogue for about three weeks and like it nearly as much as the env3.ProsThe screen is clear and bright. The slide out keyboard has a good response. I like it a lot more than the one on the Droid I used to have, but not as much as my env3. The \"back\" button at the bottom of the phone is super handy. I really liked the scroll feature in Contacts. As you drag down, a large letter appears indicating where you are in your contact list. This feature works better than the one on my Droid. Contacts are easy to edit and the list makes it easy to text or call. The colors used in the messages display made them easy to read through. The sound quality of the phone and hands free are acceptable. The controls on the sides of the phone were usable. I like the way you can pin certain often-used features to the screen and the side tab where you can select other often-used features to dock there for quick access. Permanent buttons for dialer, contacts, messages, menu are conveniently located at the bottom of the screen.ConsWith a plastic cover the phone's a little on the bulky side, but about what you'd expect for the price. The touch screen failed to respond to my desired selection about 15% of the time. I expect this would improve as I got used to it more. The screen would occasionally unlock itself, but it never pocket dialed.OtherThe camera was acceptable for the price of this phone, but the buttons and settings were not exactly intuitive and would take some getting used to. Pictures look great on the screen and there are several ways to display them. The notes feature is acceptable, but the length limit is short, and I didn't find a way to organize the notes in the order I wanted and they can't be stored on a micro SD card. I didn't try the music feature or the voice commands feature (for which there are buttons on the side of the phone).", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the wife", "Author": "A.

I often found myself inadvertently making calls or accessing the internet while the phone was in my pocket. The Rogue uses a proprietary OS...no Android or Windows on this one, so its functionality is limited to the few programs it comes with out of the box.

We searched high and low for the smartest dumb-phone we could find.  He really liked this one so we picked it up.  So far after about a month of use he's pretty happy with it.  One of the things he really wanted was a great MP3 player.  Unfortunately this isn't as good as my Kin for playing MP3s but it's serviceable.  Unlike my Kin there are actually a few games on this phone so he likes that about it.  I was surprised to see how many smartphone features had been incorporated into this phone.  The ability to add shortcuts to the home screen is very smartphoneish and makes the phone easier to use.  He wishes he could add the music player as a shortcut to the desktop or add specific albums to the desktop but the phone doesn't support it.He has had the phone lock up multiple times.  It appears to happen a couple times a week at least.  He often turns the phone off rather than just silencing it when he's in a place he shouldn't receive a call so the phone gets rebooted regularly.  It's a bit surprising to me that it still crashes so often.You might wonder why I give it 4 stars despite these failings.  It's really because it's one of the best dumbphones I've seen.  Granted, compared to a Windows Phone, Android or iPhone this one doesn't even rate 2 stars but if you're trying to avoid the phone company's exorbitant monthly fees for the privilege of using a smartphone on their network then this is a good middle-ground. I like my Kin better than the Rogue (I'd give it 5 stars in the non-smartphone category) but my Windows Phone is FAR better than the Kin.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung rogue", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Brian Richard Johnson\"", "ReviewID": "R2GP9JOB91S8W8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this phone as a gift and she seems to really like it except for the battery life which stinks", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ehhh..", "Author": "Blake Bashaw", "ReviewID": "R2VJOH2GQUETT1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Mine freezes alot and the screen cracked within the first 2 weeks and it wasnt even my falt it fell 6 inches and cracked the whole screen.
