{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing for the price", "Author": "sergey", "ReviewID": "R10LHHBDOZH1S8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in between smartphones (Google Nexus 4 is on backorder for weeks and I need something to tide me over until I get it). I got this in the mail a few days ago, and I LOVE it!!! The user interface is pretty intuitive and incredibly responsive. After smartphone touchscreens, it is so refreshing to press real buttons and to have INSTANTANEOUS response from the UI, be it launching the address book or locking the keys or similar. Yes the manual is pretty useless but you don't need it. Also, some a lot of the more \"advanced\" functions (e.g. taking pictures or playing music) require an sd card to be installed. But why would you need those functions anyway, in this kind of phone.The many COOL things about this VERY COOL phone are:1) Yellow and black color - VERY COOL, you'll spot it across the room, plus you might get STUNG BY BEES!!2) Battery lasts FOREVER (well at least compared to a smartphone)3) Unlocked GSM phone - if you have a GSM provider (eg T-mobile) you just pop in the sim card from your old phone and it works.4) It takes TWO sim cards, presumably for international travel. It looks like it can log into two networks at the same time, using two different sim cards (you can see the network status of each sim card on the home screen). Amazing, huh? Of course I don't need it, I'll probably never again be able to afford international travel. But it's there so I can brag about it!5) IT HAS AN EXTENSIBLE ANTENNA. Yes. A very long chrome antenna that you pull out -- it rotates and tilts! Pull it out at a bar! Men AND women will throw themselves at you. Of course the main purpose of the antenna is FM radio. Did I mention you can listen to FM radio on this thing? Could be useful in natural disasters! Or when the Chinese bring down the interweb. Also, an FYI, this little guy can even RECORD live radio, if you install an SD card.6) It looks VERY hip. Small and light and feels ANALOG (very \"in\" now, as you know. though of course it's digital).7) It does not do email or picture messaging. Could be a good thing. Again, very hip.8) It charges with a standard micro-USB connector.9) I had it in my hands overnight for about thirty five bucks. What a thrill, ladies and gentlemen. For the price you wouldn't expect it to do much, but at least half of this stuff ACTUALLY WORKS!!Get it. It could be your backup phone if you're on a GSM network. Or, if you are truly hip, please use it as your main phone. I would have A LOT of respect for you.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone", "Author": "Donna Dee", "ReviewID": "R1G5IJQWPMKBKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this to use internationally in the Caribbean. It worked great. I loved the fact that it was able to hold 2 SIM cards for 2 different carriers. This is important in some of the islands because there are competing carriers, and if you place a call to someone who is on another network, then the money placed on your phone will be used up very quickly. With the 2 SIM cards you have the ability to call on the same network that the person you are calling is on. I did not use or need the camera or blue tooth features.Again, this is a basic phone to save money when traveling, or can be just a great 2nd phone for emergencies.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLU T172T Jenny Unlocked Quad-Band Dual SIM Phone", "Author": "TimothyLeeAR", "ReviewID": "R391UMKBFUA358", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this phone and am happy with it as its is good value for just $30. My only complaint would be the case has to be pried open versus sliding open.Once I discovered the step-by-step interactive guide to the phone, operation was simplified. The analog TV receiver is useless in North America, but the FM radio works great. Look forward to this for weather updates while out in the woods.http://amazon.simplyinteractiveguides.com/?lc=en&pa;=B009VV5DBKUnder sunlight and light shade, the still and movie cameras take adequate images. Microphone picks up well also. Video is saved as a Motion JPEG versus MP4.

It worked without a hitch with sim card - could use either one of the competitors.  Everyone loved the cool color (not easy to get lost in bag full of stuff).  The clincher was the tv which during a 3 hour wait in the local bank kept me sane as I enjoyed a rerun of Iron Chef America!Great radio reception as well would be a help to get news in an emergency", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good cell phone", "Author": "gustavo padron", "ReviewID": "RVSVHQ0LE1H63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is what I was looking for.

This phone is the real future of cell phones for the majority of us who do not conduct ALL of our business on our cell phones - but this one does contain a great camera, and even a TV and radio function.
