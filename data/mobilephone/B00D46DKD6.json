However, she is a heavy texter, and had gotten used to a physical keypad.  So I was interested in getting her a good smartphone, but with a slide-out keypad.  After much research, the Samsung T699 turned out to be the answer.  It runs a recent version of Android; the screen is a beautiful 4\" display, and the keypad seems to be good for text entry (though she could comment more on that).It also has more internal storage than many of the other comparable phones I was looking at; and it has a microSD slot for additional storage -- something that not all of the phones I checked had.  We've already put many games and additional apps on the phone; it operates well in texting mode; and -- a big factor for us -- it is a WiFi Calling phone, meaning that any time she is in a WiFi hotspot (including at home), the phone will use the WiFI connection rather than the mobile data connection -- thus saving data costs, and improving download speeds.The only thing that would be nicer would be a slightly larger screen.

Arena \"Captain Seabag\"", "ReviewID": "RXQXLZCLYF1MM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, I upgraded from the HTC G2 Android phone. I purchased both phones because I really like using an Android phone with a real keyboard. That being said, there is no other benefit to this phone.I assumed this one would be less buggy, slow, and crash-prone than the old phone, since it's newer and from a more prominent company. WRONG. The thing is slow as MOLASSES (even after disabling the massively wasteful Lookout scam software) due to all its \"3D\" animations.This is basically the Gateway of smartphones - loaded with bloatware and so-so build quality.Next up is Google Voice. I know that's a Google app, but it crashes MORE OFTEN THAN NOT when loading.Then you have the calendar. The calendar on my G2 was simple and ACTUALLY FUNCTIONED. This one disobeys you most of the time and is difficult to use (note: I'm not some curmudgeonly old guy who is new to technology; I'm a computer technician). It keeps suggesting things at random and just overall an OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE when all I wanted was a phone with a keyboard that let me put in my business appointments.How about *gasp* a phonecall? Once a month, it'll crash while trying to answer a phonecall, requiring a reboot.Heaven forbid you want to download your pictures off the phone! Then you have the Samsung Kies malware. Instead of showing up on your computer like a thumbdrive like every other phone in the universe, this one requires (and automatically injects) Kies malware into your computer. Can't leave well enough alone, Samsung. (For Mint PC users, this implies using the gMTP software that works every other time.)Battery life is a little over a day (heaven forbid you enable DATA services, though, and you're down to a few hours, after which you're greeted with a constant popup attack reminding you to plug in your phone in case you're too stupid to know what the battery meter is for).I was inspired to write this review this morning when I found my phone dead on my desk. Once a week now, it doesn't FEEL like charging while plugged in.I'm going to throw it away now and buy a rotary phone instead. At least those don't crash while answering.

Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R1N9TI9KA7AUHE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S Relay from Top10Cell, and got exactly what was described.  This is my first GSM phone, and my first unlocked phone (in other words, I had no idea what I was doing).  I've been on contracts with CDMA carriers from the beginning (mid-90s) but decided to break away and try a no-contract service.  However, I'm very particular with what I want in a phone, and the locally available phones didn't fit the bill.At the time I bought this, I was test-driving an AT&T; GoPhone with SIM card (the Nokia Lumina 920).  I decided the Windows OS wasn't for me (I tried to like it but there are certain apps I use a lot that Windows just doesn't have).  Anyway, I got this phone (the Samsung) and tried to use my GoPhone card in it - it wouldn't work.  This GoPhone card is a micro or nano SIM.  This phone takes a standard SIM.  I still tried to make it work and it wouldn't.  I called Top10Cell:  they were very helpful, assured me the phone was unlocked, suggested it might be my SIM card that was the problem, and said to call them back if another SIM didn't work.  They were more than willing to help me fix the issue.  By the way, I don't have T-Mobile in my area, which is why I didn't use the included card.  If I used the T-Mobile card, I would still be using the AT&T; network here, and T-Mobile would consider me roaming the entire time.  T-Mobile will drop you if you roam for a straight year (that's what T-Mobile told me).  I keep the T-Mobile card in my wallet, just in case.I went to RadioShack (where I bought the Nokia GoPhone) and they were most unhelpful in fixing the issue (it's an unlocked phone, they won't even look at it even though it was their GoPhone card), so I decided to just buy a standard AT&T; SIM and be done with it - except RadioShack only had a 3G card.  This phone is 4G, and that's what I wanted.  So I went to the AT&T; store and bought a 4G card.  Understand:  I did not have a preexisting contract with AT&T;, and the only SIM card I had from them was a GoPhone card, so it seems my only option was to buy a new card rather than trade one in.  AT&T; was more helpful.  The salesman explained that the reason the GoPhone card wouldn't work is because it's tied to a specific phone - that card won't work in any other phone.  Their standard SIM cards can be used in any phone - the GoPhone cards that come with a phone can only be used in that phone.  His suggestion was buy a standard SIM then contact the AT&T; GoPhone people to have my minutes transferred over (apparently, the AT&T; stores can't do GoPhone transfers to standard cards).Anyway, I bought the AT&T; 4G card, went home, put it in the phone, and fired it up.  I didn't have the AT&T; store activate the card for me - I wanted to do that myself at home with the phone, in case I need to call Top10Cell again.  I went to the AT&T; activation site online - it took a long time to process.  They said \"a few minutes\".  It was more like 20 minutes or so.  I just left the computer to do its thing and kept checking back.  Eventually, it went through.  I added minutes (decided it wasn't worth the hassle to transfer the GoPhone minutes), and was up and running.  I did not need to contact Top10Cell again.Now, as for the phone itself:  T-Mobile has crap loaded on it that I need to get rid of, so I'll probably need to root it at some point to get rid of the bloatware.  Also, the phone wants to use \"GSM/WCDMA\" as its default Network mode.  That is a major battery drainer for me - I changed the network mode to GSM only.  It automatically boots up to GSM/WCDMA so I have to manually change it back to 'GSM only' every time I start/restart the device.  Otherwise, the battery is drained in about 6 hours.  With 'GSM only,' I can get about 2 days battery time (not a heavy user).- The keyboard is nice but the space bar takes a bit of effort - you have to hit it closer to center, not off to one side.  The keys are spaced far enough apart that you can hit a single key with the pad of your finger rather than using the end of a fingernail.  It also has the Swype on-screen keyboard, which is nice for a quick note.- The screen is nice and clear.  I don't use the phone for movies so I can't comment on that, but photos/pictures look nice and clean.- I've dropped it once already from waist-height onto asphalt, and it got dinged on the outside top edge of the case.  No glass cracked or popped off, no bits and pieces went flying, just a ding in the outer casing.  I picked it up, hit the power button to check it, and it was fine.- One annoying thing I've noticed is this phone causes static sounds to emit from computer speakers, but that's not the phone's fault - it's the GSM.  CDMA apparently doesn't do that because I can lay my CDMA phone in front of computer speakers all day long with no interference.  Everyone at work that has GSM phones have the same issue, while the CDMA guys don't.- Another annoying thing I've noticed is when I have the keyboard out for typing, then slide it back in, the volume will either go up or down, or vibrate will turn on.  The first time it happened, I thought I'd hit a button.  After that, I made sure my fingers weren't near the buttons, and it still happened.  I don't know if that's a 'normal' Samsung hardware issue, an OS issue, or if I just have a wonky phone.- One last annoying thing:  when the keyboard is out for texting and once I send my text message, the menu pops up on the screen.  Again, I thought I was touching the menu button area, so I made sure to avoid that area, and it still happens.  I have a screen protector on and there's a slight bubble in the menu button area, so that might be it.  Again, not sure where to place the blame.I've only had the phone for one month but so far, it's good aside from the annoyances.  I'll report back if issues come up later.UPDATE:  I have now had the phone for almost 3 months and I'll be leaving it, returning to my trusty Motorola Droid 3.  Basically, the battery drain is ridiculous.  I change the network setting to GSM only and that helps, but then other processes will kick in and drain the battery.  There are about 6-8 items that will run at any one given time, each of which drain the battery, and they all have something to do with \"Phone.\"  Even when I  haven't used the phone, these processes will start and drain the battery.  Any number of things can cause these processes to start up.  I've tried to track each one and figure out how to prevent them from draining the battery, but it's so annoying.  Every time I reboot the phone, I have to go through a checklist of things to fix just to help preserve the battery.  A full charge will last me 12-15 hours if I'm lucky, and that's with no talking and minimal texting.  My Droid3 will last 2-3 days on a full charge.  This could be an Android Jelly Bean OS issue vs. a Samsung hardware issue.The menu popping up after sending a text message still happens, even after removing the screen protector.  No idea what's going on with that.Basically, the battery drain is the biggest issue.  I can't depend on this phone to be available when I need it; if I forget to charge it every night, it will be dead the next morning.  My Droid3 may be old but it's dependable.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought for son with special needs", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RP1OSKG3I024T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is hard to find an Android phone with a slide keyboard.

Of course he also loves to play games and the rest of the family is on Android devices so going Android was the best choice for us. This has been a solid phone and comes with Jelly Bean, I wish Samsung did a better job updating the OS as it would be nice to move on to KitKat which I have on some of my other devices.We do have to reboot the phone every couple of days. He is a heavy game player which makes this sort of expected but I think a more recent Android version would help too thus knocking it down one star. It does reboot pretty quickly.Some games crash when you open the keyboard while playing them. As an Android developer I know the cause and a simple addition of a setting to the manifest file can solve that. I have written to some of the larger game companies asking them to fix their games.

I wasn't really happy, because the laggy behavior and bad battery life (I'd easily assume both are also android features).Yet, i didn't lose hope and always convinced myself that there should be a proper, snappy, solid qwerty android phone out there!after researching, finally found that guy (S Relay 4G) with very good/excellent reviews and thought my dreams finally came true.Bought it a couple of weeks ago, and i'm really happy with it, and let me share some points with you:- Lots of bloat ware (easily disabled and removed by Rooting), you'll significantly get better battery and overall performance once you remove them.- Camera is very good with excellent flash.- Amazing battery life when compared to other android phone, I usually put it to offline mode when I go to sleep. So, with the phone going off network 7 hours a day, i got around 60 hours on a single charge. I dont watch movies or play games, but heavy texting/emails and moderate/low phone calls.- Couple of things which bothered me, when i slide out the keyboard to text... i don't get spell check and on screen suggestions, after researching i found that can be easily solved by installing \"Smart keyboard\" from the market and it solved the issue (free) you can get the pro one if you get annoyed by upgrading reminder which pops up once or twice a day! not a big deal for me, still using the free version but actually planning to buy it.- the other annoying thing, is the home button always takes a sec or two to respond, don't get me wrong... it always always gets you home and never hanged or something but with a consistent delay (not a single time it took me to home screen immediately nor it took more than 1.5 sec) a consistent delay which seems like fore some reason samsung has put it on purpose!- Phone calls are absolutely great, so is the network signal.- forget about the benchmarks and such things, i never done them and i don't care...as long the phone responds quickly without lags i don't really care about the benchmarks...so can't help on that.- So far haven't had any problems with wifi or bluetooth.- VIBRATION ALERT IS AWESOME! what an important feature which almost all android phones have an extremely weak vibrations which can hardly feel unless its in your hands and sometime you just hear the tiny motor inside struggling to vibrate but can't feel vibration though!  I can feel the S Relay 4G's vibration in my pocket while walking which reminded me of the old Motorola V i had back in times.well, thats for now, will keep you updated if anything new crossed my mind.Bottom Line, This phone is for a practical (not fancy) person...if you are behind looks and benchmarks then search elsewhere, if you need a good qwerty android, then that's for you!", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Barbara Geringswald", "ReviewID": "R1WXUZ5A3R0SWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this phone.

This does not seem like its going to happen either in the US or in Europe where I'm based. I would probably have got a Motorola Photon 4G for its excellent keyboard but its a major risk to try and remove to build in sim card and solder on a sim card reader to access a sim for a european network.

The keyboard is very good for fast typing and the dedicated number row and multiple secondary functions on each key using the function key is a great feature. Outside of being slightly heavier that the Sansung S3, this phone can match the S3 in almost all departments - the screen resolution is slightly less than the S3 but really is not obvious.

Before I bought this phone, I had a Nexus 5 and I had to return it because I couldn't get a good signal in my house with that phone.  The Nexus was definitely a higher end phone, but I have to say that I'm as satisfied with this phone as I was with the Nexus.  Even though the Nexus's specs blow this out of the water, this phone is much heavier and thicker which gives it the feel of having a better build quality.  So far I've been pretty satisfied with Samsung smartphones and I have a feeling that my next phone is probably going to be a Galaxy S4.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellet", "Author": "Hassan", "ReviewID": "R3RX93LEDQ7FVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great smartphone.

The keyboard is fine, however, and I didn't need to use the 'alt' key to type numbers like on my old phone.When I received the phone I just inserted my SIM card and was off and running.I know there are better phones out there, but we wanted the slide-out keyboard.

Lockwood", "ReviewID": "R2LCUL9T22F9GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was an upgrade from a MyTouchQ - doesn't take much to upgrade from that  :-)  I wanted a newer phone, but still wanted the convenience of a slide out keyboard - I just find it easier to type when I can \"feel\" the keys. The keys on this keyboard aren't as easy to use as the ones on the MyTouchQ, but I'm getting used to it. I do tend to accidentally hit the volume button while typing sometimes, and that's aggravating, but I'm becoming better at avoiding it. I've had the phone for 2 and half weeks now.After having this phone for 10 days, I dropped it in the toilet. (If you are like me, and wondered how on earth people manage to do this -- it was in the front pocket of my sweatshirt and when I bent over to lift the lid, it slipped out of my pocket and into the toilet). Anyway, I feared that my brand new phone was ruined, but it was FINE! Of course I grabbed it out immediately and dried it off. Although it appeared to be functioning normally, I still turned it off, took the battery, SD card, and SIM card out and let it dry for about 10 minutes just to be sure. Afterwards, still working great!  The fact that it survived the toilet diving incident overrides the volume button while typing issue! Also, the battery on this thing is AMAZING. After a day of only sporadic use on the MyTouch, I had less than half the battery left. With this one, I still have at least 85%. And while I thought most of the issues I had with web content loading on the MyTouch were due to the slow 2G connection where I live, everything loads MUCH faster with this phone!So far, my only complaints are the volume button that I keep accidentally hitting while typing, the keyboard keys aren't as raised as I would like, and I don't like that the power button isn't very prominent - I have a hard time pressing it sometimes. But the pros far outweigh the cons, at least for me!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone with a great screan and solid performance", "Author": "Tristan B.", "ReviewID": "RZGML8I2EX3DR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really liked this phone.
