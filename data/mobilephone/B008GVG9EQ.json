It is a pretty light purple color. It comes with a notification charm which flashes when you get a call or text. It also comes with headphones and a charging dock that doubles as a speaker. It fits my hands perfectly. Has average battery life. You can make your own ringtones without downloading any apps. The only drawback is that it doesn't have FM radio but with an 8 GB SD card you can save plenty of music on it.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "One Year Later...", "Author": "PenPalMeHere", "ReviewID": "R2KQHBC3KOQ4YW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone when I started my contract with Verizon a little over a year ago. It's always had a protective case and a screen protector on it as I am a little OCD about my electronics. I've never dropped it on concrete, tile, in water or any other hard or damaging surfaces to cause it any harm - it's still in \"like new\" condition as far as looks. It was used moderately for phone calls, text and web browsing - never came close to reaching my minutes each month, sent 1,500 ish texts a month, and only used my browser when a computer wasn't readily available.Yet after 12+ months of use and the phone has stopped functioning correctly. It started resetting it's self randomly once or twice a day for about a week, but now it resets it's self more than it stays on and at this point it is unusable.While the phones features are good, I wouldn't suggest this phone to anyone. I've recently googled my resetting issue and have found many other similar complaints. I was happy to get a free phone when signing up, but in the end it will cost me the price of a new phone in order to replace it.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely terrible", "Author": "apropos1", "ReviewID": "R23R0S2OFJTJMT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone initially had great reviews- however, having owned this phone for over a year, I can say it is the worst phone I have ever owned in my history of owning cell phones (which includes the old-timey flip phones). The reception is worse than terrible. What has frequently happened is that while calling, indoors or outdoors, if i accidentally cover any of the tiny holes on the back of the phone, the person on the end can no longer comprehend what i'm saying. When I change my finger placement it then improves.  The speakers on the phone, no matter who i am talking to, are also horrendous. Even if the reception is fair, the speakers render your voice incomprehensible.The battery life has become extremely poor. Without doing anything but sitting on the counter, it will run down to half life and require recharging.The docking station has failed on and off as a speaker.  I am not aware of its current functionality as a speaker - i refuse, after already having had to replace the phone within the first 6-8 months, to waste more time on it.  The docking station recently failed altogether even as a phone charger. I switched to charging by plugging in manually, and ended up cutting off the plug that covers the phone's charging port b/c you really have to have a pry tool or long, strong fingernail to get that open. The plug is designed to snap shut automatically, so cutting it off was the best and only solution to dealing with it.The battery is not removable, so if you ever get stuck and have to do a reboot, you have to memorize a the key sequence that will restart it, you cannot simply pull the battery.Everybody i call regularly hates this phone and is incessantly bugging me to change it due to its lack of reliability - ie, horrible reception, anytime I need to make a call.  If I were stuck in an emergency somewhere, this is definitely not the phone I would want to have with me.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad experience with this cell phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1VO2MJ9J600MY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only been using the phone for about fourth months.

I don't use it too often. Voice breaks up a lot since in the beginning. It started to faulter for the worse as people on the other end couldn't hear me talk.  I change my hand positions so as not to block the microphone to no avail.  It was never dropped or bumped.  A lot of good this phone is to me if I cant have a conversation.  My daughter also has this same phone.  She needed a new battery, and it is IMPOSSIBLE!! to change out the battery, since it is built into the phone and not removable.  I fond the texting keyboard to be off evn though I calibrated it many times. Still under contract - going to have to look for a cheap replacement phone until I can re-new my contract.

It's not awesome, but it's fine for texting, calling, camera, and navigation, which is pretty much all I use it for. There's a strip at the top of the phone I got where the touch screen won't work, but it's not that big of a deal for me to send it back. It's a little slow, and the battery life is on the short end of average (but I may be biased since my last phone was a Droid Razr Maxx and the battery would last for a week).
