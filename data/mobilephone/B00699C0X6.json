{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Connection problems and lots of bugs", "Author": "K. F.", "ReviewID": "R1HSRQC0VM4KSH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned a Thrill for a year now, and it's pure junk. There is a widely known \"ghost calling\" issue, where the phone disconnects from the cell network when in standby (i.e. the screen is off) mode for long (over a couple hours) periods. When this happens, you won't get calls or texts, but those calling you will hear a ringtone. If they don't leave a message, you'll never know they called. This also causes the phone's clock to become unsynchronized, displaying the wrong time (and potentially making you late if you use the alarm). These issues were ADDED by the 2.3 patch released by LG, but LG has never bothered to fix them. Again, these are well known issues; look at LG's forum, and notice the Thrill is the most popular topic, and look at the most popular threads...There are also issues with the touchscreen - if I play an intensive 3D game (including the bundled NOVA 2) the touch screen eventually stops responding to multitouch.The phone will randomly overheat and run the whole battery in a few minutes. It will also randomly shut off and not turn back on until the battery is removed and reinserted.The screen is nice, and the 3D feature is very cool, but the cameras are too close together so the 3D depth from photos/videos you record isn't that good. Also, the video camera skips every few seconds when recording, making it useless for most purposes.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEAL!", "Author": "AndresB", "ReviewID": "RWTYJ9WQJ8H9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unlocked LG THRILL 4G - Excellent service by the seller.

Unfortunately, neither LG nor AT&T; have supported this phone hardly at all since release. It comes with an old Massively outdated Android operating system, but they !promised! it would receive an update after release. Well most owner's had to wait a LONG............time thinking it would never come but now we have FINALLY get that update - which doesn't even upgrade you to the newest Android version. It's still an old version - AND MAKES THE PHONE SEVERELY BUGGY AND NEARLY UNUSABLE!Don't update this phone if you buy it, as tempting as that may be, because while adding some (mostly useless) features, it also makes it EXTREMELY buggy creating ghost apps that are always running and draining your battery. Just looking at your App Manager (which works perfectly if you don't update your phone) you can sometimes see upwards of 20 apps running in the background that you NEVER launched! This phone does it all the time and I'm sick of going into the App Manager and stopping each one manually. I can stop all the ghost apps, and put the the phone down, and literally a few seconds later pick up the phone and its running even MORE ghost apps! Ridiculous and the reason I now HATE my phone.The 3D and especially the 3D support via features is excellent. The 3D camera and the depth it has is excellent. The way it comes with plently of memory and HDMI jack to go out to your 3D tv is excellent. But this phone is not, because it is too buggy, and we had to beat AT&T; and LG over the head to get the first Android update, and when we finally did receive it, it made our phones too buggy to be enjoyable ever againI'm just now learning about the \"ghost calling\" problem. Apparently, if the phone is idle for too long it will disconnect from the cell tower. What does that mean? Well that means if someone calls you, it will never ring and sometimes won't even show a missed call! I can confirm this as it was happening to me all the time and I didn't even know the problem was widely reported! Also this will mess with the internal clock of the phone, and it will display the incorrect time when you do turn it back on, and can cause you to miss crucial alarms that you need to wake you up!I'm not ever getting another LG phone unless it's just to use it as a toy. I love the 3D features, but if I could do it all over again here's what I would do: I would get the latest, most mainstream Android phone out there to ensure the best, most up to date support (Samsung Galaxy S III now I believe) and Android version. Never again will I buy a phone believing the promise that it will get LATER support. If it launches with crap software/Android version, it will probably be crap. And if I could do it all over again, I would never have upgraded this phone to the FINALLY released (because we were bugging them, not because they were ever going to keep their word) newer (but still old and outdated) Android version which turned out to be BUGGY BUGGY BUGGY. And they won't fix the bugs, they don't care. At&t; will blame LG, and LG will blame At&t; just the way it has gone and will go if you complain to either of them about this phone's problems/glitchinessSo there you have it. My review. Stay away from this thing unless it's just as an extra toy and not a phone you need to rely on. And if you do get it, please heed my warning and don't update it", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "thoughts", "Author": "Dominique", "ReviewID": "R36W7BFJXFN4VR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "great phone. but after purchasing i later found out that this phone was discontinued for issues im currently having with the phone. mainly the phone not holding a charge.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save your money and buy a better phone!", "Author": "CFB07", "ReviewID": "RPPLH3NU60F9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There is a VERY good reason why this 4G, 3D capable smartphone is only $235. It sucks. I have had this phone for justover a year and have already gone through 2 of them. The phone constantly freezes which forces you to have to rip the batteryout to get it to work again. I don't multi-task very often but even then, apps are crashing in the middle of doing something.Within a month the first one I had kept randomly shutting down and would not reboot unless the battery was removed and replaced. Only to take 10 minutes to restart after doing so. If you plan to use the phone for anything length of time, don't expect the battery to last you more than a few hours. Many other phones will last FAR longer then this does. And if this phone truly is 4G its slower than absolute hell! That's assuming it will actually boot the application up and doesn't constantly restart it. The only good things about this phone is the screen size and 3d capabilities.

No other company has came up with such an idea - 3 D phone.Except HTC. But I don't really like HTC.

I got update no problem.Why was it a problem on win7 I do not know.So, patience won again.With GB the phone became faster, waay faster. Battery life improved too.Skype now works no problem.The phone is easy to root as well. I used Vulcan Factory code.20 min and it's done.So, it is good machine!Do not read bad reviews, some work and patience and you will get yourself pretty muchunique phone for not so much money!Thanks for reading!UPDATE after 6 month of usage......The phone is still alive and working.But if I had my choice, I would have never bought it again.Why? Simply because it is sooooo buggy...I can't turn on or off either BT or WIFI.If I do it once, might be fine, but next attempt freezes the phone.By freezing I mean, WIFI or BT cannot be turned on or off...these two are not under my control anymore.They are stuck.So, I have to reboot my phone AT LEAST once per day.Sometimes it looses charge - VERY fast.

I got her Sim card and minutes from Straight Talk. I activated the cards and came across a problem. I needed a pin number for the phone to work.. We were both very upset.... I called Straight Talk and they worked with me, they couldn't help me and told me to call AT&T; since it is an AT&T; phone. They said it needed to be unlocked by them... AT&T; tried everything but said I may need to send my phone back to the seller...I can't tell you how angry I was. I even called Amazon. I sent the seller an upset note explaining my problem.

I tried my Liberian Sim card but it didn't recognize it. For the US, it is a sophisticated little computer. I can access my email and other cool sites. The 3d images are great. The battery is stable, it goes for a day before charging.  It died on me after a year of use. Make sure you back up your data. I lost everything. During my 1.5 years of use, there were issues with the battery. I always kept it on the charger. It froze quite often and I had to take out battery and restart.
