{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works for me", "Author": "Bezoar", "ReviewID": "RHUTKSJ5J711M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Huawei G6608 as a replacement for a very cheap T-Mobile pay-as-you-go phone.  We upgraded to a T-Mobile family plan, with which we get 1000 shared minutes and unlimited texting for about $60/mo, but no data plan.  My wife, 3 teenagers, and I never come close to using up the call minutes, but we use the texting service A LOT.  I have never texted much before, but I'm being forced to start doing so by my family and some others I work with.  That's fine, except my problem is that I hate, Hate, HATE using the numeric keypad to text, so my old junky phone had to go.  Therefore, I started looking for a phone with a QWERTY keypad so texting wouldn't be so painful.  I chose this one because it also had Wi-Fi access and some other features that are far beyond any similar phone you can get for the same price.  That way, I could do my regular phone stuff (texting and calling), but also check my e-mail and even browse the web whenever I have Wi-Fi access, which I do at home and work.  This is the perfect phone for a cheapskate like me, who won't pay for a data plan, and who wants a QWERTY keypad.Anyway, I got the phone, set it up, and it seems well made.  All the major features work, it accepts a 16 GB micro-SD card, and runs Java apps you can download from the web.  Texting is much easier, now.  The only complaints I have are these:1.  The software on the phone was obviously programmed by Chinese people who are not fluent in English.  That can make navigating around the menus a little hard, sometimes.2.  The e-mail client does POP3 mail, but you can't actually view the content of the messages--only the headers.  Tech support at Huawei confirmed that lots of people seem to have this problem, but they didn't have a solution.  However, there is a Java e-mail client called PicoMail that you can download for free, and which seems to work ok.So far, I think this was a good purchase, even if it takes a little more work to get it set up.UPDATE (3/18/2013):  I was using the Calendar program on the phone, but all of a sudden it stops giving me the option to add events.  So I call Huawei customer service, and they say they haven't released that device in North America (i.e., the sellers here at Amazon must have gotten the phones out of country), so they don't offer any support.  None.  Even if the Calendar program is on all their phones.  So anyway, you can forget about technical support.UPDATE (6/25/2013):  I actually bought two of these phones--one for me, and one for my 17 year old son.  As I mentioned, mine started having software problems, and his just quit working altogether, even though he didn't drop it, or anything like that.  I'm downgrading my rating to 3 stars, and I went ahead and bought an LG P506 Thrive (unlocked), which you can get through Amazon for about $90, and it runs on Android OS.  Now I can get a lot more apps, and it has Wi-Fi, so I don't have to shell out for a data plan.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "great quality, basic phone with wifi", "Author": "Lullabyforelise", "ReviewID": "R3BXYVWVRFDAE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i recived it yesterday, its a great basic phone with dual sim and wifi. i already knew that it works with edge,so its not big deal for me. with java apps,  you can download as many .jar apps as you would and this phone will work very well. i rate it with 4 stars because i was setting wifi but i couldn't, maybe user's guide is not enough specific as i would. Desing quality, image, sound and video are great. i love huawei mobiles because are damages resistant.Edited: ok finally i could set the wifi, the trouble was with my router. the connection is faster than my other mobile phone with android o.s. (froyo)this mobile deserves 5 stars.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A nice phone, so far so good.", "Author": "Valarie Liveoak \"SA Val\"", "ReviewID": "R2XQ9F1E94ZCY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the ringtones as installed, and the button to go to \"meeting\" mode, silencing the phone is easy and handy for me. The phone works ok with 2 SIMs in place but eats charge up rapidly. The interface is still not intuitive, but again ok. It was hard to put a lanyard on it, could have designed the loop for it better, but I finally succeeded. I was glad it came with earphones and a wired mic, and that it is easy to get it to be on loudspeaker mode, although the information about the phone did not lead me to expect that.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its ok", "Author": "W. T. Cook", "ReviewID": "RK4LP281GXU3E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Somewhat crude user interface, but I expected that. One thing to note is that a lot of features are unusable/disabled unless it has a SIM card in it. Getting the WIFI and the SIM accounts set up take a little patience and trial and error. If your not techically saavy, you might want to try something else. The ear buds were really cheap and had unequal length cords. I had good luck getting some Java apps to work though, Facebook worked, and Pico apps for mail works really well. Overall its just kind of a cheap product though, I sold it after a month. Unfortunately, the vendors return policy (i.e. restock fee) was not stated at order time, otherwise I probably wouldn't have taken the risk and bothered ordering it. For a phone similar to this, look at the Samsung \"chat\" series. They are probably decent, and I'm sure the software is MUCH more friendly and elegant.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent little international phone", "Author": "Mindmolder", "ReviewID": "R5RFLMBBL6NAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed something that was dual sim but not pricey in case it gets stolen while traveling.

However, both the ringer and phone volume are very soft compared to some typically noisy situations, like in a car, restaurant or even on a beach.  I could not hear it ring, nor hear the other person talk when I was traveling in a car and many locations away from the home.  For this reason I would not want it for a primary phone, and I use it only as a backup.The WiFi works, but does require a SYM card to function.  The browser for Internet access does not always render properly, and some pages don't display at all.  I expected the rendering problem due to display size, but was frustrated by the ones that would not display at all.  However, it was nice to have at least some Internet access on an inexpensive phone.It connects easily to a computer through USB, and I also connected via Bluetooth.  Camera quality was average for this price range and also easily took videos.  Shooting toward the sun caused problems with the auto-exposure.  Radio, voice recorder and MP3 functions all worked well.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Princess Stacy \"Annastacia\"", "ReviewID": "R3MXAZMO0VF7KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The delivery speed was excellent and the phone works great. The WIFI internet connectivity is great. It takes a little getting used to in order to work your way around the navigation but other than that this is a great phone for the price.
