I use my Nokia N810 Internet tablet to connect wirelessly by tethering over Bluetooth to my N95 high speed HSDPA data connection. This means I get fast internet connectivity everywhere - everywhere there is a cell tower at least.For those less in the know iPhone doesnt support tethering.N95 has support for A2DP Bluettoth profile - which means you can listen to Stereo music over a bluetooth headphone (like the Motorola S9). This is apart from support bluetooth headset for talking.For iPhone users , in todays wireless day, you still have to use a wired headphone to listen to music - pretty messy.N95's 5 MP camera is one of the best of breed in any cellphone - quality wise of photos.N95-3 has one of the fastest 3G HSDPA data connection support in the US. (iphone 3g does have this too)Also the Wifi and GPS in the N95 come is handy when you need those features instantly.As a in-car GPS it certainly does not fit the bill, but when walking in the streets of NY, and you suddenly need to get some info or directions - GPS and the Wifi come in most useful.For me having a good quality camera for instant shots (instead of caring a dedicated camera always) and the USA 3G HSDPA is what convinced me to go for the Nokia N95 over other similar featured phones (iPhone is definitely not similar featured - its a different class for me).On a comparatove note the Nokia N78, E71, N82 and Samsung G series are comparable devices depending on which feature set you lay more importance on.And for those who find the camera slow - please update the software with the latest N95 firmware that Nokia released recently - it speeds up the camera a lot and also some other features.The battery on my new Nokia N95-3 lasts 1 1/2 day with HSDPA 3,5G usage in NY/NJ area and I use it daily to tether to my N810 device (which gives me touchscreen internet).", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "The perfect phone?", "Author": "Sloan Bowman \"Sloan Bowman\"", "ReviewID": "R1AQ3RNNX8M2PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone packs everything you would ever need in a smart-phone and then some. You will be able to watch video,movies and listen to your favorite music with the built in media support. You can find your way with the built in GPS. Surf the web with the full HTML browsesr and stay up to date with your inbox on the go.When initially looking into purchasing the N95 I was planning on replacing a blackberry that I have been carrying around for years. I have been a blackberry user for some time and thought I would never find a better solution. I was wrong. This device does everything my blackberry did and then some. Granted the push email is a plus and the N95 does not support push out of the box (Checks at intervals) but there are some third party applications that add this. The beauty of the S60 platform is that you have the freedom to do what you want with pretty much anything on the device.The N95 seems thick at first but its actually very small and extremely easy to carry in  your pocket. I have actually learned to like the fill of the thickness more because it fits my hands perfectly. I have been using the qwerty keyboard on my blackberry for some time and can type very well on it so I was skeptical about going back to a phone keypad. While I am not as fast as I was on a blackberry the prediction is very good on this device and allows you to easily type short emails and text messages with no trouble.Nokia states that this device is a multimedia computer and I have to agree its very powerful once you learn how to use it. Will it replace my iPod? Possibly but its not quit as a good as a standalone audio device. The music player is very easy to use and with the media transfer plugin (available for mac)  you can use iTunes to sync your music just like you would an iPod. I was able to sync my address-books, contacts and music and videos in no time with the software available for download on Nokia's USA website.My favorite feature of the N95 is the fact that I can take pictures/video (5MP camera) and post them to the web (flickr, OVI) all from the device. Being a family man this is a wonderful thing to have because I have have a great moment in our life up on the web with comments in a matter of minutes without ever needing a computer. The camera is very impressive for a phone. It takes a while to get used to getting good pictures with it but with a little practice you can take great shots with ease. I can't wait to see what Nokia comes up with next. The N series devices are the best hands done.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Is that a \"thing\" in your pocket?", "Author": "Jason Fultz \"fultzjap\"", "ReviewID": "R3FMYV6WTWL0D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I try to stay on top of technology without sweating the details. I shop, I blog, and I keep up with my TLA's. (three letter acronyms)When this phone was released, I was understandably excited. I bought the display model from CompUSA before they got it out of the box for $699 in August of 2007. (it's an N95-1, the \"real\" original N95)Here's what I've figured out since then:1: You MUST have faith in Nokia and flash the firmware as it gets released (but not when it's still beta). Every time I do, I find new bells and whistles that I didn't have before.2: I have T-mobile service with the $4.99 t-zones plan which is supposed to include POP/IMAP/SMTP email capabilities. This works great... and so does the FULL http internet!! After much research, I've concluded that only Symbian phones are exempt from the proprietary blocking that WinMo, Mac, and Crackberry users are constrained to. That means you get the $40 internet capability for $35 less than the next guy. Multiply that by 12 and your phone is paid for. Do the math.3: No other Phone OS comes close to Symbian. It is, however, turning into more of a fanatical club lately, like the dorky Linux club and Apple marketing suckas club. Once you're in the club, you're a lifer. I would be in a bad place if I had to go back to the chalkboard and learn to run my life using a different platform, mostly because the competition simply cannot do what I have come to expect out of a phone.4: Components vs convergence. When you're \"decorating\" the living room, you shouldn't buy the $1200 home theater in a box. When your DVD laser gets dirty or wears out, you need to spend $1200 to replace the thing, and then you've got all these extra speakers, you know what I'm talking about. So why do I entrust my entire mobile device consortium to one device? Because all this stuff has to fit IN MY POCKET. I've never owned an MP3 player. I've never owned a point-and-shoot camera. I've never owned a Garmin GPS. And I rarely need to carry my laptop anywhere. It's all there, and if I had owned these devices, I could have easily sold them to pay the asking price at the time. There's no spare room in my pants for extra electronics if you know what i mean.5: You CAN make the GPS work faithfully. After much fussing, I found myself in the Chicago Nokia \"outlet\" store talking to a sales rep about the issue and learned that out of the box, the phone uses GSM data to triangulate the GPS position (in addition to, or rather, PRIOR TO, using the GPS antenna) which is why people are crying endlessly about it taking 5-15 minutes to find a signal. It's right there in the user interface, it's just a little tricky to find it. You have to turn off the GSM/GPRS data location awareness and it's good to go. Now I find GPS signal in 3-15 seconds every time.6: I carry mine with an 8GB Kingston microSDHC card inside and have never had any issues with data loss or recognition. I suspect the new 16GB will also be fine as it is the same class as the 8GB.7: I used a PC program called \"Fixtunes\" to lookup my music and assign metadata/album cover art on the fly, and my phone shows the album art while it is playing... a small but worthwhile chore for any music collection.8: Compatibiliy: For bluetooth, I have a Sony HWSBTA2W receiver for the home theater, a Scosche UBRH bluetooth receiver for my car, a Cirago BTA-6210 micro dongle for my laptop sync, and a Nokia 5310 for my Girlfriend.

V. Trevino \"M. Vivas\"", "ReviewID": "R267ID4VV9D9LS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I made my homework before choosing this phone and let me say I am glad. Windows based phones have a lot of programs and functions, but are very slow and the management of memory is a mess. Also some times are too bulky that I rather carry my notebook instead.Basic nokias, sony-ericssons and motorolas are that, basic.So, I wanted a smart phone, with lots of features, easy of use and that could let me stop carrying many other devices. The nokia did that for me!Pilot, no longer need it. Ipod, no longer need it. Cannon camera, no longer need it. Garming gps, no longer need it. FM Radio, no longer need it; voice recorder, calculator and games no longer need them, also universal remote, skype phone, etc... Don't get me wrong on this. But... the N95 does all that and well done! I do not miss any of the mentioned.Is like a swiss knife, every body has one but very few carry it on! With the N95 you can carry all of those devices on. (I am one of those who carries the n95 and the Sw Army)Why the n95? Came down to blackberry 8310 or 8320, iphone and the n95 to me. But I found the nokia camera a lot better; lens, resolution and also the others do not take movies. Also I found the GPS faster on nokias an can use it out of the box. Wi-fi is marvelous (blackberry made me choose between gps or wi-fi, depending on model I wanted both features), the size, etc.. The touch is firm, well built, nice grab, the size is to me perfect. Is very simple and fast to use, and finally a phone that my ol'man can use with out going to college.Also I rather this version since the 8 gigas version is more expensive and the memory has a limit. Here I can get the HD-SD for a few bucks in Amazon with... infinite capacity.If you are a corporate person, or a chat fan, then probably you are stuck with the berry. Which is a great option too. The iphone... well trendy people will love it.

Many times I'm left to wonder where the sound is coming from, even when I'm holding the phone right in front of me.Put in an 8 gig micro SD card, slap on a good pair of cans, and you can throw away all your iPods and digital music players.I have since moved on to the Nokia N85 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot - U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper), in which its OLED screen blows the N95's old TFT screen out of the water, as well as most other phones I'm sure.But audio-wise I think the N95 is better, and for a phone that's several years old, it can still hold its own on the other fronts as well - AWESOME photo quality and very decent video quality.Although it's fat almost like a soap bar (as opposed to a \"candy bar\" like other phones), I very much like how it feels in my hand - gives you a very secure feeling (I feel like I'm always about to drop my N85).The soft rubber of the back has a very nice feel as well (although prone to marks and scratches because of its rubbery material).The feel of the buttons is very firm, tactile, and responsive, but prone to wear like most phones.On the downside, the Real player sucks - you'll have to install a third party player to enjoy all your different video files.Overall, highly recommended.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia N-95 near perfect", "Author": "L. French \"cowgirl\"", "ReviewID": "R18PSJJHK7318H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my new N-95 to replace another Nokia model cell phone.  Nokia seems to have the best product I have used after 10 years of cell service.  Signal strength is the only major drawback I have found, so far with the N-95.  I live in a rural area and this weakness is still superior to other cell phone mfgrs I have tried out.  The slide mechanism is a little loosey-goosey for a pouch-type holder and I have had some adjustments to make on how I hold the phone while talking in order not to push camera buttons.  But that aside the phone rates highly for me.  The camera (5mpx) is wonderful- I have mine on automatic focus and flash and it works well.  Somewhat slower shutter release than my Nikon DSLR D-80- but IT'S A PHONE!  The image quality is great!  Very easy to operate and program, if you have used earlier Nokia models- or glance over the user manual-Don't like a button's function?  Easily changed to shortcuts to fuctions you use more.  Loads of pre-loaded ringtones and 'stuff'.  Transfer of contacts and other data was a breeze.  Connects to my computer easily with the included software.

For example, the main camera, i agree it wont beat your PnS but i do not care about this 'cuz am a professional photographer, but come on for the amount of money we are paying for this phone should have a cover on the back to protect it (if you are buying the US version at least it doesnt has), and on the software area, i really miss the sleep mode from the n73, it could be annoying for some people but for me, i like it cuz it saves a little more battery.On this subject, i do not know why people complains so much, if you dont have WiFi, GPS, GPRS and pretend to get rid of your iPod with this, of course the battery wont last at all. Since i own this phone has last me playing with all its functions for 3 days, and withouth playing with it almost 6 whole days. So, it's up to you.I havent had any gps lock problems, wifi and gprs both work fine, google applications works fine too. Native web browser works good too (you can add another one if you like but the main one does its job). mp3 player and video quality are good.the one i bought comes with software version 11.0 something, be sure to upgraded to 20.0 something as soon as you received it before makin any setups or contacts so you dont have to do backups or anything like that so you dont get bored wasting time.the micro sd it came with was 1gb, i quickly change it for a 4gb and works good enough.i do recommend using your phone as soon as you receive it because the battery comes with some charge already, so use that charge while you start to know your phone, once you are done i also recommend charging it for the first time switched off and for around 5 hours, its a lie you need 12 hours to charge it and even more a myth you need 24 hours.other than that just have fun with your new phone", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great phone; iffy email", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Tanner\"", "ReviewID": "R4SV1X7C6T7PZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as it really seems to be a phone first (actual numeric key pad and good call quality), with a really good data feature set too. The phone is great! Call quality is good and it is nice to just be able to start hitting numbers and that is what you are getting. Everyone raves about the features on this phone and for good reason. There is far more here on the phone than I will ever use. Free GPS is a great perk of this phone. And if you use it frequently, it negates some of the cost as you save yourself the monthly fee from AT&T.; The camera takes good pictures, but is far too slow to effectively replace your point and shooter.Everyone complains about the battery life, and not without reason. If you are using 3G, it will not make it through the day, even with minimal usage. Running on Edge, and only using 3G when connecting to the internet allows you to make it through the day in most cases though.My biggest complaint with the phone is that it does not maintain a connection with my mailboxes as consistently as I would expect. I use Mail for Exchange (a Nokia app) for my business account and use what came on the phone for two other accounts. Almost daily, at least one of my accounts will lose connection and I will have to restart the phone, sometime multiple times, and then go to the settings to reset the retrieval settings. I have not seen that this is a widespread problem, but it is very frustrating and not something I ever experienced with BlackBerry or HTC.When all is said and done, this is still one of the best phones on the market today. If you have the money to spend and want a lot of features, you won't be disappointed. But if you are a serious email user I think I would look around a little bit.

With the larger battery, I normally have to charge the phone overnight every 48 hours or so but I use the phone a lot so I do not seen the battery life as being a negative.

Stevens", "ReviewID": "R2ZS2C7SO8VDNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazingly, although I bought this phone neither here nor at NewEgg, there are only 2 reviews on NewEgg for it, and I wrote one of them. It follows:Pros: Relatively small, fits in a pocket albeit cases are tough to find (see Cons), has Wi-Fi, has built-in GPS (and A-GPS), has US 3G (not Euro 3G like a lot of \"unlocked\" cell phones), has a huge software development community, comes with everything you need (including a 1GB microSD card), plays video at 30fps, supports a SlingMedia client, supports voice recognition, has a great bluetooth implementation, has TWO cameras (one with 5MP on the back with a flash and a lesser one on the front for Skype-type use), is stable with the latest firmware release, supports innumerable tools for file management and software installation, has excellent battery life considering everything it has (which can be increased by turning off Bluetooth, lowering the Wi-Fi transmit level, etc.), has great voice call quality, has an FM radio, voice recorder, supports apps that allow editing of Office documents, comes with its own (admittedly almost useless) GPS app which you can easily replace, and is now a LOT more affordable. Makes an iPhone look like a Fisher-Price toy. Oh, and has a microSDHC slot that will take an 8GB chip (and larger, hopefully).Cons: There's really only one case out there--a horizontal leather fold-over flap job with a magnetic latch. PnP-driven media players for which it's allegedly a client are hard to make work. Real player is the built-in video app, which is fine for MP4 but lacks support that comes with Core Player (which you can get, but which is also hard to integrate). The stock web browser is good, but doesn't support MS IE-based apps (but a Beta version of Skyfire does, so you can play Sirius' internet stream--seeya, Stiletto). Doesn't come with anti-virus or firewall SW, but Kapersky makes a good one. The only GPS app worth using that supports voiced turns is AmazeGPS which is FREE (the latest version of Google Maps works splendidly, if silently). Users used to a simple bar phone won't like the complexity, although my wife has done OK moving from a somple 6030 to it. No QWERTY keyboard, but also no 2-handed head-down operation to send a message (OK, it's still a 1-handed head-down operation).Other Thoughts: There's the original N95 (a.k.a. -1), the -2 (with European 3G--forget high-speed Internet access), and the -3 (a.k.a. the NAM model), with US 3G that's only superseded by the N95-8G and now the N96. Interestingly, my understanding is they left out the hardware-based video processor from some succeeding models so the N95-3 supports video and games better. The -8G model, like the iPhone, has 8GB on-board but no microSDHC slot, although the N96 has 16GB internal (and I believe the slot came back). But BOTH cost a LOT more than the N95-3 (try as high as TWICE AS MUCH). I like Nokia's small-tip charger system, so the car charger works with the N95 AND their Bluetooth headsets and headphones. There's more, but space is limiting. I am convinced that there's no better cell phone available--it's basically future-proof. Don't download Nokia's Maps 2.0--it loads the voice library which you have to subscribe to in order to use ($$$!). Oh, it has lots of RAM and a standard 3.5mm headset jack. A USB charger is extra (a LOT extra), but useful. BE CAREFUL about ordering accessories--almost everything advertised for it is really for the original N95 and WILL NOT FIT the N95-3 because of its larger battery and consequently deeper case size.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent phone, is my 2nd one and I still love it", "Author": "Jeannette B.
