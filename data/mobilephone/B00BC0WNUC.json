It is literally a joy to use.I bought the Z10 as a replacement for my Nexus 4, which was a good phone, and I was still blown away by this thing. Most of the important apps are either on the Z10, coming soon, or have really decent web apps that you can make desktop shortcuts for. Anyways, the screen is the best I have ever seen on a mobile device, and that includes the iPhone 5. Color saturation is on par with the iPhone 5 screen, sharpness is slightly higher on the Z10 (Z10 has higher pixel density), and the auto brightness is by far better than anything on the market! It actually adjusts brightness while you're using the device, not just when you first turn on the screen (as is the case for the iPhone 5, and Nexus 4). The interface is super smooth, the keyboard is by far the best on the market (and I've used Swype, Swift Key, and stock iOS 6/JB 4.2 keyboards), the speaker is actually loud, not just called a \"loudspeaker.\" The battery lasts 150-200% what my Nexus 4 lasted! Anyways, if I were to list all the things I love about this phone, it would be a much longer review than I'd like, so I'll start with some negatives. App selection is DEFINITELY not on par with iOS/Android, so if you go in with that expectation, you'll be sorely disappointed. Google Account integration is not as good as on Android (obviously). For example, you need to employ workarounds to get multiple calendars from your account to show up on the device. There are also a few minor quirks in the OS, that I'm sure will be addressed in the future (ex. The Hub not resetting to the top when you leave it, so doing a peak gesture when you get a notification just shows you what you were doing last, and you have to close that to see the notification. Obviously, finishing off what you were doing is a simple way of avoiding that situation).Anyways, I'm sure you can see that I've rated it 5 stars. In comparison, my Nexus 4 received 3 stars. It is safe to say that I am absolutely in love with this phone, and have been *very* pleasantly surprised as I had been a huge RIM (Blackberry) detractor in the past. In fact, I only got the Z10 to show people that I rationally dislike RIM, and not just talk without having used their products. Well, I stand corrected. I ended up selling my Nexus 4 after a week of owning the Z10 :)", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "AnnaRose26", "ReviewID": "R3HZ0HZR0MFG6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went from an iphone 4s to this and I'm so glad I did.

Kinem", "ReviewID": "R1FTEZYTTT2MUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned and used Droid Incredible, Note 1, S3, iPhone 4s, multiple Windows phones. But, I don't have to use every phone ever made to know that Z10 is the best phone available.I'm so thoroughly enamored with BB10 after only one week of using it. I have an S3 through Verizon, but I bought a Z10 from Canada because I couldn't wait any longer. When I have to use my S3, I find it clumsy and slow and I'm not talking processor speed. I'm talking about the user interface (UI) I am constantly phantom swiping, then I realize I have to look for buttons/keys, etc. Why should I have to look around click the 'back' arrow a dozen times to get out of an app? Swipe up, it's minimized. Tap the 'X' if I've the urge, to close the app. I have 4, 6, 8 open at times with NO performance penalty.And how could I have possibly tolerated such an archaic method of communication as Android? I used to excitedly show my iPhone friends the notification center, and the tweeks of the notification center. Hahaha! Who, after using a BB10 device for a week or two, will ever accept anything less than the Hub? Here's my life to this point...closing the app I am in, opening the app that has the communication interaction (text, FB, LinkedIn, etc), responding in that app, closing that app, then finding and reopening the original app I was in? Serious? How much better is the Hub than anything else available? Infinitely better. Swipe up and over, respond without opening any other apps or closing the app you were in, return. Never again will I settle for anything less efficient.The virtual keyboard? Wow...I never thought I would love something as much as my brief encounter with the Bold 9930 physical keyboard, but this is nothing short of amazing. Stunning in look, feel, accuracy. It's beautiful and efficient and I love it. It even sounds amazing. I'm so fast and accurate and it has to be because of BB, because my fat thumbs aren't any more nimble when I use the S3.The browser? It SMOKES my S3's browser. I don't even understand how it can be as fast as it is? Why are Android and iPhone browsers so slow? And they have the address bar inconveniently located at the top?  Compare it to any browser on any platform. The videos are out there to PROVE it, but actually using it yourself is spectacular.Yes, every week another droid comes out with great specs and more cores, but it's the same thing over and over. It's the same clumsy, slow, inefficient UI. NO security. SPECS DON'T MAKE IT A BETTER PHONE! All it does is makes an impressive stat sheet. Do stat sheets make your day better? Does it make your life easier to have more cores? Is that what you begged for in your next phone?Yes, BB doesn't have all the apps yet. They will build them.  But, it's OS is something none of the others will have...ever.Google and Apple know they are behind now. Their browser and keyboard are woeful in comparison.  And they have NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO 'Hub' and 'Balance.' Who would like to argue that? The the gesture based UI? I guess, that is a personal preference, and you could argue it, but try it for a couple weeks and then pick up the others. Wow, could they be any less elegant?Android and iOS will have to steal the 'Hub' and 'Balance'. They will have to patch sloppy hack code onto an OS that was built to play apps. For BB10 the OS was built with those things at it's heart. Security, communication, separation of work/play were afterthoughts for them. If Android and iOS have to copy many key components of BB10 OS....who is behind who? What is a better phone? A list of specs meant to 'wow' the geeks, or one that makes your day better and more efficient...a few seconds at a time, hundreds of times per day....", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Black is Back!", "Author": "B2S", "ReviewID": "R2WKNNFK504WS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I got mine from TMO under a business account.  Though I think that my first hand experience with the phone should be helpful for those of you buying this phone from Amazon.After weeks of use, here is what I gather for both major Pros and Cons.Pros:1. OS - The new Hub, Peek and Flow are superbly implemented. It may feel weird at first, but it takes no time for me to master my phone. The phone runs fast and doesn't get hot under heavy uses. It gets slightly warm though on the back.2. Browser - This is the fastest I have seen till date. It has flash player which you can enable or disable. With my unlimited 4G data, I have been able to watch series or movies from HBO GO in HD quality! It is a little bit difficult to move through the web, but doable.3. Look and Feel - This can be subjective. I personally feel that it looks modern, light and has very sleek slim profile.4. Quality - It is made of mostly plastic, which doesn't bother me. Though the plastic material doesn't feel cheap when hold in my hands. The screen resolution is the best in the market right now. However, the color saturation, contrast, etc may not be the best. Though I don't think human eyes can perceive any significant difference.5. Virtual Keyboard - I can't believe that I could end up liking the phone as I tried iPhone since those old days. I couldn't get myself to use it even when I tried the newer one like 4S or 5. Even on the new Android, I got frustrated all the time using its virtual keyboard.Z10 keyboard software is the best right now in the market largely due to its words auto correction ability. I just couldn't believe that I can type almost as fast with hardly any mistakes with Z10 virtual keyboard. The word flicking feature is such an icing on the cake!6. Removable back cover - Well, most of these days modern touch screen smart phone doesn't have this. With Z10, you have option to use a back up battery when you need it. In addition, you could use up to 64GB sd memory card though you will need to set up the card in a correct way before Z10 will accept the card. Otherwise, by default Z10 will take up to 32GB sd memory card.7. Call quality and Reception - Well, the most important feature about the phone is to make and receive calls! So far the calls have been very loud and clear. It is easy to use. A few things I don't like is that I can't seem to be able to copy number from the web and paste it onto call window to make a call! Also, I do hope that TMO bring OS update to add WiFi calling features soon.....There are more, but I should move on...Cons:1. Apps - Not much there. But I only a short list, which is Skype, Instagram, Watch ESPN and HBO GO. Yes, on EPSN and HBO GO, I can use desktop web browser and make it work. However, having these apps would make my life a lot easier. Then I can stop borrowing my wife iPhone from time to time to watch sport games :-)2. Customization - The notable one is notifications. With older Blackberry, you could set a profile where your ringtone for phone and/or SMS, BBM, etc will ring at different level. That is gone! Also, there is a slight glitch where when I set my phone to \"Phone Call Only\" it stops my virtual keyboard sound. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. Well, in short, I can do way more on this notifications customization with my older Blackberry than my new Z10. Perhaps there will be an app for that!!!3. Email - This supposes to be the strongest feature of any Blackberry devices. However, gone is the ability to store emails on your device more than 30days - what gives!Yes, you can search the server on certain email protocols, but I know many colleges who won't use Z10 because of this. Well, they love to keep email on their phones 2-3 years way back.I know that this 30 days email sync is similar to many other phone platforms, but why removing one of its strongest features! I do hope that it will be fixed with OS update to be able to archive email on device of memory cards soon.In summary, I highly recommend the phone if you aren't rely heavily on apps.The battery is not the best thing, but is on par with the likes in the market - but with ability to swap out a back up battery.You should find it very easy to learn and master this phone in less than a week.I am sure though that given the time, apps can only improve as user base grows.

I switched to the Galaxy because I felt like the iPhone was exactly the same phone every year despite me buying a new model every year. Literally, the same phone, I bought the new iPhone every year hoping something 'cool' was added, but nothing, same look and feel.I went from the iPhone to the Galaxy SIII because I had heard great things about Android. Sure enough, I enjoyed the phone, though not as slick as the iPhone, the Android Operating System was a refreshing experience. This honeymoon lasted about one month, and then couldn't stand the phone. The battery drain was just too much, then people told me, root it!!! That's the way to go! Samsung's TouchWiz interface is a battery killer and is clunky. Okay. I rooted the phone and installed basic Google apps. Okay battery life did greatly improve and I was happy again. Until I realized that I had installed a ROM that was supported by a Community of brilliant people, I must say, but I was a BETA tester!!! I couldn't take the crashes, and basic functionality bugs... So I went back to the iPhone because even though I was sick of it, it at least lasted me half the day.I bought the BlackBerry Z10 and haven't looked back, I haven't been this excited about a phone since the first iPhone, when I switched from a Nokia. It was night and day, and that's how I feel right now. Going from Galaxy and iPhone to a BlackBerry is literally night and day. Incredible battery life (up to a day and a half of intensive use before a charge), true multi tasking.. this is truly amazing. I remember when the Apple introduced the multi app function, but was it really multi tasking? Clearly not, currently you cannot go to Youtube, listen your your favorite mix and reply to a text, or go to Facebook. The minute you leave YouTube, the music stops... That's not the case in the Z10, you can navigate the entire phone, open any app, and the music/video is still playing. True multitasking.Awesome phone, really powerful operating system.

Admittedly, I am a former BlackBerry Curve owner who eventually bailed on the platform for a then new Iphone 3gs paying early termination fees for not just one but two lines. I initially left seeking what everyone else was at the time - a better experience.Iphone was everything I was looking for. Siri and 4s, even better. Android started to catch my attention and I eventually went on a Sprint trial with an Evo 3d. What a POS. To this day I'm not sure if it was the sheer weight of that phone, Sprint or the Android experience, but I returned it within 30 days and went back to the Iphone.Enough about memory lane. Let's talk about the Z10!GesturesImmediately users will find themselves feeling somewhat lost, missing their home buttons to press to get started. Even my 2 year old son knows that on the Iphone if he gets lost, push the button to bail and start over. Z10, the marketing will tell you it's built to keep you moving.  What's more appropriate would be \"Built to keep you from bailing\".Unlock the phone? Swipe the screen from the bottom up. Icons at the bottom service everyday functions, phone, search and camera, and showing you which apps are running.From there you swipe left or right depending on where you want to go.  Left takes you into your messaging which let's you see everything (a.k.a the hub) or filter messages by app (Facebook messages, twitter activity, email, text messages, etc). Right takes you to a familiar tiling of your apps similar to Android and Iphone.On the side, there is a button between the volume controls that launches the voice controls. You can do Sri like commands such as textting or calling people, reminding you, schedule meetings, tweet, status update, you name it.App StoreThe essentials are on the phone such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, FourSquare, Dropbox, Evernote, etc.. I did some research and found the holy grail: side-loadingThe genius people at BlackBerry have allowed developers to speed up adoption of the platform by porting over their Android apps in a few clicks. There's even websites that let you upload an android app and immediately download it converted for BlackBerry. It's not 100% foolproof but I'm now back in business with essential apps - Pandora, Netflix, Plex, Google Maps, Skype to name a few.I see this as a short term compromise that will be unnecessary midyear when BlackBerry shocks everyone on success of the platform and competition forces people to target releases on the platform.  As a developer, you have SOOOO many paths to launch an application in Java (Android ports), Native C++, HTML5, you name it.  One year from now (at most), there will be a huge surge and Blackberry will be on top in sheer app count.  You can take that to the bank.  $BBRYTyping / KeyboardOne of the most overlooked area of innovation in the last couple of years has been typing. It is only fitting that BlackBerry comes along and turns this into one of the biggest differentiators between this platform and anything else out there.As you type, suggestions pop up over the letters. You can complete the word by simply `flicking' the letter upwards. Before long I found myself typing whole sentences with a few letters followed by some consecutive flicks. (in fact, I wrote most of this whole article on my z10, that's how natural it is.)All of a sudden, I'm not feeling sad anymore I don't have the 200,000 free games that bait you to buy the 200,000 paid version of them. The typing alone is a huge plus and top of list feature. Simply put, it's the new standard.CameraThe camera is pretty standard but comes with two unique features. One is the ability to take photos and fine tune individuals faces. Took that family portrait to find out half of the fam has their eyes shut? No problem with the Z10! The phone essentially takes frame samples like a video and allows you to cycle through the frames. When you are done its blended into the pictures and voil\u00e0! The perfect picture.You may have heard some buzz about Instagram not being available. What people don't know is you don't need it. There is a built in picture editor that allows you to tweak your pictures, such as applying image filters like Instagram. Pretty cool and another top of list feature.The Red LightWhat the heck am I talking about now you might ask. For die hard BlackBerry users, the visual indicator (red light) meant you had a new message. It would keep intermittently blink until you've read the message. I didn't initially notice it in my first run with the phone but I'm excited to announce IT'S BACK! However now, it spans any notification in my hub. Response to my Facebook status? Blink! Someone replied to my tweet? Blink! So what? Well what was even more equally satisfying was letting my phone sit by itself on my coffee table. I didn't have to pick it up, opening and closing apps to check for activity because I already knew. It wasn't blinking. For me, another top of list feature. I already feel like I'm saving time and being more productive on and off the phone.So far after 24 hours on the new device, I am in love again with my CrackBerry.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfecho", "Author": "Eduardo Hernandez \"El Valiente\"", "ReviewID": "R271DLQ9ENKMDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,Muchas gracias por el servicio.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry 10 Operating System Is Challenged", "Author": "USC MBA", "ReviewID": "R1WPJ9M79MDLLJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I initially wrote a review with a five star rating given my initial enthusiasm for the Z10 (Verizon), based on the size of the screen, gesture based operating system (rather than a home button) with the Hub and Peek, removable battery, advanced keyboard, etc.  However, as I gained experience on the device, it became apparant to me that this is a really challenged phone for the following reasons:- Clunky BB10 operating system that doesn't work smoothly, and is frustrating to use even after getting used to the various gestures.  Part of this is the gesture based system, part the rendering of the screens, and the part is poor functional design (i.e. why are certain buttons at the far upper left-hand corner of the screen where it is hard to reach?).- Keyboard that lacks precision and only makes up for this in the error correction algorithm which is very good.  The individual keys just do not respond well and the glass feels slick - like typing on ice - and so while the error correction and flick typing help, this doesn't make for a very satisfying experience overall.- Just fair battery life, so it is a good thing that the battery is replaceable, because it will need to be replaced about 2/3 through a busy day on the road.  And the battery is slow to charge through a low-quality micro-USB connection.- Good phone and speakerphone that is marred by issues with visual voicemail (had to replace phone once after it froze entirely), accidental dialing (more than any phone I have had), and answering through the gesture/swipe.- Music player with limited options and fair sound quality.  The Neutron app is available for $4.99, but this should be standard for what I paid for the device.- Browser that is improved over past BlackBerry browsers and accommodates Flash, but will not render email images to the correct size.- Camera that does have a useful fast shutter option to capture good faces plus some good effects options, but the low light photos are fair, and the video rendering is jittery.- Desktop software via BB Link that is just terrible - this by itself is a complete deal breaker.  Have never seen such a difficult to use program of its kind, making transfering pictures and music a struggle.  I tried just dropping files directly to the device, but my computer wouldn't recognize the Z10 as a drive.- Low quality look - the fit and finish is bland and not up to the competition.  After awhile, I just didn't like using a device that looked so dull, in addition to working in such a clunky, frustrating way.- And yes, applications, or lack of them.  There are few really good apps (Neutron, Kindle, and LinkedIn are a few good ones).The main bright spot was the screen size, which made the browser a partially effective back-up for the lack of apps, and good durability, as the device can survive a drop.But in the end, this phone and desktop software was so frustrating, I ended up asking my IT department to get me an iPhone 5s, which is an incredible phone.  This was a hard decisions, as I went back to BlackBerry a couple years ago after realizing the old BlackBerry 7 Bolds being snappy and efficient for email, as compared to my last iPhone (a 3GS).  However, this new iPhone 5s is extremely fast, and the application ecosystem is amazing.  The one-touch fingerprint unlock is an incredible feature that works far better than BlackBerry's method of typing in a passcode (which didn't work half the time).  Having access to the applications that are common now, that simply work, provides amazing functionality, and now that I am on the iPhone 5s platform, I can see the vast difference.  I see people on these reviews write that the browser/large screen makes up for not having good apps - but that is just innacurate.  Many applications that are on iOS, like MOG, HP12c calculator, and Sonos controller, have no BB10 or website equivalent.Most discouraging is the recent decision by the company to move away from hardware and new devices, especially high-end ones.  This is ultimately why I lost hope in the platform and made the switch to Apple.  It makes no sense to be pushing the enterprise network without a \"must have\" device that requires it.  One of the mistakes of the Z10 and Q10 is that IT departments have the option of just using ActiveSynch, without the need to use the secure BlackBerry network (which also provides an ongoing revenue stream to the company).  Yes, the BlackBerry device is more secure itself, but this isn't enough of a reason to use the device over an iPhone, and the secure network is needed for this security feature to be fully there.BlackBerry should focus on an updated keyboard Bold device with higher quality materials, bring back the track pad/back button (this simple ommission prevented many exisitng Bold users from switching to the Q10, plus worries about the company going out of business), customization of alerts, incredible email/Outlook Exchange functionality, good desktop software, a great music player and camera, and the best phone/voicemail set-up you can buy, and long battery life, plus, BlackBerry should have its own in-house programmers writing BB10 applications for the most used Android/Apple apps (or, just drop BB10 now and move quickly to Android - I hear this might be happening soon).  They should also bring back the simple docking/charging station which worked so well with the older Bolds.  This type of device might win back users focused on productivity who have left the platform, as then BlackBerry would offer something meaningfully different than the current available offerings, and it would be of interest to the few existing BlackBerry customers that are looking to upgrade.I hope the best for BlackBerry, as I liked a lot about my old Bold device.  Perhaps the company can  a way to build a new device aimed around the corporate user that provides the busy executive handling over 100 emails per day the most useful communication tool possible.

I have been so pleasantly surprised by this phone. It blows my mind how quickly I can navigate between opening a new app, getting to an already open app, my email, texts, etc. I love swiping quickly between the screens, truly innovative. The camera is great, I understand it has a feature where it captures a few seconds before and after the photo is taken and this can be used in case the subject blinks etc. The browser speed blows my iphone out of the water. I also love how the url/search box is on the bottom of the phone, compared to the top on the iphone. Many times with my old phone in google I had problems with trying to re-type in the search bar and the keyboard would push the search bar out of screen. I have no issues with battery life as was one of my initial concerns with the phone. Seems to be holding up great. The keyboard is absolutely amazing with the new feature that can finish the word for you by making a small swipe up. Another concern I had with the phone was the apps available; however, I spoke with netflix this morning and the representative reported that they are currently working on developing an app for blackberry, so this is great news. I think in the next upcoming weeks we will be seeing thousands more apps becoming available as the phone grows in popularity.

Al-tough the competing platforms were eye candy but a huge a let down when it comes to productivity - namely email (unified inbox), key boards, notifications, multi-tasking and finer nitty gritties that Blackberry is known for (example : bedside mode, message compression, attach photos in email with lowered resolution on the fly, exceptional reception, security etc). Last 2 years for me was painfull since I have been patiently waiting for BB10 that was promised eye-candyness of other platforms combined with productivity features of good-ole Blackberries. Here comes the release and BB10 doesn't disappoint.The size, weight and tactile feel of the BlackBerry Z10 is a win for BlackBerry's designers and in an era where every smartphone vendor seems to be going towards bigger and bigger screens in an attempt to provide differentiation, the Z10 is perfect for single-handed use.The Z10 seemed to me to offer up crisper images than the other S3 and Iphone 5. Maybe that is because the Z10 tops the other two at 356 pixels per inch (ppi), compared to 306 ppi for the Galaxy S III and 326 ppi for the iPhone 5.Z10 has an 8-megapixel rear camera; however, the Z10 boasts a 2-megapixel front-facing camera , while the iPhone 5's camera is rated at 1.2 megapixels and the Galaxy S III's at 1.9 megapixels. All three have fast processors, with both the Z10 and Galaxy S III running the 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4. The iPhone 5 runs the Apple A6 processor. All three support LTE and up to 802.11n Wi-Fi.The Z10 offers NFC for file sharing and mobile payments, something the Galaxy S III also includes (but not the iPhone 5).BlackBerry Z10 is more than a piece of hardware - it has BB10 operating system that offers various services that add value to the overall user experience. Some of the cool Z10 features by BlackBerry are Story Maker, Remember, Balance, Hub and voice control and we would like to take a moment to discuss them as they add to the overall experience tremendously.The Hub acts as the single point for you to check all your updates, like new Facebook notifications, tweets, emails, LinkedIn messages, SMSs etc. If you want to open it, you just have to keep swiping towards the left of the screen till you cross the first menu page and task switcher. It is very easy to navigate and gives you options like posting new messages, emails and social network updates, depending on the service you are working on in the Hub.BlackBerry Balance is a feature aimed at corporate users who want to keep their work and personal lives separate - on their phone. It allows users to store apps and data on two distinct profiles - Work and Personal. Users can easily switch between the two profiles and users who bring their device to office can easily format the Work profile when they switch jobs without having to change any setting in the personal one.Call Quality is exceptionally good with HD voice and reception is better than Iphone 5 or Galaxy S3. Battery has improved by 30% after the first OS update (it better than S3 and more or less same as Iphone 5)", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone... its the best smartphone I have ever owned...", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "R8RIFIUDC4SDR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazingly fast OS.... most responsive screen.

If it saves me three minutes a day due to faster typing, true multitasking, more integrated apps, that comes out to over a thousand minutes a year.

Some international countries are the 100-2 and 100-1.  Be careful of the 100-1 as this is a 3g phone model only and does not come with the Snapdragon processor.  Do not buy from any vendor until you have asked them which one they sell.  All the vendors are listed under the other \"NEW\" phones to buy.

I really wanted to support Blackberry, but this phone just doesn't do it for me.  Let me note the below may be user error, but some just don't point to the great phone I thought I was getting. I am returning for the following issues:1) Battery life is poor - If I don't use it much for calls it easily makes it through the day and night.  However, on three straight days where I needed to be on the phone straight for 90+ minutes, the phone died and shut off as soon within 30 minutes of usage2) No zoom feature.  You can't pinch the screen and make it larger to read texts, etc.  Yes, you can adjust the font, but this doesn't help me for when I have glasses on or don't.3) The voice recognition is nothing short of dismal.  I have a very flat Midwestern accent. The phone constantly misses easy words and there is no way to correct other than delete the entire string and start over again.4) Where is the on/off for GPS?  It is always on.5) There are not enough of the apps available for this phone as I had on my last Android which I need for work6) I tried to load music to the phone a number of times.  It shows the music, but will not play7) Everything takes more than one step.  For example, to send a text you must open phone, slide over to texts, slide open texts, hit button to create text, go to contacts to find person, select person.  This contrasts with one click on android and start to input name and it pops up.  Everything is two to three extra steps.  Very frustrating8) You can't delete just one text message in a string, but you must delete every text message in a string or none.  This makes no sense to me as you may only want one message gone and not the entire string.9) The phone came with a Blackberry charger, clearly marked Blackberry.  Yet every time I plug it in a message pops up telling me to use the original charger or it will take longer to charge?  But I am using the original Blackberry charger!10) Turning of WiFi calling was nothing but a nightmare.  Every time I entered a WiFi area a notification popped up telling me to initiate WiFi calling.  Very annoying until I spent an hour online to figure out how to disable this feature.11) I saved this for last and for the second time.  The voice recognition is nothing short of terrible.  It simply doesn't work with any kind of reliability and is very frustrating.I am sad to have to return the phone as I really wanted to support Blackberry.

I was set against I-phone because I feel it's not for me, and against BlackBerry as I felt an air of arrogance from the company and their users. I chose the Nexus 4. The experience at first was great (probably because it was my first smartphone).Then the minor bugs popped up, like freezes requiring re-boots and an inability to see many webpages. I changed to the Chrome browser, and still the same problem. I chalked it up to the fact this is a small computer, and thus won't have the same functionality. Then the power button began to stop working. Re-setting became a nightmare, and I had to remove my case and remove the battery to re-start. It was a massive hassle, and what started as having to do this only about 2-3 per week became 4-5 times daily. I checked online and saw it's a common problem. Whenever Chrome went to a website with flash, the entire phone would freeze. My frustration boiled over.I decided to take the plunge with the Z-10 and take advantage of the 2-week return policy. This phone is a revolution. It has almost all the functionality of a laptop computer. Things I've noticed so far:(1) The browsing is extremely smooth and fast. Videos play on websites. The browser will even alert me if a website uses flash extensively, and if I want to turn flash on for this particular site.(2) I am shocked Google and Apple did not figure out swiping earlier. It is intuitive, and lets me do multiple things on my phone. When I use my wife's Nexus 4 (which she is desperate to part with), I have to control my movements and remember there is a home button. It's like a right hander trying to write with the left hand. Same type of awkwardness.(3) Small things make this phone wonderful. The weather app displays a colour to match the weather of the day (which is important in Vancouver), the alarm clock is easy to set, linking with my laptop is easy, sending out an e-mail with the HUB (and the ability to choose from multiple accounts) is very handy etc.(4) The HUB itself is a very intuitive creation, and I am not surprised it was not thought of earlier. Having all my e-mails and messages in one area and the ability to \"peek\" at them without terminating what I am already doing on the phone is awesome.(5) The camera is superb. The time-shift mode is for more than just closed eyes. Timed correctly, it lets you take multiple shots of a moving object and choose the one you like best. We've gotten some amazing shots of our little guy on the swing with this. The latest software update added HDR capability to it.(6) I've never had a hard keyboard on a phone, so I cannot compare. I can also only compare to the Android and iOS keyboard. The Z-10 keyboard is light years ahead of the previous two. The responsiveness is leagues ahead, the accuracy is incomparable and the predictive text feature is scary. I find myself writing longer texts and e-mails in a fraction of the time. I am actually swiping more than typing.(7) The battery life is far superior to the Nexus I had. Without heavy use my battery is lasting upwards of 36+ hours. Heavy use means I am charging every night when I head to bed. Not bad!(8) No rebooting. At all. This has been a big relief for my blood pressure.(9) There was a lack of apps when I started, but more seems to be coming online. I've recently seen Skype and SoundHound available (among others). From what I've read, the apps are coming and coming fast.I would suggest you try the phone out. I believe most carriers have a return policy within a certain time.

I have had it for about 2 weeks now, and realized I really love this phone.I have been an Android user for the last few years.  I left my old blackberry behind because it just felt old and outdated.  I enjoyed android, but it was always a little buggy.  I had to restart the phone every day or two or it would get laggy.The Z10 is fast and responsive.  It works great.  I haven't taken the time to really get to know the keyboard, but I do notice that it fixes more of my mistakes than the Android keyboard did.  I can just type haphazardly away and then when I go back and read my message, most of the time it is 100% accurate.I also use voice controls quite a bit, and for the most part it works very well.  I would like to see more features in the future, but it does all the things I really need it to do.I had serious battery drain issues at first, but I made 3 tweaks and now I get through the day without dipping below about 60% battery life:1. Settings - Network Connections - Mobile Networks.  Changed Network Technology to LTE instead of Global.2. Settings - Display.  Allow Gestures when locked to OFF.  This is a tradeoff because it's pretty cool to just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to wake up the phone.  But I don't mind pushing the on button instead.  This is supposed to save a little battery life.3. Settings - Security and Privacy - Encryption.  OFF.  I read somewhere that this helps the battery life.  I don't know how important it is to have the encryption.  Maybe I should turn it back on.  But I'm not really that important, and after doing all 3 of these things, I am getting great battery life.My wife is not a techy person, she just wants her stuff to work.  I was a little worried that she wouldn't like the phone, but so far she is really liking it.  She would like Pinterest and Instagram apps.  Not currently available, so that is a bummer.We both went in with the attitude that we had 14 days to try them out, so we would send them back if we didn't like them.  Well, we like these phones.

And at today's prices it is practically a steal!The Z10 is built around a new mobile operating system, BB10.  It is unlike any previous BlackBerry OS, but maintains the productivity focus BlackBerry users demand, while adding exciting full-touch and entertainment value like other popular \"glass slab\" mobile devices we've come to love.I won't go into the many things I love about my Z10.  Other reviewers have covered it well enough.  But, after using my Z10 for the past 6 months, I would like to add a few points of my own:1) BB10 It is not a wholesale Android or iOS rip-off.  It is also very different from the track-pad interface-oriented OS of earlier BlackBerry devices.  So, it will take some time to get use to some of the interface \"quirks\".  Of course, BB10 borrows many common intuitive touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom.  But adds some unique and useful gestures, like multi-finger swipe on the keypad for multi-word delete (Yes, the BB10 touch keypad is probably the best).  The important gestures that quickly become intuitive are \"peek\" and \"flick\".  Personally, I have come to miss them when I use my Android devices.2) Android Apps can be side-loaded to BB10 devices.  As of BB10 10.1, This feature is still being refined, but it promises to become a forefront feature early next year when BB10 10.2.1 is officially released.  (BB10 developers have access to this release today!)  The key here is that you have access to the broad base of Android Apps without compromising the security and productivity focused features that BB10 offers.  You'll be hearing more about this before long.As much as reviewers complain about the \"lack\" of BlackBerry Apps, many popular Android apps have been ported to BB10.  Although less numerous than iOS or Android, the native BB10 apps are really nicely put together and BB10 developers are very \"hungry\" trying to make BB10 users happy.  (They know there is an opportunity for growth as the BB10 user base grows.)3) Mobile carrier technical support personnel are not very familiar with the new BlackBerry BB10 operation system.  And they have little incentive to change.  So, you will have to rely on online user groups (CrackBerryDOTcom and N4BBdotCOM are good starting places.)  Unfortunately, getting support form BlackBerry directly is \"challenging\" since they will request that you first try working with your carrier... (I think this is one of BlackBerry's weaknesses right now... carriers have more incentive to support Android and iOS, but BlackBerry won't even try to \"go it alone\" as far as tech support.(Maybe they can't for legal/contractual reasons.))4) Many corporate IT personnel are not familiar with BB10 and how it is different from previous BlackBerry OS versions.  Ironically, if they use an older version of BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), they may not even think your BB10 device can access corporate email without upgrading to BES 10.  But, rest assured, if Android and iOS devices can access corporate \"push\" email, so can BB10.  This is because BB10 BlackBerry devices no longer require the BES for corporate email.  Instead, BB10 devices now use the same ActiveSync technology used for Android (and iOS) devices.  My experience was with my employer's Lotus Notes system and the setup procedure was practically the same as for Android.  (I found a great how-to write-up online.)  So don't let confused (or ill-informed) IT personnel to discourage you from getting the most from the Z10.5) This is no longer a problem, but it is worth mentioning.  Since new owners may run into this too.  There have been 3rd party radio firmware problems on some phones.  As a result, many of us (myself included) experienced random reboots with my Z10 (AT&T; STL100-3) while AT&T; was powerless to fix it.  I am very happy to report, that this problem is now fixed with BB10 release 10.1.  So, if/when you get your phone, be sure to check for updates.  (Updating software is pretty easy once they are available through the carrier.  There are ways to install secure and stable \"leaked\" versions (i.e. developer releases)  But, it is not recommended for those who are not technically savvy.)The bottom line is that in the Z10 BlackBerry demonstrates a promising and exciting mobile software platform with a solid hardware platform.  If you loved BlackBerry devices in the past, but moved to newer full-touch devices for modern experience, I think it is worth trying the new BB10 devices.  (Especially now when carriers are practically giving them away.)", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever purchased. Period!", "Author": "Chin Chilla", "ReviewID": "R3E6Q51ZNJXKFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't for the life of me understand why Blackberry has struggled so much and can't seem to sell these BB Z10 phones, taking a write down of almost $1 Billion on this phone in particular. I LOVE my Z10! It's lightning fast with the Snapdragon processor; the HUB is FANTASTIC! It's like my personal assistant in a virtual office, alerting me when texts, e-mails and anything else of importance need my immediate attention. I've synced all my e-mails to the phone, I added my Twitter account, linkedIn, etc. and that beautiful red light (the one EVERY BB owner knows about and loves to see blinking) tells me when the phone must be picked up. Screen size is great for watching movies but I must say, there's a learning curve in understanding how this phone works, with it's swipe ups and downs, sideways swipes and getting a feel for how it all meshes together. People have gotten lazy and want their phones to be simple. Some of us are cerebral enough that we want a challenging phone to intrigue us. If you don't have time to learn how your phone works, then don't buy the Z10. I for one have no problem with using my God-given brains. They atrophy quite fast when not in use, you know? :)Phone has enough apps to make me happy for now. I'll be good to go when they add native apps for Amazon videos, Netflix, Hulu and Dramafever. I'm not CRAZY about apps that want to know every darn bit of information about you including your blood type, last person you dated and the size of your knickers. The Z10 allows you to put a bloody leash on these apps and deny them access to your location, serial and pin number and God-knows what else. Seriously, when an app is ostensibly \"FREE\", it really ain't if they're accessing all your personal information to mine for nefarious purposes. Okay, enough of my rant on apps. Needless to say, I keep my apps to a bare minimum and will delete any that demand to know my location, identifying information and pin # in order to work. That's why I hate whatsapp so much, even as I'm forced to use it. On the BB Z10, I'm able to put a muzzle on whatsapp's nosiness and still make it work. Couldn't do it on my last BB phone 'cos whatsapp refused to work until I gave up my whole resume.Back to the phone. Did I mention that I love it? Yes indeedy! I'm not interested in EVER purchasing a phone whose battery can't be removed by the end user. That's why you'll NEVER see me with an iPhone or the new BB Z30. Why Blackberry??? Who came up with that bright idea to make the battery on the Z30 non-removable? I'm seriously pissed about that; and bummed! Which reminds me, the Z10's battery life needs some  improvement. With the way I'm using it, my phone needs to be charged 2x a day but not for long thank God. I know the apps drain battery life but this area of the Z10 can be improved upon.The virtual keyboard is excellent! Very intuitive! It remembers what I type, including weird names and surnames and immediately proffers it again when I type another time. It has the Dropbox app already on the phone and I've synced it. Which means I have access to massive amounts of my Jazz and Classical music that I can use as ring tones any time and change at whim. I also purchased a 64 GB storage disk from Sandisk, B009QZH6JS (don't forget to have the Z10 re-format it or it won't work because of its capacity)so this baby has 80 GB of free rein (the 16 GB the phone comes with plus my extra 64). I do believe I have enough room to last me quite a while, no?Peeps, did you know that the US Defense Information System Agency (DISA) has given both the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10 the Authority to Operate (ATO) on the Department of Defense (DoD) networks, making BlackBerry the first Mobile Device Management (MDM) to obtain an ATO? Think about it when your phone gets hacked into, or you hear about all the other phones used by celebrities that routinely get hacked into. They all need BB phones; evidently. By the way, the phone comes with NFC technology, and y'all know it's a neat feature. Well ... I've turned that sucker off on my phone. I'm not interested in any persons unknown gaining access to my phone's contents by just placing a device next to it in a crowded public place and surreptitiously downloading stuff. A bit paranoid, I can hear someone saying? Yep, that's why I'm a Crackberry user, FOR LIFE! In fact, I'm thinking of purchasing more BB phones to add to my arsenal. I feel there are elements at work dedicated to the downfall of Blackberry, all because of the security features it offers to regular folks, not just those in power. Y'all think I'm crazy right? Pray for me! This move by the DISA is a great display of just how secure BlackBerry 10 devices are and a huge move by the DoD.I tell you, technology is a beautiful thing, and when it's firmly ensconced in a phone as capable as this one is, I for one, am a happy camper.

But I read about how several governments were already adopting the Z10 as the only phone secure enough for their use. I heard about how a police agency in Georgia uses blackberry OS for it's police paperwork and database access.Sounded well vouched for to me, and I wasn't wrong.As an android user who really only wanted a phone with a calendar, my first concern was google calendar. My answer is yes, it can and does currently sync *witout problems* to my Z10. It wasn't as easy as other calendars, but all it required was manually putting in Google's settings for CalDAV and a few tries and Voila! I can read and write to my google calendar easy as pie. Or cake.Now I was told as I was buying the phone \"I hope you're ready for all the gesture based interactions!\"...All modern mobile devices use some form of swiping to get you places in the phone. The Z10 just uses them better. Swipeing to use the BlackBerry hub is awesome, and it works just as well as other similar social agregators I've seen on android phones. Also, being able to peak at the unread items in the hub while using an app is plenty cool. It doesn't say who's a text is from, or what facebook activity just occured, but you know it happened. Worse comes to worst, just play with the tutorials like I did until you understand how to use the gestures. Remember, always RTFM.I don't like using a million and one apps. I use my phone as a phone, calendar, and quick look up device. That being said, there are stil many quality apps on the BB market, but not to the levels that iOS and Android have. I have unfortunately run into one or two apps that need trouble shooting, but that just needs some time.The hardware is sweet. It has yet to freeze up on me even when running 4 or 5 apps at once. I haven't tried stress testing it, but when I was running a graphics intensive game, it did get pretty warm with no drop in performance. The camera takes photos that look great, or just as good as any iPhone photo I've seen. Video is just as nice.Now, I do have a few issues with it.My first problem was with the password protection. No recovery options. 10/10 tries are used up, the phone shreds all it's contents. I *really* should have remembered my password. Lost some nice photos of a train derailment.I don't use all of BlackBerry specific communications methods (BBM, BBM video, PIN messaging), because I don't anyone with a blackberry. Simple, and not really an issue.It appears blackberry Balence (a system that allows two different home screens, one work, one personal that can be password protected) can only be activated via a blackberry server and not by a single, at home, user. I don't need it, but it would be nice to have the option.All the default ringtones sound the same. Seriously. They are all 1,2, or 3 \"ding\" tones with varying pitches. You can easily pick any audio file as a ring tone, txt tone, or e-mail tone, but as it stands, I never know what kind of message just showed up on my phone. This is after a month of use.The cost. This phone appears to be a very much like the best iPhones out the, but with no web browsing issues, more business oriented, and more security. So given all that the price is comparable, but my phone was $531 new from T-Mobile. Damn. That's like...two phones.All in all the Z10 is awesome.

My husband has had the BlackBerry Bold, Curve and others and they have been great phones.  I got my first one in late March and its now August and I'm now on phone #3.  My first one last until mid-May when it completely quit working and I was told that it was a \"software glitch\" and that they would send me another one.  My 2nd phone worked until the first of August and then when I took it back to T-Mobile, I was told that my \"Operating System crashed\".  So, I'm now on phone #3 and wondering how long it will last.  When you pay $500 for a phone, it should last more than 2 months.  The battery drains quickly even when the phone is not being used.  I have to charge mine several times a day because of this.  Sometimes my phone will be sitting right next to me and my voice mail will light up.  I got a call, but it never rang and it happened when I was waiting for a call back for a job interview over the phone.  The choice of app's are OK, but not nearly the selection as the iPhone.  I love Angry Birds and only have access to the free Angry Birds Star Wars and the paid version of Space.  The Z10 and the iPhone were released by T-Mobile on the same day and now I regret not going with the iPhone.  If my 3rd phone quits working, I'm going with the iPhone.Update: My 3rd BlackBerry Z10 quit working......after 20 days. I had it on the charger because it was getting to where I would have to charge it twice a day and the battery would drain when I wasn't even using it. The phone was working, I took it off the charger and it went dead. I took everything back to T-Mobile and they weren't able to get the phone to start up and they told me that because this was my 3rd time I could choose any phone....and I went with the iPhone5 and I love it.

Although Consumer Cellular is reluctant to confirm that Blackberrys work on their system, AT&T; does offer Blackberry phones.  The Z10 uses the OS 10.2. operating system, different from earlier Blackberry phones, and so, can be fully functional on a network like that of Consumer Cellular - as my two are.However, not all Z10s are the same even if they are the same model and advertised as \"unlocked\".  One must be very careful to chose a version that will work on the network they intend to use.The first Z10 I bought through Amazon worked perfectly and was fully functional.  The second, which was the same model, did not.  That phone did not allow the APN to be set and saved and, therefore, mobile data service was not available although everything else worked fine.  I returned that initial second purchase and Amazon was very, very accommodating and replaced it with the Z10 from Tradewind.  That one also works perfectly.Amazon seems to feature specific seller each day.  But, when clicked on, that listing also shows what other sellers also have a Z10.  If information is not available on the Amazon  listing for a seller as to which network the Z10 is manufactured for, then I suggest you email the seller as I did.

It's locked own OS and locked own features have caused people later on to create the android OS which is much more free and less constrained by rules of the manufacturer, allowing people to customize it greatly and and manufacturers to create unique devices that would differ greatly from company to company but allow it to be all under once flag, the android flag.Obviously, being the free and open minded person I opted android, where I found freedom to be plenty. Custom roms, rooting, and other features lured me into an android world full of possibilities.I slowly watched as my 8 month old android phone become archaic and urged myself to go forth and by the newest and best android phones every 6 months, becoming a victim of this intelligent marketing scheme. With each newest phone offering the best specs, the best software, and best hardware quality I was eager to treat myself with such.Oh but then I saw through this. I realized that with each newest phone upgrade, the differences between the past models were unnoticeable based on speed. Galaxy S3 versus S4, no one would notice the difference between the speed. Oh, but you can say you have those nifty benchmark speeds, which would greatly be able to see the difference through digits. Oh, but I say in return, those numbers don't mean squat, since the hardware difference will always be too small to noticeably feel it with each next concurrent model of the android phone. Thus, by telling yourself the phone will be faster based on just a benchmark score would be like me judging a book by its cover. It's not enough to have a accurate assumption, and may fall to give one a misguided perception.Then I realized, optimization is key to a fast phone. What does optimization mean? Well first look into the computing aspects of a phone. There is two sides, software and hardware. Just because you have the latest hardware, doesn't mean your phone would be the fastest. Just because your benchmark score is super high, doesn't mean your phone performance will be. What is just as important if not more is the software side of things. Android is supposed to run on hundreds of different phones from different companies, thus, the software is not optimized as compared to a company that codes its own OS in relation to its own hardware. Wait, wait, wait a sec, isn't that what BLACKBERRY and APPLE do? Yes quite certainly, thus, you can see how apple phones and blackberry phones last MUCH longer than those \"premium\" android handsets since there is too much competition among android phone makers, who try to pump the best every 6 months only to forget and leave in the dust it's older phones.But companies like blackberry and apple only create one line of products, which they control the OS to. Thus, they are more careful about the full utilization of software for its hardware, unlike android.Thus, with this phone, I realized how fast it is, even with its one year old dated hardware, it still runs as fast as the newest android phone, because the company cares and has complete control over it's OS, so that it can be optimized the high extent. Can android phones be opitimized as much as a blackberry? No, it is such a broadly used OS, it will never be able to.Now to the actual OS, this phone is flying with speed. It has the core functions of a phone: calling, texting, email and social media all integrated into the OS. They call it the hub, I see it as genius. It is simply where you will be spending most of your time in regardes to communication, which is only 2 swipes away from any screen. This makes checking anything amazingly easy and fast. You can install android apps, which closes pretty much the \"app gap\" people compain about. It has the screen you expect from a high end device as well.All the little things, like the alarm app, compass app, and other default apps are beautifully and smartly designed. They seem to be designed in a way so that you would actually see yourself using them, unlike android where every default app made by samsung is crap and I always turn to 3rd party apps from the store to take care of that. Not Blackberry, everything I need is in the phone by default, since so much care was put into those default apps.Is this phone less constrained by rules than android? No, blackberry made security important feature, thus it is not as open as android. But, it is more open and less rule governed than the IOS, where you can't even view your phone as a USB Device without the use of a 3rd party software.Transferring files? I will never need my USB cable again. How you must scream! Easy, all I did was set up blackberry link on my PC and I have access to my blackberry as a \"networked hard drive\" whenever it's connected to the internet. Damn, that's nifty blackberry. Oh sure, you might say, well android can do that, but I would say, still though, you would only be able to do that through 3rd party apps. I can do that by default on my device. Why should I care? Well for one, I know it's a secured and reliable way, I don't need to depend on a third party company, I only need to depend on blackberry to make the best out of my phone.Smart phone that actually thinks the way you would. Seriously, they should make that their logo if they can because the major thing I noticed about this phone is how much it makes sense logically.Minor gripe, the battery life will last you 6 hours on heavy use and 10 hours on moderate use.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R21Z2E7GH9A7D2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So with all the quality luxury car brands out there, why did I choose Tesla for the analogy? Like the new Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, Tesla arrives at it's luxury and overall driving experience by cleverly blending innovation with simplicity and efficiency. And, Tesla is a newer luxury car brand that is (for now anyway) serving a niche audience and trying desperately to catch on with the masses amidst more established brands. And unfortunately, consumers who choose to overlook Tesla because it is not established are missing out on something that is simply better.The new Blackberry 10 operating system is so good that OUT OF THE BOX it is a complete system ready to be enjoyed and ready for productivity. Try doing that with an Android phone. My Android phone has Kit Kat (the latest os) and it took me weeks of downloading and trying out various apps to get the phone to perform to my satisfaction and to do what this one does right out of the box. I mean lets be honest here, let's cut to the chase- when your phone's operating system along with it's native apps will not perform correctly or lacks certain important features, and you go to Google Play for an app that will do it better, what you are in a sense doing is downloading a patch. Go to your Android or IOS settings menu and call up the list of downloaded apps... that's right... your phone is FULL of os patches. The new Blackberry 10 is clearly the superior root operating system when compared to IOS or Android.When it comes to contact management, SMS, the dialer, email, file system management, keyboard, web browsing, voice recording, notifications, photo management - there is no need for improvement with aftermarket apps. So please, don't reply to this review with comparisons of the size of Blackberry's app store vs. google's and apple's. I get it.So let's go beyond the reliability of Blackberry's new and innovative operating system and discuss some specifics about this Z10 phone that I love. I want to start with 'The Hub' because a phone is primarily a device for communications, right? Well then, what a great idea it would be to have any and all communications - you name it, tweets, texts, voice mails, call logs, facebook updates, IM's, emails, whatever you want - centrally located and \"peekable\" (for lack of a better term) with a simple swipe. Introducing The Hub. Regardless of what the phone happens to be in the middle of doing, a short swipe up from the bottom gives an initial peek of simple icons (with counter) indicating the type and number of new communications you have received. Now continue the swipe slightly to the right and the screen will slide to reveal yet a further peek for more specifics as to who, what and when. Now finish the swipe right if you want to actually open up and interact with The Hub. Very nice! The Hub is agile and customizable. One of my favorite customizations is the pinch function for each type of communication portal in the hub. What this does is give you an alternative view consisting of only messages that meet your customized parameters. For example, lets say that for my gmail account I want my alt view to be only sent messages and also only those I sent to coworkers. When I go to the hub and open gmail I see everything. But if I pinch, everything literally starts squishing down until, poof, all disappears except for only those messages I've sent, and sent only to coworkers. And keep in mind that The Hub is not merely a gateway where you go to launch say an SMS app or a browser or app that gets you to your facebook account...all messaging is done right there. Very impressive.Next up is the neat settings menu and it's customizability. When you call up the settings menu you will always have access to ALL the settings (wi-fi, bluetooth, accounts, sound settings, flashlight, battery monitor, device monitor, airplane mode, brightness/white balance and display, apps, alarms and notifications, voice control settings, security, etc.) because right at the top of the list will always be the button called, well, \"Settings\". But I like how right on that initial settings page you can customize which settings functions will appear. It's like a quick links page.Next up, battery life - This phone comes with an 1800 mAh battery (removable!!) and for some reason the battery life on this phone consistently blows away that of my other phone which has a 2200 mAh battery. I can't really explain this. My only theory is that because this is such a \"young\" operating system, and one which was specifically designed in conjunction with the Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, it is an extremely streamlined system without any bloat and extraneous or redundant processing going on in the background. But admittedly that's just guessing.This phone has no \"home screen\" per se, which is awesome. This is because of Blackberry's focus on multitasking, productivity and simplicity. You do not have to keep tapping the Home button or the recent app button in order to proceed on to another application that you want to use. Instead, when you are done using an application just flick up from the bottom of the screen and it closes, gets pinned to the wallpaper, and turns into a widget-like live tile (for example, if you were on twitter the little tile would continue to show you your latest twitter feeds). You can have up to 8 tiles (4 on a screen) before the system begins to sequentially turn them off as others go onto the wall, and they can be turned off manually as well. To view all applications just swipe left.The operation of new Blackberry phones is very dependent on getting the swiping gestures down. It can be tricky at first but once you learn it, the phone is a real treat to use and is very interesting, intuitive and user friendly. The screen quality and resolution is stunning to look at, the phone itself is well built, exudes quality and is handsome looking. I am very psyched to have discovered the Blackberry Z10 as well as it's fantastic operating system.

(That was sort of a BB pun...) This is the BBZ10 STL100-3, with 4G ready and the QualComm Snapdragon S4 Plus dual-core 1.5Ghz Processor.Battery life:If I *had* to complain this is where I would do it. The battery life is not legendary. It's about what you would expect from a smartphone. I charge it everyday and it works the whole day but don't expect much more than that. In this day and age where every smartphone has multi-core processors, 5 different radios, push email etc. I think a whole day's worth of battery life is what you can expect. If you're answering emails all day or gaming or surfing the web, battery life will suffer but you can always buy an extended pack, one of the accessories BlackBerry sells.Call quality:Call quality is fantastic. The new 10.2 software upgrade comes with natural sound technology. And I have to say that it sounds superb. Voices are full and rich. This phone has also never dropped a call in the 6 months I've had it. (The iPhone has dropped at least 3.) Video call quality is also good. The front facing cameraExperience:The swipe interface is amazing. Whoever said that it has a \"steep learning curve\" is obviously a moron. There's only three gestures that you ever have to use and if you can't handle that then maybe a touchscreen phone isn't for you anyway. Programs are fast and responsive and it's NEVER frozen. I have also never rebooted the phone because its gotten slow or lagged. I've never used the Mini-HDMI output so I have nothing to say there.Email:As the original push-service email device, the BlackBerry still holds ground as the best workhorse phone for email. My BlackBerry gets email faster than my computer EVERY TIME. With Priority Hub on the new 10.2 OS, the phone also learns which contacts and conversations are important (read: not ads) and pushes them up to the top of the Hub so you get your important emails quickly.Storage:You can use the device as a NAS through an encrypted WiFi connection. This is STANDARD and integrated on the BBZ10 platform. It seemlessly integrates with several cloud based services too including Box, DropBox and Skydrive. It also accepts a 64Gb Micro-SDXC card so its tough to run out of space too.Build quality:The phone is well built, feels hefty and substantial but isn't heavy and is EXTREMELY thin (.36 inches to be exact).Display:The display is clear and beautiful and with a 356 ppi resolution, it's sharper than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also 4.2 inches diagonal where the iPhone is only 4 inches. But I mean...some people say size doesn't matter.Overall:This is really a fantastic phone. I've run phones with Android and tested iPhones (dark days) before and I think that the BlackBerry really gets down to what you use a phone for. Messaging, taking and placing phone calls, updating social networks, email and browsing the web while your girlfriend is shopping for clothes. It's not app-hungry, which could be a downside to some users. But for the most part it does the job, does it well, is fast, responsive, looks and feels like it means business, keeps you connected and lasts all day, take a look at the BlackBerry Z10.

I like this phone, no doubt; I'm not so much into millions apps, i'm more on the productivity side. No surprise except the model STL100-1, which is the 3G  only model. No big deal because 4G is NOT coming to the country where it is used now anytime soon...You will be frustrated if you are used to the android system (I used to have a galaxy nexus) because the only google support is synchronizing of e-mail / calendar /contacts, yes there is a a crippled Google talk and nice Youtube but need \"built for blackberry\" version. Not bad but sometimes, google video chat is convenient too for communication. Other google products suck as keep or google search are still missing.Here are some of the apps that came with it:  Docs to Go , File Manager, Print to Go Adobe reader, Remember (Evernote), Dropbox,  I added Camera Scanner, SIP.fm a very nice SIP app, NYTimes, The guardian, Sky scanner, Google Talk, Tube Map, The guardian, TuneIn radio, Skype...The battery life is OK, just slightly better that say my Galaxy nexus. Charging every couple days in normal use and everyday in heavy use. It has a better reception than my galaxy nexus for sure...I like the fact that the battery is user replaceable, and I think NFC is not on the battery but rather on the battery cover which is better in term of cost if you want additional battery.I like the BB OS 10, there are still lots of room for improvement (Hub on wake up screen for instance) but I do like the more professional side of it.

I tested the Z10 and Q10 before it was even launched and after a few days my android phone feels outdated.. Blackerry 10 was strange for a hour but it was so good and easy to work and  handeling an android phone seems odd to use so I bought the blackberry 10 OS which i like because it give me the same feeling when i used the first time android 1.6. in android i saw the future but these days BB10 with 10.2 in front is beyond android/ios but you must feel and see it.Good things I like to use is playing mp3 by wifi 2 my surround blueray player or watch photo's/movies i made on my tv and also with wifi. I also like the wificonnection with my computer so that i can easily send and mp3 album to my phone. I love the keyboard the most because typing in English, dutch and Deutsch is soeasy that it almost know what i want to write. The HUB where all your sociale media and mail traffic comes in one place where you can reply is the best and better than on windows 8.

Why? Smartphone marketing is a brutal battlefield, and I kind of want to smack BB's marketing department upside the head for not getting the word out properly on the astounding awesomeness of this phone.***And yes, make sure you're buying the correct model. I have the STL 100-2, 100-3, or 100-4. I have 100-3.***I'm going to start from the beginning with the actual user experience and tell you what this phone does.I will also say I bought this phone from my carrier with admittedly serious doubts about whether it would be worth my money or if I should go back to another platform.The most important feature of the BB10 Operating System is the Hub.The Hub is a consolidated communications center. Add your email account(s), Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn(if you use that), and Evernote accounts. Now everything you use is all in one place. Calendar is integrated too. It's awesome. Go into the hub. Tap \"compose.\" Choose your weapon - from any of the above mentioned accounts you added, and including text messages, etc. Pick your recipient(s). Type message using the awesome keyboard (which I'll cover later). Tap send.Done. No BS, just direct and easy messaging.I will warn you that FB defaults to importing everything like birthdays. I didn't like that, some people might. You can edit all that for each account you add.In an app like the full FB app? Need to do something in the Hub? Swipe up from the bottom bezel area to mid-screen, then to the right. You're in the hub. No hunting for messages, use the excellent search function. No switching between email and Twitter to find something, it's all right there. The app you were in stays open and running until you close it.Want to see only texts or emails or whatever? Tap \"Hub\" in the lower left or swipe to the right again, and pick the account you want to view. Done.Here's where it gets really interesting and important: when you are using a native \"app\" or a 3rd party one with Hub integration, things get really easy. Say you're surfing the web. You find an interesting web site you want to show your friend. What do you do? Tap the browser menu, tap \"share,\" and pick your method (text, email, etc.) and recipient. BAM. Done.Just took an awesome photo? Same process... which also allows you to upload it to Facebook, etc.Sharing of your own files, photos etc. gets even cooler though. When working with a file on your phone (photo, a doc you typed, etc.), from the file browser (or direct photo browser if you prefer), you can Share via ANY account you have added (Twitter, FB, email, etc., as well as Bluetooth, add it to BB Remember, or the best: NFC. NFC is awesome and quicker, or at least I think so. Touch your NFC enabled phones together. File Transfers. Done.Which brings us to the \"File Manager.\"What *can't* you do with this?? Nothing I've found so far. Move files (including between device and Micro SD Card), copy, rename, delete files, share files via the above outlined process (easy-peasy). ZIP Files into Archives for goodness sake. Unzip archives. Send said Archives via chosen method. Switch between \"list\" view and \"tiles\" view, whatever you prefer. Search. Sort. Browse. Whatever you want.Want Cloud backup? Integrated Dropbox. You can even tell Dropbox NOT to use the mobile network if you're concerned about data usage. Same for \"Box.\" Holy cloud storage, batman!Active Frames: Basically, when you open an app, it stays open and live until you close it. Swipe right (to go to the left of your main/home screen), and they'll be there, hanging out and being awesome. Re-maximise it by tapping, or tap the \"x\" in the lower right hand corner of the app / frame to close. Done.Contacts: if your contacts are on a web email account, once you add the account, they will get imported. Got a few accounts? Adding Facebook? Worried about duplicates? Easy. My Z10 took care of merging most of them for me, but missed a few mostly because of my friends' propensity to use wacky names on Facebook. What do you do? Link them. Tap the contact, tap \"Link,\" tap \"add Link,\" select the right contact to \"Link\" (merge), and they get merged. No BS, no nonsense, it just gets done. You can apply the reverse process if you want to unlink contacts.Add multiple email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, all of your designation (home, work, other, etc).Set a specific ringtone to the person - but not just a ringtone; vibrate, LED, emails from that contact... all customizable. All from one place.Looking at that contact? Want to know what they've been up to? Tap \"Activity\" in their Contacts entry. Any and all activity from your phone relating to that person - emails, texts, phone calls, appointments from your calendar that list that person... all listed right there.Calendar: Pretty straight forward... or is it??Choose your view: Day, Week, Month. Search your calendar by name of event \"subject,\" attendees/participants, locations, and even notes you put on the appointment.My personal favourite view is \"Month.\" Why? The day you tap on shows your schedule... and here's where it gets cool: the busier you are on that day, the bigger the date number gets. Seriously. You will know at a glance just how busy you are, and of course your specific appointments are listed right there too.Keyboard: I was very leery of going back to a touchscreen keyboard. Boy was I wrong.This phone learns how you type. Seriously. If you say, keep hitting the \"v\" when you meant to hit \"b\", it will learn that. Heat sensors study where you tend to tap on the keyboard. The predictive text is not only an awesome approach but it is eerily smart. While typing, words will pop up on the keyboard. Type in the letter \"Y,\" and above the \"O\" key will be the word \"you.\" flick the word up towards the message. Basically, it draws logical conclusions based on language AND your personal language usage habits to determine that if the next letter you want is \"e,\" this is likely the word you want. It gets smarter with more usage.Notifications / Ringtones: set profiles AND set separate tones for phone, email (each account), texts, etc. etc. Awesome.Camera: Rear facing 8mp with flash and 1080px 30fps vido, and other fancy stuff. Front facing is 2MP. Just go read the specs.The camera rules. No, I have not done extensive, multiple light level testing. What I have done is taken loads of photos of my friends and my dog, and even some nature scenery. I love it. Timeshift is really cool, it's not just a \"burst\" mode, it's more. Go watch a video, this review is long enough as it is.The screen of your BB10 has an unobtrusive permanent \"bar\" at the bottom that has Phone, Search, and Camera. Right there. No flicking around to find the \"app.\"You can drag the focus to anywhere in the frame you want. You can set flash to off, auto, or on. You can choose the Scene mode (auto, night, etc.). The two things I find to be the best? You tap *anywhere* on the screen to take the photo, and the photo you just took is sitting in the lower left corner. Drag it up to \"peek\" at it to see if you got the shot you want, or tap on it to open the photo and access the editing/sharing capabilities.Photo editing and capabilities: Share photos as outlined above. Set as wallpaper. Edit photo with the built in photo editing suite which includes:Transform: resize, rotate, free resize or rotate, mirror, and crop with a handy perfect square shape option and predefined standard ratios;Enhance: Auto, remove red eye, brightness, white balance, contrast, sharpness, hue saturation, and noise reduction;Artistic: B&W;, Lomo, Antique, Sepia, Whiteboard, Watercolor, Negative, and SketchStyles: Beautify or \"Big Eyes\" (for detectable faces), \"Sixties\" (as in retro look), Grain, Aged Photo (looks like an aged photo taped into an album), Film Strip, Halftone (like an aged postcard), and Cartoon.Don't like what you just did? Tap the menu and hit \"Undo _____\" (one step undo available), or \"Revert to Original.\" Or just Cancel the edit outright.Like what you just did? Save it. It will automatically save a copy so you don't have to worry about screwing up the original.Like it enough to share it? Share it in the above outlined method.If you got in here via the Camera, just tap on the back to Camera.StoryMaker: looks awesome. I haven't used it yet. Maybe I'll make one to torture the in-laws at the Holidays. Basically, you pick photos and or videos and music, and it mashes them all together in a pleasing manner - and you can edit specifics too.Browser: Nice and snappy. Built in sharing. Downloads are a breeze, and you select the destination folder and name right off the bat. Open links in new tabs. Copy link address. Share a page by just tapping \"Share.\" \"Save Link As\" if you need to download something from  poorly coded websites. On that note, I have to say: if you find a website that doesn't work nicely, talk to the website. BB10 is FULLY HTML5 compliant. If the coders for the site you're looking at can't figure out how to be compliant with a worldwide standard, that's their fault.Bookmarks are managed via tags. I actually like that better than folders, but that's my opinion.Full Flash support. There is a YouTube app on the phone, but frankly it's kind of redundant what with the full Flash Support. Just go to the YouTube website. You're good.Security: Everyone has probably heard that not only has BlackBerry historically been the top for security. This is still true. I could launch into techno speak as to why, but I'll spare you that. For the daily home user, know this:You will have expected options like locking your phone with a password... or not. It's up to you. Set your default screen timeout as well as \"lock\" timeout.You have BlackBerry Protect built in. Lose your phone? Someone stole it? log on to BB Protect via the web and choose your path: Make your phone ring loudly and a lot. Make it display a message. Track it with the built in GPS. Worst case scenario: wipe it.BlackBerry Balance: if you're a Sysadmin, this is built for you. An employee will have two completely separate and compartmentalised profiles. One for work, where you can control anything you want, and when they go home at the end of the day, they log in to their personal profile and can use any apps they want look at adult websites for all you care.There is no crossover. None. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Company data stays where it belongs, and personal use does too.From your Home Screen, swipe down from the top to: Turn Bluetooth and WiFi on or off, lock/unlock screen rotation, access your alarm clock, bring up your notifications profile (normal, silent, etc.), or bring up the full settings interface.Organize your apps however you want. Make folders. Swipe to the right to see your active frames, and again from there to get to Hub (or as always, from anywhere you can swipe up to the middle then right to get to Hub).Maps: It just works. GPS. Voice Guidance. Avoid Highways, Toll Roads, etc. etc. Voice Search. It works nicely. I'm happy.Voice Control: Built in Voice Control to: make a call, send email, BBM, text, schedule an appointment, update FB Status, Tweet, LinkedIn... seriously please just go to the BlackBerry site and watch the videos. I will say it's not at 100% capabilities I had hoped for, mostly that it won't just tell me the weather. BUT, I have done all sorts of stuff with it (texting, email, searching, etc). Hold down the \"mute\" button on the right side of the device to activate voice control. Is it as good as the competitors? Maybe not, but darned close - and will presumably keep getting better.Screen/Display/Video quality. Gorgeous. Enough said.Battery Life: there were a lot of complaints when Z10 first came out. They may have been valid. 10.1 OS update fixed that, and I got the phone after that. I will say: when you install an app, go to \"Notifications\" then \"Other Apps\" in your Main Settings and make sure the darn app isn't constantly polling for updates. Just turn the stupid notifications off, unless you really really want it. Mine is set to only notify for FB and BB World. Also, this will not affect the Hub, so don't worry about turning notifications off.Secondly, when you get your phone, kill the battery fully then do a full recharge. This is standard for any phone. The battery has been sitting in a box for you don't know how long - days, months... just do this. It will help.Call quality. Excellent. No complaints. When you are on a call, if you take the phone away from your ear the and call screen automatically comes up so you can bring up the dial pad or tap for speaker phone. Speaker phone is really nice sound quality.***Bedside Mode and Alarm Clock*** If you are not a previous BB user, you may not know \"Bedside Mode.\" Here's what you do when you go to bed: Bring up the clock either from the home screen app icon, or drag down the top menu from home screen and tap alarm(either works). Set your alarm - if you chose the analog clock, just drag the little blue button around the clock. Digital clock: tap where the alarm is displayed. Set accordingly. Then drag down from top bezel and tap Bedside Mode.-OR- if your phone is locked, just drag down from the top. You will automatically be in the Clock and Bedside Mode is automatically engaged.Bedside means all alerts are off. You can opt to have phone calls come through if you want (say if you're on call or something).Apps: I knew you were going to ask. To be completely honest, there isn't an app that I need/want that isn't available. I know, I know.... some of you want App X or App Y. Well, if it's that important to you, stick with another platform. Or... tell the App X to develop a BB10 app. Simple. BB10 apps are developed with programming languages any programmer worth their salt would know. So.... what's the problem?All in all, I'm actually really amazed.... that even with being a techno junkie I didn't know about even half of the awesome features of this phone that actually make a huge difference for day to day user experience... and...I love this phone. Love. Want to marry it. Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G (ok not that part). LOVE IT.Questions? Ask me. I'll try to get to them as time permits.Just try it. Seriously.

This vendor is selling the Verizon version (RFF91LW). None of the Verizon phones are considered 'Factory Unlocked', since they are locked to Verizon by Blackberry at the time of manufacture. Therefore, any RFF91LW that is unlocked cannot accurately be claimed to be 'Factory Unlocked'. It would have to be unlocked by a 3rd Party.  Next, and perhaps most important, the Verizon version is the 'Tri-band' RFF91LW and does not include the HSPA (UMTS 4 band) 1700 frequency, like its 'Quad-band' counterpart the RFK121LW.  The only performance distinction between these models is that if you use the RFF91LW  on T-Mobile in a non-4G LTE area, you will be unable to achieve 3G performance and the phone will drop to 2G performance levels. If the phone is used in a T-mobile 4G LTE service area, there would be no performance difference at all (in the U.S.; performance on some Canadian carriers may vary). When you order a Z10 directly from Blackberry, they offer only the RFK121LW and is available for about the same price from a variety of sources.

Having used RIM/BBRY devices side by side with iOS devices for years, can say that there is more of a learning curve with the Z10 and BB10 OS, but I still prefer BB10 OS/Z10 as my main communication tool, strongly prefer to iOS. Main benefits of the Z10 are Hub, which pulls all incoming communications into one spot (you can see, delete from multiple accounts, eg email, Twitter, LinkedIn, text, voice mail, Microsoft 365, update notifications for updated apps, calls in/out, etc) without having to press a button for different apps; intuitive typing is light years ahead of iOS (including iOS7, which I installed yesterday); multitasking far easier with swipes not constantly pressing home button. A few weeks ago my Z10 needed to be exchanged and I returned to iOS as primary communication tool. It worked, but far, far happier with restored Z10 back in hand.Z10 and BBRY far short on apps, however.If communication is not primary tool for phone, and apps are a major interest, then iOS likely the better choice for you despite having to use home button to switch apps and other limitations. Having > 150 apps, I can say apps are nice, ultimately only a few truly used with great frequency. For many these few convenience apps are worth iOS limitations (virtual keyboard, app switching, etc). The new iOS has an updated look, but difference is stylistic, not a major functional change.  Whether one upgrades for fingerprint scanner for security is personal choice/convenience issues, as one can still type in a security code to access device. Only major improvement I can see in iOS7 thus far, and truly helpful, is that one can open more than 8 browser windows at a time. A disadvantage of iOS7 is that folders are now limited to 9 apps before one has to page through to second screen; on Z10 each folder will hold 16 apps.If communication using multiple different accounts (as noted above) are important and you don't like switching from app to app, then Z10 is better option. Uncertainty of company's direction is unsettling. Personally I avoid Android due to malware risk.Much talk about BBRY going way of Palm. As a former Palm user, I gave up on device as lagging and no longer useful long before it bottomed.

I tested Iphone 4 and 5, and some Samsung Galaxy and Motorola Razr devices, but none of them really liked me.I had to admit that I do not like the Samsung quality and the sensation of this phone in my hands. For my humble point of view, I never get friendly with the Android's interface. Among the many cell phones that I used, I always missed the Palm Treo, your rock solid design, and GUI.I work like a patent engineering in electric field. I spent many hours per week researching tech info, so to make up my mind, I did a research and I came across that this BB could be a very good option besides many negatives reviews.Virtual keyboard:I really hesitate to replace because I love the Torch's keyboard, but after few hours of use the Z10, the virtual keyboard I realize that the virtual keyboard it's outstanding. The predictive option it is very good. It helps so much because predicts the following word in mostly cases. I do not consider the BB Q10 (it has a physical keyboard) because I was looking for a bigger screen.Battery life:I read in a post that if I run an app and closed it after used it, the battery life improve, because this background task was killed. I did it and I get more than 14 hs.Made Quality:It has been well designed and constructed, the size it is very good, and I have the sensation that I have a very good piece of engineering in my hand, not a toy.Ecosystem:Many apps that I use it weren't developed to BB already, but after downloaded the Amazon App, I could installed and run it like a breeze.BB gesture:It's taking a time to get familiar with, but after this it's so easy to use it.BB OS 10:I really like the stability, until now after installed almost 20 apps, the Z10 never hang it or showed weird error's'pop up sign.BB Hub.It is a simple but very effective app that concentrates the main incomings notification that the user received. It's very useful and very addictive.BB headphones:Far away in terms of quality from the previous top models. There are fair but not outstanding. I missed the noise cancelling ear silicone.Quality of In/Out calls:I really impressed because sometimes I have to set the volume down to get more comfort. I can talk and listen without any problem.Copy and paste:In the BB Torch, it was a nightmare to do it every time I need it. In OS 10, BB Engineers solved this issue and it's simple and intuitive as it has to be.Cradle:I really missed the BB Torch's cradle to charge it and use the cell phone like a clock. Actually BB does not design anyone. Thirds party suppliers offer some option but I did not buy anyone of this.Holster:It comes with anyone. I had to buy to protect it.Camera:.I am a photo enthusiast, using everyday a DSLR, so any cell phone never gives me what I looking for. It is fair for occasional photos.GUI (Graphical user interface)It's clean with very good icon's design. It is possible to make folders and gathers icons.HDMI mini port:I hadn't tried this yet. I don't have the cable. It's possible to hooking up a cable and broadcast any movie from the BB to the TV.Update:After 3 weeks of using it, one morning at home I went to my bathroom and absent mindedly I dropped the cell phone into the toilet. Few seconds before I took a piss. I took it out immediately, took the battery out, cleaned it and put it 24 hs into rice. After this I dissembled and cleaned all the circuits.

This is the second Z10 phone I've owned, since after 6 months of use from first release, the phone started acting up (random swiping on its own; activating apps on its own esp. the camera app and taking photos all by itself; touchscreen unresponsive; phone overheating). Went back to the same TMo store I bought it from where they made arrangements for UPS to deliver a replacement phone in 2 days in exchange for my defective phone.I didn't bother to see which model Z10 phone I originally owned, but my replacement phone is the STL100-3 with the latest 10.1.0.4200 OS release. I restored my backup file to this phone via BlackBerry Link Software with no problem. I have since obtained thru Amazon.com a 4500mah batt which allows it run 1 1/2 days (as opposed to the 1/2 day with the stock 1800mah batt).You can read the other reviews here how good/bad people's experiences with the Z10. To sum up it's been good for me. Malfunctioning 1st phone aside, one gripe I have is the Remember app and its voice recording feature which works more-or-less advertised, yet I don't completely trust. A few times after I've completed a recording, I've hit the \"Cancel\" button on the upper left-hand corner and lost said recording forever, without a prompt to tell me \"are you sure\" if I want to delete it. Another thing about the voice recording feature is that a couple of times, the app has failed to save the audio file properly that even the phone itself can't even recognize it as a playable file! I have since resorted back to using a good old tape recorder to record my lectures and interviews.I find the phone hard to hold to take a photo, since the entire LCD becomes the shutter button and too many times I've taken inadvertent shots by placing my fingers on the LCD. The quality of the photos is not up to par to even my 6 y/o Sony p/s digicam, even though both shoot at 8mp resolution (examining detail when images are zoomed in reveal the Z10 is inferior).The 4\" size of the Z10 is the perfect size for a handheld phone; 5+\" is unwieldy and looks positively ridiculous against my face when making a voice call.If you're an chronic app junkie, this phone is not for you. However there are more than enough useful apps to make this a perfectly usable phone.The phone UI is smooth, stable, unfancy, conservative; gets the job done. It's not glitzy or schmaltzy like an Android or Apple phone. It's a very adult, boring. If you like adult and boring, this phone is for you. This phone certainly is for me. I would suggest people try it out if given the opportunity. It just plain works and works very well. //", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "cool", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "RNXNZTZO4G1H6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is neat an classy, good size, works very good, want another one soon,thank you very much. will recommend it to others.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfaction Granted!", "Author": "Edgar Alvarez", "ReviewID": "REYPIEKG9V80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so far the device / phone has been everything I've expected, I'd would love to have everything in landscape view mode more easily.!", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Muy best phone", "Author": "Farid safady", "ReviewID": "RV041INASRDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "new things And fastwr to use it, ta theta begening its hard to use but when you know the way its so godo And stable", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "the best purchase in a cellphone", "Author": "John Church", "ReviewID": "R2C97WHFN2I9UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was delivered on time (for us.snail mail I had to meet the mail man at one of his stops. ) the phone is in excellent condition.

I am going to divide my review for two kinds of users - A) Gadget enthusiasts with minimal business usage and 2) Strictly heavy business users.Kind A) For gadget enthusiasts with minimal business usage: Overall rating 2/5Pros:AP1) It's something new and different than iOS and Android, and I know enthusiasts get quickly bored, so this may just serve to be your new little toy to fiddle with. (Hint - it won't last nearly as long as the other two mentions above) - 1 star gained.AP2) Excellent stock keyboard. The swipe-up feature on appearing words to complete them is irritating, but despite you like it or not, this will probably one of the best keyboards you'll ever find in a smartphone. I have an Android and I use SwiftKey since I can't stand Android's stock keyboard. Apple's keyboard is perfect for what it is, but iOS 7 introduced some delays switching between different keyboard layers, and I also find them a little too cramped on the phones. If typing is the most you do on your phone and you don't like Android and SwiftKey combo, Z10 is for you for this one feature alone. 1 star gained.Cons:AC1) No apps besides all regular stock apps, and a few social-media apps. This kind loves to try and tinker with new apps, play games, and overall, can't deal with a nearly-empty app store and bad ports. Remember, just because email and text messaging and other \"routine\" apps are well done, no phone today will gain a star. Not going above and beyond will certainly hurt. 1 star lost.AC2) Sluggish vertical scrolling, great horizontal scrolling. This is a 2013 release, and I cannot understand why overall speed cannot just be fast, and why vertical scroll is sluggish. This kind hates sluggishness! 1 star lost.AC3) Small size battery with no extended battery alternative available. Heavy usage would get you through probably 3/4th of a day. 1 star lost.Kind B) Heavy business users who seek minimal entertainment. Overall rating 4/5Pros:BP1) Same as AP2. 1 star gained.BP2) Email, call voice quality, LED notifications, typical BB ringtones, and profiles etc. are just like your good old Blackberry and they are still effortlessly great, and now on a full-size touch-screen and with nicer icons. All your settings are also there just like before and while there are a lot of them, the seasoned Blackberry user will become familiar in no time. 1 star gained.BP3) A much better apps and games store (Blackberry World) is here for the little enthusiast in you. Go ahead, experience what the rest of the world was playing back a couple of years, while you were breaking bricks for living. 1 star gained.BP4) Ever imagined 8 megapixels packed into a cell phone camera (albeit with a useless flash)? You will now never feel left out in parties, team events, and outings where you thought a little better camera wouldn't hurt. 1 star gained.Cons:BC1) Same as AC3). 1 star lost.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I belong to kind A, and I am returning Z10, and keeping my S3 despite its cons.

The hub keeps everything in one spot so that you can check messages of multiple accounts at a glance.

I used both iPhone and Android phones. My last phone was Nexus 4 which I really liked. I had fo d memories and BlackBerry Curve and bold. Bold 9000 was one of my fav phone of all time. I know there is 9900 but I am fine typing on a touch screen and I do prefer the larger displays now. I wanted to see what they with the new blackberry.I like the clean design. Reminds me of the iPhone 5 but I do wish they had better battery door. Plastic battery door now squeaks to pressure. Metal like the storms would have been nicer. I love the display. High resolution, good colors, and responsive. It has micro SD card slot and dedicated hdmi port next to the micro usb port which is a plus. It has a front facing camera unlike older blackberrys and good rear camera.Now for the software. I have mixed feeling about the New os. I like the hub where all the new info is gathered in one place. I like the the keyboard a lot.  It may actually be even better than the iPhone touch keyboard which is very good. I like swipe to wake which is different and neat. Still BlackBerry z10 has no navigation buttons whatsoever and uses gestures. It was a good try but still it's premature and not perfected. Swipe up is like a home button which is fine. But, swipe down is like a menu button whole in apps. I much rather it be notification pull down like iPhone or Android. I have to get out of an app to see new notifications. Also multi task has a dedicated page and acts as a home button. I don't like it. I rather it be a pull up like other os. Trying new things is good but gesture navigation sacrifices something that I miss dedicated buttons. Also BlackBerry could have taken gestures further with more gestures doing various tasks. Ipad uses multi finger gestures which is neat. BlackBerry tried to be too different needlessly.Lastly, biggest draw back for z10 is lack of apps. Smartphone is only as good as apps that enhances it's capability. Apple has literally apps for everything as do android and many for free. BlackBerry z10 has limited app support to say the least. No Netflix and other apps that I used often are not available in bb.Well, BlackBerry z10 is different. I like it but it doesn't feel as well refined. It's a good base to build upon and needs improvements. Also BlackBerry really needs to get app support. Almost makes me wish BlackBerry z10 would have been an android phone with blackberry overlay. Love the keyboard and the screen. Typing is best in the tradition of blackberry phones. Other areas need tweaks and adjustments. 3 stars only as of now.UPDATE:I learned that you can sideload (install downloaded android apk app files manually) android apps on Z10 without hacking or any modification the software.  Since then I successfully installed apps like Netflix and other Android apps that I missed on this phone.  The apps seem to work fine so far.  I have updated and gave 4 stars instead of initial 3 stars.

The way the OS swipes and moves around is simple and great. The speed is ok, not great, but not bad either.  The screen looks great, the weight & size are good, overall, I'm very pleased about this device! If you're at a company that requires blackberry, this is certainly the best option available and it's quite a large step up from previous options. That being said, the severe current lack of apps is probably enough of a buzzkill for a lot of people to steer clear.All I can hope is that additional apps come along.

James", "ReviewID": "R2ASIDTJ6ATY06", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a Blackberry Bold 9900 owner who just went from switching from to the Z10, to back to the 9900.The Z10 is beautiful phone, larger screen than an iPhone but not so huge that it's like walking around with a clunky, mini tv monitor.It's sleek, light weight and the screen resolution is beautiful. I really love the screen's UI.The virtual key pad is big and easy to use (I had far fewer typos using it than I did trying an iPhone).The gesturing on the phone takes some getting used to, because it's initially not intuitive (you definitely need to go online and read the manual), but one could master it easily and become quick enough with it over time.The Browser totally rocks compared to the OS 7 BlackBerrys and is probably faster than the iPhone.All of the reports that the phone constantly reboots, is just rubbish. The phone worked fine without any issues or hang-ups.But Blackberry seems to think that all anyone wants, is a phone for music, games and YouTube, because that's where it seems to end, if you own a BlackBerry primarily for business use.Gone from OS 10 are the features that are a legacy of BlackBerry and made BlackBerry popular with business owners.Out is the BlackBerry Desktop Software with the intelligent, adjustable feature, \"Selective Sync\".In is the BlackBerry Link with sync options only for iTunes, Photos, Video and Documents (that's apparently all of your Document Folder).No Calendar options and No Contact Options are shown.I had to speak with technical support on the phone for to find out how to sync those two and then there are two disappointing problems (for me) there.Calendar:Out is being able to sync an Outlook calendar from your PC or an iCal from  your Mac. Not being able to sync those to the phone, was standard with the 7 OS.In is copying your Calendar from your computer to the Cloud and pasting them into your Z10 Calendar from there.The ability to sync those calendars via the BlackBerry Link, \"wont be available until later this year\" (As told to me by a BlackBerry tech and reported in numerous forums).Contacts:Out is the intelligent organization of your contacts via categories (ex: Legal, Manufacturers, Dealers, Employees, Shipping, Friends, Family, etc.).In is your contact list being limited only to \"All\" or \"Favorites\".Speed Dialing:Out  is One touch speed dialing via single key pad assignment for frequently called phone numbers (ex: Key 2 for a supplier A, Key 3 for your Office, Key 8 for a Family member and so on.)In is: Gesturing to your Contact folder and scrolling down through All of your contacts or Scrolling to your Favorites (limited to 10) and scrolling through those and pressing on their name to call them.Unlike pressing a single key to make a call (as with your voice mail) neither of those options is something that you can do safely while driving.Phone Calls:Out is disconnecting on a call or dismissing a call while in any screen.In is gesturing back to the calling screen to disconnect or dismiss.Search:Out is universal search from the Home page.If none of the above bothers you, but you are a person who only likes to type on a hard key pad, then you should wait for the Q10.Unfortunately, if the use of BlackBerry's legacy features (as mentioned above) are more important to you for running your day to day business, than cropping photos and making videos, then neither phone will work for you at this time.And forget about visiting the BlackBerry forums or any other support group to get answers, you'll only be treated like an idiot and flamed by the BB employees that run them or post in them.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work outside of the USA as advertised", "Author": "Rodimiro E Garcia", "ReviewID": "R3GYHTZD6ZA0G5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this device and rushed it to my home before traveling out of the country.

BlackBerry users are fierce when it comes to any negativity. I understand, you love your phone. However, everyone should know what they're getting into when they're buying a phone. This is just one average users opinion, take it with a grain of salt and keep in mind all of the positive things along with the negatives when you're deciding to spend the next two years with a phone.I'll be comparing the Z10 with my experiences with the iPhone 5 and a few android phones. I'm a long time user of androids, and a new user of the iPhone. I had this phone for approximately a week before my trail period ended with Verizon and I could still exchange for another phone cheaply. If you have an extra $35 to decide if this phone is truly for you, I would definitely take that path. Ask your Carrier the conditions on trying out a new phone, and how long you can keep it before they charge you ANOTHER activation fee (if you keep it over a certain period of time and then exchange it, you'll be hit with two activation charges AND a restocking fee.)On too the review...I'll start with the negative first, so the positives don't seem so glamorous. Be aware I said negative, singular. It's a big negative for a lot of people and a deal breaker for me. As much as there is to love (as you've probably already read with the many positive reviews) there's really something that's detrimental to this phone: the app market. Many users have slightly dismissed this and people often don't give apps enough thought when choosing a phone. Mostly because they've always been there, and presumably, always will. This is especially true for a brand new BlackBerry user (such as myself and the group BlackBerry is targeting with this phone). Strongly consider how many apps you use. Nowadays, apps basically rule the phone. It's not so important any more the gigs of ram it has, or whether it's a quad processor or dual. If there are no apps to take advantage of hardware, it's basically a moot point. And honestly, there really aren't many apps that take advantage of the powerful system.There aren't many apps at all.One of the things that makes the iPhone so crazy popular are the apps. All apps are meticulously combed by Apple itself, and most apps are cheap, well made, and extremely useful. When a company decides to build an app, they instinctively choose Apple. Then comes an Android version. However, most major developers such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Skype, Spotify, Instagram, Hulu, smaller banks, and a lot of others have ignored BlackBerry. The thing is; it's incredibly easy to port an android app to the BlackBerry. You could even do it yourself, really, you can (albeit in a buggier state). Why haven't they? Honestly, I have no idea. It's a large user base they can take advantage of, it's bigger than Windows mobile. But what matters is they haven't, and some, such as Netflix, have already stated they have no interest in doing so. BlackBerry has announced they're negotiating with Skype to build an app. That was months ago. As I've already said, you could probably port a buggy version of Skype yourself. So what's taking a multibillion corporation so long to do it? Most likely, they have no real intention of making an app. If you, yourself, can do it, it would probably only take a day for ONE professional programmer to make a native BlackBerry app. They've had 4+ months.This was a huge, unforgivable deal for me. When the Verizon Rep. first told me there wasn't that many apps, I kind of shrugged, I thought maybe he was exaggerating and all the apps I wanted would be there, either that or I could live without them. However, when I received the phone it turned out I had a really hard time not having the apps I used every single day not there. Spotify, a music service I absolutely love, was not there. Netflix wasn't there, Skype wasn't there, Amazon wasn't there, YouTube wasn't there, Google Maps wasn't there (BlackBerry's version is okay - not great), my password safe wasn't there (you can't copy and paste into password fields anyways), and other smaller apps and games I really enjoyed weren't there either. The rep wasn't kidding. There really aren't that many apps. I decided, however, I have the phone so I might as well give it the good ol' college try and see what happens. Soon enough I found myself not being able to rely on my phone. All the things I used to do, I really couldn't do anymore. I felt like I was compromising all the time with it. In the end, I felt it was too much not to be able to use my phone like I wanted too, it simply wasn't worth it, and I wasn't about to wait indefinitely for developers to maybe, someday, kind of, develop an app for it. I'd tweet this as a huge first world problem - but there's no Twitter app to do that either.But, I understand there's people who don't use Spotify, Netflix, or any of the others I use daily. They might never have even thought to use them even if they were available. And to those people I say: this is the best phone on the market for you. It's really outstanding, seriously, it's phenomenal. There's so many things I did love about the phone. It's quick, it's smooth, the browser and keyboard is the top of it's class. Mutitasking is an absolute breeze and the phone is super intuitive. This is the ultimate business phone. But that's just it. It's the ultimate business phone, and in it's current state, leaves little room to do anything else other than productivity.However... if you're the type of person who uses even one of the apps I mentioned that aren't there, then you'll never be completely satisfied with this phone. I think everyone will love a lot of things about this phone, but when they learn they can't use the phone like they'd expect because of a lack of apps, they'll also learn to hate the phone.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not support 4G .", "Author": "Cheng L.", "ReviewID": "R2PQFBLGDWZZOM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It\u2018s a STL100-1 type.

Thats when everything went downhill for this historic company.I didnt want to doug on blackberry, but this phone just begs to be ridiculed. And my main disappointment here is the user interface. It simply could not be more annoying to open up each app without any ability to \"simply close it\". Blackberry went out of their way to break people's heads on this one. For example when using a calculator, once youre finished u must swipe upwards to turn it into a smaller little window,, and itll stay there to nag you until steam blows out your ears and u simply HAVE to press the  tiny little x to close it. There are no buttons like \"home\" \"back\" or \"apps\" to quickly change to different applications from any screen. So going from 1 app to another becomes a tedious chore that will drive you mad. But that's not all! Blackberry was kind enough to lock in their network settings feature, so even the unlocked versions you cannot easily change the APN for your particular carrier. Theres a whole process of doing it all through visiting some specific blackberry webpage. I could go on about how this phone does not even compare to the functionality of htc and motorola phones from way back in 2011, but its not even worth it. This company is done... and even if they continue trying, they will get wiped out like Sumatra.

But, it is not good for who came from another platform.", "Author": "Hassan", "ReviewID": "RZ4U8IN3EGRPS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, before I bought Z10 I have Galaxy S3, Iphone 4 and Nokia lumia 920.This phone is my first Blackberry phone. I just wanted to try BB and see what is the new BB10.In fact, Z10 has a nice design and stylish. Many people asked me about the type of this phone and many could not believe that this is a bb Phone because they used to see BB with physical keyboard.I liked it at the first days. I liked how the hub works and how my emails organised with my other accounts (like Facebook and Twitter).The typing on keyboard is awesome (you should watch it on youtube), The YouTube works even when the screen dims (this is really a great feature that is missing in all other platforms), so I can listen to the music that I easily find in YouTube and lock the screen. Also, Z10 has a great clear sound when I use my SAMSUNG headphone because the headphone that came with Z10 is terrible. Simply, the design, typing style, YouTube unique feature and the great sound were the best things that I experienced with this phone.Now, you might ask yourself why I gave this gadget just two stars with this good criteria.Okay, here is the bad part:-As I told you in the beginning, this is my first Blackberry device, I expected something much higher (woow). I bought it by $650, which extremely expensive for that phone.I started to experience many problems related to YouTube crashing and slow download, I compared the speed of music playing with my 3 other phones and all of them beat Z10.Whats app, which is recently ported to Blackberry World, works very bad. My friends text me and the text appears after few minutes (the same happened when I reply them), so I experiences delay in communication. The hub looks very nice but I used to hear my Lumia and Galaxy ringing when a new E-Mail received then after 30 minutes or more, I receive the same mail. I tried to reduce the time of synchronizing to the minimum limit (15 mins) but nothing has changed.The Camera is terrible and took very crappy images compared to Nokia Lumia 920 or even Galaxy S3. However, it is still better than the ones in Iphone 4.There is always wrong notification in the hub of new email or message or voice mail which is so confucing. I tried many times to erase the notifications or restart my phone, but nothing changed.The device heated many times when I play games on it and drain the battery quickly.Blackberry map or the navigator is non reliable with poor directions and slow road recalculation compared to the fantastic Google maps and the very best Nokia here.The worst part in Z10 is Blackberry world (Apps store) which is extremely awful. No Viber, no skype, no Instagram, no Mobile Voip, No Bank of America, Whats app that is recently being available for Z10 is very lame and not reliable, Very bad ring tones (just I wanted to replace the few and miserable native ringtones with new ones in the store, and I could not find good tones either), very old and obsolete games or apps. Most if not all Android ported apps works terribly on Z10 and I uninstall them after checking.Simply, the apps store is non-functional and useless. I used to take my galaxy S3 with me to make viber calls with my family and later dropped whats app from the Z10 and kept using it on the Galaxy S3.I had to give the Z10 at least 3 stars, but the very high price precluded me from doing this. The price should be not more than $350 for this mediocre phone.I gave Nokia Lumia 920 4 stars because of one problem that is related to  WP store, which is now much more mature than BB store and is keeping in progress. However Nokia's hardware is the best among every manufacturer and I amazed by the power of Lumia 920 and its great features. on the other hand, few features in Z10 amazed me compared to many bad problems in this phone.In conclusion, If you used to have, and kept using BB phones, go and buy this Z10. You will love it. Two of my friends, who are BB old users, bought this and adored it. It is a great idea to change your old Kia Rio with a new beautiful Honda Accord.If you are coming from Apple, Android, or Nokia WP, Please don't buy it. I don't think that you want to leave you Mercedes Benz CLS and jump to Honda Accord, or buy a new Accord with the same price that you paid for your Mercedes CLS.You would see a huge difference in the platform features, usage and performance. It is really boring and non-functional as the other three OS.I tried to be neutral and say the whole truth, and I'm ready if you have any question.Thank you..", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Skip this phone locked APN", "Author": "dl", "ReviewID": "R951VK9N04F8E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Avoid buying this phone if you need to use prepaid cards.

Besides blackberry employee are for sure very demoralize as they see their future dwindling and many maybe looking for other jobs. I was thinking talented employee's of blackberry many of them maybe leaving or looking for other job. So my friends and co-consumer BE WISE and save your hard earned monies. My belief is there will only be 3 major Smartphone OS in the future and they are Apple OS, ANDROID AND WINDOWS. So if you like your investment in technology and knowledge relevant in the future just concentrate on these 3 Smartphone OS and I am pretty sure your investment will not put to waste.Update 6/19/2013....Huge markdown at Costco looks like this device is not selling well...From the original upfront cost of $200 with contract, Costco is now offering this device at $50 with contract. is this a markdown of 150 dollars in just a period of less than 3 months in the US market.. sorry for those who bought this product and paid $200 with contract.Below is my original post:Tried this many times but the problem is there are very few good Apps for this blackberry new operating system, Most Apps are google apps emulated softwares design primarily for android so future updates and performance is an issue. Developers has anemic support for this new Blackberry operating system so I don't see future development of popular apps for this smartphone, I don't see any reason to spend so much money for a smartphone like BB10 if only you will use it for text messaging, voice and few apps. Some functionality are also buggy (With bugs), battery is not good enough to last if you browse a lot. Maybe be if they lower the price below $100 as compare to other smartphone with the same feature as this I may consider, I think paying more than $600 dollars for this phone is a waste of monies . Buyer beware cause this operating system may not last just like other new smartphone operating system without application developers support. Companies are starting pilot testing to convert from Blackberry to Iphone and Android smartphone so I think it is better to invest in the future and learn new technologies than stick with this new operating system that don't have support of major developers and popular tech companies like Microsoft, Netflix, facebook, google etc. Take note that if you buy this smartphone facebook, Netflix and other popular apps is not supporting and developing apps for this smartphone so you may regret spending a whooping $600 plus for smartphone like this.Buyer specially current user of blackberry should also realize that this new blackberry is totally different from the old blackberry phone they have before, this one has new operating system, functionality and features, so effort in learning how to use this is similar to learning how to use the much popular smartphone like iphone, android and even windows phone. Iphone, android and even windows are tested and with strong big hi-tech company support and application developers support, so why not spend your effort in learning popular and tested smartphone instead of spending so much money for this new blackberry smartphone that I for sure will be gone in the future. Without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system will be gone in next couple of years.I am updating this review for I already decided which smartphone I will buy please read:No blackberry home button. Many are complaining that Z10 Freezes a lot, especially when using AppsAs I am evaluating Smartphone cause I am planning to upgrade from my old iphone 3gs (almost 4 years old) I am evaluating Smartphone based in blackberry, iphone, android and windows 8. That is why due to hype about this device, I initially considering buying BB10 Z10 tried many times to test it and see its worth. My budget is between 500 to 800 dollars. As I am reading reviews, trying the product myself and even went to blackberry website about Z10 complaints well there is a lot of them mostly operating system, hardware and software related. One thing that's get my attention is the blackberry Z10 having no home screen button, this is important because since many of blackberry apps are not develop and optimize for its operating system but is originally for android if the apps freezes (Due to bugs or outdated software) there Is no way for a user to go back to the home screen but to reset the Z10. Since this is most likely to happen a lot of times as the apps really not optimize for new blackberry operating system resetting devises and waiting for it to boot is very stressing. The maps for Z10 is useless my wife has the old BB7 and she hated it, her company provides it so she has no choice, but this year her company is pilot testing iphone so maybe this year or next year they will convert. I think blackberry should lower the prize of Z10 to less than $100 for the consumer to get fair price since you can most likely use Z10 or Q10 for texting, instant messaging, voice and internet browsing. Close to $700 for Z10 is very expensive considering that you can buy old iphone and android phone with the same capability plus good ecosystem, good popular apps are available and gadgets integration for less than $100. Do you know that you can get iphone 4 and 4s for free if you sign a two year contract with the carrier? This is much better than paying $200 for Z10 with poor selection of apps, close to isolated ecosystem, face with a lot of bugs since it has the new operating system and softwares, dismal apps developers support etc. One more thing, this blackberry phone same as the old one is difficult to dispose cause you can't sell them or give it to your kids they will not accept it and you will end up throwing wasting monies, this may holds true with this Z10, no apps developers support, no big hi tech company backing/supporting it most likely this new operating system will be gone just like the others. My research is over and will buy the new iphone or Samsung galaxy S4. My son is more than willing to get my old iphone 3gs but I am thinking about just using my old iphone as navigational device with Magellan apps for iphone (take note many good apps for navigation is not available for blackberry). I am sharing my review and research so that others will not waste money buying expensive smartphone. For now I believe considering the future direction of modern technologies like good ecosystem, integration, device manufacturers support it is better to buy smartphone based in apple IOS, google android and Microsoft windows 8. Don't waste your hard earn monies buying other smartphone cause they may be gone in the future, if the price is less than $100 go ahead cause that is just like buying a regular good cellphone for texting and voice.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pouch in the phone kit is missing.....:(", "Author": "Soma", "ReviewID": "R33FBO0A5ISA6E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have spent a lot of money to buy this phone.When I unboxed the phone, I found pouch is missing....!I need to spend $20 to get the pouch again...Is there anyway I can get my pouch?", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$749.99", "Features": "BLACK Blackberry Z10 Unlocked 16GB Latest Model\n4.2\" Multitouch display - ~ 335pixel density\n8MP Camera - Autofucos, LED Flash, GEO-Tagging HDR\nBlackberry OS 10\n4G LTE - 3G - WiFi - Bluetooth", "Name": "Blackberry Z10 16gb Black Factory Unlocked Gsm", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nDWGd81VL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BC0WNUC"}}
