{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buy an external case, know exactly what you're buying - and what you're not...", "Author": "Sam I Am", "ReviewID": "R3M6HIROW2WO80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone 4 (regardless of your cell phone carrier) works best if it has a case. There was some issue with the iPhone 4 and the quality of the internal cell phone antenna. Without the case, I drop from full reception to only one bar. I had the same exact issues when I owned an unlocked iPhone 4 which I used with T-Mobile. So I highly recommend also purchasing an external case, to protect your phone as well as improve the cell phone signal.Definitely you need to understand what you're buying. This iPhone will not work on any wireless carrier other than Verizon. You can't take this phone and switch over to AT&T; or T-Mobile service, because they use a different cell phone technology than Verizon. A lot of the unhappy user reviews posted on Amazon for this product suggest to me that in many cases, the buyer just didn't understand what they were purchasing.Another problem may be with the prefilled Amazon product description. This is not technically an \"unlocked phone.\" An unlocked iPhone is one that will work on different cell phone carriers, so some people may have bought the phone relying on the word \"unlocked,\" which is completly inaccurate and misleading. This phone will only work on the Verizon network.There's no SIM card slot on the  Verizon iPhone, and by design, there's no memory card slot either. You'll have to live with the 8 GB (actually closer to 6 GB) of space available on the phone. I've kept my iPod for listening to music - my primary reason for buying this iPhone 4 was so I could use it as a phone.My final suggestion is this: anyone who buys this iPhone from Amazon should not wait to activate it with Verizon. Even if you've bought it as a gift, don't wait to make sure the phone works, because on the off-chance the phone was reported lost or stolen and deactivated by Verizon(a \"bad ESN\"), you will need to get in contact with Amazon right away so you can send the phone back for a refund. This is one of the advantages of buying directly from Amazon - you might pay more money but at least, if you buy from them (and not from one of their third-party sellers), you have Amazon customer service to watch your back. Just make sure you're buying the iPhone on a sale page that says \"fulfilled by Amazon.\"  This is the one you want, because at least you know Amazon will stand behind the purchase.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "my first ever foray into an  I phone and this one was wonderful", "Author": "fred pauer", "ReviewID": "R257FBOL3XSDXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was like new out of the box.

My dad said he was getting me a phone but, but he surprised me me with the White I phone 4-8GB. It was my dream phone. I like how it is white so it can go with almost every color of a case. I also like that I can have apps and music on my phone. I like it because if I get bored somewhere and I have my phone with me then I can just pull out my phone and play a game or listen to music. There is only one bad thing I can think of and that is that I only have 8 gigabytes so I can only have so much music and apps. You can change that though when you buy one.I recommend this I phone for someone who uses their phone a lot and is willing to pay for it each month. I recommend it for all ages.

I am actually typing his from a mac book pro right now.  However, this phone... this phone...  Where do I start.  I have had this phone for quiet some time now.  Yes, it looks sleek, however the screen is tiny and made from glass.  The back side of the phone is also a glass substitute.  This means that if you drop if (luckily i have not yet) it will crack the exterior of your phone.  Who on earth puts glass on a cell phone. But this is not even the most upsetting part, and maybe I should direct this anger and frustration more towards apple themselves.The still sell the apple iPhone 4 is select mobile retailers, however what they do not tell you is ios7 is NOT made for iPhone 4.  So when you download up/update your phone, the i phone 4 will run slower then it did before.I do not care what people think about the great aps (that were not made my apple themselves but other companies) when the phone force close you out of a app while you are trying to use it... it defeats the purpose.  This has happened of countless occasions.THE CHARGING PORT!The charging port is what I really wanted to get to.  Today when I woke up I noticed that my phone had not charged at all.  I have plugged it into the apple wall charger and the divide still read 3% this morning.  I tried taking it to an AT&T; store and was told that I needed to go to an apple store.  It was a 1.5 hour trip to the closest apple store.  Once I was there they told me \"This thing happens quiet a lot, however there is nothing we can do besides replace the device.  It seems like your warranty ran out last month, it will be $149.99 to get a almost new phone\"This is not something I did to the phone.  I did not drop it, get it wet, shove crap in the charging ports, why does this \"happen quiet frequently\"???  The apple employee did not know the answer to this.So if you are looking for a phone that looks cool but runs like a piece of crap then this is the phone for you.  I need to re-think the apple features (iCloud) and see if it is time to let this \"iPhone fad\" be over and get a phone that is actually dependable and not a total waste of money!!", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "looks good", "Author": "lee her", "ReviewID": "R34JAU8381W9SY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this i phone works perfect, i would refer this ti any one who like i phone, my daughter loves it", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "The Doctor1893", "ReviewID": "R20FCTVQNZ2AB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was a gift for my sister who broke her last iphone. she says it works well and does not have any problems.

The descriptions says it is refurbished but that they replaced basically everything like the screen, which seems like a great way to make sure the phone is actually like new. However, after the order shipped I tried to track it but theres no tracking number. I understand that some packages, per Amazons explanation, cant be tracked though I've never had an un-trackable item. This would be ok but seller hasnt responded to my multiple emails asking for the tracking information so I can be certain someone is here to accept the phone since I am very busy and I do not want it to be sent back. If the seller would respond to my email I will change my feedback back to 5 stars when I get my package and the seller contacts me.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "My Best Phone Yet!", "Author": "Dylan Morris", "ReviewID": "R1G0U7QD1JCCLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "iPhone has always been popular among texting fanatics and touchscreeners and it doesn't prove wrong with the iPhone 4 with iOS 7!!
