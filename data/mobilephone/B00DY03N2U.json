When your cell rings, you can answer it on the watch. The speaker on the watch is acceptable and loud enough to hear at most noisy places. You can set an alarm on the watch, it tells time, day and year as well. Otherwise it's basic and does what it says. Oh, the battery life on it is fantastic!

I was suprized that it projects enough volume to be heard in a normal background environment.  It is a hands-free speaker phone bluetooth worn on your wrist so that you do not need to dig into your pocket or backpack to answer incoming calls.  Other bluetooth wrist watches merely alert you to an incoming call, but you stil need to answer them with your phone.  This one allows you to answer the call, speak, and listen without fumbling around for your phone.  You actually speak into your watch, just like Dick Tracy.
