I should first disclose that I purchased it for basic use, to make calls and send the occasional text message.  I was lured by the description of \"rugged\", as this phone will be exposed to plenty of dirt, vibration, and I'm sure the occasional drop around the farm. (Which is why I only buy flip phones) So far, I really haven't fully tested the \"rugged\" feature!The biggest positive I've noticed is signal reception -- I live in an area where tower strength is pretty weak, yet this phone does a good job of hanging on to calls.On the downside, I don't find the control buttons very intuitive to use.  The manual that was sent with the phone by BlueTek was pretty lame, so I had to go online to download the manual from Motorola to teach me how to use some of the basic features.  I suppose had I owned a Motorola brand cell phone in the past, this might not have been such a problem for me.The side keys mostly just get in the way.  I really like them for volume control, but the music control key is perpetually being accidentally activated, as is the voice command button.  I'm quite accustomed to hearing \"Please say a command\" from my pocket.  I can lock the side keys, but it appears they unlock as soon as I open the phone and then stay unlocked, so you have to remember to relock them each time you use the phone.  I had a previous phone where I could set it to lock the side keys each time the flip was closed, which was MUCH more user friendly.The ringer volume cannot be set as loud as I would like, either. I often have a lot of background noise, and miss quite a few calls because I don't hear it ring.

The battery department is quite cheap and actually popped off the first time I dropped which I would not consider a strong quality for a rugged phone but it was also open at the time and hit a concrete floor which did no damage.My phone has a couple of quirks that it will often freeze for 10 to 15 seconds after hanging up, I think this is cause from the battery needing replacing, it is used and an older model phone after all.  The other quirk is that I can't use my speed dial if I hit a # and press send I get a strange recording, so I have to hit the # then view then send, not to big of a deal once I figured it out.

The phone would ring, but then when I tried to answer - they couldnt hear me. Fifth, the keyboard also wouldnt \"beep\" when I hit keys, no matter what setting I put it on. Sixth and the final straw was when it started calling the last person I called over and over and over. It called my girlfriend 49 times in less than an hour - at midnight when I was sleeping.

An adventure.  Not the worst phone I've ever tried, but overall a disappointment.1 - When I want to use the internet, about 15% of the time it locks/freezes.  I have to take the battery out and replace it 3 times or so to get it to reset.2 - The battery life is below average. The battery itself is doomed well within a year and needs to be replaced. Turns out it's because the charger was \"overcharging\" it, so I bought a new convservative charger for about $32, rather than use the one that the phone comes with. This seemed to alleviate the problem of burning through batteries.3 - For someone who texts or likes to take pictures or download ringtones, the memory space is completely inadequate.4 - Although it somehow qualifies as a \"rugged\" phone, the screen will still crack, it is not recessed enough nor rubberized, it's just a hard plastic shell.5 - The camera zoom is very blurry.6 - The internet apps are so poor, especially driving directions and the e-mail app that asks for you to re-enter my password three or four times, leading me to believe I was using the wrong password, even though I was not!7 - When I lose bars/service and a call is about to be dropped, I must end the call in order to call the person back. Then all of a sudden, the service is back up to 1 or 2 bars, as soon as I hang up.  If I completely lose signal, I get an audible alert and a \"call dropped\" message but when it is in 0 bars, I must manually hang up because the signal cannot be restored automatically (after passing through zero bars, there is no coming back), but there is no indication warning me that the call has been dropped already.8 - There have been no visible upgrades. Verizon does not actively support this phone.9 - If you e-mail yourself a ringtone to vzwpix.com, you can't set it as a ringtone. This way, verizon can keep monopolizing your ringtone purchases, you can't use third party services sufficiently.10- My replacement charger, one that was sold to me by verizon store purportedly to work with this phone, works okay for AC power but not for transferring data or charging via the USB port. You apparently need a special charger for that basic functionality. The phone does not have universal port nor any kind of commonly used adapter can go with this phone.
