It comes with the two batteries, earphones, and a cover case. Everything is nice and clear when you turn it on, but the camera quality is BAD! I love taking pictures and there is barely any flash and the pictures aren't as nearly clear and bright as the default pictures that come on the phone. So if you don't really take pictures, you will be fine. I haven't really used any other features yet. But I will do a follow up once I have.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This Cell Phone works with 3G -WCDMA & 2G -GSM networks\nAndroid 4.1 CPU /MTK6572 ROM \t1GB+ RAM 512MB\nBuild in GPS , Bluetooth ,Dual SIM Card Dual Standby\nGSM850/GSM900/DCS1800/PCS1900,WCDMA850/WCDMA2100\nResolution \t960 x 540 pixels /Dual Cameras, front camera 0.3MP, back camera 5.0MP", "Name": "Unlocked without Contract 5.0 Inch Dual Sim ram 512mb +rom 4 GB WIFI Bluetooth 3G WCDMA network Smartphone MTK6572 Dual Core 5.0mp back Camera Dual Camera Cellphone Android 4.1 Ice Cream Capacitive Touch Screen T-mobile Mobile GPS (White) by Purplelan C20", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Xg%2BsGuhQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FE9C4N8"}}
