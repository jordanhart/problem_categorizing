GreatCalls now uses the Verizon network. They were using Sprint when I first joined. I understand Verizon now has a healthy sized piece of GreatCall. But the service continues to be very good.I've been on the GreatCalls Jitterbug system for about 3 years now and have never once regretted the choice. I've never experienced connection problems, customer service difficulty, or any other problems worth mentioning.The phone, I have the original Jitterbug (that was replaced with the J). It is a bit heavy in the pocket but it's also rugged and durable. I even accidentally drove over it in my pickup. The phone continued to work well. Try that with one of these high tech smart phones!  After over 3 years, I am only now thinking about replacing the battery. A new battery will hold a charge for 90 hours. Mine is now down to 30-40 hours between charges. But it still works. The buttons are large enough for my fingers, the sound is good, and screen quite readable even with my bad eyes.The service has been outstanding. Something that can not be said for most telephone services. GreatCalls uses the Sprint network which has provided me good service even in the New Mexico desert, the Rockie Mountains, and even 30 miles off-shore. I'm a low phone user so 250 minutes lasts me a couple of months. No, the per-minute cost is not the best. But the total monthly cost is as good or better than most I've looked at.I'm not some young kid who needs or wants all the bells & whistles. But neither am I a senior citizen. I'm a middle aged man with no kids at home and who doesn't use my cell phone for business.  I don't need a camera, or internet connection, or an mp3 player. All I wanted was a phone. One that worked well. I got what I asked for at a good price.And no, I haven't been paid to write this review. But a good product/service should be given the credit it's due. If you want a mobile phone that is just a phone. That is good & reliable and you aren't a gabber for hundreds of minutes a week, Jitterbug is the phone for you.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use but not for the faint of hearing", "Author": "mphsangel", "ReviewID": "RKKADTV13RB2B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After hooking my 88 year old mom up with my phone provider and learning that she couldn't operate a regular cell phone I bought this one for her. Because there's no complicated fancy gadgets to deal with she can actually operate this one.  The big problem is she can't hear it ring. There are a couple of ring tones but the loudest one is a typical phone ring that sounds like the phone ringing on television so consequently she doesn't think to answer her cell phone.  My husband and I both have been in the room with no TV on and could barely hear it ringing. It's quite a bit lower than any regular cell phone. There is a vibration option however it's a very light vibration and there's not an option to combine a ring tone and vibration together like other cell phones.I called customer service and was told that this is a common complaint so that's why they offer the lanyard.The phones easy to use for making calls but even for good of hearing - it's a challenge to depend on.If we had figured out before the 30 days were up that the reason she didn't answer the phone was because she couldn't hear it ring, this thing would have gone back immediately.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Jitterbug phone and service", "Author": "Gnome D.

Nice, guize!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is not the perfect solution, but far better than nothing.", "Author": "Customer", "ReviewID": "R15AW30WGF8E6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The idea of the Jitterbug Phone for seniors is a great idea, but the product falls a bit short a few places. My mother never wanted a cell phone, EVER. A month ago she had congestive heart failure and ended up in the hospital for a few weeks. I live almost 1800 miles from her, so I flew right out and met my sisters there. I talked her into finally allowing me to get her a senior friendly phone, and the Jitterbug is the one that came to mind.  There was a retailer within a few miles of the hospital who sold the phones and I went to pick one up. After charging it and setting it all up for my mom I gave it to her the next day. She has had it a couple weeks now and I talk to her 3 to 5 times a day while she is at rehab and I feel I have a good idea of the ins and outs of the unit now.Let me start by saying that my mother is 85 years old. This was her FIRST EVER cell phone. Being the one on the other end of the calls, I have noted that the sound quality on my end when she uses it is a bit muffled. Not from her oxygen tubes in her nose, that makes her sound congested, but the quality of the voice over the phone. Even when my sister is there and she talks to me I get the same thing. The best I can describe it as is the voice is mixed in with a hum and muffled. Now my hearing is not the best, so perhaps it is me, but then again I can hear fine when talking to other people on their cell phones. So when I talk to my mother I have to press my phone (cell or house) on my ear and pay close attention.Next is the charger. Why they make such a thin plug for senior citizens is beyond me. My mom struggles to plug the charger into the phone and I am fearful that she will bend or break the plug. If Samsung were smart they would have used a simple round plug that was not super thin. There are a lot of older people who have a hard time seeing well and may have arthritis. So I am expecting I'll have to replace the charger soon, but we shall see.I decided to not opt for mom to have voicemail or call waiting on the unit. Again, she is 85 and would have found that too confusing. I simply needed a simple cell phone for her that worked and could be with her at the hospital, rehab and when she gets home (which is tomorrow).Beyond those points, I am not unhappy with the unit. It works, is small enough that my mom can place it in her purse or pocket and best is that it is simple. I noted other product feedbacks here with people complaining about its size, weight and that it looks like it came from the 80s. You need to realize a few things.1. The phone is designed to be simple to use. It has the basic number buttons, an on/off button,  speakerphone button, a YES button, a NO button and an up/down button. If you are buying this for yourself and you are not a senior citizen or you are a senior who is very familiar with cell phones then you should look at a higher end phone and stick to a major cell carrier.2. The phone is made a bit larger than the small flip phones available from the major carriers. Consider that seniors will find it easier to hold and the buttons are large for ease of use. This is intentional. (as for the comment claiming it was like a phone from the 80's. did that feedback person ever own a cell phone in the 80's? I did, those where either fixed into your car OR were big bags and huge by todays standards.)3. You can use the GreatCall provider to program the phonebook OR do it yourself. This is great since my mother would never figure that out. I had them set up 4 numbers initially, I added 3 later and if I decide I can have the provider add more later (I pay for her service).4. GreatCall (provider) offers some things like an available RN 24x7 and programmed into the phone and some other apps designed to help seniors (like medication reminders and wellness calls). Do these take care of my mother for me? No, but it is nice to know that if she wants to call a nurse she can, if I forget to remind her to take her meds they will and if I forget to check in on her one day they will do it for me and let me know of a problem.In the end the phone helps offer ME peace of mind as well as some for my mother. It is not a perfect phone or service, but it is a good start.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rates listed are wrong", "Author": "Terry Morris", "ReviewID": "R2DPXDVBIVEXUU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The monthly rate plans listed here are incorrect.

Haynes", "ReviewID": "R25M7IV5111IGJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Is a product like this needed? Yes. We do need items (like a cell phone) with simple, easy-to-use and easy-to-see functions. For that reason, the Jitterbug gets a star from me. But this product loses 4 stars because of the scam that is GreatCall (the only communications supplier for this phone). What happens when you no longer require the services of your activated Jitterbug phone? What if you want to wipe clean the memory and donate it? How do you do that?The answer is that you can NOT wipe your information off of this phone. Buyers (and sellers) of these phones: beware. According to the two reps I talked to at GreatCall, once your information is on this phone it is there permanently.When I no longer needed to have this phone for my father, I decided I would donate it to either soldiers overseas or to the local Council on Aging. I called GreatCall to deactivate the phone. First I was asked why I wanted to deactivate it and then I was grilled on what could have possibly been wrong with the service that I no longer wanted it. Then the representative tried to get me to keep the phone for a lower rate (and fewer minutes). After finally convincing the rep that I simply did not want the phone service, she tried to sell me other products that would \"keep my father safe\" (I didn't want to say that he had died; my reasons for discontinuing the service was none of her business). I waited until I received my final bill to make sure the service was indeed deactivated. Then I removed phone numbers from the phone book, but I could not figure out how to erase the incoming or outgoing mailboxes. Nor could I find a chip to remove. I spent two hours searching the web and reading the four booklets that came with the Jitterbug (Customer Agreement, Quick-Start Guide, Activation Guide, and How-To Guide: a total of 249 booklet pages) before I finally called GreatCall again. The rep at GreatCall claimed that the phone log and the phone number assigned to this phone could not be removed. I repeated to her that I wanted to donate the phone (in case she did not understand what I wanted), and she repeated that there was no way that the phone number nor the incoming/outgoing phone numbers could be erased.So I found myself stuck with a usable (and barely used) device that cannot be reused without compromising the phone numbers of family and friends. I hope some other electronics company designs a cell phone that's easy to use and easy to re-use.In the meanwhile, my significant other is in the backyard with a sledgehammer and a Jitterbug having the time of his life.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible service", "Author": "Gifter", "ReviewID": "R1JQAO4K5V459X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Two minutes of operation, months of dealing with charging and other problems from Day One.
