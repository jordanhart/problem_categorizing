This is a cute little phone, but it is not an Android phone. It comes with Bada, which is not compatible with most of my T-Mobile services. I could make and receive texts and phone calls, but I could not access the internet or GPS. There are no apps for facebook or email. I returned the phone and got a Samsung Galaxy Y instead, which works great.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AM36FAE"}}
