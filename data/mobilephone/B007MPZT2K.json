{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good unlocked gsm/3g feature phone", "Author": "chairman@en63", "ReviewID": "R3ODHWIMFQPHL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g  supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T; and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard.  The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY", "Author": "R.

The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone.  It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P  This phone is basically an update of the C-3.  It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing.  This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone.  If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed.  If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed.  Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing.  I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that.  It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them.  I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice.  Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small.  I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to.  If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Phone", "Author": "J2201987", "ReviewID": "RYKIMZS3B0ZZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Mike W", "ReviewID": "R18SKPCO3GLGW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just received the phone a few days ago.

After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A GOOD CELLPHONE", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R2644BQTLIPFZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT...", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could have been a good feature phone, but it has a fatal flaw.", "Author": "tallguy \"tallguy\"", "ReviewID": "R1WQAXGTFVPB7S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Preface:  This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone.  Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty.  I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue.  Now for the phone review.Pros:  The phone has a great keyboard.  If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard.  The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways.  The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color.  The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels.  For e-mail it's adequate.Cons:  I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone.  The onboard social network apps are not fully functional.  You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so.  The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them.  Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store.  The browser was mediocre, barely passable.  Also, NO GPS for this phone.  Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength.  That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone.  With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things.  The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card.  This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card.  Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and  constantly lose the signal.  So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card.  Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process.  It was WAY more frustration than it was worth.  It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential.  Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable.  I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place.  What a waste.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Fantastic, Simple Symbian S40 on Executive-Level Hardware!", "Author": "Kurt Schoen", "ReviewID": "R16Y9TBGAPF018", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update.  This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware.  The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan.  Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all.  Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting.  Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some.  I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia Asha 302", "Author": "marciah", "ReviewID": "R3LTYA9EIOHYPK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have always been a fan of Nokia phones.
