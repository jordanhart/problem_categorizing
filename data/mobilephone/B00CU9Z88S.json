It got great service, even on the north side of Denali where a significant portion of the southern sky was blocked by the mountain.However, you need to be prepared to approach using this as if you're signing a cell phone contract.  Despite having \"monthly\" and \"annual\" service plans, and the \"monthly\" plans would seem like a logical choice for someone looking to use the phones for a limited time each year - you need to be prepared to pay that \"monthly\" fee for every month for an entire year. Apparently the plan goes month-to-month after that, and it's not clear if once you go month-to-month and stop service, if you'll  have to sign another annual contract in order to start service again.  Mostly likely you will.  Because that'd be a great scam.Classic case of let the buyer beware. Because the phone works well, I can't give it just one star, but it can't get more than two because this emergency product is misleading/obfuscatory in their service plans.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality; poor service", "Author": "Allen Gwinn", "ReviewID": "RRTHCI6S1AIGS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Without going into history of their defective satellites, I had maintained a Globalstar (SPOT) phone for years in case the service improved. They just finished their \"second generation\" network and their phones are still virtually unusable. You get connected, then the call drops. Maybe after 4 or 5 times you'll be able to get a call to last for more than a minute or so. Bottom line: extremely unreliable and expensive. Finally gave up and nixed the service.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the Caribbean", "Author": "B-Rob35", "ReviewID": "R2I8BW7U2JO3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only used Spot in the Caribbean and have had great success with connection and time of connection.

This device just really provides a great degree of safety and peace of mind. If you are a global traveler or enjoy outdoor pursuits I would not leave home without one. Much of the world does not have any cell phone coverage including many areas of the USA and with this phone you will never be out of touch or be able to dial 911 for help.I highly recommend this gadget.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.95", "Features": "Battery Type Lithium Ion\nModem Capable NONE\nTalk Time 4 Hours\nWeight (oz) 7.05", "Name": "SPOT Global Sat Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xhw7G6h3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CU9Z88S"}}
