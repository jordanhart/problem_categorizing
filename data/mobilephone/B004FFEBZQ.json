While it does not have a Qwerty keyboard for texting, I am hoping that it is waterproof and can withstand the abuse from an active soon-to-be teenager who is a competitive swimmer and carries a phone in his pool bag to practice.  The built-in flashlight is a nice added feature and has already been put to good use.The phone appears to be very sturdy, but I am not sure whether the plug-in area for the charger is really waterproof.  The battery and sim card area does look waterproof.  The phone is compatible with AT&T; in the United States.  This saved us from having to purchase a new phone and phone plan from AT&T.;  We were able to purchase a sim card from AT&T; and have the phone operational in minutes.The phone is solid black as identified in the written description.  The red stripe on the illustration is not on the phone.  The company that sent the phone did so very quickly-- I did not pay for an upgrade in delivery.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "From Russia With Love?", "Author": "PeteCress", "ReviewID": "R1GXWDTFUM7SX9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am in the USA.Just took delivery on a Samsung B2100 from HassleFreeCell.The order summary says \"Samsung B2100 Unlocked Quad-Band Phone, Extreme Anti-Shock, Waterproof, Built-in Flashlight, Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black\".That being said: all printed materials are in Russian and the charger appears tb Euro standard (with the two round prongs).Somebody tossed in a purely-physical adapter but the phone gives no indication of charging even with the adapter.  Experimentation with another adapter - that up-converts voltage and works withe the phone - suggests that the supplied adapter is inadequate bco the voltage issue.Sent an email to their support address, got back the usual automated acknowledgement.  That was yesterday.EDIT: 2011 12-12-------------------Got an email response today (the first business day after my email)They acknowledged that sometimes the instructions books are in the wrong language and supplied a link to a download site.  They also offered to ship a U.S. charger at no cost.Based on this response, I would upgrade HassleFreeCell to four stars.After all, stuff happens, no matter who one is dealing with - and the real measure of service is what they do when stuff does happen.Good job guys!", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "b2100 phone", "Author": "alquell", "ReviewID": "R6521RD2JNU1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very nice and easy to use and it was one phone i order found to be true to the adds i read and love it alot  iwas very happy with the seller and they were fast and the service i rec was alsome . sending one to my nice in nv today . thanks everyone", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Christmas present", "Author": "Diana E.

I understand French, so had no trouble changing the settings. The instruction manual includes English, so if you don't know the language set by default, it is easy to change. As for the European charger, I don't mind having it because I plan to use the phone in Europe as well, but it is inconvenient for most people to have to add an adapter to the end of the charger (even if adapters are cheap to buy). Fortunately, I have another Samsung cell phone with a US charger that works with this phone, so now I have a charger for use in the US and in Europe.The flashlight works fine. It comes with a slot for a lanyard or key ring, too. Works just fine on the T-Mobile pay as you go ($0.10/min.) plan and should work fine on Vodafone and other inexpensive pay-as-you-go services in Europe (at least my other Samsung does).", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone but...", "Author": "Madeline", "ReviewID": "R1TA9JGAMVN2VA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "East European phone used on AT&T; mostly DC to NY.

Couldn't access bluetooth capability either.The durability and water resistance were the main reason for purchase and so far so good.
