Mine came from this specific site, and his was a black one, but they were both by Nokia. His came manufactured incorrectly, the input for the charger is reversed on the inside, and there is no way you can stick the charger in to fit. Though I understand his phone was not from here, mine was. And mine showed up, and it looked used. There were a few scratches on the screen, and there was a chip, scratch or whatever you want to call it on the bottom left corner, as if it had been dropped. We are both sending our phones back, but we are going to try and re-order them for better results. I hope to make another review, hopefully a positive one.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but a few curiosities leave me wondering...", "Author": "Patches N. Stitches", "ReviewID": "R2SAZUUYI5ENJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has been reviewed thoroughly elsewhere. It is an excellent device, the flagship of the Windows Phone 8 line. I wanted to mention that the Cyan Lumia 920 I ordered from this page came glossy, not matte. If you're familiar with AT&T;'s Lumia 920 line, the black and cyan models are matte, and the red/white/yellow models are glossy. Why then did I receive a glossy Cyan Lumia 920? I'm not sure. I do know that the box that it came in was a counterfeit copy of the one that comes with the local AT&T; version. The charger, manual and SIM card ejector are different, too. The phone itself otherwise seems authentic, but one curious thing did happen when I powered it on. The default color for the interface was red, not blue. Anyone who has purchased a Lumia 920 through AT&T; knows that the default color scheme matches the color of the phone. So, apparently, I have a Glossy Blue phone that thinks it's a Red phone. The only thing that I can figure is that either this is a refurbished unit with a new glossy blue casing, or the software was set incorrectly. I'm not dissatisfied, though. The phone works as well as any other Lumia 920 I've owned, and I actually kind of prefer the glossy finish. I always wanted the (relatively rare) cyan color, and now I have it.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cyan is great", "Author": "EricTangZhaoBin", "ReviewID": "RGW6UU2XOTPLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a little bit expenience and it could not be unlocked right now.but cyan is very beautiful and rare .so it is worthwhile", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "wantong chai", "ReviewID": "R2NCNP0WVKR05U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There was a mark on the back of the phone yesterday. but now it disapeard. i love this phone now.
