I asked around and was informed it was probably because some functions were changed however, the phone was advertised as brand new.  So I got in touch with the seller who promptly replaced the phone with a new one (seems new at least) and it was activated on Page Plus without a hitch but the phone has since then developed other issues.  I don't know if its just the phone brand itself or what, but after my experience with this particular phone and another phone bought off Amazon from a different seller, I think I won't be buying anymore cell phones off Amazon, especially older models.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Queen", "ReviewID": "R34IS3IVWAQM3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is greatAlso priced rightLove anything from HTCGreat phonesGreat quality phone altogetherReally enjoying the rhyme at this pointGreat doing biz with you", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "HTC!", "Author": "brooklynn kelly", "ReviewID": "R2EWAN1TOF7QRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone meet my needs its a great color nice size, the camera works fine, I just love my phone!", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing phone!", "Author": "katelyn526", "ReviewID": "R1K187JK4DLRZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have always preferred i phones over any other phones  but i might just change my mind htcs are great, at least this one is.  it dose everything i need it to and has a very, very good camera and nice sound.is very pretty and very user friendly.  great deal, amazing price. most other phones make it difficult to screen shot if they are not a apple product but this one is very easy.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CBNRFI4"}}
