I had some friends ask me if this  is HDTV. BUT! one thing I really hated about it was that it has a Video out  but not a tunner out, so when I hook it up to my A/V receiver, if I whant  to watch regular TV I have to use 2 remotes, one to set my A/V to TV and  the other one to set the TV to TV, can you belive that? , my old system  1989 model had a Tunner out! , some body at Sony was sleeping on the Job.  Besides this small fall back its a great TV and people will say \"wasnt  projection TV supposed to looked bad! \"great value buy it!", "Date": "June 19, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good value for the cost", "Author": "James Kinsley", "ReviewID": "R2CV5HQAMLF1PJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I found the Sony KV-53S65 53\" Projection TV to be the best value among similar size projection TV's. I compared the Sony against comparable RCA, Toshiba, and Phillips models. The Picture was much sharper than other  models. I found the Red, Green, and Black colors to be more pure than more  expensive Phillips and RCA models. I realy like the front S-Video input for  easy hookup of my DVD. I also especialy enjoyed the layout of the remote  control compared to RCA remotes I have used previously (The buttons were  not layed out logicaly on other remotes I have used).", "Date": "June 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "A great TV!", "Author": "James Clark", "ReviewID": "R7GOZBR9A2RVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has a great picture quality.  The picture is great.  The sound is awesome.  Eventhough it is very expansive for a TV but if you have the money, this is great TV to own.

Whenever I think of buying something that is technology related, I buy Sony. It is the only brand that I trust, and they have never failed me. This TV has great resolution, and provides great  sound. It has an easy to understand remote and a great picture as long as  it isn't coming from cable. If you are thinking of getting a big screen and  are currently a cable subscriber ask them if you will need a signal  booster.  Although if watching a video or DVD the picture is excellent,  clear as can be. Another thing is that it is light, which makes moving it  very easy.
