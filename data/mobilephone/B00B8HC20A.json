This phone is super fast and is compatible with prepaid GSM carriers such as ATT and T-Mobile. I am personally using T-Mobiles' Monthly 4G plan and it is working out great so far. The design is beautiful and the phone doesn't weigh much more that the GS3 but is slightly taller on height but the width is just about the same. The display though! It is the best you will get until 1080P displays start becoming the new trend.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Droid DNA - Just gets better", "Author": "Jesse", "ReviewID": "RFSAGS5RBPEC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Droid HTC DNA is a great phone. I have had mine for almost 6 months now and it handles flawlessly. There used to be an issue with the phone not reading the SIM card and displaying an error, but that error was fixed with a software patch and has never happened since (probably 4 months now). Sturdy, fast, brilliant screen sizing, easy navigation screens, Beats Audio... it has all you need in a phone and more. Another plus to this phone is that it runs both CDMA and GSM, so I can switch it from Verizon to T-Mobile in a heartbeat by switching the micro SIM card.The specs on this are still top notch, and it is now an \"older\" phone. I highly recommend it!", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Droid DNA", "Author": "darren pelio", "ReviewID": "R1PRFSQ03RQAOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th droid phone and light years ahead of the rest.  My biggest issue is being able to multitask and having fast processor speed.  The DNA doers this very well. I can go in and out of functions while texting and/or opening apps and is does not slow down or seize up like my razor. The quad core is the way to go.  Screen is very nice, phone thin, light. Beats audio is great for working out. Battery life only drains to @50% at end of day with my GPS off.  Drains to about 20% with GPS on all day.  And that is with heavy usage as I work medical and am looking up info and texting orders to nurses all day.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Known Flaw in SIM Card Tray", "Author": "CB \"Canyon\"", "ReviewID": "R2I8GFPEU8AGBJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone has a known issue with its sim card tray.  It will lose the card causing you to disconnect from the network unable to utilize either data or voice calls. The user either has to wait for it to be \"re-found\" or reboot the phone; both very annoying. Everything else on the phone is great.  The screen is very clear, the camera is great. I enjoy the phone, just not that it disconnects all the time.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Jacob Stier", "ReviewID": "R32BKFH25BDWSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Phone is a great buy and if you are looking for a great phone that has 90% of the modern features of a Samsung Galaxy 4. This is a phone for you. The screen is 1080p and is great looking. Although it looks best without a case, I would recommend buying one since without at the least a screen protector after a few drops or a slam to the concrete the screen will crack. even though the phone is a lot more durable than the iPhone so it won't break on the first few drops i would still recommend a case or screen protector. anyways, it is a very slim phone, its durable and fast.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great condition", "Author": "RE4 Rox", "ReviewID": "R2F35VFT57QPNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone simply hoping that it would work.

The are already unlocked,and only cost $600 new. THEY ARE UNLOCKED OUT OF THE BOX FOR AT&T; AND T-MOBILE. I have one myself, got it at Walamart $600 and tax but Amazon is $600 no tax, phone is already unlocked I hate when people try to do people wrong and charge them for something that is already unlocked. One thing I do have to say though that you have to buy a brand new phone or make sure its on the earliest firmware if you want to root it unlock it and have S-Off.
