{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does A Good Job", "Author": "R. M. Slade", "ReviewID": "R1MDVOFW11WIBW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I consider this to be a very good phone. I purchased it to replace my worn out VX8300 flip phone. I use it to call, text, and occasionally to photo share. This U940 Glyde does everything my VX8300 did, and does it better.Pros: Reliable. Touch screen works well. Battery life similar to VX8300, last approx 18 hrs w/ approx 10 texts and 4ea 10 min calls. Frequently searching for signal significantly reduces my battery charge. Qwerty keyboard simplifies text entries. Screen resolution is very good. Phone is sufficiently robust to withstand the abuse of being carried in my pants pocket. Not too heavy or too large for pants pocket. Excellent audio for hearing the caller. Plays video well, speaker volume and clarity is good. Plays MP4 video files. Easy to unlock screen by sliding key icon to lock icon. Easy one button to lock screen.Cons: Small keyboard buttons can be cumbersome for large fingers. Annoying to unlock screen to end a call. Was advertised as a new phone. Phone looks new, but Verizon confirmed the phone had been activated before. Ringer volume could be louder.Notes: Requires small 2.5 mm headphone prong. I purchased a car charger, but have only had to use it once. I do not use phone to access the internet or use data. I use a 2gb micro memory card. I finally found a Verizon store that had the software to transfer my contacts.

Charlton", "ReviewID": "R2SEHKCDNPNGBS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone because my Verizon contract allowed me to use a smartphone but I did not want to use a data package, since those cost so much extra per month. Sadly, I had to stop using this phone (and should have stopped sooner) because it is terrible! Its main problem is that the touch screen is so glitchy and almost never worked when I tried to do something important, like make a call or text someone. You know, the stuff you traditionally use cell phones for. Also, I could almost never set an alarm because the touch feature wouldn't usually allow me to do a simple task like that. I put up with annoyance and frustration for too long!

They really like them so far.  They came in great condition and other than a little difficulty getting them activated, which I'm sure has more to do with user error than with the phones themselves, they've worked great!

Kim", "ReviewID": "R3KIF2J3NNRCHM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 2 years and I highly recommend NOT getting this phone.It works great when you first get it, but after about 7 months of regular use the entire touch interface will start crumbling. The touch interface will inaccurately read your touch movements and will take on a life entirely of its own- making texting and just overall use of your phone a nightmare. Even when you aren't touching the screen (i.e. using the keyboard to text) the screen will do whatever it wants.The keyboard, overall look and easiness of use is great- but the touch interface's malfunctioning is a deal breaker.If this is a phone that you're getting just for a short while then go for it- but if you mean to use it long-term look for something else.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Glyde touchscreen", "Author": "Millicent L Bowie", "ReviewID": "R223SHZ94OX2T0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not like this phone.

That was a mistake.The phone I received was three years old and refurbished, which isn't the problem.  The problem is that if you do a simple search for the Samsung Glyde online, you will find that the phone is a bad model.  The touchscreen stops working, either all together or stops responding properly, and the battery life is pretty bad.  Mine lasts a day before it has to be charged again.

I've had it for about two weeks now and it seems to work fine despite all the bad reviews on other websites. The only bad thing about it is the battery life. I need to charge the phone daily, even when I don't even use the phone. The phone I bought was used thought, I'm buying a new extended battery and cover for it, maybe that will increase the battery life.After a few months of use and with an extended battery, I'm liking this phone even more.

I can only make a phone call for 5 minutes at the max until it completely dies. I will have a full battery that is just freshly charged and then as soon as I go to make a call the battery is low. I noticed though that as soon as I end the call the battery life \"magically\" goes back to having four bars again and continues. I can text and do all sorts of things on the phone and the battery lasts forever but it is extremely inconvenient not to be able to make calls on this phone. If I were in a car accident alone, knock on wood, I would not even have enough time to tell the 911 operator my location before the phone died. Granted, it'd have full battery life once I turned it on again, I still think that this is an extreme inconvenience. I was going to give it one star but I do have to admit it does have the longest standby life. If I don't touch it at all, it can last up to a week on a single charge. Hence why I gave it two stars instead of one.One thing that is also an inconvenience, you can only have a certain amount of texts until it says its full and wont receive any more texts. Which is what I would expect from a basic phone but 100 texts seems a little on the low side but that's just my preference. All in all the phone works for what you pay for. The calling issue though is an extreme inconvenience. I don't know if it's a battery issue or if it is the actually phone but Samsung should look into this.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not purchase from beast Deal", "Author": "Deborah", "ReviewID": "RQIR8QXBHNWZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Item is not even 6 month old and it already is brooken.

If those were your intentions as well, then I am forewarning you to look elsewhere. The software that comes installed disallows you to access the internet (ie. phone number backup app).

This device is cheap and obsolete. I lost my money, don't do the same.ps.
