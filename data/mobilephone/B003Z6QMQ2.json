Big mistake.1. Poor battery usage - if Wi-Fi is on as well as Bluetooth, expect a couple of hours use.2. The phone switches to voicemail in mid conversation, when you put it to your ear.3. The white Aspen - Keys light up white against a white background, so you can't see the keys in daytime.4. If someone is calling you when you are on a call and you press answer, it cuts you off. Most irritating.5. Operates on Windows - need I say more.6. Touchscreen scratches very easily. Even with provided stylus.My daughter is getting this phone to play with and I'm buying a Blackberry 9780. At least I can message my friends for free.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.99", "Features": "3.2 MP Camera Built in 3.5mm jack FM Radio Full IE browser Windows Mobile 6.5 Talk time is 10 hrs", "Name": "Sony Ericcson Aspen Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, gps navigation, microSD Card Support --International Version with Warranty (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y9%2B06gv8L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Z6QMQ2"}}
