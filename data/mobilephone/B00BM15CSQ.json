You agreed to refund the price of the watch plus shipping, and I responded, and agreed to send the watch back.2. You know darn well that it takes several days for the postal delivery to you.3. The 3rd watch you just sent me was not requested by me due to our agreement on refund with shipping cost refund.4. The fact is the error is on you not me.6. I refuse this item.7. You owe me a refund.PS I also left 2 voice mails to you guys on this matter.(28 July):I received item replacement,but it too is defective. When I try to charge battery I get an alarm and message that states(Bad contact of charger). Also when I try to read my email I get (insufficient memory) or some other kind of error. I want a refund? I'm out 12.84 return shipping for the last broken down watch you sent. So far I have nothing to show for all my time and effort. I'm mad as hell! I WANT A REFUND, AND A REIMBURSEMENT OF SHIPPING COSTS!Problems with WiFI  and the TF card slot. WiFi won't connect to internet. TF card (4GB) not even seen by watch. Manual nearly useless, and the fonts are ridiculously tiny. Scanned manual into computer in order to increase font size. Still fonts are weak lacking in clarity. I tried to find a picture on the proper insertion of TF card as a precaution just in case there may be a manufacture design change. NOTHING in manual or on line. You can buy a similar watch phone excluding the WiF,but with WAPi for a quarter of the price of this watch. My experiences with watch phones leads me to believe no one is manufacturing them to industry standards, I suggest buy a cheap $40 phone watch on Amazon, and expect some features won't work. You will have a fun toy for a small price, and your expectations will be met. Just in case you still want this watch let me tell you about the replacement. I get an error messages while trying to use web. No explanation is given in the manual. I get a memory not sufficient message while I have a 16GB flash card inserted. I see an icon with an red X next to it, but it is so tiny I can't image what it is. The icon don't match the ones in the manual. Although, how would I know, they are almost undetectable to the naked eye. Bottom line this really is not worth the money. Yes it is cute, and I do like it. But not for the hundred and thirty plus dollars it cost with the return shipping. Also consider that you will spend hours with almost no useful instructions in making this thing work. After 7 hours getting this thing to work I still haven't tested all the features so I just hope they work. P.S. The info below is a little history on my dealings with the seller.Update:As of July 25th things are not looking good with this seller. Seller has a short memory, and totally disregards my phone conversation with him on 15 June. Seller falsely accused me of not replying to his email or providing him with requested postal tracking number. According to the postal system my watch was delivered to him on June 20th, but he has not confirmed receipt of item. And to add insult to injury he seems to think I should of shipped item to him at the discount commercial rate he paid. I had to ship at the rate everybody pays (non-commercial)As of July 27th I received a replacement from seller. BUT I'm still out the return shipping cost for a defective item. Why should I pay for the manufacturers mistake?", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BM15CSQ"}}
