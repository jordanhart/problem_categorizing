I finally got sick of intrusive apps, data plans and being connected to all things all of the time. I am going to sell the Samsung Note, dump my data plan, and stick with this basic texting phone. It's not perfect, and has its quirks, but it performs better than most I've tried in this range. The keyboard is easy and travels well, the 3G powered Mobile Web is faster than I expected, it has threaded messaging, the touch screen is more responsive than the Pantech Laser, the call quality is satisfactory and there are many convenient features (Quick Contacts, Inbox, Voice Recognition, etc.). Additionally, the Easy mode is in fact, easy. My only gripe is that there is no threaded messaging in this mode, which is odd because it is easier to track conversations within a threaded view. The phone does not have a 3.5mm jack and relies upon the micro usb port to serve double duty(you'll need to find an adapter). Access to apps, games, ringtones, etc. is just silly, so you may not want to waste your time. The music player is fine, as far as it goes and I was surprised to see an equalizer. If you're looking for a basic, no data plan, qwerty messaging phone, this is a great alternative. If you're looking for a cheap smart phone, exit stage left. I got this phone on eBay for $57 with free shipping and I'm happy so far.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Data Plan NOT mandatory...", "Author": "marek831", "ReviewID": "RIUG22CXKXF0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Pantech Ease is a quick messaging phone.

I should have searched longer before deciding on Pantech Ease.  The phone is sturdy and has a nice keyboard for texting.  Sound quality is okay, touch screen very responsive. Gave it two stars for that.Now the bad.  In advanced mode its not that easy to use.  I find the much higher end smart phone easier to use.  Many features are hidden in the menus.  I had to consult some cell phone geeks to show me how to access them.  Such as viewing pics stored on the SD card. Doesn't want to stay on the home screen for some reason and it changes fonts on it own. The camera is useless because of the lag in the shutter.  Unless your subject holds still for a couple of seconds you will have a blurry shot.  I Have missed several calls because the phone does not ring (goes to voice mail) and text alerts do not sound half the time, resetting everything did not help. Many sending \"errors\" with texts on this phone as well.  Alarms only work half the time and volume turns off by itself.Battery life on this phone is far worse than any phone on the market. Even on a full charge if you are on a call for more than 5 minutes (my usual talk time) it will drain the battery to nothing (even on \"easy mode\").  I put a brand new battery in but that did not improve talk time by much.  Even on standby it seems to discharge very quickly.  I do not have any apps running and nothing else turned on.  Can't comment on internet browsing, I never use it.My phone may be defective as other reviewers are happy with theirs.

Holding the phone slightly away from my face so it doesn't touch the screen doesn't help. The screen is so sensitive that even \"hovering\" over it will push buttons. I liked the qwerty keyboard and the simplicity of it, but it just wasn't worth it. After having it for a short while I bought a new phone and this one sits in a drawer unused.
