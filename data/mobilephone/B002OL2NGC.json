It is in fact the South-East Asian version of the cell phone which means the following:- In the phone's settings the user's 'locale' can only be set to two values: Vietnam (English) and Malaysia (English)- The phone does not have the android market application pre-installed. In stead there is a clone market place installed called 'slide' but this one only has a very few applications compared to the market. This also means that there is no means of updating the existing (google) applications whenever new versions are released.Even though I haven't tried this myself yet but apparently there is a way for a user with a bit of technical knowledge to install the true international firmware on the phone. So consider yourself warned: if you want to full HTC Tattoo experience, you'll need to do some hacking.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice , but..", "Author": "Yizhaq Shmaayahoo", "ReviewID": "R1ZJXYDERGJTWT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The device is light and fits nicely in any pocket.
