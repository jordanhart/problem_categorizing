I really liked my Galaxy s3 mini too, but Straight Talk now has 4g LTE in my area and I wanted a phone that also had 4g. This is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when I put it in the case I can't really tell. It does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. I have gotten two days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user. I play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. I very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. I am probably not the most techy person, but I have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one.  It did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. My guess is that SHOPBEST opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so I could use it in the US without an issue. This is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. This is the mini version not the regular version. I knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don't read the product description to be surprised.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Did not work on AT&T; data", "Author": "dan j.", "ReviewID": "R1UXBIEG72BFRB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone because I have AT&T; service.

It was late if we consider that was expected after two labor days. It was a waste to have two shipping days...The device itself is great. I had the old vibrant S4G from t-mobile but just broke its screen. This G4Smini is just a little bit bigger but best replacement. I do not like the super sized S4. The model is the GT-I9195 from somewhere in europe (france?). It comes with a brochure from the mobile company Orange. After charged, I turned it on and asked me the preferred language, data for account logins and internet. Created some accounts as well and finally was up and running fine. The charger has a plug useful in some countries in europe and many other countries in latam etc. The seller included an adapter for the US connector. The box itself appeared unopened with its seal intact, but a more careful look showed that the seal was on top of a previously broken seal. Both seems to be official but who knows how hard can be to make a sticker with the words \"samsung\" on it... The device had plenty of plastics protecting all the sides and corners so it looks \"enough\" new to me.The cons:- horrible boot screen. No idea how to replace it without rooting the phone.- many not needed applications you cannot uninstall unless rooting the device (as most smartphones).- it uses microSIM cards... No idea why since it has plenty of space for the regular SIM cards. I had to buy a cutter to trim my old SIM.- the device comes with android 4.2.2. I was expecting something more recent. At least 4.3, or an update. But no....- its price feels way too high for a device with only 8GB of internal memory (already shared with OS and the several updates to its original apps).I recommend the product but knowing in advance its details.EDIT: Be aware that as with previous model, Samsung messed it up. Firmware 4.2.2 \"allows\" to move apps to SD to free internal memory space. But it is not true... all it does is to say it did it, but it only moves the apps to a sort of partition or folder \"./emulate/0\" on the same INTERNAL MEMORY!!!! Checked many forum and this issue is reported since S III, but is still not solved by Samsung.Some stated that firmware 4.3 may solve it but my Kies still says 4.2.2 is the latest firmware.This is a HUGE fault on this device. My previous S4G Vibrant, really moved the apps to the SD as most android devices. It is one of the plus over iPhones. But this one, more modern and very expensive device just fakes it. Do not get confused by Samsung Support FAQ stating this is only due to developpers of some apps not using SD compatibility, because no one app was in fact moved to the SD card. All went to the emulated area inside the internal memory despite stating the app was moved to SD. I even checked my SD card on linux to see all hidden forldes and NADA. No one app was moved there, not even a folder was created to do so. Google this issue and you will find many forums showing this problem.I do not like when manufacturers LIE and sellers do nothing to inform their customers about what the product really is. This bug is known since long time and the seller should know the products they sell. When I press move to SD, and it says it did it, I expect to find it on the SD card. Too much to ask?My internal memory is getting full by just having built-in apps auto-updated.I am overseas now. Otherwise I would ask for a full refund.No, I do not recommend this product until Samsung offers a firmware update that solves this issue.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Helena Buturma", "ReviewID": "R3JG9813VF47KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just came back from Europe and phone was working absolutely great!I had My Touch before  other phone was slow no reaction to commends, this one is fast and smooth.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "factory unloked SANSUNG", "Author": "Julieta S\u00e1nchez", "ReviewID": "R3GD6FCJ2KYJRE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The product is fine but not unlocked sent him as I asked. and brought me many problems.
