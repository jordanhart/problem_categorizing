At college and home the students have full WiFi coverage so they don't need a data plan ($0).  Using Google voice and WiFi they have full smartphone functionality with no monthly bill, and the kids love the phone.  Almost all Android software will run except some of the really high power games that require a dual processor.  Purchase a $100 go phone card and you basically get a smart phone for about $20 a month. (including the purchase price and the 1 year service plan)  The battery seems to last for days even though the kids are using the phone ALL THE TIME.  Only time will tell if the phone will hold up, but at this price the phone only has to last 3 months before we break even versus a traditional plan.

I have a work cellphone through AT&T;, but it's very basic. I wouldn't say I use my personal phone for much more than texts and the occasional call. I originally went with Straight Talk since I didn't want to pay a lot for monthly service. While with them for a year, I had 4 different phones. Only one was a touchscreen and it had made me wonder if touchscreen phones are just not made for me. This past December, I decided it was time to get a new phone. I tried one of Straight Talk's Androids, but even though Sprint is listed as having excellent coverage at my home address, I could not get any reception inside and only 1 bar outside. A Sprint rep told me to try their prepaid services instead of Straight Talk's. I tried an HTC on Virgin Mobile and had no reception. I returned it and tried a Motorola on Boost Mobile, no reception. I should add that the area I live in has very good - excellent coverage on all the major networks, including full coverage on Verizon and AT&T;'s LTE networks. So I'm not out in the sticks trying to get coverage here, but was having no success. I ended up buying a Verizon phone through Straight Talk. It was okay, but I was back to paying 50 dollars a month for an unlimited plan that I maybe used 100 minutes of talk on.I have never had problems with reception through AT&T;, but I found the Go Phone's plans to be a little confusing, but when I saw this phone, I decided to keep the Verizon Straight Talk and give this phone a try. I've never used an iPhone or any of the high end touchscreen phones, but I couldn't imagine them being any better than this phone's touchscreen. Maybe they are, but it's highly unlikely I will ever try one of those out. I searched through reviews here and elsewhere to understand AT&T;'s data plans with the Go Phones, but found very little information that answered my question. I know I'm not a whiz when it comes to the new phones or technology in them. I did want some internet capability though because of some apps that Android has that would come in very useful for me. So I am going to explain that part in case anyone else has the question I had.Others have told you don't have to buy a data package with this phone. My problem was, if I was going to have an Android, I would want some internet connection to add the apps since most of them cannot be downloaded to your computer then transferred to the phone via a memory card. I saw where this phone had wifi, but I could not find any mention of if you still needed a data plan to allow the phone to rely solely on wifi.That's the good news. You can use this phone with wifi without any data package. I'm sure the cellphone snobs will tell me, but you can't use it online when away from home and that's true, unless I get lucky and pick-up a wifi signal, but I don't need the internet away from home. I signed up for the unlimited text, 250 minutes package, it's 25 dollars plus tax. Mine comes to roughly 28 dollars a month and with a cheap Cisco Valet router, I get unlimited data at home. That's perfect for me. So you know if you're wondering about how the wifi/data package works, you can use just wifi without a data package.The rest of the good news: I had been force using a T-Mobile Samsung Exhibit II as my personal phone. It has a slightly bigger screen than this phone does, but this phone has a bigger screen than the other prepaid touchscreens I have seen. Another thing I liked about this phone is the width. I by no means have small or average-sized hands. The touchscreen I had through Straight Talk was so small in width that I could hit 3 keys at one time. I don't have that problem with this phone. Comparing it in size, it's very similar in overall size to most iPhones. I have not had any problems whatsoever with this phone, though I will warn against the screen protectors sold here on Amazon by a marketplace seller. As I went through all 5 without any working. Everything on this phone though works as it should. I can't say I would be happier with any other phone because I don't see anything that would make it any better than it is.The battery did seem to run out pretty fast, but I downloaded the Juice Defender app and that fixed it. I can leave it unplugged for 24 hours and will still have roughly 75% charge. It has all the customization options that I know of or at least that I would use.The closest thing I have to a complaint is one that I think most phones now have and that is I have to take the back cover off the phone to get to the memory card. My favorite phone I've had was a Nokia e71, it had the memory card slot on the side so it isn't quite as easy to change the memory card in this phone, but that's hardly a big complaint. The sound when playing music without headphones could be better, but that's hardly a complaint either. It does have the standard headphone jack in case anyone is wondering so you don't have to try and find a non-standard plug adapter for your headphones. It's really a nice phone. Match it with a router at home or if you have access to wifi and you have a decently powerful Android for less than 30 dollars a month.Last is reception. I still have the Nokia e71 and it runs on AT&T;'s network as well. The Nokia does get better reception overall. As I'm typing this, I have both phones sitting beside me and this phone, the Avail, has 3 of 5 bars, that's inside a condo, in the back bedroom. The Nokia has full reception. I also can't say if the Avail goes to AT&T;'s 3.5G network when using data, but the e71 does. Having said that, the Avail still has very clear call quality and I haven't had a dropped call or failed to send texts. With the added bonus of the dozen or so Android apps I wanted, the responsive touchscreen, I'm very pleased with this phone and have recommended to several friends who were looking for a good prepaid phone. I would think this phone would be ideal for college students as well since most colleges have plenty of wifi hotspots.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "As an iPhone guy, color me impressed", "Author": "jcazz", "ReviewID": "RUJZA8AGYE7JN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife wanted to try a smartphone, but wasn't sure if she would like it so she didn't want me to upgrade her account and extend her contract to test it.  Being an iPhone guy from day one, I set out to find a used iPhone and realized that they hold their value pretty well.  Out of my try-it-to-see-if-you-like-it budget.Then I found this Android phone and decided for the money it wouldn't be a complete bust if she hated it.  Ordered it and it was on its way.As I mentioned, I'm an iPhone guy.  I've had friends try to convince me Android was a good platform, but I've always pooh-poohed that.  I tried out some of the early Android phones (way back in the Cupcake days) and was NOT impressed.  I remained confident that my iPhone was the ONLY way to go.After putting the battery in and powering up the Avail, I was able to quickly connect to my WiFi network to complete setup (I hadn't put my wife's SIM in yet).  After setting her Google account up and answering a few questions about my location & time zone, I was into the phone.And you know what?  I was fairly impressed with what Android has evolved into.  Navigation worked well, the screen animations were reasonably smooth.  I was able to figure out how to add & remove icons from the various pages.  Android has become an OS that an iPhone user can pickup (probably vice versa too) and with only a few differences feel completely at home.The phone itself is very nice for the money.  The size is about the same as the iPhone in width & length, but the screen is a touch smaller and the overall thickness is a little more.  But the Avail feels really nice in the hand.  It's got a good weight and the battery cover feels slightly rubberized and grippy (my biggest complaint with the iPhone is the glass back is slippery as all get out).I was able to throw some apps on the phone easily and they worked as expected.After giving my wife a crash course in smartphoneology I told her to play with it and see how she likes it.  So far so good & she likes texting MUCH better on a phone with a full keyboard than on her old flip phone with only number keys!Pros* Cost can't be beat for an unsubsidized phone.  If you have an AT&T; account you can pop your SIM in and go!* Android has actually gotten pretty nice* Phone feels good in the hand, doesn't feel flimsy or cheap* Can increase storage w/ larger SD cardCons* Only 5MP camera* Less on board memory than a higher-end phone* Only comes with 2GB SD card* Screen doesn't feel as smooth as other phones I've used - screen protectors should help & are on the way* Occasional slowness in opening an app or navigating, but very minor", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "An excellent pre-paid smartphone", "Author": "Jason Jia", "ReviewID": "RU6SSQVVBKDF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought AT&T; Avail a month ago from Amazon to replace my broken LG Thrive. I used LG Thrive for about 40 days and its screen stopped working after dropping it to the ground by accident. Both Avail and LG Thrive are in the same price range (~$120). Based on my experience with both phones, here is the comparison of those two phones:AT&T; AvailPros:* Larger screen (3.5in compared with 3.2in LG Thrive)* Better looking (maybe it's my personal preference, I think the black Avail looks good)* Newer Android 2.3 system (Thrive uses 2.2)* Better camera - 5m vs 3m Thrive* More stable wifi connection (Wifi connection of Thrive is not so reliable in my home. Probably it's the compatiblity issue with my router)* Slightly larger internal storage. Actually both phones have really small internal storage and I'm out of space after installing ~20 apps. Although you can move some apps to SD card, some apps cannot be moved.Cons:* Seems Avail does not have many OS customizations. For example, LG Thrive has a nice home screen widget to turn on/off 3G network, while on Avail I have to go to settings every time when I switches network.In summary, AT&T; Avail from ZTE is an excellent prepaid smartphone for its price.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Avail", "Author": "Great Choice. No More Data Plan!", "ReviewID": "R1SNM8EIJKYCNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everyone has their own needs, but for what I was trying to accomplish, this phone has worked out perfectly. I was already an AT&T; customer with two iPhones on a family plan paying $250 per month. After my contract expired, I came to the realization that we do not need data plans since most of the time we are either at home or work, which both have WiFi. In summary, this phone is a great deal and allowed me to drop the data plan and my monthly mobile fees while still having a fairly stylish, connected smartphone.I have used the Avail for a month now and this is exactly what I was looking for. We now pay $100 a month and we don't have to be embarrassed by a ultra-ugly basic phone model in hand. In my research AT&T; has the best options for pre-paid phones.Pros:1. Call quality is great. On 3G - service seems no different than with the iPhone I had. Strong speaker.2. WiFi works great. Always connects right away for me. There is an icon on the home screen. Once set up, one touch and it turns it on and off as you need it.3. Great screen quality. And the touch screen works very well.4. Only $129 @ AT&T; store.5. No data plan. I was leery even after buying this that somehow I would still get charged, but unless you load up a pre-paid data plan no worries. Plus, it also has settings to disable data. You can still download and use all of the app on Android Market as you did via a data plan. Downloaded and used Words with Friends just as I did with my iPhone. Works the same.6. Battery life. I think it is great. Seems to last days on a single charge with moderate call use. Again, I turn on and off WiFi as needed which probably helps.7. Camera is ok. Has some cool settings like zoom, lighting - but seems a little shaky. Not bad, but not great.8. Only $50 a month - unlimited talk and text. Great deal.9. Phone feels like good quality. Good weight and the exterior casing (kind of a molded rubberized plastic cover) has a good feel.Cons:1. AT&T; really did not want to sell me this phone, especially since I was a high $$ contract user. They tried everything to sell me out of these phones - two different in-store reps. They threw every possible objection at me. Persevere and ignore it all or buy online.2. I owned an iPhone and never used an Android phone, so as expected this phone would take a good deal to get used to. It's hard for me not to compare, but this phone is not really intuitive and it takes some getting used to, but after using it I am willing to give up on the ease of use for the price. You get used to it, but it does not flow well always. Even some simple things, like accessing voicemail or the icons they chose aren't super intuitive, but again you get used to it.3. It's a little sluggish. Meaning that a button press and resulting action might take a second to register. Nothing too horrible, but there is a little delay. Sometimes the transitions are smooth.4. Not loving the text input. Even after adjusting the settings, it doesn't seem to be auto-correcting or predicting.5. Another little peeve of mine is the notifications with missed calls and texts. Why is there no message on the home screen when you pick up your phone? Instead there a very tiny icon in the corner as a notification and then you have to go search in the call log for who called. Again, back to the flow and simplicity issue.Overall, I think this was a great decision a for us and it is saving us over $1500 a year by making this change. Sure, I can't access Yelp while walking around, but again it's a trade off.

At first, I thought I was just use to the Avail and I would start liking the Fusion eventually.. that was 6 months ago and my opinion hasn't changed.  The Fusion blows.. I miss half my calls and my internal memory only allows space for very few APS.  So, I recently ordered myself another Avail.  I haven't tried the Fusion 2 to see if it's any better, but I know the Avail is a winner for the GoPhone, so I'm going back to it.I also recently upgraded my plan to the $65 monthly plan, which is unlimited talk, text and 1GB of data a month.______________________________________________________________________I got my AT&T; Avail a few days ago and - being my 1st \"smartphone\" - I'm very impressed!

The phone has excellent voice quality and the device is quite nice. The touch screen is responsive and easy to use.

This phone will be completely paid for in a few months with the money I've saved by cancelling my Verizon service.The android operating system is very nice. There are many things about the OS that is much better than an iPhone. You have much more control over your device and aren't limited by Apple's constraints. Also, you can see the details of your system much easier (for instance, you can drill down and see which applications are running and how much memory they are using, even system applications). You can install any Android  application and aren't forced to use Apples' App Store. There are tons of apps: just as many (or more) as on the iPhone.The battery life is comparative to my older iPod touch. It isn't great, but it isn't terrible.The only negatives I've found about the device, is that I had problems with the installed keyboard and the auto-correct feature.

It's not a good choice for T-Mobile though because it doesn't operate on T-Mobile's 1700 MHz 3G band.

Two big changes:1. You can no longer purchase blocks of data if you opt for the per-minute plan--AT&T; has eliminated that option effective 4/18/2012. Too many smart phone users that use few voice minutes or texts, but moderate amounts of data, were moving to pay-per-minute from higher value postpaid accounts. Existing smart phone users can still purchase data at 1\u00a2/5MB ($2/MB or $2000/GB) but cannot purchase data packages anymore. New smart phone users cannot purchase data at 1\u00a2/5MB.2. The costs and quantities of the data packages listed on Amazon are all wrong. AT&T; has increased the amount of data to $5/50 MB, $15/200 MB and $25/1 GB.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Phone with Very Few Faults", "Author": "bobber", "ReviewID": "R1VSY30VXTFBL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used the AT&t; Avail for a while now and can give a good review of it's quality and features. Just to give a bit of background, I've used iPhones and Samsungs for a while and can offer a good comparison.First, you're using the Android system and you'll have to decide for yourself if it's what you like, as opposed to Samsung and iPhone, which are quite different. Me personally, I like them all, but the Apple will have less customization, but beyond that, as a phone and PPA device, they all work very well. I would say, I give a slight edge to Android, but not enough to keep me from buying the others.Second, performance is the number one thing on most people's mind when they buy any phone, so here we go. Call quality is far above average. I've read about the crystal clear call quality of the iPhone 4S, but in use, this phone is as good or better. Seldom do I notice muffled voices of callers, and even then, I'm not sure they're not holding the phone too close or too far from their mouths. It's not something you can blame on the phone. The Avail has a more balanced sound, as opposed to the slightly tinny sound of an iPhone. If you like Samsung, you'll love the Avail, nuff said. The OS is snappy and there are no annoying lags. Moving around the system is both intuitive and easy. There's just not much to dislike about Android. You won't find any annoying omissions of features or weird menus here, all is as it should be. Android has some really cool apps and widgets to add to your phone, that make it easier to do some things, even though the standard way is surely nice, but you do have the option to change almost anything your heart's desire, not so with iPhone. So, in this respect, it is far ahead of Apple, but then again, the iPhone works fine too, so it's a small advantage, but noticeable.The Avail's call sound is capable of being quite loud, and even my hardness of hearing isn't a problem. The external speaker is adequately loud and very usable for speaker phone calls. I've used it often with not a single complaint. It's better than most by a long shot.Connectivity is pretty good really, with only a few dropped calls, which in most cases, I would say were dropped by the other phone I was talking to. Sometimes it's really hard to tell which phone actually pulled the plug on a call, so I've not experienced any more call problems than with any other phone. iPhone 3G may, and I say MAY have just slightly better connectivity, but I can't tell for sure, so the difference is not enough to get excited about.Web and appps are more easily and diverse on Android than Apple to my mind, but again, if you're a dyed in the wool iPhone user, then you like their apps and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. It all works about the same, it's just a bit different. No complaints here for the Avail.The Avail has a very, very nice touch screen system that is easily mastered and quite responsive without being prone to mistakes. It is really easy to type, and maneuver the phone and apps without making mistakes. You'll find no complaints here either. I have huge hands and can type text messages without making a single mistake most of the time. It's very well engineered in this respect. The screen on the Avail is 3.5\" diagonal and very nice indeed. You'll see some reviews saying it lacks resolution, but you will NEVER see it when looking at the phone, it's simply beautiful, and text is crisp and sharp. I have no complaints at all with it. Viewing in direct sunlight is good, if not great, but highly usable for sure. One review I read said the Avail lacked auto brightness, but that is not true, it has it, and it's easily found and set, so I can't imagine where that came from, probably just a mistaken reviewer.The Avail has some nice features in addition to it's ordinary PPA device features. For one, voice control, similar to Apple's Siri, and it works just as well for me. Maybe I speak clearly or something, bu it seldom doesn't understand me. I even tried some mild curse words and it was able to understand them and enter them in text messages with the *** in the appropriate places, when you turn on the feature to mask known curse words in text. How cool is that? Voice calling is equally easy. It's a neat feature, and it works well for me, but I would guess it would respond to some voices and dialects differently, who knows.All in all the Avail is quite a phone. The neat thing is it's a Go Phone from AT&T; and it doesn't change your rate plan a bit, or even count as an upgrade, again really cool. I'm using mine on my regular rate plan. The Avail is made by ZTE, and I've had ZTE phones before, and find them very well made and of great quality. I did have a cheap, basic ZTE phone die on me, but I carried it at work and abused it unmercifully, so I doubt the phone was at fault, but who knows.If you're thinking about the latest phones, one word of caution for us men. Most of the latest batch of super phones are so large, you'll be stuck trying to find a way to carry them. I love how in computers we couldn't wait for large screens, then in phones it was to see how small they could make them and now we're trying to go large screen on them too. The Avail is about as large a phone as I'd want to carry on a daily basis. It is exactly the same size in all dimentions as the iPhone 3, they could be twins, so they're just the right balance between view-ability and carry-ability.Does the Avail have faults, yes, but they're common and minor. The screen smudges easily, but not a lot more than an iPhone, so no biggie, and it may be me. Other than that, I can't really think of anything that holds this phone back. I've tried everything on it, trying to complain, and it just does everything well.Day to day use of the Avail is quite nice, with no annoying things you must do to use it. Wake up, sleep, calls, texting and web are all easily done with no weird annoyances as with some phones. The Avail has not bad habits that I can find so far, and I've tried everything I can think of.I highly recommend the Avail, especially to those who're not lured by the latest hype of great phones. It does it all with little fanfare, and you'll love it. I can't think of a single thing that would keep this phone from getting 5-stars. Other phones my have more features, or bigger screens, or whatnot, but the Avail uses it's hardware nicely and does a fine job.EDITED REVIEW ADDITIONS:Now that I've had the phone for a while and have installed and uninstalled apps and played with it, I though I'd add some more to the review.First, battery life is only about average. When you do a lot it goes down fast. Who wouldn't have expected that? I have a pal with a Samsung SII and it literally eats it's battery before noon, so compared to it, the Avail is very good. Compared to an iPhone 4S, it's a bit worse, so it's average I guess.The OS is pretty fast and responsive on this phone, no huge lags at all. If you've used an iPhone 3G, then you know what lag is, this has none, as far as I can see, it's as good as the iPhone 4S in the speed category. Apps load and unload pretty fast, no complaints.The screen is nice and bright, I can see it in bright sunlight well and have no complaints. It is a beautiful display, if not the best, hi res out there.Pre-loaded apps are pretty good from At&T.; I use Places, Maps, QR scanner, Music player and all the utilities, so good choice At&t.; I haven't figured out what Data Balance is yet, but no biggie.One slight negative is the voice quality over the earphone. It's not bad, just a tad muffled, or rough, hard to describe. It's usually easily understood, but sometimes noticable. I often wonder if it's not the other phone I'm talking to, but it's something to be aware of. Not a huge negative, and certainly nothing to keep me from buying this phone. Loudspeaker is quite good and easily understood, very usable for phone calls. I rate it far above most of the phones I've tried. Both the earphone and speaker have plenty of volume, which is nice for a 'hard of hearing' guy like me.Internal storage could be a problem on the avail if you're into tons of apps. I've got a bunch on mine right now and have around 27-35mb free. There's plenty of memory to run apps, but internal storage is very close. You can put a lot of apps on your SD card, but most of the really good, useful apps need phone storage to work properly. I think most users will be fine, but the real app hungry folks, will need to pick and choose. As I said, I have a bunch on mine, but any more and I'll have to start removing some. The phone is still very useful and I really didn't leave much off of mine, but again, it's something to be aware of. I guess this is how you save money. This would definitely not stop me from buying or using the Avail.Overall, this is a fine phone. I don't know who posted they didn't need a data plan, but you do with At&t;, but, hey, that's what a smartphone does! The Avail does everytihng well without costing you your kids college money to do it. Unless you just have to have the latest, greatest smartphone, (and there's certainly nothing wrong with that!), then the Avail is a good option. It has no glaring faults, and actually is surprising in it's ability to perform for such a low cost. I'd love to have an iPhone, but the more I use the Avail, the more I wonder what it would do that this one won't.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone...... but one thing I would like to mention...", "Author": "sindee01708", "ReviewID": "R2NJHVI01ARD1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this phone in today.

I wanted to keep my pay-as-you go plan, but I wanted to get an app to combat the increasing amount of spam calls I was getting. This phone fits my needs and then some at a good price (around $107). I did not get the data plan. As others have said, if you don't need internet access 100% of the time, just using the wifi works fine. All I had to do was transfer my smart card from my old phone and it was up and running. I also added a SDMicro card for additional storage.One fault I give it is that AT&T; loads up a bunch of apps. They don't allow these apps (including a couple of games) to either be transferred over to the SD card or deleted if you want to free up space. The only apps that you can transfer to the card or remove altogether are the ones you add.The second fault is the lack of battery life. I don't use my phone very much and keep the wifi turned off generally, but you really have to charge it up every day. IMO, it's not worth having the data plan with this phone: If you're keeping the internet/wifi on all the time, I can't see the charge even lasting a full day. And I'm sure my usage is a lot less than most people.I'm using Mr. Number (free!) to handle the spam calls and it does a great job. You can choose to send the number to voice mail or hang-up.

It is just as good as Motorola, Samsung, HTC or other leading companies that run on Android's Gingerbread OS. I'm glad as an AT&T; Go Phone customer AT&T; is selling smartphone with Google OS with the most affordable smart phones on the market. With an AT&T; GoPhone prepaid service your monthly cost can be $50.00 or lower, higher depending on the voice plan and data package you buy from AT&T.; You have to buy a $25 250 minute voice plan or $50 unlimited voice plan. Plus a data plan to have full access to everthing this phone is capable of from the internet. AT&T; data plans are 10MB for $5.00, 200 MB for $15.00, or 500 MB for $25.00.

Went right back and purchased the Avail for about $125.I was very pleased with the phone, and it was simple enough for me to operate. I'm not very tech savvy, but I can do what I need to do. I liked the touch screen although it took some getting used to, I like the picture and video quality, and I liked that I could add apps. ( which I think is what ended up happening to it) I could use the phone in the house (ATT service sucks where I live)instead of going to my front door to make or take calls. I was completely happy!the only thing I didn't like about this phone was the camera. The button is on the screen so when you are taking pictures of yourself, which I do a lot because I'm so vain :)..it's hard to get them just right.I never had a problem with internet, I usually get online when WIFI is available, at home for instance when I don't feel like getting on my laptop. It was pretty fast. The only time I purchased a data plan was when I was going out of town so I could use my GPS or check my accounts etc while on the road. No problems.A couple of weeks ago, it started giving me error messages so I deleted some stuff. Then all of a sudden, the pics I had just taken where blank, etc. Finally it cut off and it will not come on past the welcome screen, it just sits there powering on and off until you take the battery off.So if you plan on only having a phone for a year..which it seems that's how long they last anyway, then this is a good phone. Unless, you are a chronic picture taker this phone should work.UPDATE: 04/26/13 took this phone to see if it could be repaired. The tech told me that this is just what this particular phone does and I should return it because of the warranty..only I didn't purchase the warranty, because it was a Gophone..it was cheap and they usually are good for at least 2yrs. So really this phone is not as good as I thought initially.

So I'll publish one now, posthumously for this phone.I loved this phone while it worked. It was my first smart phone, and was pretty easy to navigate. I did encounter some quirks along the way, but chalked them up to being a new device that I was just learning about. I'll discuss some of those quirks now.Battery life. All smart phones have issues with it but this one...I don't know. I went to people for help with the battery issue because we just couldn't figure out what was draining it. Finally downloaded Juice Defender and it helped a ton...but more on the \"juice\" issue later.Pictures/Videos. This really irked me. Randomly, the pictures would become unviewable, and videos, when uploaded or emailed, would lose sound.  Or they would do this weird thing where it looked like the subject of my video was aboard the Enterprise and we were going warp speed. Usually after we warped, the sound would fail. But that wasn't always the case.This was a huge problem for me because I take so many pictures and videos and always upload or email them promptly.Storage space. I didn't have very many apps on my phone. Just three or four, in addition to the garbage that came on it. But sure enough, as soon as I'd download an update for a pre-added app, my storage warning would come on. I cleaned caches and deleted messages and pictures and did everything that the ATT rep advised me to do-but only after I uninstalled updates did the storage warning go away. That was aggravating. Oh, and this happened after the first two weeks. That was weird.Going back to the first issue-juice. So my phone is now dead because it won't charge. It's been having issues for some time. I'd have it on the charger and walk by and it wasn't charging. Last night it finally gave up the ghost and won't charge at all. I got this phone in August and it's only February. That just isn't right.I understand that there's a margin for human error, and since this was my first smart phone, I know there are probably a ton of things I'm leaving out or didn't do or didn't know to do. But these things really, really aggravated me about this phone while I had it. I'm not sure if I'll order another one or go with something new but I probably won't order it from here, either way.Even with all of the problems, I did love this phone while it lasted.

I used to have the iPhone 3 and could no longer afford the data plan, so once my contract was up I got rid of it.  When I got this phone, I really liked it.  Nice touch screen, good speakers, takes extra memory.  It wasn't as nice as my iPhone, but I used wifi on it and didn't have to have a data plan, and it was much better than my flip phone, so I was happy.Six months after it was purchased for me (it was only used for 4 or 5 of those months), it died.  I was alerted that memory was almost full.  I thought that was strange.  I had added an 8 gig chip to it.  I deleted a bunch of stuff I didn't use. Then it said my texting was full, so before I did anything else I tried to restart.  I turned it off, waited a while, then turned it back on.  It kept looping the load screen.  I had to take the battery out turn it off.  I looked online to see if the problem had a fix.  I saw many people having the same problem.  Some said if they hit the right combo of buttons, you could get to a factory restore screen.  I gave this a try and never got to the factory restore screen.The next day I took the phone to the AT&T; store.  They tried doing a factory restore, but it didn't work, and they told me the phone was dead.  I asked about warranty, and they said if you buy from their store, they give you a year warranty, but if you buy online, they don't give you anything and I needed to contact Amazon.  I called Amazon, and they said they would give me a partial refund.

It's inexpensive enough to give you an exposure to the Android experience and I have no beef with the voice call quality (either on the handset or through bluetooth; and the other party can hear me well).Some misc stuff: To address the battery issue, I installed a widget to allow me to turn off the 3G connectivity from the home screen.  Since I don't use data all that much, I felt comfortable having 3G turned off and manually switch it on if I have to use it.And with the screen brightness set to a tad below middle, I can go through the entire day-- making short phone calls (say four 2 minute calls), send/receive SMS & MMS -- and still have at least 60% after 10 hours on battery.  But then again, that's with no 3G (no internet).  YMMV if your usage is heavy on the calls and you use 3G to check Facebook, Twitter, email, etc.And then... I rooted.  Which allowed me to freeze/delete some of the built-in system apps that was drawing power behind my back, and move some of the internal apps to the SD card, which freed up some internal memory. And with Juice Defender installed, I can go a tad longer between charges-- some days, I'll have at least 70% left after a day of light usage.  One note on root-- I noticed any third party widget that returned time, sys/battery status or weather info would shut down the Avail hard after about 15-30 minutes-- I could not power on the thing without having to plug it into a charger first. It doesn't hard shutdown when it wasn't rooted. Don't know exactly what's the true cause but if I exempt those widgets/apps from being auto-killed by Task Manager, it no longer shuts down on me.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow - goodbye contracts!", "Author": "Troy McClure", "ReviewID": "R2YT3YQFS4MHMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the AT&T; Avail for about 2 weeks and love it!I was an AT&T; contract user for 10 years and got tired of paying $30+ dollars for minutes I never used and unlimited texts I never sent/received.  I've always wanted a touch-screen phone, but had zero interest in a data plan.  I sit in front of a computer all day and have no need to access the Internet on my phone.  I opted for the $0.10 a minute plan (texts are $0.20 each).  I rarely use a cell phone (use my VOIP line almost exclusively), so I estimate I'll save a good $20 a month over what I was previously paying.  I put on $25 the phone which lasts 3 months - so even if I don't use it all before it expired, I wouldn't lose more than ~$8.50 a month.  I can always roll it over by purchasing another card.Pros:- Good size screen, but still fits in the pocket nicely.  Some of the new phones are practically tablets which is ridiculous to me.- Android - coming from a flip phone, anything is an improvement.  I find it very intuitive and for what I need it for, its more than enough.  Unlike a lot of people I don't spend hours on my phone so I wouldn't notice a huge difference between iOS and Droid anyway.- Wifi - I don't have a data plan, nor do I plan on getting one.  I can still use it over wifi and download apps.  Obviously I won't always be near a hotspot, but more often than not I am.  Probably the best feature to me.Cons:- I haven't figured out how to read a text without my phone marking it as read.  I got 2 spam texts and tried to delete them - even though I didn't read it first (just held my finger down on the message and clicked delete on the popup menu), I assume Android marks it as having been read since I got $0.40 taken off my balance.  Not a big deal, but since I have the pay-per-text plan it means I either have to pay for texts I don't really want, or I just will let them stack up and figure out what to do with them later.- Battery life is so-so.  If you keep wifi off and let it sit idle, it is not horrible.  I don't really expect smartphones to be good on battery life, so frankly it's not a huge shocker to me.**Update**- This has a very small internal memory of 156mb.  If you look at the comments, you'll see that by default Android installs applications to the internal memory and not the SD card (opposite of how a digital camera works).  You can manually move some to the card, but some apps don't allow you to do that.  For me it's not a huge deal, but if you plan on having a lot of apps, be aware of this.----------Overall:I've only had it for 2 weeks so I may have a different opinion down the line, but for anyone who wants a full-featured phone but doesn't care about having a specific model, this is great.

The phone did pretty much what I needed, but after you've had an iphone and you downgrade to this (my phone was stolen), you'll definitely need some time to adjust.

It's like the annoying mother-in-law of phones! (No offense to mothers-in-law, mine is great!) The camera SUCKS. Not a primary camera by any means but at this point I barely use it at all...and I love photography of all kinds. *Instagram junkie here!!!* Trying to slide the little green dot to answer the phone is marginal at best, missed a lot of calls that way. Luckily my husband understands, as his phone does the same thing. No funny business going on! I hate that stupid screen that comes up when you unlock the phone: 6 dots with stuff you can't change (if you can I haven't figured out how yet...the manual doesn't mention them, like they don't exist) and you have to choose one to go on to the next screen. Somehow I got Facebook as one of them, so more often than not I pick that one to get past the magical lock screen. Never seen anything like it!

The external speakers are a little tinny, but that's to be expected on a phone. The camera quality is great. All in all, he is really happy with his phone, and I'm not glad it wasn't $300.

Glad I did; after 3 months, I have no complaints at all. I'm pretty much a texter and don't do much talking on the phone (I can't stand it), so this worked out perfectly. My last month on Verizon, I dropped down to the 1,000 texts / 450 minutes per month plan. Well, I didn't monitor the texts and at the end of the month - BAM! $175 extra for trying to save a few dollars (that plan was $50 / month). I get unlimited texts and 250 minutes of talk for $25 / month (check around the Internet and find the refills cheaper; newphonestore.com has $50 refills for $47.50 and that includes Internet ($25 plan does not) of which I don't have because I spend enough time on the Internet at home; I don't need to surf the net on my phone). No more scary phone bill at the end of the month for me. As for the phone, same thing - no complaints. Just like a smartphone that you would have with a contract plan. Although I don't get the Internet on it, it has full capabilities of doing so. The photo quality from the camera is amazing. I used to carry a separate camera for taking photos at work but no longer do so; I just use the phone (there is NO flash for the camera, so it's daytime photos only). Again, no complaints on the phone or the service. If you want to save a few bucks a month, go with the Go Phone; you won't be disappointed.PS - As for coverage, so far, I've had no issues.

This phone comes with Gingerbread out of the packaging and delivers a great android smartphone to your surprise. I bought this phone for my preteen daughter after she saved money for an upgrade, I put in half of her costs as a gift. You get the quality of an Android/iPhone without breaking your bank. The screen is amazing for the phone cost, accessories are cheap on amazon and ebay. I would say the only thing that anyone could remotely complain about is the lack of internal memory (although you can expand the phones capabilities up to 32 gigs,) you need internal memory to run much of it and store cache files natively and the screen keyboard which is on the small side. Still we managed to download and/or transfer around 15 apps to the sd card. Th battery life is also short but not unlike all of the other Android phones out there (we've had 6 so far).  The screen is great, the touch feature is extremely responsive, the apps that are available are in demand, and the phone does it's primary function of calling/texts extraordinarily well. No matter what I won't take away a star from a product that more than met expectations in a prepaid market saturated with overpriced, cheaply made and feature lacking phones. This one looked nice, felt nice and more importantly, functioned well.The only con, and this has nothing to do with the phone itself, is AT&T.;  I bought it at the exact time they were restructuring their phone plans.  The former phone was an LG Prime. Data use was extremely limited on the antiquated edge network so we upgraded to this phone and our pricing got \"upgraded\" as well.  I had her on the 2/day plan which usually worked to about $100 for 6 months.  The 100 dollars in her account was usable for a year.  The original idea was to keep her on that plan and just buy a small data package to use whatsapp in order to text her to make sure she got off the bus ok, got home alright, and that she studied/finished homework. That didn't work out as they stopped selling the data packages to anyone on the .10/min and $2/per day plans. They pretty much force you to go to a prepaid $25/$50 (250min/unlimited texting) with the option to buy data if you wanted.  Otherwise it is .01 per 5/kb.  That can add up to quite a bit. So we're on the $25, it's a little more money now but otherwise the phone has been a gem.

The phone eventually just gets to the point where it just shows the ATT Rethink Possible splash screen over and over and over again. It will do this indefinitely. There is no way to reverse it. I have taken it to the ATT store and they just tell me to purchase a new phone.Also, The original charger that came with the phone is a piece of poop. The charger has a short in it. It doesn't charge reliably. I have tested it on multiple phones and the same thing happens to each phone that is connected to the original charger. I have had to purchase another charger in order to even start using the phone.Another thing is that the phone only has 150MB of actual internal memory. This limits your apps down to essentially what is on the phone when you first purchase it. Most apps need to have some memory saved on the internal phone memory in order to function. This phone is so full of apps when it comes in the box, that you can't put anything else on it other than a few small apps. The apps that come on the phone are not able to be erased. So apps like UNO, Twitter and other stupid driving games that take up precious space, you are not able to delete. Even though I have never used a single one of these apps, I have had to keep them on the phone.Another thing is that ATT offers unlimited talk, text and web for 50$. This is highly inaccurate. The actual cost of having unlimited service is closer to 70-80 a month due to the service chargers that are tacked on. You can only order refill amounts in odd amounts. This makes it so that you actually spend as much as a regular service plan. You will always have left over amounts no matter how much you use.

One of my main uses for the phone, being in an area with mountains, is to be able to get onto skype to talk to friends and business customers. The bluetooth works for a normal (non skype) phone call. The microphone worked for nothing else however (skype, voice recording, voice commands, etc\"). And the device is very buggy when it comes to bluetooth.Below refers to Non calls (includes voice funtions in the phone and skype calls only).First time connecting the bluetooth device: bluetooth speaker worked, no mic worked with bluetooth active.Second time (after restarting my phone a few times): bluetooth speaker worked, the phone's speaker mic worked.Third time (after restarting phone again): bluetooth speaker worked, no mic worked with bluetooth active.So, I took the phone back and am now out 45 dollars. 35 dollars for the restocking fee (even though the item was defective), and the 10 dollars of minutes that I had put on the phone (minus the minutes used trying to get the bluetooth to work for regular calls. Even for regular calls it didn't work right away.On top of this, the sales lady was non aggressively rude.

(while I didn't expect the minutes back, when I had asked if I would be refunded the minutes, she had told me yes before).I asked for a manager before signing the return receipt that charged me 35 dollars for the restocking fee, to ask if they still charge this for a defective product. I was told that if I wasn't exchanging the item, that I would be charged the restocking fee, even if defective. I gave up and stated that I would pay the money, but I am no longer going to be an ATT customer.After the manager was gone, I stated to the saleswoman that I am sorry and I know it isn't her fault that this happened.

She could have added minutes and used it otherwise.  To be honest, there were 2 texts on the phone but both of us dismissed them as another irritating Facebook promotion.An email or a call (even automated) to the PRIMARY number on the account would have been appreciated before complete disconnection and I would have gladly put on more money.

I'm not a big cell phone user so I've had a basic pay as you go phone that I've had forever.  I recently bought a new Honda Civic that has in-dash blue tooth capability so I thought I would get a new phone to use with it. Small problem... the car keeps acknowledging that \"the phone has been connected\".... over, and over, and over... about every 6o seconds - SUPER annoying. I finally had to disable the blue tooth because I couldn't get it to stop - bummer because it sort of defeats the purpose. I know that it isn't the car because I've tested it with several other people's phones & it doesn't do this. I'm going to take it and the car to my local AT&T; store to see if they can figure it out, if not, then on to the dealership. Either way it's really a pain.

Then, back to my normal usage, to preserve battery I turned off bluetooth and Wifi, the battery lasted 1.5 days standby.  Actually, not total standby as I set the alarm for it, once.  By the way, because the menu button would wake the phone up (a bad design since it is easily touched in the pocket) I carefully kept the phone in such a way it would stay standby.Thinking of getting a bad unit, I complained and Amazon sent me a different one.  No difference!  Considering my previous phone which started out standby for 5 days, after 3 years it dropped to 1 day which was the reason for a new phone.

The lack of camera flash really limits photo opps.

All other phones I've had since 2002 would come apart, battery out, back cover off from a low fall, but this one has Absolutely NO shock resistance, and cheap, CHEAP materials.The ONLY good quality of this phone is that you just SLIP in the (activated from your current account) sim card and use it...until you can't take it anymore, and seek out a better model Android for AT&T; GoPhone because AT&T; is the ONLY signal you get in your house & there is no long distance plan on your home phone.  Even  so, don't be surprised to find that while there are NO areas in the house that won't lose the signal, there are some spots that NEVER get a signal and kill the call if you step there (like the kitchen!)...

Not too worried because I can use my other charger with same connection, voltage and Amps.4. Can't find where phone shows how much battery you have left. It just warns when it's low.5. Manual enlightenment is limited in some areas.One other issue. Phone storage is limited and there are many apps you can't put on the SD card. I had to delete some of my favorite apps because of it.

It appears to be a great phone, we also looked at this phone at a local AT&T; store.Wednesday I received a text message from AT&T;, saying as of April 18th I must have a $25 per month plan to continue with my $5 per month data plan. That would be $25 per month plus $5 data plan at a total of $30 + tax every monthFor my use that more than doubles the amount I use/pay now.  I don't need the 250 plan minutes, nor the unlimited text.And now I have a phone that was just shipped that will be just as costly!THE GOOD NEWS - smartphones still can be used on your home wifi or hot spots. And, the AT&T; Avail is a good phone for the money. So we will just not have a data plan.Another note on AT&T; : I was told by the rep at their 800# that they will be dropping their 10 cents per minute plan. If you currently have that plan you can still use it, but it won't be available for new customers. It SHOULD be available for our new phone since it will have the same account and phone number - just upgrading the phone.
