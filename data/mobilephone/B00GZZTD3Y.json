A detailed review!", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R1W6FOQU84IK79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to let you know, I bought this tablet phone combo in White on Amazon as it was just what I was searching for as it is a tablet and an 100 percent GSM UNLOCKED phone! I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have so many overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this phone/tablet out to great lengths and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this amazing device. *This is a excellent choice in an ALL IN ONE device. For me, I use it as my primary phone with no contract plan that includes minutes and a small data plan. (Most of the time, I am on WiFi for the internet but I need my minutes to make and receive phone calls etc).Also I want to state that the phone accepts a MICRO Sim card, not a regular full sized Sim. Since I had an old Samsung Tab 2 3g with a regular Sim, I just removed my old Sim Card from the older tablet phone and cut the Sim with a Micro Sim cutter, placed it into my Tab 3 phone/tablet and my data was there, my minutes were there, worked great!Also this tablet installed an update to the OS from December 2013 and this tablet phone runs so fast now!If you are looking for: a lightweight combo phone and tablet that is very easy to hold in one hand comfortably and you want a basic and easy to use tablet, then consider this tablet. While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies. And as a bonus, if you request it, I will share with you how to get Archived Flash so you can watch online videos on the tablet. And I encourage you to ask me questions in the comments (should you have a question) about this tablet and I will answer all questions. Here are the Pros and the Cons below.PROS:1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is good in most places I tested. And I received a STRONG WiFi signal on this device.2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB.3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily.4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port.5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages.6- I had a Tab 3 7.0 WiFi only and sold it to a friend, bought this one and find that it is a much better tablet.CONS:- Low internal storage - this tablet comes with 8GB internal storage (advertised). Because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage. This is not good because when you install an app from the Playstore, it goes onto your internal storage not on the External SD card. (The external SD card is meant for personal files such as your music, photos, home movies,etc).**The GOOD NEWS IS: If you do not install a lot of huge games onto this tablet, you will probably do just fine with this storage.- Heat \u2013 Under normal conditions (when not running intense games or downloading files etc), this tablet runs very cool. It did get up to 102 degrees ONCE when I downloaded lots of apps from the Playstore, but then it went back to a low 80 degrees after that. This is normal though for this particular tablet, not a cause for any alarm.Bottom line and Summary:Would I buy this phone tablet all over again? Yes in a heartbeat! If you are looking to buy a LARGE PHONE that you can use as a MINI TABLET, this is the one that I recommend to you as I love mine!Since I am a techie, you can ask me any questions in the comments under this review.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GZZTD3Y"}}
