So I went to BestBuy and purchased this new lg optimus exceed. This is by far one of the fastest phones I have had on a prepaid plan. I love how fast it is and how accurate the speech to text is. The only complaint I have is I wish the battery life was better. I can get about 5 to 6 hours before I have to out it back on the charger with medium use.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone, lots of flaws.", "Author": "Ana_Marsh", "ReviewID": "R323BHYSSTZFFE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like the user interface. As a first time smart phone user, it made it easy to get the hang of things. HOWEVER this phone is useless for Navigation. (one of the reasons I went to smartphone). It takes so long to upload the navigation maps that I literally will sit in the parking lot for an hour plus trying to load navigation before giving up and calling someone to give me directions. I don't know if I can throw too many stones because, after all, it IS a prepaid phone. Battery life is terrible. I understand that it runs low fast, and was naive at first because I'd never had a smart phone. I did start to compare my phone to my husbands droid and the battery life is leagues better. This phone is very good for checking e-mail. it's hard to send picture messages because in my old phone i could be in my picture gallery and select that I wanted to send the picture. Or I could go through messages and attach the photo. There's only one way that I've found you have to go through messages. If you try to do anything on data, (I was attempting to use skype for instance) it is a constant battle because it keeps stopping to search for wi-fi signal. I will turn wi-fi off manually to attempt to fix the problem and it will turn itself back on. generally I perfer wi-fi over data useage, but when I'm in a building that has protected wi-fi connections that I can't access, my phone won't let me use data because it keeps trying to unsuccessfully connect to wi-fi. This could be fixed through settings, but it will turn wi-fi back on after you turn it off.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything your expecting and more", "Author": "Robby", "ReviewID": "REQDKZSGDEVH8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by for the best prepaid android phone on the market it blows away the others I have been using this phone for a while now and it is every bit as good as my droid razor max other than the fact that it is only 3g.

Beside the crappy battey life it does what a phone is suppose to do. Camera quality is nice, and the overall performence is fast but will at times slow down ive noticed that if you text more then 3 people at a time the phone wont respond very well, it slows down quite a bit to where it takes me 2-3 minutes just to type a simple sentence that should take 30 seconds.

It is a re-branded LG Lucid.  The battery life is not great and the phone loses data connection a few times, at least on mine.  It has great call quality and when the data is working the phone is very fast.

I turned it on and I immediently fell in love with it I love how it has soooo much space, the front camera I love , and the swipe texting it has the only flaw that it has it that the battery life sucks and it too forever for it to charge so my advice would be keep a  charger at all times but other than that I love the phone and I tossed my samsung illusion in my top drawer and played with my LG ! So i would suggest buying this phone but keep a charger for it", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I think people write reviews before they have had the product for a while", "Author": "richard", "ReviewID": "R2MKU9ZBR3KEWC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is cool for the first month or two. After a while it while start to slow down A LOT. It will start to freeze, apps will crash, and the damn keyboard cant even keep up with how fast I text and its a pain in the ass. When you open your text messages it takes a while for messages to load, videos take a long time to send people (sometimes more than 12 hours for a 30 sec video). Camera is okay, but even that is slow. Overall I think this phone is pretty s***ty. I have to constantly restart it and you cannot do very basic things like send contact info. You have to manually go into your contacts, copy the number, go back into messages, paste it, AND THEN YOU CAN FINALLY send the number. I say the word \"finally\" because everything takes a while to load. This is the second LG phone I have had and I am just about over LG and there phones.

At first, it was a good phone, no complaints.  I had it for about 3 months and it stopped holding a charge.  Took it to the Verizon store, and they sent me a refurbished replacement.  The backlighting on the screen wasn't working (right out of the box!).  I'm now on my 3rd one, we'll see how long this one lasts.  I had better luck with my cheap phones than I've had with this one.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG DOES NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY; PHONE IS A JOKE", "Author": "Doctor Bombay", "ReviewID": "R35XT6XQW0QI9F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had my last LG phone for more than two years before I decided to trade up to a new LG phone. The earlier one was great. I expected at least decent performance from the LG Exceed. Instead, after a month or so of use, the screen became jittery, the screen display would fly up and down, the display would go black during calls and the phone would freeze at random. LG requires that you mail the phone to them at your own expense. I was without the phone for about 3 weeks. Then LG returned the phone to me AS IS, no repair. They found no defect and no trouble with the phone. The phone does not work. I called them again and they said that I could \"request\" a repair authorization and that they would pay the shipping this time. So I have the opportunity to go without the phone again for a few weeks while they choose whether to fix the phone of send it back. Just to let you know what cheapskates.schisters these people are, they do not replace your phone with a new one. You will receive a phone that has been returned and \"repaired\" by LG. Run from this company. Don't buy anything from them.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK at first but not for long", "Author": "ESB", "ReviewID": "R2CFD67ZBPUPC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to agree with the other more \"negative\" reviews. I've had my phone for about 1 year, and as I type this review on my computer, my cell phone is currently typing random numbers and letters, pulling up random apps and the internet BY ITSELF--and there's no way for me to stop it because the touch screen is unresponsive. I've attempt to due a hard & soft reset but the problem is still going on. I have to admit this was going on within the first few months of having the phone but it was corrected by me doing a battery pull (hard reset) so I didn't mind it much as I don't use my phone for the majority of the day. (By the way the phone just put itself on speaker phone and called my voicemail--scared the crap out of me.) I know this all may seem like a overreaction or a fake review but I assure you this is NOT the case. I would not recommend this phone UNLESS you only plan to use it for a short period of time (5-7 months) or as a cheap first phone for a child that you're afraid may easily break a more expensive phone. But for the average smart phone user I'd say MOVE ON. After doing a Google search I just found that LG phones are known for this issue. I have to say I will never buy another LG again. So looks like I'm officially on the hunt for a new phone.

Probably because I have to have it charging constantly from lack of battery charge.It has issues while texting, the keyboard function either crashes or glitches. The malfunction locks up the phone or somehow starts new words in the middle of a word already typed. example : \" I cannot bethis phone is not yet a year old lieve.\"  its extremely annoying as it happens several times a day.  it seems like a soft ware issue that has not been addressed in the updates.the phone lags during calls. the screen blacks out when its not supposed to leaving me trying to hit the button to bring it back. sometimes it comes on by itself while I am hitting the button to bring it back effectively making me put t to sleep and needing to wake it up again while the person on the end wonders where I am at as I struggle with the phone.the speaker volume has been not as loud as it used to be.  the text alert used to be loud enough to hear pretty much anywhere in the house if I left it in any room. now I miss texts if I run water with the phone in the same room.the settings will not remain customized.  ringtones I have set will need reset in short time.its also very light and very smooth. slippery.  I had a motodroid I kept for like 4 years before it started having issues. I dropped it ONCE. its probably the source of the issues it had.  I have dropped this thing CONSTANTLY. it slides too easily. I have fumbled it getting it out of my pocket because it is slippery hard plastic.  the case is cracked too.I liked it until things started going wrong. the screen is big enough for man hands and very bright/clear. it takes pretty decent pics and video for a cheap phone. its not overly large.I would rate this phone a lot higher if I didn't believe it has build quality issues and design flaws. I am not sure if it's the design that caused my constant dropping of the phone made the issues happen or if they would have happened anyway. I am saying that to be fair because I did really like this phone while it lasted.now I am shopping for a new phone.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery Life Kills It", "Author": "Eric Flapjack Ashley", "ReviewID": "R1GZLFD4EKG8RK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Optimus Exceed is a decent phone as a prepaid entry level model, but the horrible battery life kills any kind of enjoyment you can get from it.  It runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and is relatively speedy as far as processing power goes.

The phone feels substantial and solid. It has alot of memory and it's very easy to use. The sound is loud and clear but you can turn it down.  It's got all the bells and whistles. I agree that the battery runs down quickly, thus the 4 stars instead of 5, but I haven't had a problem yet because I always have a charger cable. And I don' t use saver mode.
