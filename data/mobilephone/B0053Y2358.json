After looking around all over the internet for a replacement phone I found out that the thunderbolt was the cheapest phone that still has all of the smart phone features that I wanted.

Don't waste your time with Craigslist since Amazon has a return policy (which is something the seller will laugh at when you call them back about your phone).I do not have much experience with Android phones since the one my corporate gave up sucked (Vortex-entry level).  My only complaints on this phone is the proximity sensor doesn't automatically pick up/turn on when I take my face away from the phone.  You have to wake it up in order for you to end a call or press the touch pad.Do yourself a favor and buy the extended battery, a 32GB Micro SD card, and a case from Amazon.
