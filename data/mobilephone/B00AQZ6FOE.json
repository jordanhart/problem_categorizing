The major thing is the seller included a note that if you let the battery run down completely on this model that the charger will not work.  You then need an external charger, which we had to order within the first week.  It is inconvenient to make sure you watch so the battery stays charged.  Other than that not a bad phone, especially if you want a basic phone to avoid data charge of $30 a month from verizon.  Verizon sure is pushing everyone to use a smart phone.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "poor quality", "Author": "T.

What a great deal! The phone is priced right. It does exactly what it needs to do. Makes calls, sends txts & doesn't take up too much pocket space.

It's touch navigation system could be a lot easier to navigate.  However, when combined with: the difficulties to text on that tiny keyboard, the fact that the speaker function produces an echo that distracts whomever you're talking to, the phone's low memory capacity which forces you to delete text and voice messages constantly, AND THEN the battery dying on me after less than 2 weeks.

Bowden", "ReviewID": "R6X1VSWFJ8J35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the phone today... so this is not a full review. I'll come back in a few weeks and do that. This review is mainly so I can confirm for other potential buyers that this is a viable option. I was nervous about buying this phone. I didn't want the hassle of returning it if I couldn't actually get it to work on my Verizon account.  Those worries turned out to be unnecessary. I got the phone out of the box, took the back off, jotted down the serial numbers and put the battery in. Then I went to the Verizon website and signed in. There was a little confusion about which of the three serial numbers they actually wanted. I popped up the Verizon instant chat thingee and we got the right serial number in the right box and they walked me through the rest of it, which wasn't much, really. I dialed *228 and followed the instructions.I have now entered my contacts and sent a practice text and phone call to my Mom. So far so good. I'll be back in a few weeks after I have played with it and write a full review. I am looking forward to putting in a memory card and loading some music on it and seeing what that is like. My expectations are not super high in that regard, so if it does what it is supposed to, I'll be very satisfied. more on that later.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone!", "Author": "Emilie", "ReviewID": "R1GY7F9DB094SI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has been the best phone I've ever had.
