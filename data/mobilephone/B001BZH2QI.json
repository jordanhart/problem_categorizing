Most people dont realize it, but this nokia really can do just about anything (and more) than that iphone your thinking about. (save the apps on the iphone) But i truly am more happy now with my Nokia. its such a solid, substantial piece of technology, in every way i can think of, nokia made this thing of quality materials. not fragile at all.So what about the monthly internet (data plan) ?Well, with the iphone get ready to pay 30$ a month for data alone! that is a rough estimate of  720$ over a span of a two year contract with at&t.;Why not get this Nokia, sign up for at&t;'s \"smartphone data plan\" (also known as MEdia net thing) i pay literally 15$ a month flat rate for unlimited data. it takes no genius to realize thats about 360$ savings over 24 months. (that number covers the actual cost of the phone it self!)Do not be swayed away either by the e71's business appeal. I am a college kid and very into electronics, and i can honestly say this phone has everything a person would need (business/just for fun/practical uses) and seriously has technology a year ahead of its time. in otherwords, i could see myself using this phone in two years and still be more than pleased with it.Buy also a micro SD card. i bought an 8gb card on here for around 20$ these plug into the phone and allow you to save your media on the phone. i.e. music, videos, pictures ect. this gives me a wonderful media device thats easily comparable to any ipod.one setback on the phone is the 2.5mm headphone jack. Standard is 3.5mm so your favorite headphones wont plug into the phone without an adaptor. i bought one on dealextreme.com for literally 1.26$ (no tax, and no shipping) the adaptor is a 2.5mm male to 3.5mm female adaptor, and works wonderful.Nokia did things right with this device.the iphone strays away from the fundamentals of what a cell phone is really about: making/ recieving calls. Nokia sticks to simplicity and makes using the phone for calls/texts VERY straightforward and easy.you wont be dissapointed, and at this price its really a deal that can save you a good chunk of change in the future.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but overrated", "Author": "M.

I have used a Motorola Q9h and really wanted something  that could connect to WiFi.  While the E71 does that, it does not offer much more.  It has a few nice features, but there are many things that make you wonder what Nokia was thinking.Pro:Build quality is greatEasy set up, auto wizards did everythingBrowser is greatCall quality and signal is good (better than some LG phones but no better than my Q9h)Menu system is very good (much better than Windows mobile which hides so much).Lots of option for pic takingPC Suite is a nice free app for syncing -integrates well with OutloolGPS with Google maps is very quick to pick up signalNice to have a phone w/o all the garbage they put on the ones you get from the network operators.Syncs Outlook notesCons:Sending and deleting emails should be easier, they make it a 2 step process.  I do a lot of email and this is a major disappointment.When using IMAP for mail, no way to move emails to other folders.Categories for contacts does not carry over from OutlookNo ability to filter contacts, you must use groups.  Unable to set a default groupDoes not play quicktime or windows media video filesPic quality is just ok, color are really off unless the light is greatSignal strength meter is almost impossible to readLimited ability to customize home page, no ability to add shortcuts to non original apps (lots of plug ins for Windows mobile allowed much more flexibility)Enabling call forwarding is a very involved processAlarms are not well done.  You can not save an alarm turned off.All in all I like the phone but am not sure there is much of an improvement over the Motorola Q9h.  Generally better menu system, but email is a weak point on the E71.  If you are a light email user and are looking for a good looking phone, the E71 is a good choice.  If you are a heavy email user, go with either a Blackberry or Windows Mobile phone such as the Motorola q9h", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "I am happy with mine but like anything else it can be improved.", "Author": "M. Kertajaya", "ReviewID": "R1342OOGBZLBYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a long time user of smartphone. Started with one of the first smartphones, Ericsson p800. Then some windows flavor as well as blackberry.This phone is by far the best phone I have owned. And I think this phone is probably one of the best looking phones in the market. Here are some of the things I love about this phone:1. It has a very strong signals.2. Call/voice quality is really good. Speaker is loud as well.3. Battery lasts a long time.4. GPS works really well and fast (this phone has 3G). GPS works especially well with google map/earth.5. It plays youtube out of the box.6. One hand handling capability from typing, taking calls, etc.7. Screen is bright and still usable under bright sunlight.8. Lots of applications available including a free SEVEN push email solution which is still beta version.9. Multi-tasking.10. FM Radio.11. An ability to subscribe to podcasts and download the only the ones you like.Some of the features that can be improved:1. Audio playback like play list creation and sound quality when using headphone are not as good.Creating a play list requires too many clicks. I am using a kingston 4gb and often my song list just disappear. I need to refresh it many times.I can hear a hissing sound from the headphone. From what I read many people experience this as well.2. Lack of task manager. I can not kill an application like I can on windows phone.Correction: The task manager came with the phone can kill most of the programs but not all. A media player for some reasons can't be killed using this. And in my experience, this is the one that hangs often.3. Keyboard takes a little time to get used to. I don't have big hands but I am still trying to adjust to this keyboard.4. Copy and paste only works in some applications. With windows phone, you can always copy and paste almost everywhere. Not with this phone.5. Headset output is not a standard size.I found 'Shure' makes an adapter which allows you to use regular size (3.5 size?) headphone of your choice. This adapter comes with a microphone. There are a lot cheaper one, but none comes with microphone. This adapter was made for Palm device but works well with E71.6. I like the FM radio but this feature only works when you attach the included headset. I think the antenna is actually on the headset.I hope this brief review helps. Some of the feature like camera, I have never really used.

I've had windows mobile, palm and blackberry phones in the past to compare this to.Very thin, sturdy (all metal casing) it feels solid in your hand, professional and sleek.  Screen is good, keyboard better than most, camera, GPS, email....it essentially has it all.  \"Mail for exchange\" software works flawlessly for \"work\" push email and calendar syncing.  Battery life is outstanding (two days on one charge with moderate to heavy use...which is as good as it gets).Nokia makes everything customizable with many shortcuts available to get to all functions.  Really a great thing about Nokias in general and this one is no different.  Short press the dedicated calendar key (like on a Palm) for the calendar, long press for a new calendar entry.  4 dedicated keys for these types of things (calendar, messaging, contacts and a home key) and 6 on screen shortcuts, plus two more soft key shortcuts and even some keyboard long press shortcuts on top of that.  That means one click access to just about everything you would want to do with the phone.OS crashes less than windows mobile, though not as good as blackberry (simply turn off / on to get back to normal - this happens once every two weeks or so if you use it heavily).  There are many app's available for download.  Camera is good in good light, video quality is surprisingly good (even in bad light).  GPS works great (download google maps).This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned and as good as any smartphone available on the market right now in terms of build quality, battery, features and certainly in terms of looks (slimmer than the iPhone 3G and as I said before - it is made out of metal).  The metal gives the phone a certain gravitas, a certain feeling of quality that it generally not available in phones.  It feels like a well made tool, it just feels good in your hand.Get a blackberry if you mostly just need email and don't care as much about multi media and games and the like.Get an iPhone if you mostly want multi media and the like and not so much email.Get this phone if you are in the middle (though it handles email and calendar syncing about 95% as good as a blackberry - I use it heavily for work email and have no complaints).", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful phone if you can overlook a few little things and get the right plan", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R1VG3X7451EK5D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a 6-year T-Mobile customer. Why? Because frankly, I'm too scared to change! Really though, I have a $29 a month plan (Business 300) that is no longer offered - 300 whenever, unlimited weekends, 100 texts, which has worked well for my needs and budget.  Unfortunately all the handsets I've owned (Nokia and Motorola) have had terrible reception much of the time.  I was blaming T-Mobile until I got the Nokia E71 and I'm THRILLED with the call clarity! Both on my end and for the recipients of my calls, who say they can't tell I'm on my cell - 'a first'.I purchased this item as a Gold Box deal after reading online reviews here and elsewhere, that gave it mostly glowing reviews.  I also liked that it would work on T-Mobile or ATT, which are both available in my area.  I had hopes of using T-Mobile's $10 a month add-on for 'unlimited web for phones' (previously called Web2Go.Upon opening the box I was surprised to see that the size and thickness of the phone are almost identical to my iPod Touch.  Very pretty - sexy even - the phone has an easy to use keyboard (my first phone with this type) with raised keys.  I have small hands and didn't find it tough to punch in numbers or texts, but people with bigger fingers might. The keyboard is backlit, which is very helpful, but it's not very bright.  I bet there's a setting for that which I've not yet discovered though.The documentation, a CD for the PC Sync suite from Nokia, an AC charger, earphone/microphone combo, white (slip-in style) case, battery, and phone are in the box. I also bought a OtterBox Commuter Case for Nokia E71x (Black) to protect it.  This case takes away from the beauty of the phone, but gives a bit of added protection.  The Otterbox Defender series is even better, but more expensive.Not being a big reader of directions, I tried to wade through the manuals anyway.  That was daunting.  There is a lot of info on this phone as it has a lot of functions! I found that after I swapped my SIM card from my previous T-Mobile phone and got to the home screen on the E71, I could press 'menu' and then 'help', and again 'help', to be where I wanted to be to learn about this device.Some cool functions found on this phone and discussed in 'help':-Adobe Reader-Activation Keys-Active Notes-Barcode Reader... VERY unusual to find on a phone and very cool to save product info and compare prices.-Dictionary-Flash Player-GPS-Internet Radio-Modem - you can connect this phone (assuming you have mobile web on it activated) to a laptop for example, and use it as a wireless modem.-Net calls... it has a webcam built in.-Printing... add a printer to sync with your device to print docs.-Real Player-Recorder-Wireless keyboard...if you link it to your phone, you can use it!A 'Tutorial' section is a available in the 'Help' section as well, with short animated videos on 'how-to'.  I like this area, but even with these helps... this phone has a lot to offer and a lot to learn.The E71's build quality is excellent!  Metal housing makes a world of difference in the feel of the phone.  I expect it would add to the durability as well.  My Nokia 5300 with a hard case started cracking within months of light use, as have other plastic phones I've owned, so for me, this is a big deal.Navigating the phones many functions is relatively easy, but yes, it takes time to get the hang of it.  Buttons for specific functions like email, 'home' and others are clearly marked.  The side of the phone has a mini-usb port and mini-SD card slot, covered by rubber inserts. Volume controls are on the opposite side of the phone and work easily and well.The 3.2mp camera is better than previous phones I've owned and it does come with a flash, which is new to me on a camera phone. Images were blurry or 'cloudy' looking, until one reader of the review mentioned taking the plastic film off the lens. \"Duh!\"  Usually I remember these things, but not this time.  Taking the film off the camera lens definitely makes for better pictures - clarity wise - however the color of the images taken indoors with the flash, tends to be a bit off. Not a huge deal as photo editing software takes care of a multitude of sins, but you probably wouldn't want this camera to be your only one.Charging port is at the base of the phone, with the speaker and on/off at the top.  I noted the microphone is at the lower left-hand side of the phone.  This is great if you are right handed while making calls, but call quality seems to suffer just a bit when you switch to left-handed chats.  Microphone placement... who knew?!The keypad does lock and the screen goes dark rather quickly.  Again, probably just a setting issue I've not yet discovered in my 3 days playing with it. I looked it up in the book how to 'unlock' - pressing two buttons - which while a pain, is no big deal either.The screen is big enough for most things.  Not fantastic for viewing web content, but this isn't really a web-maximized phone either.  The OS alone should tell you that, and if you're looking for a multi-media phone, keep looking.  It will email, do basic web browsing, and open media files if you have the appropriate data plan.  I didn't want to pay for the $20-30 a month web plan, so I am trying out the $10 a month unlimited web plan for phones with TM right now.  While I have a very basic Facebook interface for example, it's nothing like you would see on your home computer.  It is however, handy to Google things, comparison shop while out and about, check weather, etc..., which is good enough for me.  **I have been told by some that T-Mobile may try and kick me off this $10 plan saying if I have a smartphone I need the more expensive one.  My time with T-Mobile would be cut short if this happens, and I'd be looking to switch to ATT, as for me, this would be simply a way for more cash without 3G!  T-Mobile does not have 3G to this phone, but the phone IS capable of it.I was going to return this phone, but that was due more to T-Mobile issues rather than the phone. I love the clear call quality most of all and the easy texting. Admittedly, basic stuff. The internet, if available, also affords some nice things like email, Skype chat, Facebook, and Internet radio (too bad it's got that 2.5mm port versus the 3.5mm standard).In conclusion, it's a really nice phone for the right user. Not the best for multi-media or taking pictures, but a quad-band phone that has exceptionally good call quality, nice speaker and keyboard, moves quickly through apps, has built-in GPS (no internet needed) and Wifi capable.  I really like it, which I can't say about many phones I've owned. So the only real problems I find with it are linked more to T-Mobile as a provider than the phone itself. Which leads me to the basic question: 'Is the money I paid for it even on sale, worth it?'  \"Probably... at least for me.\"4/26/10:I have had a full 24 hrs of using this phone with T-Mobile's 'unlimited web for phones' ($10 a month) add on. I lost it initially when T-Mobile figured out I'd switched phones.  I went back to their site and put in my old phone as the one I'm using, and so far, they've not cut off my internet service. While it's nowhere as fast as 3G, nor visually as 'wow' as the newest touch-screen phones with Android OS... it's the useful kick I needed to make me happy and at the right price.Now I have a phone that has great voice quality, speedy bluetooth uploads (took some photos and got them to my desktop very quickly), easy texting, GPS (tried that today too, and had it plot some routes with great success), music player and other assorted goodies that for me, are really sweet!I'll be keeping this phone and may end up adding more texts or more minutes to my phone plan simply because it's a joy to use.  Has held a good charge too, even with lots of web browsing, texting and playing music. I like it and would recommend it to the consumer who wants a feature packed phone, that while not the 'latest and greatest', does a damn good job at the things it was designed to do.4/48/10:T-Mobile's Web2Go is called 'unlimited web for phones'.  I had added it (free for 1 month), but decided $10 was more than I wanted to pay for this basic stuff (not G3).  Today when I went to take it off, T-Mobile offered it for $5 a month, calling it \"Preferred Phone First Unlimited Web Only\".  I snagged it and upgraded to a non-contract extending plan: 'Even More Plus 500 Talk + Text' which is $39.95 a month.  Now I have unlimited text (video, IM, Photo, or text), unlimited weekends and evenings, unlimited web and 500 anytime minutes for $44.99 plus taxes.  The Even More Plus 500 Talk, Text and Web unlimited is priced at $59.95 plus tax... so I feel really good about both the T-Mobile deal AND keeping this wonderful phone!", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Top Pick in Fortune Magazine", "Author": "Y.

I can scrobble music on here with my SD card, and I have a GPS and it tells me where the closest dry cleaner is and what not in walking distance that I never knew of before! It also has this really cool application called SportsTracker, and it tracks not just the miles, but your pace. It is a great tool for athletes.

I charge it every other day. Things that I like are the basic design, sturdiness and quality.  Call reception is excellent.  I previously had two Samsungs, and always had numerous dropped calls each day.  Reliability of radio service is much better now, which is saying a great deal considering I use the least reliable network (begins with \"A\").  It comes with a wired headset and I actually prefer that to my bluetooth earpiece.  Sound quality is important.  The speakerphone works but isn't loud enough in my car or outside.The keyboard is a little cramped and takes getting used to.  The dictionary works great and mostly predicts what I am trying to type.  You can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type.  I have g-mail and I found both the Nokia mail app and g-mail's own app disappointing.  The Nokia app doesn't display html messages without opening a separate browser--not good if you want to quickly scan through messages.  The g-mail app opens .pdf files within its program, but loses document formatting.  You cannot choose to open an attachment with a program of your own choosing (sounds like the Microsoft strategy is growing within the g-camp).  I found \"Profimail\" which works great for me.  It works more like a true desktop mail client and can update your IMAP folders so you can carry all your important messages with you.  You can download attachments to any location and open them with the application of your own choosing (like Acrobat Reader).  The mail client meshes well with the Nokia address book.  It is totally software worth trying.  I purchased it after only a couple of days of trying it out.There's another default screen app called \"Active Notes\", which I thought would make saving documents a snap, but I was again disappointed.  Sometimes I edit emails for people.  I copy emails, paste and create a document, edit and then send the edited document back as an attachment that can be copied and pasted into a new email.  I tried using Active Notes and it would only attach as a .zip file.  I replaced the Active Notes icon with Quick Office, which works well and saves text documents as .txt and .doc.For gps and maps, I use Google maps for Symbian.  The gps works quickly and accurately.  I'm a guy and wouldn't use turn-by-turn directions even if they were erotically whispered into my ear.  I just want to find my location and look at a map.  While house-hunting recently, I used it to look at the satellite views too.  I recommend Google maps and it's free.The browser mostly works well, and I salute any browser that can display modern web pages on a 240x320 pixel screen.  I tried Opera Mini, but didn't see anything better, so I just use the Nokia included browser.  Speaking of internet, I also use my phone with the included USB cable as a tethered modem.  The Nokia PC Suite of software makes that pretty effortless.  Too bad the USB cable doesn't also charge the battery.  I purchased a separate USB charging cable that adapts to the charging connector on the phone.There are a few little irritating quirks i found.  You can briefly push the power button to switch to different modes, like \"Silent\".  Unfortunately the default setting on Silent mode is to not alert or even vibrate upon receiving a call.  I missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one.  I later edited the Silent mode to include a vibrating alert.  That seemed a little lame to me.When the phone drops into the standby screen it displays the time without the backlite.  When you press the home key, the menu displays and when you press the menu key, the home screen displays--Totally backwards.The mute button is right between the volume keys and you can easily mute your own voice while trying to adjust the earpiece volume if you are not careful.The menus are confusing and completely non-intuitive.  Trying to find out how to change something like a hot-key can take a lot of trial and error.  An update to the Symbian OS is going to be necessary to keep Nokia competitive.The best case I found is from Beyzacases.  They are a Turkish company that makes fine leather cases.  I received mine within 3 days of ordering from them.Lastly, the fact that it is unlocked (but works best on US ATT networks) is the best feature of all.  You will pay half what you would pay for data if you buy a subsidized phone with a contract agreement.

Invested in a 8GB micro-SD card (Class 6), transferred my music, purchased a 2.5mm to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, bought a Fiio Headphone Amplifier and you've got yourself a high-quality portable MP3 player AND you can answer calls, browse the internet and check e-mails.- MAPS: Ovi Maps (offers voice-guided directions) and Google Maps are both great! One feature I absolutely LOVED about Google Maps for E71 was the voice-recognition feature. Press the TALK button and say the name of your destination (ex. XYZ Drycleaners), I was blown away by its accurracy - it actually works flawlessly! With Ovi Maps, you can download maps from different countries. I'll be traveling to India this summer and the idea/concept of having the map of India for point-to-point direction is just phenomenal.- KEYBOARD - Now I'm back to using a physical QWERTY keyboard but the layout is great. Well placed, raised keys. After a week or so, you'll get familiar and will be typing at a good speed.- SCREEN/MENU: Great resolution, brightness. Adjustable menus, icons, apps etc. The layout of the menus and options is simple and straightforward. Won't even need to look at the manual, it's user-friendly.- It's got VIDEO CHAT facility with a front-facing camera.- It's got an FM Radio which works great!Overall, if you're looking for a phone that DOES THE JOB and DOES IT EFFECTIVELY and EFFICIENTLY, go with this phone. Sound quality and clarity is great. I can go for 2 days EASY without having to charge the phone. If you're looking for a multimedia device, iPhone is your best bet. However, I've successfully been able to use pretty much all the features I used on my iPhone - maps (Ovi maps and Google Maps), E-mail, Shazam, Calendar, Facebook, Skype. I have the E71-2 North American Unlocked version. In other words, this is a WORLD phone! :) I've received several compliments on this phone in the past month that I've owned it. It differentiates you from the rest of the people with Blackberry's, iPhones, HTC's etc. No one can ever tell that it's a 2008 phone!Not really CONS but I'll say drawbacks:- no thread feature for text messaging- browsing the internet can be time consuming/cumbersome - but I don't usually surf the net on a mobile device that much anyway - (whether iPhone or E71)", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "one of nokias finest", "Author": "brian stanley", "ReviewID": "RHGCRDKPYBL62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was way ahead of its time here in the US.

I've had other phones from Motorola, SonyEricsson, Samsung, and LG, after a couple times hitting the floor, the phones would start to auto shut down in the middle of a conversation, or wouldn't pick up a call, or lose signal strength where it should have been strong. None of such things with this phone.So I would say E71 truly has a very solid built that can withstand moderate accidental abuse.  For a couple hundred dollars, I would say this is a great buy!

I have been using it for more than 3 years now, and yet, everything in the phone is very up to date and I never got the feeling I have to change to another phone, even when androids come in and touch phones are out.I find the design sleek and classy. It is very thin and not bulky. The QWERTY keypad is very delicate and is easy to type in. I send more than 1k text messages in a month and I find it very easy to use. I even type my word documents on the phone when I'm reviewing because it is the only device you can hold the book open with your arms, and yet see the book, and type at the same time. No need for trying to force the book open and move my head left (from the book) and right (to my laptop) just to type. Everything is in one view. And then after that, all I have to do is save the document in my memory card and transfer it to my laptop if I want to.When I got this phone, one of the details I have to have is a good camera. E71 has 3.2 MP camera and with an auto-focus, (or for even better focus click t), the pictures are of really good quality, unless there's no adequate lighting. It is enough for my everyday picture taking. Though I'm planning to find a regular digital camera so I can blow up my pictures. But with one that comes with the phone, I really like this.I also like the fact that it has a removable memory card. Mine came with a 2G mini SD card. I can use it to store files that I need and carry it around with me like a USB stick. Who doesn't have a phone with them all the time nowadays, anyway?I also like that it came with a headset that I can use to listen to the radio too.Wifi is a blessing for me since I can connect to wifi's and not pay for a internet plan with my phone plan.There are lots of games to download for E71 and it is easy to use the phone wifi and connect and download it right from there, compared to others where you need to log on your laptop and connect your phone, etc etc.In these days where the ports are limited, E71 still has the infrared. I don't know when I'm going to use it, but I am glad it's still here, with the bluetooth and wlans.Another thing I like about Nokia phones in general is that it is VERY durable. I drop my phone a hundred times and sometimes it opens up, with battery jumping out, etc, but when I put it back together, it works just like new! My phone has a lot of scratches and dents, bitemarks (from the baby I babysit for), etc. But it still works really well, considering it is around 4 years old or more already.It can also read your text messages out loud! It's fun! Another thing that I LOOOVE is that it has an option that when it rings, whatever ring tone you have, you can have the phone tell you who's calling, even before you get hold of your phone.. it's like *music music* Angelica Stafford *music music*. How cool is that!I can sing more praises about the phone, but all I want to say that is phone is a great buy and I love it so much!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best phone", "Author": "Joseph Candito", "ReviewID": "R1VK6PHKCBJTA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No doubt the best business phone I have owned.

It has a nice substantial feel too it - very thin and smaller then an 2G/3G iphone. The software for the phone/system is easy - makes transferring data from a PC very easy, online updates are available.

I know the E72 has been out for a while, but there have been some major issues around it, so that is why I chose to purchase the E71. First of all, Symbian is so easy to use, and especially on this phone. The short cut keys for contacts, calender, messaging, makes everything so simple.Battery wise, it last up to 3 days with medium to heavy use. This is on par with my N95 8gb and N97, further proof that S60 offers teh best battery life of all mobile OS's.

Though, i still was looking for a device that can also act as a phone and has wifi(i am 99% time within a wifi network, so 3g/edge is not a factor).I debated between E71, N95 and many other phones. So what sealed the deal? E71 is way smaller than any other device (iphone included) (and that too with a very easy keyboard), perfect seamless pairing with my bluetooth headphone(motorola HT820) and easy OS. I never used a symbian phone before and without much effort(no RTFM) was able to learn all functions. Though there are times when there are just too many options and i do click the wrong button.People might complain about the no-touch small screen, but to tell the truth it serves the user adequately: compared to the N800, i find, i prefer the keyboard on the E71 better than the onscreen keyboard of the N800. It serves best as the enterprise device for which it was intended for so the camera is just ok (too much purplelish), screen is small for video but the processor/OS is snappy to handle it. Though the media player is awesome, pair up with a stereo headset and voila (it also supports album art, and easy way to create playlists )! There are many good and free Symbian apps from Yahoo, Google for mail, news, maps and work good with E71. Also, the battery is huge and can last more than a day with heavy net usage. Oh and the charger is the half the size of a fat thumb!Accompanying Software is pretty good and connects seamless through via IR, bluetooth or USB. for Mp3 files there is a convertor to convert to a smaller AAC format and load to the device (one can load as MP3 too btw). I use a Sandisk 4GB microsd to store media files as the inbuilt phone memory is just about 120MB. It has a one stop app solution to handle almost all phone functions like transferring files, to reading SMS's, backing up, etc.Symbian is pretty snappy as OS and i have yet to have a 2 sec+ lag moment (which sometimes happen when switching between wifi access points). GPS is Ok and takes sometime to get a lock, but with a real nice app from Nokia called Sport tracker to track walking distance etc etc and also works with google maps.Pros: Snappy OS, excellent bluetooth capability, very good apps, on the first look i wondered 'how did they cram so much stuff in such a small package and that too with a massive 1500mah battery!'.No Cons, except perhaps the red on/off switch on the top of the phone (see it's so hard to find a fault with e71)So overall its a dream phone for me and worth much more than the going price of 350$.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good but....", "Author": "Average Consumer", "ReviewID": "R2IBA9Y7Z8J57I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the E71 to provide several functions:(a) international access to voice and Internet;(b) WiFi access; and(c) GPSThe voice, Internet and WiFi work fine. The GPS software, however, leaves much to be desired. See details below.Voice/Internet/WiFi work fine:-----------------------------The voice  worked fine with T-mobile and AT&T; in the US. The signal strength and voice quality are excellent. However, these companies either do not offer Internet access to prepaid customers, or if they do, their staff had no idea how to sell and use it. I used the E71  with O2 on a recent trip to the UK. The O2 staff, in contrast, were exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful in setting voice and Internet access in minutes; I paid 15GBP and had unlimited calls to the UK and US as well as Internet access which is where the money went.The WiFi access is terrific and I have used it heavily while travelingand at home to handle email and web access. The E71 discovers WiFi networks quickly and attaches to access points instantly.GPS Software Leaves Much To Be Desired---------------------------------------The GPS software is very unfriendly. I preloaded a map of London before traveling; when I arrived I found that only sections of the city werepreloaded while major other sections were missing; it was not clearhow to get the other sections, short of getting a map of the city andentering addresses in the missing parts. Then, when I tried to use thenavigation feature it got the route all right and the position of the car reasonably well, but, surprise, there were no voice instructions. I checked the manual and could not find how to get the voice to work. Fortunately, many other users that struggled with the problem posted solutions on the Internet.

My K850 was incredibly buggy so I decided to give the N95 a go and never looked back.

Again, never looking back. In terms of my mobile needs this phone meets and exceeds all of them. It's great for listening to music, however for extended sessions I do bring a dedicated music player. This thing gets a GPS lock lightning quick, my N95 would take upwards of a minute to two, while often times I blink and google maps has already located me. The camera... leaves much to be desired.

I only rely on cameras in phones for the rare times where I want to capture something but haven't brought a camera with me, or one isn't allowed. In terms of actually talking on the phone, I try not to do that. Not because of any flaws, I just prefer cell phones for their features rather than the phone aspect. It's flawless, I've yet to have a dropped call, or reception problems. My only gripe is with S60, not the phone in particular, caller ID pictures are handled horridly.

It has the usual features of other smart phones (connection to the internet, voice over internet, dictionary, barcode reader, to name a few), but with one additional feature: free GPS (and I do mean free).  Nokia provides free maps of the entire world and voice guidance in over 100 languages and it is all free.  Once the maps are loaded on the phone (this can also be done free) there are no usage charges, no need to connect to a service, etc.  The phone came unlocked so I just slipped in my SIM card (some phone services like Sprint will not work) and off I went.  The phone interfaces seamlessly with both the MAC (see limitation below) and a Windows based PC.  The keyboard is easy to use.  I have used the built-in, trimmed down version of Microsoft Office suite (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) and the Adobe Reader and they all work well.  The phone has the capability to interface to a bluetooth keyboard and printer as well as other bluetooth devices, but I haven't had a chance to try those yet.  There are many more features that I don't use, but they are there if I need them.The only reason this phone doesn't get 5 stars is because of Nokia's support.  When I received the phone it did not have the latest firmware installed or the latest map guidance system.  Nokia support was no help at all and after three solid days of trying to get help to fix my problem I came close to returning the phone.  Here is what happened.  I was unable to get the critical piece of Nokia software that would allow me to update the firmware to work on the MAC.  All their other MAC software that syncs data (calendar, contact list, iTunes, bookmarks, photos, videos, etc.) worked great, but not this one.  Next after trying unsuccessfully to use this critical piece of software on two versions of Windows (XP and VISTA) I was finally able to load the Nokia software on a Windows 7 operating system that allowed me to update my phone to the current version.  Using this computer I then downloaded the maps of the US but I will still need to use the PC software if I want to download maps of more countries.If you buy this phone you should also purchase a high speed 8gb microSD card with adaptor.  Otherwise you won't be able to store anything.Now that everything is woking well (no thanks to Nokia support) I am very happy with this phone and all its features - Nokia does have good technology.  This is my first GPS system and I have already been on a trip and it is fantastic.

The feature I like the most about my E71: it allows me to untangle my data from the ATT metered plan via WiFi. While sitting in a restaurant I am able to pickup WiFi to go online while a friend with a Verizon BB Storm2 can't.Everything works - albeit a bit slower compare with those uber smart touch screen phones.  GPS, Camera, streaming video, RSS news feeds and podcasts all work flawless, plus free office productivity tools and PDF reader. Another advantage with the smaller screen: without the large screen the battery life is great, depending on usage it will last 1-3 days between charges.Similar to a well designed Swiss army knife this is a handy little tool that does everything well within its specifications.  It is a also a great bargain - I highly recommend it to anyone who does not need a full sized phone.PS I have the white version of this phone - it looks great with the backlit keypads and polished aluminum back plate. No smudges nor discoloration of the keyboard thus far with daily usage.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone, great price", "Author": "N.

Munjal \"M Munjal\"", "ReviewID": "R1MDMSRGCWFQ5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Starting things off, I am a 19yearold male from NJ, coming from previous phones of a Nokia 6101, RAZR1.2, Nokia N95, and now this flashy, new, white, E71.This review is for Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS and Free Vocie Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)Summary.CONS- True Multitasking: I have run over 25 apps concurrently.- PC Sync capable: the provided PC Suite is powerful and useful.- SLIM SLIM SLIM: Ridiculous, it feels less than the advertised 10mm depth (which is about half its competitors).- Call quality: This may be a network-dependent (I use T-MobileUSA), but this thing is clear and loud. Callers frequently thought I was on a landline, and the bluetooth connection (to a Samsung headset) was bulletproof it seemed, even from 30 feet away. I have never seen a device power bluetooth that far (at any good quality at least).- Fast: My N95 felt sluggish at time with all the things running, this phone has yet to slow down while running apps (with 25 at once, as mentioned above).- Fantastic keyboard: I always thought T9 was incredible, coming first-time to a QWERTY and could not be happier.- Sound design: Looks good, feels good, feels tough (it is made of stainless steel as well, thing feels quite solid).- Battery life: Coming from a N95 I am used to charging almost every night. This thing has lasted 4 days with heavy WiFi usage, camera usage, intensive texting.- GPS: I do not pay for a data plan, and the included GPS and the newly revised Nokia Maps 3.0 is great. I get FREE turn-by-turn directions with voice, all running off my handset, with no internet needed! It works reasonably well, possibly better in walking situations and POI lookups then driving (it can be slow at updating sometimes).- Software/Operating system: Symbian may not be popular in the US, but it is the most popular OS in EU and Asia (one of the most popular). Nokia rules the market segments there, and the OS has tons of applications (newly launched Ovi Store). It may be out of date and due for a refresh, but it just works.CONS- \"Outdated\" OS: It is not as flashy as iPhone or even newer Android devices. Does not have \"150,000\" apps either.- This model is business focused: Applications included do not go to media side (as seen in the music player).- Camera: This was the saddest fact for me. I am coming from the 5MP Zeiss lens on the N95, which took incredible photos (sometimes equal to an SLR in daytime, depending on the photographer's skills). I expected similar, but less detailed (3.2 MP verse 5MP) on this. Unfortunately, Nokia seems to have messed up, with photos being sometimes blurry, almost always with a purple tint, and generally not good. Night photos are barely usable, as the flash is too weak and cannot accentuate details enough.- White color: I personally like the white color now after using it, maybe recommend the all black E71x (from AT&T;, sometimes available unlocked), or the regular grey/black E71 (other color sold by Nokia, unlocked). This can be described as a \"pimp\" phone by some. Also picks up fingerprints easily, but what phone does not?CONCLUSIONBuy this if you need a reliable handset, that is used for heavy typing and web usage, and general \"business-y\" things, the E71 will not let you down. Its strengths lie in an OS that just works with little issues, problem-free WiFi, 3G, a GPS that actually works, and little need for charging. If you are looking for a multimedia handset, do not be swayed by the flash support (which is great), or the media player; look at the new Nokia X6 or Expressmusic phones or N series.

So I looked at other options to tie me over until I figured out what I wanted to do next. And a new toy is always nice as well.The E71 fit pretty much everything I was looking for: email support, qwerty keyboard (the iPhone keyboard is a bit tough to use quickly), 3G connection, GPS, expandable media for music and images, camera--all the main things I was using my iPhone for. The expandable micro SD was a big plus, since I was at the point where I was trying to figure out what was coming off my iPhone to make room for other stuff. The four dedicated keys to email, contacts and calendars are awesome--things that I predominantly need a smartphone for. The size is great--about the size of an iPhone strangely--and just looks so slim. The steel frame is worth it for the high end look to the phone even at the expense of some fingerprints. Nokia did a great job with the design of this product. What really caught my eye was the white version. Most smartphones are geared towards men and so colors are chosen accordingly. I was happy to have a more feminine choice. Also having lived abroad, I was ecstatic to finally have a place to put my girly accessories (which are not as popular in the States) to jazz up/personalize my phone.On the flip side, I do wish there were more free apps for the Nokia. After being spoiled by the sheer number of apps that cater to every whim on the iPhone, I'm finding life with Nokia apps a bit boring. I understand that Nokia Ovi acquired Widsets, so I assume there's more apps/widgets on the way, but haven't been able to find any information on what the plans are for that. The included email client doesn't do a great job of mimicking email accounts when it's not automatically retrieving mail, which you can only do for 2 accounts. Every additional email account needs to be manually retrieved. I'm trying some of the push applications that are available and the jury is still out for me on those. Also the number of steps that one has to go through to delete emails, mark emails, add recipients to emails, get to applications that are installed on the phone, etc. is a bit annoying.All in all though, I think this is a great buy and a strong contender in the more business-oriented smartphone that has entertainment add-ons.

The camera is 3.2 mega pixel but the pictures didn't seem that much better.  They actually seemed darker than the 2.0 megapixel camera on the e63.

This phone is a fingerprint magnet and I can't find an app to use the front facing camera to do video conferencing, though Fring is supposedly working on it. If that's a deal breaker you should still get this phone.I got this phone to replace my old E62 and I am beyond pleased. The GPS works great and you can use offline(without a data plan). The keypad, though small, is tactile and allows for very fast typing. I love it. When I saw this phone in the stores, I thought the keypad was too small. I was wrong. Once you get used to it, and it'll take a sec, it's amazing. Also quite amazing is the track button. On my E62 my finger would start to hurt after repeated use, but on this phone the track button is contoured, ergonomic and smooth. I love it!Emails shoot out, and apps pop up, compared to my E62, the processor is lightening fast, though that's not saying much.Another feature which I found amazing, and which newer phones are bragging about is the ability to use the phone as a hotspot for my Nintedo DS or my Ipod. It works perfectly though you need an app for it.Also, using the Skyfire web browser, the phone handles Flash better than almost all current generation phones, especially the Iphone...wink, wink. You should also invest in the Handy line of products from epocware. They add alot of functionality especially Weather and ShellAnd last but not least the phone is beautiful.

This phone in alot of ways is similiar to the BlackBerry similiar look, Full Keyboard and One of the best things is the Browser. I honestly like the Factory installed browser over alot of popular browers like Opera...With the Browser it runs full web pages which you scroll from side to side to view (Im assuming its done this way since if it showed a full page on the screen everything would be tiny)..Also this phone has fully functional YouTube Support anyone running a Data Plan on this phone I think will be Pleased.... The ONLY thing I truley hate about this phone is the keyboard. Yea its got a full keyboard but the keys are TINY and rather hard to text on...I wish the phone would have been alil wider to make the keys bigger.

The Symbian operating system is horribly easy and I promise my grandma could master it in a week. Applications run fluidly and efficiently. For the first time ever, Gmail and Opera Mini run smoothly without any problems for me.Battery life: Blows the other two away.

Other than hitting the dedicated silence button, I don't see another way to do it (volume buttons, power button, etc).  Maybe there is, not sure?  Setting up Mail for Exchange was a hassle.  It takes less than one minute on an Iphone, and took me a while to do it on this phone with all the little nuances.  Setting up GMail and Yahoo was easy, although that opened up another can of annoying worms.  If you're viewing your GMail mailbox for instance, and you exit, the phone alerts you that the mailbox is connected, and asks if you are sure you want to disconnect?  YES, I want to disconnect, that's why I pushed the exit button....ugh.  The web browsing is by far the worst I have ever experienced on any phone, simply unusable in my opinion.  When your packet data connection is active, and you receive an incoming call, the phone will beep in your ear and display that the packet connection is off...then will beep again at the end of the call and display that packet connection is back on.  Why do I care about this?  Why do I need a beep in my ear for this?A friend of mine who's an engineer in this industry says that Nokia phones have the best antennas.  I'm not sure if that's true or not - I was using this phone with a T-Mobile SIM.  Whenever I was someplace where I didn't have reception, my ATT and Verizon friends were just fine.  This was especially true inside of buildings.  BUT, I think this is more of a T-Mobile issue than a phone issue.Also,I bought his phone in White.  The online pictures of the phone make it appear that the keys are more of a silver, and blend into the rest of the phone.  This is not that case, the keys are WHITE WHITE and are not sliver....there is a huge contrast between the keys and the chrome body of the phone.  - It's ugly in my opinion.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good phone", "Author": "Mario Solorzano Sandoval", "ReviewID": "R3SEV3OE5WNMNO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think the E71 is a good phone, but it's not as friendly as others.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Be smart, JUST GET IT!.", "Author": "HRO \"HRO\"", "ReviewID": "R2N0P4SHK3SYD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally I get paid for giving my opinion, but since Nokia gave me a real solution I will write a few lines about this product.

While the construction of the E71 is very nice, that's where the positives end.  The software on this phone (Symbian S60) is a chore.  Seems like everything takes four clicks to accomplish.  Why do I always have to make a choice between a \"video call\" and a \"voice call\" every single time?  Why do I have to make a choice to reply via text to a ... text message? Why is that not a default choice?  The email application also sucks.  Again, because of the multitude of clicks that's required to achieve anything.And the desktop software... wow is it horrible.  Lots of sizzle but no steak.  Animations and fancy transition effect abound, but there is no way to edit notes on it.  It supports sending and receiving texts through it (the application) when the phone is plugged in, but it shows the numbers of the sender; it does not associate the number with the entry in  your phone book.  It also crashes randomly at startup.And the thing that prompted this review - the phone does not support charging via the USB port.  I mean c'mon!The other good thing about it - it doesn't suck more than the Blackberry Bold", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "My first smartphone experience", "Author": "R.J. \"Rick\"", "ReviewID": "R2P7QBB1IRDABG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Because, this is my first smartphone experience (I've never even played with one before), please put this review into context.I bought this phone when Amazon did a one day $200 sale on the phone, because my wife needed a smartphone for a new job.  She's Japanese, so she's used to high tech, next gen phones, but she's never been a phone person. In Japan you can get phones with crazy features that are still easy to use. I also liked the fact that you can use this phone as a stand alone GPS device without having the service. The phone actually is great for that, even though the screen is small. Needless to say the phone was too complected for my wife to like. She's very busy and doesn't have time that this phone needs to figure out.I fell in love with it, because I like thinner flip phones, and this phone wasn't much bigger than my Samsung flip, one of the worlds thinnest. So you can throw this thing in your pocket, and it's not going to anywhere as bulky as an iphone.  I also like the solid construction and the steel case. The phone isn't cheaply made. The keys are white, as others have said, not silver like the pic, but I think it looks good. It's an off white, not a bright white, so it doesn't really clash. The letters and characters are back lit, and you can set the phone to slowly pulsate light from the phone on standby.I do like complicated toys, but this one was a bit much. Granted, I don't know about blackberres, et al.  The main issue was the fact that I hate AT&T.;  I hate the a la carte menu plan style that charges you more for every little thing. The phone runs on T-Mobile, which is what I ordered, because I have good experience with them previously. This phone doesn't get 3G on T-mobile. The phone jumps on wifi signals around you with no problem, so I just used my home network. If you're gonna buy a phone like this, you need AT&T;, and then you might as well get a Nokia E71x, which is the same thing, just black and cheaper with an AT&T; contract. I use Sprint normally and can get unlimited everything for a two phones, for what it almost costs to get the same level of service on one phone from AT&T.; With T-mobile, if you don't buy a phone from them, their smartphone service is 20 bucks cheaper a month. that's $480 dollars over a 2 year contract. Think about that for a second if surfing the web a lot without wifi is important to you. The phone isn't good at that anyway. If you wanted to surf the web without a computer, then get an iphone or Droid.Because it's unlocked, it's basically like you bought it in Europe. The phone has an uber chic European style about it for those that want to be artsy and businesy at the same time, but I think you really need the support of an American carrier.  AT&T; supports this phone, so its probably better on their network all the way around. There are functions that don't work in the US. There are other functions, like the music store, that ask you to list what country you'd like to buy from and then give you the choice of 50 or more other countries, but not the US. The online music channel player literally gives you thousands of options for dance music alone, per country. You can listen to a European dance station called Gay radio Europe, or country music from the US. That's cool, but that's too many options. It would bug me to know that I'll never hear all of them and wonder if whatever station I was listening to is the right one.  The phone is like a pretentious Western European looking down on you (stretched metaphor).The camera's kind of crappy for resolution. Just a bit better than my 4 year old flip phone 2mp camera. If that's important to you, then get the Nokia E72.Screen resolution is fine, but will win no awards. Its not like the new droid phones. I played with a bunch of phones at the Sprint store after getting this phone, and the pre was by far the easiest and most intuitive to use. Think of the Palm Pre as the antithesis of this phone. I used the Youtube app that came with it to watch videos on wifi, and there was zero problem. The speaker is actually pretty good, and the speaker phone is great.Using the internet is a pain with the cursor, and there's no touchscreen. Using Opera for mobiles, the speed was great on wifi, but you have to zoom out over the whole page, move cursor where you want, and then zoom back in. If you really need to surf the web a lot with a phone, which I don't, then this isn't the phone for you. It has all the business stuff on it.The keys are ridiculously small, but even with my big thumbs with wasn't too hard to type on. Very few missed keys. The pain in typing for me was actually holding such a small phone with two hands and typing. Easier one handed. It's easier than typing on the Palm Pre, which is really bad.The Nokia apps store is terrible as well. Not a lot of stuff. It uses a Symbian OS, which is a Linux OS, so you might be able to use android apps. Don't know.The software the phone came with, something like 9 programs, were a pain. You can use them when you connect your phone to the computer, and can actually use the phone as a wireless modem, but they are a pain in the ass to use, not very intuitive or multi functional (they are buggy as well).Due to this I only had the phone for 2 days, and I sent it back. Again, with T-mobile there's not much point. I'm also more of a flip phone or multimedia touchscreen phone guy, not a full QWERTY guy. I don't text a lot. If the phone ran on 3G Sprint, which I've been on for 3 years now, then I'd probably just keep the phone for myself and buy my wife something else. Looking for a way to format the phone before returning it, I actually looked in the instruction booklet and saw how many things I was misunderstanding with the phone. If you don't like reading the whole manual, don't get the phone.
