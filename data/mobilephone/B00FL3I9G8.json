{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect for the price", "Author": "John J \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R3M1RN5ZWWZK7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting a week to reflect on the phone - it arrived in time.  It's my first try with the Smartphone phenomena.  I was attracted to the price and to the positive experiences noted.  I would only echo how easy it was to set up.  I have a Pay-as-you-go plan with Spotmobile and an Italian SIM card for Italy, where I travel frequently.  I chose not to have a dual-SIM phone - I'm used to simply changing the cards when I arrive in the country.  In any case, I love the freedom the Europeans have to pay per use and forget the costly Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord.  I average $15 a month for the US SIM.  The Italian SIM is much less than that since I am only there for work.  This phone is, thankfully, unlocked.  I inserted my SIM card and my 16GB memory card into the phone (directly from my previous Samsung flip-phone).  Voil\u00e0! I was up and running.  The screen is tremendously clear, the apps I've been able to upload have been super helpful and the Wi-Fi connections work flawlessly.  I am WAY too happy with this phone. I feel badly for most Americans who are stick with the fables and myths fed them about  (1) what a phone actually costs and (2) why anything like International texting, International calling or data access has to exponentially feed only the profits of AT&T; and Verizon.  It's a crime . . .  . . . but I digress.  The phone is perfect for me.  I'll let you know if it breaks down, but I'm pretty savvy electronically.  My only complaint is that I'm still waiting for the holding case to accompany it (The \"Elegant leather case for the Huawei Ascend G510 with magnetic fastener and stand function in Black from kwmobile\").  The delivery date is not projected for another MONTH. It's the only case made specifically for the phone sold on Amazon.  If I had to do it over again?  I'd shop a regular store and forget skimping on the cost if they can't deliver a leather case for over four weeks.  Is it coming from China - on donkey?", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "marctheshark", "ReviewID": "R3D1YYQLVS5TBM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a gift for my wife; so far she is very satisfied with it and likes the many features.
