Game Lover stated the product was in good condition and that there was a scratch on the screen (which was accurate) The phone appeared to be in good condition, HOWEVER, a valuable piece of information was not included. The phone constantly shows an hourglass spinning. The only time it did not constantly spin was when I was able to actually place a phone call. Otherwise, using the phone for web based functions was a JOKE! I understand that this may be a glitch in the model, but through research it appeared to me that it should not have been as frequent as it was. Suffice to say, I am sure the previous owner knew about this and failed to indicate this malfunction. An attempted email to the owner was not returned, so, I strongly discourage anyone from buying any type of product from this individual. Thank you and have a nice day!", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Curve", "Author": "hotbabbb", "ReviewID": "R1M0OTSERE6Z2S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Blackberry Curve is good, but not as good as the Blackberry Bold 9000.

I only use it now to make and receive calls. In the earlies it use to freeze for some strange reason and the battery would run down. Now it takes 2 days before it dies. It takes long to boot up whenever the battery is pulled like with all other blackberry.
