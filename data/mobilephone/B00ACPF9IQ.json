{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Yes!", "Author": "misscrusty", "ReviewID": "R2AFZFMHWFSKNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Exactly what I was looking for! A multi-functional basic phone with a QWERTY keyboard that works great for calls and texts.I was looking for a replacement for my Nokia C3 and found that most of my options with a full keyboard were RIM Blackberries, which, honestly, are just too much phone for me. All I wanted was a phone with a camera, alarm, speakerphone, and ability to easily send and receive multiple texts.For $40 this phone has huge bang for the buck. It is really intuitive for being marketed as low-end: menus are easy to navigate, lots of options for ring and alert tones, and the text messaging provides both inbox and conversation views. Call quality is surprisingly good. I did have one call so far that sounded a little grainy but overall voice quality is better than most smartphones I've used.They keyboard is slightly cramped due to its small size and the buttons are a bit slippery. Nothing that you don't get used to, however. I didn't think I would want a phone this small (slightly smaller than a deck of cards), but its compact size is actually a nice change from carrying around a bulky/awkward phone. The casing isn't super sturdy but the phone overall is a solid little brick.Before this phone I have tried the Moto Atrix, iPhone 3 (hated paying for data and smartphones are battery hogs), Nokia C3 (got buggy after 3 years), Blackberry Pearl (too complicated), and the AT&T; Z431 (just awful). Amazingly, this little thing has been the best of the bunch so far.Nice, bright screen, dedicated camera and messaging buttons. This phone even has a flashlight function and it really works!The only downside for me (and this is commonplace on many ATT devices) is that the Internet key is centrally located so it is easy to hit and accidentally incur data charges.Summary: this is a fantastic basic phone for those who don't have a data plan but want many functions and a full keyboard for easy texting.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow- what value", "Author": "Lindalealphamale", "ReviewID": "RDJ2HWE5DELN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't believe the value I got for this Alcatel phone. I didn't even know they made phones, but for less than $40, I got a sturdy device that does everything I need it to do and it has given me zero problems. A great phone for people who want the features and still have money in their billfolds so they can afford to go to a picture show or something.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the first week, dials 911 on its own with little effort (Issue Resolved)", "Author": "Pmm368", "ReviewID": "R1BYPZHFJBS48M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for 3 weeks after buying it at Radioshack.  The first week was okay, but going into the 2nd week was where things started to go downhill.  After about 3 days of owning the phone, I could go 2 or 3 days without charging my phone.  A few days later, I have to charge it every day as it'll easily lose half of its charge in about 12 hours from doing almost nothing.  That's something I'd expect from a smartphone, not this thing.  After what happened last week, the battery was (and is) the least of my worries.I was getting ready for work one day and I received a call.  It was from my county's sheriffs office.  My phone had somehow dialed 911 without my knowledge and with such little effort, as I've never had this issue with a candy-bar style phone.  It's been a few days since then.  Now on August 11th (Sunday), my phone had dialed 911 AGAIN!  This time I was already at work and my phone was on silent with nothing in my pocket besides my phone.  There wasn't even anything pressing against my leg.-final noteBefore finalizing this review, I found out what's causing it.  It's more at fault with Alcatel, as they put 2 methods of calling 911 when the screen is locked.  You can either dial 911 and press the green (call) button, or press & hold the green button.  I'm still confused as to how the call button was pressed specifically.Edit 8/12/2013I was able to update the firmware, turns out I just had the data service off (When my phone mentioned Over The Air update, I thought it wouldn't use data).  The file is only 26kbs, which cost me 6 cents in data, but this should've been taken care of by the carrier or manufacturer as this issue is at no fault to the consumer.  I will give my review a 3 star instead of the 2 I have given it.  Luckily no charges have been brought against me as I noticed my phone dialed 911 2 times last Saturday (8/10) and once a few days before that, making it a total of 3.Now that I have it taken care of though, I will go ahead and add more to this review.CameraA 2 MP camera is included with this phone as well as a video camera.  I give the camera quality a 3/5.  The pictures come out alright, but I can't complain for a $30 price tag.  The camera does have a flash that can be set to On, Off, Auto or Red Eye Reduct.  There is also a night mode in case the image is still too dark/grainy after using flash.Picture Resolutions: 1600x1200 (2mp), 1280x960 (1.2MP), 640x480(0.3MP) and 220x176 (may be the phone's native screen resolution).Video Resolutions (MP4): 640x368 (20 fps, 10 with night mode), 320x240 (30fps, 15fps in night mode), 176x144 (30fps, 15fps in night mode)Video Resolutions (3GP): 176x144 (15fps, may be same or less with night mode).In Video mode, the audio quality can't be changed that I am aware of.  The audio quality isn't great, but the video quality is decent at best.FM RadioThis phone is equipped with an FM Radio.  In order to use it, all you need is any pair of headphones or auxiliary cable.  The FM Radio works quite well on this phone.  It does not use the internet, so there is no worry of data charges.  There is also some kind of chip, I forget what it's called, that allows you to see what song is playing, provided the station you're listening to sends it out over the airwaves.  This doesn't use data either.  You can also record the station you're listening to for later playback.  Go in settings to change the recording settings though.  You have a choice of AMR or WAV sound file.  AMR will sound like you're trying to listen to the radio over a phone call.  You will want to use WAV, which records at 60kbps or somewhere around there.BluetoothThis phone comes with the real bluetooth that I like, not the crippled bluetooth that some providers put in.  By crippled, I mean by the company trying to make you use data to transfer pictures or files so that it's more $ for the phone company.  I've used phones where you can't transfer files by bluetooth except for phonebook contacts.  The bluetooth on this phone lets you stream music via bluetooth if you have a headset or speaker that has bluetooth.  I've transferred pictures and videos to my tablet and pictures from my tablet to my phone and it works just fine.MemoryThis phone has a 50mb internal capacity and uses a MicroSD card for more storage capacity.  A MicroSD card is not included with purchase, but thankfully I had a spare laying around.  I believe this phone can accept up to 32gb's if I'm not mistaken.  You will need a MicroSD card if you want to take a lot of videos.  The highest resolution at the highest quality will take up your internal memory in about 2 minutes if you have nothing on it.Wall Charger, USB CableA wall adapter comes with this phone with a detachable USB Cable so you can transfer files to your computer.  The USB Cable is a simple Micro-USB cable.  The wall charger charges at 550 MA.  In the event you forget your wall charger, you can simply connect the USB cable to a nearby computer with an open USB port to charge.  A normal USB 2.0 Port charges at 500 MA (50 less MA), so the charging time won't vary too much if you need to charge your phone in a hurry.ToolsThere are a decent number of tools available on this phone.  This phone includes a calendar, alarm clock, notes, world clock, Currency & Unit Converter, flash light and a voice recorder (which you can change the quality on.  There's AMR, which is the default, quality sounds like a phone call.  You will want to use WAV since it's a more common sound file and also has way better sound quality).Overall, this is not a terrible phone.  I just wish the 911 issue never happened and that the update was put in before it went out for sale.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "tdl", "ReviewID": "R12IEIBWI5YYY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful and easy-to-use cell phone.

It's great a great basic call and texting phone with a camera.I can text with one hand, just like a blackberry, but without the need for a data plan, and none of the frills of a smartphone.  It looks great also.  So much better than what they're offering in the basic phone category that requires a 2 year contract, and an activation fee.The only caveat is the camera quality.  It would be spot on perfect if the camera lens and resolution was better, since there are so many photo settings that you can do, like continuous shots, timers, white balance, color mode, etc.Also, for all of those reviewers that had a problem with the phone dialing 911 just for holding down the call button--the software update that you should do when you first get the phone, resolves that issue.  It may fail the update at the time that you requested it, but the update comes back to the phone within 48 hours, for me it was less than 24 hours. -- I nearly returned the phone because I thought the software update wasn't out yet.Glad it was a weekend where UPS was not open!", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "accidental 911 calls", "Author": "kbustle", "ReviewID": "R3W3MKKXTVEGMI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my kid to use because it was cheap, sort of cute and she could text with it.  Unfortunately, TWICE now, she has inadvertently called 911 from school while the phone was in her pocket. I believe this is called \"butt' dialing.  The phone is designed to allow a person to call 911 simply by pressing and holding the \"send\" key, EVEN IF THE PHONE IS LOCKED.  The send key is prominently located on the left edge of the phone and is quite large relative to the other keys.It is no laughing matter when your child makes spurious 911 calls from school.

It's smooth, light, and easy to drop, so I strongly recommend immediately getting a textured phone cover for it.  Such a cover would also help to decrease the accidental pressing of the keys.  It seems to have a cheap microphone.  The audio quality of a call was below average for the other party, but on the GoPhone was fine.  A nice feature for noisy environments is the ability to use conventional stereo headphones plugged into the jack on top.  Headphones are also necessary for the FM radio feature to work, and it worked well, with selectable sensitivity, and stereo separation that's better than in the iPod Nano.  The phone has the ability to serve as a music and video player, though I didn't install a MicroSD or use those features.  There is an LED that serves as a flash for the camera.  It also could be switched on like a flashlight, using the keyboard.  Regarding the camera, the default setting from the factory was to use low image quality, so adjust that, if desired.  The camera is only 2 megapixel, so you will not be the next Ansel Adams using it.  A handy feature is the ability to use its camera as a webcam.  To do this, interface the phone with your computer using the included USB cord.  Select the webcam mode on the phone when prompted.  On a Windows 7 computer, the Alcatel driver that loads automatically will not work.  Get to where you can manually install a driver, and select the Microsoft driver for a USB webcam.

I can hear their voices crystal clear, but after a week of ending every call with the other person telling me that they can't make out what I am saying, I'm going to return this phone.  Here is a full review anyway.  Before I had this phone I owned the AT&T; Z431 GoPhone (AT&T;), and since they have the same form factor I will compare the two.  Most of the things I like better or worse about this phone than the Z431 are small but noticable.Pros -Better menus and shortcuts.  Good customizable options.Very fast response time between menus and screens.The music player doesn't rescan your SD card every time you open it, only when you tell it to.  This saves time.Texting interface is very good.Very loud build in speaker for music and ring tones.Ring option - vibrate first and then begin the ringtone.This phone is 3G, so it works with my At&t; microcell (to boost signal strength at home)Price - At $30, this was the cheapest phone I could find with this form factor.Cons -As mentioned, call quality.  I can't make it through a conversation.Poor battery life.  For non-smart phones I expect to charge about once every three days.  This phone must be charged daily.The music player always orders songs alphabetically, so you can't listen to an album in the order.This phone is noticably thicker than the Z431Key are ever so slightly harder to press.So if you live in an area with excellent signal strength I might consider this phone.

If you think you can prevent this by locking the keypad prior to putting it in your pocket... you are dead wrong. When the phone is in keyboard locked mode, it is actually EASIER to accidentally activate 911 than usual. It makes no sense, clearly a design decision made by some idiot at Alcatel.  Currently there is no fix for the problem.What makes this doubly burn is that, if you are on the $2-per-day-of-use plan, it will go ahead and charge you the $2 for the privilege of having your pants pocket speak to a 911 operator.Finally, carrying the phone in your pocket in power off mode opens another can of worms. A \"hard data reset\" is initiated by long pressing the # and power keys together while the phone is off. I fished the phone out of my pocket after half sitting on it, 4 days ago, to discover a threatening screen asking me if I wished to continue, and erase all user data stored on the telephone. Please understand that I had been using the digital camera for 5 months as a visual diary of life on the farm, young animals developing, etc. No, I did not wish to continue. I chose the red X (not the green check mark) indicating I did not wish to continue. According to Alcatel's website, my decision was correct and should have stopped the master reset in its tracks. But, the phone immediately performed the reset anyway. And whatever voodoo method it used really did wipe out all my photos, I have been unable to get anything off the phone using a data recovery program.I feel a hard data reset should only be initiated after the user has performed some complex task indicating intent, such as physically typing  Y E S  on a keypad.My only consolation is that the photo quality really was pretty poor. My pictures looked good when viewed on the little tiny phone screen, but the few I transferred to my hard drive before the event were disappointing viewed at full size.

Biggest Pros for me is that it has a normal headphone jack for listening to music, and all my old phones had special jacks so you had to buy their headphones. Also, if you have small song files (up to 300 kb) you can set them as your ringtone. So if you know how to edit music files, you can easily make any song you want into a short ringtone.

Even in that case it is hard to imagine a scenario where buying this phone would be the best option.I bought mine for 40 bucks at Walmart after losing my phone. It was an easy fix- I just popped in an AT&T; post paid sim card and I had service again. A couple weeks later I switched to an AT&T; sim card on Straight Talk (could not recommend them enough though!) and service has been great.This phone is a major bummer though, I don't think AT&T; has tested this product. This makes us all canon fodder for that evil corporation.All of the problems with this phone are with the open face keyboard. The other reviews are spot-on about the pocket dialing 911 while on screen lock. I once pocket dialed 911 twice in one day!! Good thing they don't fine you for this because I would sue AT&T; GoPhone for reimbursement. I took action to take it off screen lock, deciding pocket dialing friends was less serious than bothering emergency services. Pocket dialing 911 still occurred because sometimes my phone would lock its screen anyway even though I had that option deactivated. (This is where people are going to become skeptical about my compatibility with basic technology.)No matter though, the real problem came after I woke up this morning and found my entire phone's memory reset and all of my contacts now lost (for the second time since this year). I don't know how this happened but I am guessing if it was my fault it was due to pocket-hitting some combination of buttons on the keyboard that selected and confirmed this option. I was doing some rather intense carpentry work yesterday for most the day and night while it was in my pocket. If it wasn't my fault than the phone just decided to do this on its own.Oh and I had one text message and one voice mail when I woke up. The text was from my ex-girlfriend trying to get me to go to breakfast. The voice mail was from the Seattle Police saying I had called them and it had sounded like the phone was in my pocket. Now the only two phone numbers I have on my phone are of the Seattle Police and the girl that I don't want to see anymore.The real kick in in the pants is that in three days a new phone I ordered to replace this piece of junk will arrive. I almost escaped the Alcatel hell but the demon phone had the last laugh. I wanted to smash it more than anything but its my only phone right now so that would be making it worse. It was slated to be a back-up phone but now when my new Samsung gets here I will be smashing it with much satisfaction.

I have no trouble hearing people when I make a call.-Allows a micro SD card: This is one of the few Go Phones that seems to allow a micro SD card (at least from what I read). I personally love to use micro SD cards for personalized ring tones, music, and additional storage space.-Flashlight feature: How often do you find yourself using your cell phone to see in the dark? Well, this phone offers a flashlight feature, giving you a bright light so you can see even better!-Camera: This is not the greatest camera, but for a quick snap shot it works well. Again, from what I read most go phones lack this feature, so I was happy to find a Go Phone that had this.-Battery: The battery seems to be fine. It lasts at least 1-2 full days before I have to recharge. This varies depending on phone calls and usage.-Music player: It's similar to an ipod in that it lets you listen to music. The sound quality is good.-Standard headphone jack: This is very important for me. I can't stand the usb headphone jacks. Just give me a standard headphone jack please!CONS:-Texting is a little difficult: The keys are VERY tiny. I am a young female with tiny hands, but even I have a hard time pressing these tiny buttons. If you have large hands and you are a heavy texter, I would look elsewhere.-Accidental 911 call: It has not happened to me, but I do think about it after reading other reviews. The biggest complaint is accidentally calling 911 when it is in your pocket. You can not lock this feature. It even says it in the user guide that you can call 911 even when it is locked. I understand what they were attempting to do, but when you have so many people accidentally calling 911 it clogs up the emergency phone lines. This is not good for obvious reasons.-It limits your personalized ring tones to 15 seconds max. This is not a major issue, but if you are like me and enjoy a personalized ring tone, then you need to be very careful when creating it to ensure it is 15 seconds or less. This can be bothersome to some people because if your favorite part of a song is 20 seconds long, then you need to cut it down somehow or else it will not work on this phone. Again, this is not a major issue, but it's just something that bugs me a bit.Overall, it is a great little phone if you are looking to save some money via Go Phone plan. I personally am using the $25 monthly plan.

But the tracphone(motorola) only gave me a phone to call out on and receive calls. Decided to get a phone that would do more, pictures and being able to show it as soon as I took it, access to FB ,the internet, ect. The thing I found that I can't see the #'s or the letters because they are to small. When using, I would have to wear reading glasses which I wear contacts, but can't see anything close up, only far away. It's advertised to lok as big as the letters on other phones I've usedin the past. I'm debating on even using this phone and just go back to the motorola, tracphone, or the net 10 due to the very small #'s and lettering, so I've wasted approx. , $45.00 with the phone, s&h;, cover for accalate and another s&h.; Very dissappointed in my purchase of the accalate phone!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Numbers and letters are very small.

While trying to set it up and finding the manual less than helpful, I started searching online and came across these reviews.  Ugh!  From then on I was scared that I would accidentally dial 911.  So I had to start carrying my phone differently than I ever had.  Also, I noticed that the phone had to be charged every day.  I don't even use the phone much at all, so that is ridiculous.  But the part that pushed me over the edge --- and drove me back to my old phone -- was the bluetooth.  No one has mentioned that.  Everytime you start your car, you have to wait for the bluetooth to recognize the device and then it asks you if you want to connect it.  You have to sit and wait for that screen to come up so you can push the proper button to connect, or else the question disappears and you can't get it back.  So much for having your phone put up so it can't distract you.  So much for backing out of a parking space in a decent amount of time.  I guess I've got nothing better to do than sit around and wait for my phone to find the bluetooth.  Well, it's not going back because the restocking fee is more than I paid.  Got a new charger out of it, which was what I really needed in the first place.  I'm sticking with my Samsung!  I did really like the white keyboard - thought it was much easier to read.
