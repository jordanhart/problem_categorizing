This very basic phone is great for people who do not make many calls, do not text much and do not need fancy web connection.  The camera is not good and the complete user manual did not come with the phone.  The phone seems to hold up the charges fairly well and the no-contract service with Verizon is a strong selling point.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cell phone", "Author": "V.

I incorrectly assumed that a phone is a phone and that it could be programmed for prepaid or contract usage.  Although Verizon's sales store indicated that it could be programmed for contract usage after they get 6 months of prepaid billing out of the customer. I rely on the Amazon Feedback Community and want to warn everyone that this is a rip off. You can get a prepaid phone at Best Buy for $14.99.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Only Works with Verizon Pageplus prepaid plans\nGreat simple and useful phone interfacce\nIncludes $10 dollars of Free Airtime!\nSealed and Brand New in case", "Name": "Samsung Gusto Sch-u360 Prepaid Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W3SQDJ3RL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004W0RZCU"}}
