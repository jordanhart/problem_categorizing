{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very creative", "Author": "Steven M. Garcia", "ReviewID": "R1ACBX4NT8A125", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month now and I have to say it's a very pretty and excellent phone to own.Sound: Excellent. Nice and loud.Battery: It'll last you a good 8 hours (full charge).Internet connectivity: Can be faster. Maybe it's because Xperia isn't too popular in the U.S. quite yet. When AT&T; supports it, it will most likely improve.Response time on touch screen: Pretty good. It can be faster but I'm satisfied. Those of you with big figures or no finger nails will need the touch pen included with the phone.Features: Solid. The customizable panels are a neat touch to the phone.Camera: One of the best things about this phone. It's quality of picture is very excellent. And a huge help since it has a flash built in the camera. You can't compare with the iphone camera with this one.Keyboard: I love it. It's the one of the main reasons why I purchased this phone and I like typing on the small keyboard than touching the screen to enter letters; faster respons.Overall, If you're willing to fork over $600 dollars for this phone and if you're a sony ericsson fan of phones, you won't be disappointed.Cons: Internet streaming playback for live tv can use some improvement (in the U.S.) but it will come in time.It's not the most user friendly phone. It will take some time to get use to it. That's all I have for cons.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3 Inch TFT 65k Colour Touch Screen (800 x 480 Pixels)\n3G Video Call\nVideo Recorder\naGPS Navigation, 3G HSDPA", "Name": "Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 Unlocked GSM Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21xBXhBLMDL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001OD6CO0"}}
