{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beats the pants off any other phone in its price range", "Author": "Shifui", "ReviewID": "R14EVT15UWADGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've worked in the wireless industry for years and am very familiar with a wide range of current and emerging technologies. The Nokia Asha 311 is a surprisingly good phone at an amazingly low price. I am very pleased with it. Compact, reliable and easy to use for both calls and messaging.To understand why the Asha line isn't found among North American GSM carriers however, one must first understand that North American network success is measured by profitability first and THEN innovation. Nokia has reversed that equation in two ways: (1) By compressing high speed data through their own servers, one can take full advantage of the internet without a required high-cost smartphone data plan and (2) The Asha is LOADED with features and apps found on phones 3-4 times its price. In other words, the Nokia Asha 311 is not economically advantageous to any carrier that would prefer seeing its customers shackled into a 2 year service contract with an expensive smartphone data plan. Not surprisingly, the Asha line is VERY popular in countries outside the US. Indeed, more than 26 million Asha phones have been sold on the global market.With the Nokia Asha 311, one can use a low-cost feature phone data plan and have full access to Facebook, Googletalk, Twitter, Nokia Maps, Weather Channel, WhatsApp, etc, and still save 3/4 of what you would spend for the same thing otherwise. For example, with the Nokia browser one can easily access email and YouTube. US GSM carriers have rendered this next to impossible on their feature phones. One would assume that with all the Asha features, battery strength would be an issue? Not at all. One can easily go several days between charges, even with regular use. Amazing.Bear in mind, the Asha 311 is NOT a 4G LTE smartphone. However, it IS one of the best 3.5G feature phones available at any price. Perfect for everyday use or international travel, no other phone at this price range offers you a capacitive touch screen with Corning Gorilla Glass, 3.5 megapixel camera with video, built-in WiFi, VoIP, expandable memory up to 32GB, multiple languages, FM stereo radio, internet radio and even Angry Birds. Buy it, you won't regret it.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone on budget", "Author": "nicholas278", "ReviewID": "R2KIA7G8F5MPL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. I bought it for my wife and now I want one myself. There are some pros and cons to the phone and I'll list them in order of importance to me.PROS:Unlocked!

It does everything you need and looks great doing it. It's not a \"Smart Phone\" but it does everything one does. If you want tons of pointless apps then this isn't the phone for you.

I hate big sized phones and was very happy to see that this phone was just the right size. Its very comfortable to hold in hand. The touchscreen responds well. The features are attractive. As a phone it does its job very well. The audio is clear. The ringtones are loud (I used to miss many calls with my previous phone coz the ring would get suppressed when the phone is in my pocket). Dialing and making calls is also very easy. It is nice to hold in the hand. 1Ghz processor is good in speed. 128mb memory might not be sufficient for app users (Angry Birds plays fine though).Wifi connects well (I'm not a very heavy user of the internet over the phone, but I have streamed videos occasionally and didnt think it bad). I do not use the 3G feature so I'm not bothered about it. The screen size may not be the best for watching videos (having said that I don't think a 4-inch screen does any better). The 3.2mp camera is good (again I'm not very picky about the images). There is no flash (but the flashes I've seen on many phones were not so impressive, so I don't miss it). There is a qwerty keyboard while in landscape mode.I have synced up my email and calendar so I get email and also meeting reminders on my phone (the syncing happens when I'm connected to WiFi)! My son loves playing games on it.I wanted a good looking, not too large, touchscreen phone which operates very well as a phone and moderately well as a camera, video/audio player, internet browser, email device, etc.. and I can say for sure I got it.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not a smartphone, so don't treat it as such.", "Author": "D. CHAN \"dgc218\"", "ReviewID": "R39TQ83G8Q83CU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Basically, treat it as you would your old \"dumb\" phones, only with more options and functions available, because that's exactly what it is.If you use the internet on your phone at all times, this probably isn't the phone for you.  The standard Nokia browser sucks and is kinda slow.  Plus, the smallish screen size makes typing an exercise in pronounced concentration and backtracking to delete typos.If you text up a storm 24/7, this also probably isn't the phone for you.  Again, the dodgy keyboard.But if you're looking for a nice solid phone as an upgrade to your old \"dumb\" phone, then this might be the phone for you.  Remember what cell phones used to do?  Y'know, make and receive phone calls?  Well, if you're one of those old-fashioned types who still use your phone as ..... well ..... as a phone, then the Asha might be the right phone for you.  I personally went with the Asha because reviews said that the call quality was very good, and I can confirm this in most situations.And if you think of the other smartphone-y functions as merely a bonus, then this phone works well in that regard.  I don't have a data plan, so I can't vouch for the data plan connectivity.  The Asha, however, connects easily to my home's wi-fi network (it's pretty easy to turn on and off from the home screen).  Checking Facebook and email is a cinch whenever I turn on the wi-fi antenna.Other smartphone-y functions:- If you text only occasionally, this phone works fine.  Receiving and reading texts is a cinch, however.- The calender/to-do list is a bit clunky, but it works fine after you get used to it.  Very useful function if you keep daily reminders.- The camera's quality is meh, but it's available.  The camera can also record video.- Despite the small screen, video quality is pretty impressive.- You can play games on it like Angry Birds. (Don't bother using the EA Games app if you're in the U.S.  You can download some of those games here: [...]- The Nokia maps, though a bit clunky, work fine.  However, without a data plan, the maps are essentially useless, right?  Wrong.  Even though you can't automatically locate your position without a data plan, you can still download map data to your phone via wi-fi by panning over your desired locations.  Even without a data plan, if you've already downloaded the map data for your current location, you can see the individual streets and intersections for that location.  This is more useful than you than you would think, especially if you're touring a city/town/anywhere and don't feel like carrying bulky paper maps.The phone's storage is also expandable up to 32 GB.  Basically, you can vastly increase your current phone's capacity for only $10-$20.  The phone's battery life is good (another Nokia trademark, besides good call quality), and the battery can be replaced easily and rather cheaply.Now for some cons, besides the ones mentioned above:- The orientation sensor isn't anywhere as good as that of the iPhone 5 (or most other smartphones, I suspect).  It takes a second or two to switch views when you turn the camera, if it switches views at all.  I don't know what the rules are as to when the phone software decides it can switch views, but it gets annoying when you want to go to landscape view to use the QWERTY keyboard but you remain stuck in portrait view.  In those situations, the already small typing screen becomes even smaller.  I took at least a half star because of the Asha's dodgy and frankly awful orientation sensor.- Frequently, whenever I play Monopoly on the phone for 30+ minutes, the game will freeze and the phone will act up.  I don't know if this is the game's problem or the phones problem, but I'm guessing a bit of both.  The phone gets noticeably hotter at times, and I'm unable turn off the screen with the side button when it gets hot.- The shiny back panel is a scratch and fingerprint magnet.  They really should have made the back panel from the same matte plastic that they used at the bottom of the phone (under the call and disconnect buttons).  It's basically my old iPod Nano first gen problem all over again (as opposed to my new iPod Nano 6th gen, which feels like it will take a diamond in order to scratch it).- Speaking of scratches, this con has more to do with the screen protector than the phone itself.  That said, if you do buy the screen protector sold on Amazon, anticipate a difficult and imperfect installation process (with more air bubbles than you'd like) as well as a ton of scratches on the protector a few weeks after you've installed it.  The Gorilla Glass screen might have been fine in resisting scratches by itself, but I'm paranoid like that.  I'd rather have a crappy screen protector scratched up than the actual phone screen scratched.Basically, my phone is looking pretty beat up after a month and a half of use.  But I don't look at my phone as a fashion accessory.  I look at it as a phone, and thus far, it has done its job.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT (8/2013):  I have a new phone plan that includes data (30 MB, which is more than enough for what I need right now), so now I can review the Asha on its data connectivity.The data connectivity is fine.  I believe you get a max 3.5G connection, which is fine for most non-streaming tasks.  I use it to check email with the app (works just as well as wi-fi), the Facebook app, and the internet on occasion.  The browser works fine for checking sports scores, news, and other small tasks like that.In addition, the Asha makes it really easy to turn on/off data, wi-fi, and Bluetooth connections.  Simply swipe down from the top of the screen to access the quick connectivity/sound/calling/texting menu. For small data plans like mine, it is imperative to have the ability to easily turn on/off the data connection.I've also used the Bluetooth to connect with my car's Bluetooth system.  It works very well as long as you're doing one task at a time.  Calls via Bluetooth are crystal clear, and music/podcasts played from the Asha via Bluetooth sound fine as well.  But don't try to do two things at once because the Asha can't multitask like normal smartphones can.  I tried once to pick up a call while a podcast was playing via Bluetooth to my car's speakers; it did not end well.  I couldn't hear anything on the phone line, and was forced to restart the phone to reboot everything.Text messaging has been better than expected as compared to my previous review above.  Yes, the keyboard is still too small and you'll still make typos.  But like everything, you get better at something as you get more and more used to it.The cons mentioned above are still pretty much there.I managed to get a better sense of how to use the orientation sensor: when I turn my phone and the screen remains in the same position, I tap the bottom of the phone (bottom of whichever orientation I'm in, that is) to try to turn the screen.  It works some of the time, doesn't work other times.  Like I said above, the sensor still stinks.The scratched-up back screen has worked its way to the camera window.  Pictures are blurrier than ever, and they weren't great to begin with.  I'm not sure why Nokia didn't bother to put Gorilla Glass or some other scratch-resistant material there.  To get around the scratched up window, simply take off the cover when you want to take pictures. (Don't forget to hold the battery so that it doesn't fall out!) It's like night and day between the two. Pictures taken without the cover are now of acceptable quality, if not better.  That said, it still sucks that you need to go through such gymnastics to take decent pictures.One other con I might add: the screen lock button on the side doesn't feel sturdy anymore.  It feels like it may give out after one too many uses.  Let's hope that's not the case.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT (1/2014): The phone works perfectly fine if you don't use Nokia Suite, but becomes much improved if you do use it.  I finally used it this week and have been pleasantly surprised.Nokia Suite allows you to do a couple of things.  First, it allows you to update the phone's software, which gives you newer versions of some apps (like Facebook) as well as some new apps and games.  The best part of the updates are the new games, which are all far better than the games originally included (other than Angry Birds).Second, Nokia Suite allows you to download maps of entire countries directly on your phone.  Remember my advice above about saving map sections by panning and zooming with a wi-fi connection (if you don't have a good data plan, that is)?  Forget I even mentioned it.  Once you've download your country's map via Nokia Suite, you won't need to bother with such gymnastics since you now have access to every street and block in your country.The only negative is that the complete US map takes up 2 GB of space, which takes a long time to download and a lot of space on your phone.  So do yourself a favor and buy a 16 GB micro SD card for $10 (which you really should be doing anyway).And finally, don't even bother using the Nokia Xpress browser.  My review above stated that Xpress sucked and was slow.  For several months, I just accepted that the Asha was just not a good web browsing phone because of how crappy Xpress was (despite periodically updating browser).  But I finally got fed up and looked for a new browser on the Nokia Store App.  The Opera Mini browser was highly recommended, so I downloaded it.All I can say is, WOW!  Using Opera Mini to browse the internet is like a complete night a day difference in speed compared with Xpress.  Websites load immediately, and it feels like you're browsing the internet over a true 3.5G connection  Opera Mini's general layout is also far superior to Xpress. So do yourself a favor: download Opera Mini and get rid of Xpress from your life.The only thing to note is that Opera Mini is no longer on the Nokia store after I updated my phone with Nokia Suite.  So you should either download it before you update the phone's software, or download it from the web via Google.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "R. B.

I share the other reviewer's praises.  Nokia's Asha 311 is very well designed and the in-phone and online software is beautiful.  Everything is well thought out and relies on simplicity rather than complexity but has plenty of firepower (my past Pantech and HTC phones prove just the opposite).  Read the online manual to see what I mean.  If you want a phone that has most capabilities but don't want to pay the extra mandatory $40/mo or so for smartphone internet access, this is it.  The touch screen is a new experience for me--very sensitive, yet not prone to errors.  I bought it for use abroad, but can use it with my AT&T; sim card in the US.  (To be picky, the phone is perhaps a tab small--would like it very slightly larger!)I've been disgusted with the \"locked\" phones AT&T; offers in their stores, and now its down to just a handful of non-smart phones.  With an unlocked phone you can purchase an independent sim card for about $50/mo. which gives you lots of talk and internet time--much better than the major carrrier's contract rates. (Some sims actually use the same network as AT&T;, so you get the same quality.  Note that Verizon's network is incompatible with most unlocked phones).  So no more 2 year contracts--take THAT AT&T;!  Check out [...].  \"Locked\" phones are a US phone carrier scam that does just what they say--locks you into high monthly fees.  Europeans have been enjoying the benefits of unlocked phones for years and now we can too.  Hope this helps.Further comment:  Took off one star because internet access won't work using AT&T; network in the states--you must use WiFi.  Also their downloaded maps are not the greatest.  Talk and sms are good, as is Nokia support.Update, April 8, 2013.  Many hours later, I finally DID get internet access.  With Nokia's help, found an AT&T; forum that gives the internet (web) and MMS (multimedia) settings you need to plug into your phone so it will work properly (presumably they only work if you're with AT&T;). So I'll restore the star I took off before.  Here's the link for the magic info (some terms were slightly different on my Asha.  note that this is for a Nokia C3 phone, but it still works):[...]On my Asha 311, I went to \"Tools, configuration, personal settings\".  Create and set up the \"AT&T; MMS\" settings, and then the \"Media Net\" (web) settings.  Call Nokia if you have trouble.Hope this helps others avoid the multiple hours of set-up.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong item description.

You can set the phone language to English and it does work well, but don't expect French (Qu\u00e9bec) or Spanish menus and interfaces.Even worse, the phone is supposed to come with a 2 GB MicroSD card from the factory (although this listing incorrectly indicates 4 GB), but it is not in the box as delivered. Does the vendor remove the cards? You will need a MicroSD card for music, videos, maps, etc. even for your own ringtones.Overall, not a bad purchase, except for those negative points. If you can find a better deal elsewhere (with the MicroSD card and a North American model, if that even exists), then definitely go for it.Don't forget to get the Nokia PCSuite from the Nokia web site for connecting to your Windows computer.One problem - WiFi may not work for you. This is not a problem with the Nokia phone, but with your phone service provider/company. The moment you insert your MicroSIM and power the phone on, it downloads a configuration file from your phone company. Some of them don't like you using WiFi instead of their mobile date connections, so they block WiFi (I use Orange and they do this.)

The small screen and limited number of apps really make more of a feature phone than a true smart phone.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "danny medina", "ReviewID": "RRDOB9SSBBN8U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Muy buen tel\u00e9fono ajustado al precio, lo \u00fanico malo es que el proveedor no cumpli\u00f3 con lo especificado indicando una memoria de 4 gb y lo que vino incluida fue una memoria de 2 GB", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Florin", "ReviewID": "R145LVIYZHYV7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "for some reason the mobile data doesn't work on it.might be because wind mobile in Canada has a lot of problems with the network", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Asha-bama: Using the Nokia Asha 311 in the Southern U.S.", "Author": "Trevor", "ReviewID": "R2540KCAQA45Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My LG Xpression just wasn't working for me, so I decided to get a new phone. I already had an active basic phone plan with AT&T; and didn't really want a smartphone anyway, so I did some thorough searching (thanks, PhoneArena.com!) and narrowed my choice down to either the LG Arena or the Nokia Asha 311. I couldn't find an Arena on Amazon, but they had the Asha and it was eligible for Amazon Prime! Decision made.I was a little hesitant purchasing a phone not released in the United States, but after reading reviews and checking the specs I decided to give it a chance. So far, I really like it! :)DIMENSIONS:I don't care for the way phones are getting bigger and bigger. At roughly 2\" x 4\" x 1/2\", I'm very pleased with the size. It's about the same size as my old LG Xpression 2 (same as LG Extravert, Reflex, etc.) and about 1/4\" thinner. It's thinner than the pictures make it look.CONSTRUCTION:It's lightweight all-plastic construction feels very sturdy. Knowing the screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass is another touch that gives this phone a premium feel. As added precaution, I purchased the black Amzer case to protect the phone from dings and scratches.TOUCH SCREEN:The capacitive multi-touch screen is VERY responsive. In fact, it maybe even TOO responsive, but I can get used to that. The virtual keyboard is small, yes, but what do you expect from a 3\" screen? I have average-sized thumbs and don't have too much trouble typing. Yes, I occasionally  tap the letter next to the one I meant to enter, but it doesn't happen enough to discourage me from typing.SPEED:The 1 gHz processor in this thing is very quick! I've gone through all of the features, menus, etc. and everything loads and transitions very quickly with no lagging whatsoever that I've noticed (so far).PHYSICAL BUTTONS:Someone mentioned the side buttons in particular being hard to press, but I disagree. The side and front buttons all give a nice, firm, reassuring click when pressed.USER INTERFACE:Even though the screen is low-res and only 64k colors, it's very bright with rich, vivid color. The layout is very organized, simple and not over-complicated, and very easy to navigate and use. Some of the standout features include an FM tuner (not yet tested), e-mail client, news app, weather app, internet radio app, and a variety of games (Bejeweled, Angry Birds, dice, and more).CAMERA:At 3.2 MP, it takes photos big enough for me. The photo quality isn't the greatest, but this isn't a smartphone with high-end optics like the iPhone, Galaxy, etc. It does, however, have a decent set of features (digital zoom, burst shot, self-timer, color effects, fun frames, fun shutter sounds, grid overlay for photo composition, white balance presets, and exposure adjustment). Besides, if I want to take a quality photo, I'll use an actual camera and not a phone.==========Overall, it's a good little \"feature phone\" that definitely lives up to that description. It's loaded with features, has fast performance, a responsive screen, and solid construction. That's not to say it's perfect, however. My single biggest gripe is definitely a lack of GPS capability, but not because I need navigation. Without GPS, if I'm ever in an emergency, police and other emergency personnel will have to triangulate my position using cell towers which is slower and far less accurate than GPS. One other minor gripe is that, unless I'm overlooking the option, you can only set one alarm at a time. Ultimately, however, I'm pleased with the phone and glad I took a chance on the Nokia Asha 311. :)", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "rojas518@hotmail.com", "Author": "Francisco Rojas", "ReviewID": "RZNYRTKJSQJ2W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Meets my expectations, what I expected and would recommend to those who like me, are not lovers of technological excess.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia Asha 311", "Author": "Andrew Uy \"Betterlate1\"", "ReviewID": "R1PBYKZ55BCIAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good alternative to a smartphone.

So far, I haven't put a SIM chip in one, since I don't use either of the USA GSM carriers. So, I've only used it with a WiFi connection. Product was not really as promised. The \"Maps\" app isn't at all like GPS, and it only gets your location by triangulating signals from nearby cell towers (a pretty inaccurate way to do it). Worse, the \"keyboard\" is on the screen but functions like a basic phone, in that you have just 10 keys and have to hit \"pqrs\" 4 times to get an \"s\", so even basic texting is slow and cumbersome (the good news is that the keys are large enough on the small screen). Also, even with a very good, fast WiFi connection, I couldn't get this phone to play any videos.Nokia's literature claims the phone has the ability to synch contacts via Bluetooth, but although I got it paired with my Bluetooth cellphone, nothing synched, and I think that it only synches with other Nokia telephones (a fact that Nokia doesn't seem to feel worthy of mentioning in its user guide). Speaking of the user guide, the box from Amazon's vendor included only a user guide in German. German??? I was able to download one from Nokia's website, but only by pretending I wasn't in the USA. Apparently, Nokia never sold this exact model in the USA, so Nokia won't give you a user manual if you're dumb enough to find yourself in the USA with this phone. It's not totally clear exactly what I purchased, actually. The to-be-sold-in-Germany version of a Finnish phone made in India is my best guess.The phone is small and is nice in the hand, and the screen is big enough (although I've yet to see any video at all on it). The user interface is clean enough and slightly customizable, but requires way too many confirmations. Every time you leave an application, it demands to know if you really meant to do so. That gets old.I assume this phone will eventually provide basic telephone functions when I put a working SIM chip in it, and when/if it does, I'll upgrade this rating to 3 stars, but it will always be quite limited for any smartphone functions.Update: I used this phone all over Europe this summer, and I have a better opinion of it now. I was able to get it to synch all my Outlook contacts and bookmarks, but only using a USB cable and the Nokia desktop software. It was pretty hard to do, but in the end it worked.On the road, the phone worked fine, with good battery life. I wouldn't ever want to use it for Internet browsing unless I had a good WiFi connection, though as data speeds were never usable, and the phone frequently froze. Another weak spot is the socket for a SIM card--it is very flimsy and takes a lot of wiggling to get it to accept the SIM. About half the times I took out the battery to swap batteries between phones, the SIM card and/or the memory chip fell out. It's a phone, but very basic one, and the promised GPS never delivered anything at all. So I'm upgrading this to 3 stars, as it does work.
