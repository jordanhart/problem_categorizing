I got mine throught Tracfone with the triple minutes for life.  I had been looking for a phone with these features- voice dialing and voice commands, slide out qwerty keyboard and the most important feature of them all- CDMA coverage!  Yes, it uses Verizon towers!  It seems that CDMA prepaid phones are in the minority as far as cell phones go.  That being said, it really fit the bill!  Thanks Tracfone and Net 10!  Keep bringing us those CDMA phones!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great NET10 Replacement Phone", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "R1MUNL7OF0EAA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previously had a low cost $20 cell phone from NET10 and this one hands down is 10x better just in the battery life.  The other one from the word go required charging every 2-3 days with little to no use.  If I was traveling I would have 1-2 hrs of talk time before the battery was completely dead, usually required a recharge after 4-6 hours.This phone on the other hand can last 10-14 days even with use and the slide out keyboard is pretty nice.  It would be nice if the menu was customizable.  Another major complaint is the camera button does not work.  To use hte camera you have to go into several sub menus, what a pain.Finally the other BIG DRAWBACK is the phone deducts minutes the second you hit the send button to make a call.  Whether you connect or not you are going to get charged the minute charge and the clock will start ticking from the moment you press send.  Definitely a detractor seeing how every other NET10 phone didn't start charging you until the call actually connected, AS IT SHOULD!!!!All in all a great NET10 phone.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS PHONE", "Author": "Pam Carter", "ReviewID": "RDEE490BEIZSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and orignally I had the NET 10 but it was too complecated to get the minutes and they were more expensive through net 10/ so I brought it back and went to wlmart and got this in the straight talk phone for 30.00 1000 min/1000 texts  I love it best buy ever, I was with VeriZon for 9 years/ we pay much less now and great coverage!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Alright", "Author": "K.

Bauman \"bauman171\"", "ReviewID": "RSJPGFZC7LOU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a replacement to the identical one I accidentally broke.  It's easy to use, customizable and has a bright display (easy to see in daylight) and is compatible with Net10 service.  The only downsides I have come up with for this phone are 1) it's not compatible with the Cellular One computers that can transfer your contact list from another phone to this one, and 2) you have to remove the back of the phone to access the microSDHC card (I think this is not unusual, but it is still inconvenient).The battery usually lasts me about four days before it requires recharging (I usually charge it when it's down to one bar, but also keep in mind I don't use the phone a lot, mostly just texting with a few phone calls a week and occasional pics taken).  The camera is sufficient- I think the quality one would expect from a cell phone.One downside to this phone is that there is no setting to turn off the ringer/alert but keep the alarm on.  You can turn the sound completely off or turn it on, that's it.Another note- the headset that I have used on my last LG phone and another Samsung that I previously owned does not work on the this phone.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "J.Rushing", "ReviewID": "R2QGQV3OK8V43M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "only thing that annoys me is that there is a 160 character limit and you can not have multiple pages of text. as long as you texts are short you will be fine but if you like typing a short story then you will have to send it in chunks.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great inexpensive phone", "Author": "C.

I live in Maine which has a strong US Cellular presence and they are a CDMA carrier. Logically, having a CDMA phone would give me extended coverage around the state over GSM. What turned my opinion on the phone was how poorly it worked in my home calling area in Portland. Calls from my house were plagued with echoes. Signal stength didn't matter, 4 bars, 1 bar, as long as I was within a mile of my house I got an echo. There were places out and about where the phone worked wonderfully, better than my wife's NET10 GSM phone, but that alone didn't justify keeping the phone. More often than not the signal was fleeting, going from home to roam, 4 bars to 1 for no reason I could figure out.Overall, sound quality was disappointing. This may be an issue of samsungs of this generation because two phones, the 455 and 404, had poor voice quality issues. They were gurgley.Physically, it's a blocky phone. Thick in the pocket, thicker than the s404 and twice as thick as the lg500 that replaced it.I bought the phone for the slider option to increase my texting speed, which it did do, but the keyboard does not feel as good or seems to be as functional as the s404's.Likes: I do like that the phone can use full mp3s as ring tones. Battery life was great for the month that I had it. As all reviews for NET10 phones seem to indicate, the browser button is in a bad place, but the keyboard lock worked well to keep from pocket surfing the web, the sad thing that it is for NET10 service. Opening the slider is the fastest way to turn the keypad lock off to get to texts and what not.I returned this phone to amazon and they were great about issuing me an RMA at the 30 day mark. Net10s customer service was informative and effective in checking out whether the phone was working properly first. Unfortunately, it was. I got stuck with the s404, but that's another review.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone...why did it say triple minutes???
