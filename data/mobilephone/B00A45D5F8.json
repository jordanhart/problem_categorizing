{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great Phone with Inherent Flaws", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R2YFG9YOSIJ5HT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let's get to the nitty gritty:Pros:1- It's BIG. Big for gaming, big for videos, big for web browsing. Simply put, if you want a phone with the most real estate on the screen size, then there is no alternative. Don't be so mesmerized on the 1080p screens that will come out soon. Unless you want to destroy your eyes and use the phone from an inch away, you will not notice the difference in everyday use.2- It's fast. Yes, the Qualcomm S4 Pro quad-core beats this Tegra 3/Exynos 4 CPU in most benchmarks, but again, unless you are a hard-core geek that is OCD on numbers, you will not notice any difference in everyday use. There is no discernible lag anywhere (it's probably just your slow Internet connection).3- It's beautiful. Not HTC or Sony beautiful, but this is one sleek and stylish phone. The white is classic, but this Titanium Gray is awesome. Just check out the back cover and you will see what I mean (yes, even with that cheap-feeling plastic material).4- Did I mention the screen? It's BIG, it's bright, and it's beee-ay-eeww-ti-ful! AMOLED screens have awesome color saturation and contrast (most times even overkill, actually). Some people say it's not good in daylight. Um, have you tried cranking up the brightness??5- The Samsung/Android touch. Not everyone may like Samsung's Touchwiz user interface compiled onto Android, but I dare you to find a phone with more features than this one (and similarly the Galaxy S3). Here are the main highlights:a. Samsung utilizes the front facing camera almost to perfection. You can use it to control your music player; it has facial recognition to sense you are directly in front of the screen so it won't dim and turn off the screen (for reading, web browing, video playback, etc.); it recognizes your facial orientation so that when you are lying down sideways looking at the screen, the accelerometer will not kick in to auto-rotate the screen in the wrong orientation. That is something that has always bothered me with other phones and FINALLY someone has added that feature! Granted, not all these features work flawlessly, but it's a great start.b. Integration with Google is finally starting to show off in good ways. It was always once that Apple had the superior ecosystem. But now we see the future is bright indeed. Not just evolution, but finally innovation!c. The S Pen and all the neat things you can do with it. Preview a point in the movie before skipping to that point, and other things like going old-school back to the PDA days!6- It accepts up to a 64GB microSD card. That turned out to be the dealbreaker for me. Explanation in \"cons\" section below.Cons:1- It's BIG. With my tiny hands(hey hey), I can hardly do anything one-handed with this phone. Pocketability rating: -2. Putting it up on your face to make a phone call is also a big fail if you're sensitive to public ridicule like me. Have your Bluetooth earpiece ready.2- It's quite heavy. I really wanted to switch to the Verizon Droid DNA - for a 5-inch screen, it was remarkably svelte and light. And if it wasn't for the fact of pi$$-poor Verizon customer service at their call centers, and that it only had 16GB of memory with no microSD card option, I would have made the switch. The Droid DNA is superior in every way except those things mentioned. I have absolutely no doubt that the Samsung Note 3 (and maybe even the Galaxy S4) will be a 1080p screen with the Exynos 5 quadcore - can't wait!3- The screen may be bright and colorful, but it's way over-saturated and unnatural. Fortunately, you can go to the screen options and set it to \"Natural.\" \"Dynamic\" is overkill, and even so is \"Standard.\"Conclusion:Even with its inherent flaws, I can't help but love it. It's not even a phone, it's a cellular tablet(cablet, anyone??). I'm going to keep it. Until the next big thing is already here....", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Different strokes for different folks", "Author": "Edmund D'souza \"IT Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2220UVMNEV6XV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a hard time trying to decide to stick with my s3, go to the s4 or get a note 2.  This review is intended for people on prepaid or for people who buy the phone outright.The current T-Mobile S3 is worth about $300-$350 used.The T-Mobile S4 sells for $500 and is $629 newThe T-Mobile note 2 is $699 new and $400 usedI wanted BANG for my buck.  So the way I look at it, I paid $50 to upgrade from a S3 to a note 2 and this is what I got:4.8\" to a 5.5\" screenStylusQuad coreMuch better battery lifeI love the s4 don't get me wrong, but after playing with it in person, it gets really hot, its much more fragile, and its just plain..  The screen is nice but honestly who reads 3\" from their face anyway?  The note 2 is the perfect resolution and is just more practical.  The only negatives are its a struggle to reach the corner 1 handed.  I can use it one handed its just not as easy as the s3.  Partly due to the weight with an otterbox it tends to slide out of my hand more.Let depreciation work for you and the fact of the matter is that the note 3 is coming out in September and the note 2 can be found for a little over half price.  It is almost as fast as an s4 in real life usage and costs $100 less used.  Just my opinion..", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone...", "Author": "Bobby \"Bobby\"", "ReviewID": "R35SFORPSEW1MB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're wavering between this and the S4, there aren't many differences, aside from the size... you'll be splitting hairs trying to find them. Folks are quick to point out that the S4 is faster, but one car goes 190 and the other goes 180... for me, that's a wash, especially since all of the speed limit signs are no higher than 70... (think about that analogy).But if you really are concerned with the speeds, CNET has an article about the 5 fastest phones in the world, and the S4 and Note2 are two of the five phones!I dropped it one star because it hasn't updated to the latest Android OS. It's a hair behind what S4 has. I believe Samsung is delaying the update because they want to sell S4's. If they just plunked down the same OS for Note and S3 that S4 has, then the S4 wouldn't stand apart... some of you know what I'm talking about with the iPad 2 and 3. The operating systems are identical, thereby offering nearly identical experiences... again, one is faster, but revisit my comments about speed. At the end of the day, they're both so fast, it's impossible for me to hand you either device and you know you're dealing with the faster/slower of the two.One last thing, T-mobile's service is a drop off from Vz or ATT... most notably, it doesn't seem to work in buildings. My old Vz phone worked in most buildings with no problem. My T-mobile works about 40% of the time in big buildings.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever used by a mile", "Author": "B100", "ReviewID": "R15FN6DCIII2D0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has been my daily driver for about 9 monthsPros:1. Battery: Best battery life I've every experienced on a phone. Finally I don't have to worry about my phone dying on me before day's end. It also has the added advantage of a removable battery so when I'm traveling I don't have to worry about the juice when my flight is cancelled or delayed. If it dies I just pop in another battery. It actually has never diet on me yet2. S Pen, S Note and the other Note features are awesome. I can even fill out forms and sign them and email them back on my device, etc. After my experience with these features I can't possibly use a non-Note device ever again. They all don't measure up as far as functionality goes and so this is also bar none the most functional phone I've ever used and I've used a lot of them3. Screen size: Great size. I hardly ever use my tablet now.4. Pocketability: I'm surprised at how easily pocketable it is despite the size. It fits well in my skinny jeans despite he size. This is because this device is also quite thin5. Loudness: the single back speaker is quite loud and clear.6. Speed: Good speed. Probably the fastest phone I've ever used (unless the internal storage drops below ~ 2.5gb then the speed also degrades and it begins to lag - I'll address this under cons)7. TouchWiz: a lot of people bash TouchWiz but I disagree. I agree it could be more aesthetically polished but it's far superior to anything else out there in functionality. The icons, etc may not be the most beautiful but this is easily solved by installing Nova launcher from the play store and you don't have to root / modify your device to make it look the way you want because it runs on Android.8. Very good camera with a lot of features - I like that it can take 20pics in 3 seconds and yet maintain good quality in well lit situations (average night / dark situation quality pictures)Cons:1. Lack of adequate internal storage: This is my biggest issue with this thing. It has only 16gb of internal storage, but apps don't install to SD. You might think 16gb is a lot but I've pretty much run out of storage pretty quickly (and this is without storing pics, music videos or games on the internal storage)- I have 82 apps installed and I can't accommodate anymore because I have to maintain about 2.5 to 3gb of free internal storage otherwise the phone begins to lag and freeze like a spastic (and yes I actually use all the apps installed - some for frequently than others). I find this very annoying. Now, I understand that this may not be an issue for a lot of people who don't use a lot of apps and who eschew storing music, video, games and pictures on the internal storage, but it is for me and a big one at that.2. Poor sunlight legibility: This is also annoying. When standing under direct bright sunlight it's hard to read anything on the screen. My old Galaxy Nexus with Amoled screen had much better sunlight legibility than this phoneStill giving 5 stars despite those two annoying cons because this is simply the overall best phone I've ever owned /used and non other comes anywhere close, not remotely (phones used - Nexus one, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, iPhone 5 - one of the worst experiences, Nexus 4, Galaxy S, galaxy SII, Galaxy SIII, Droid DNA - and maybe some others that I can't remember at this time)I certainly very highly recommend this phone or you can wait to see what the Galaxy Note III has to offer in 2 months (since my review is coming so close to the release of the Note III)", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Business", "Author": "Freddie Casiano", "ReviewID": "R1XBLP5KZSW6A7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The seller listed the phone as unocked and ready to use  but I was unable to use the phone as there was an insurance block on the phone.

Works like a charm if the wifi is reasonably quick.This is incredible phone - large enough to write with the pen, read plenty of text, do work on the web, etc.  This can easily replace my top of the line IPAD and am considering doing that possibly. Speech to text is also noticeably more accurate than the iPad for quick dictation.The pen is configured to bring up the writing pad for quick notation the moment I pop the pen out.This does require a fair bit of learning curve but after a few hours of learning it and configuring it, it is phenomenal tool that keeps all my to-do list, calendar, pdf scanning of documents, calls, text etc. It also functions as a hotspot for my laptop when I need the laptop to do work. 95% of what I need is on three pages so everything is one page flick away.And yet small enough to fit in a men's pants pocket or dress shirt sized pocket.  Yes, obviously more bulky than a smaller smart phone but not a problem.Best gadget tool I've ever had.  Increased my productivity significantly.The only way I would love to see this improved is to have a design with virtually ZERO bezel so that the screen is larger without increasing the size of the phone itself.  That could give us a 1/2 inch larger screen without adding to the phone size.  That, and the camera on the Lumia 1020 on this....:)  I would happily trade away pixels for much improved low light shots.Easy five stars.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Eve", "ReviewID": "R18A7Z3W01HXXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is exactly the same as the we brought from T-mobile except the packaging is different.
