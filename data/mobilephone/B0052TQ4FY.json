{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Droid 2 lasted a full 18 months +", "Author": "AccioFirebolt", "ReviewID": "R19KU8BAWGQSAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't understand all of the negative reviews for this phone. I noticed that some of the reviews are rating the seller they bought it from instead of the phone itself which isn't fair for this product.This was my first smartphone. I chose this one for the full keyboard. Let me tell you, this phone lasted a full 18 months until my next contract extension and then I was able to resell it to a friend and it's still going strong for him.Let me say the only problems I had with this phone. Firstly, it froze and/or powered off then powered itself back on a couple times a week. It wasn't a big deal for me. Just take the battery out if it ever freezes, put it back in, then restart it.Second problem is that the keyboard went \"wonky\" sometimes where it wouldn't type or wouldn't recognize inputs. After researching online, I was easily able to fix this problem. All you have to to is clear the cache. Go to Settings>Manage Apps>Keyboard<then clear cache and that will solve your problem.Those are the only problems I had with this phone. I absolutely loved it. I also tried a Droid 2 Global and if you're given the choice, choose the Droid 2 instead because it is better unless you need the Global for international use.I love the full keyboard. Fast internet speeds. Easily connects to bluetooth. I was able to connect it to my computer via bluetooth which made sharing media between the 2 super easy. Ran all the apps that I downloaded.Let me recommend adding the Amazon MP3 app. I used it as my main music player because the user interface is better than the stock music player. You can add your entire music collection to your Amazon Cloud from your computer and it automatically sends them to the app on your phone which saves up tons of memory because the music is saved onto your Amazon account and not on your phone. Then when you get a new phone, you download the MP3 app to the new phone and all your music is right there. Very convenient. I literally have 2000 songs saved to my cloud so it's like having a iPod and phone all in one.Add the Amazon App Store application. You get a free paid app everyday so that I now have over 400 paid apps that I got for free easily saving me $1,000+ if I were to purchase those same apps. Like the MP3 app, the apps you download are saved to your Amazon account so that they will follow you from phone to phone which I can verify from having done it myself.And download a free browser app. I prefer the Dolphin browser but there are many other options including Firefox Mobile. The browser apps are better than the stock browser.So whatever problems other have had with the stock browser, music player, etc, etc, can be easily circumvented by following the tips I have given you. The firmware isn't great on any of the Droids I have had so far, including Droid X, X2, Droid 2 Global, and this phone. But by customizing the phone by using the app store, it's like customizing your home computer. I use Firefox browser instead of Internet Explorer on my laptop, for example.Any app that is giving you trouble, just go the the app in the settings, clear the cache, and chances are that will fix the problem. There are dozens of free touch keyboard options, too.How many electronic devices nowadays hold up over 18 months? Not many especially not smartphones but this one did. I loved it. I will continue to buy Droid phones for as long as I have cellphones. Very well made.Buy the extended battery. You will need it. Buy extra chargers for your car, work, etc, anywhere you will be using your phone.Finally, the Otterbox is the best case for this phone. I tried dozens. The screen on this phone has rounded corners so most of the cheapy cases will not fit because the screen piece pops off due to the odd shape. Buy the Otterbox.OtterBox Motorola DROID 2 Commuter Series Case", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Droid 2", "Author": "Ross", "ReviewID": "R18J9X48TUS497", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was really surprised how fast I got this and let me say that this phone is great.

I have tried dozens of them. I prefer this phone over all the others, including the iPhone 4s. Some of the benefits I see over other phones are as follows:1. Flip Keyboard: It's must faster to type with than an on-screen keyboard.2. Speed: The speed is about as fast as most other phones. It does what it needs to do quickly, without much lag-time.3. Battery Life: As long as I keep the Wi-Fi off when I'm not power using the internet, This phone easily lasts all day. Even after I've had the phone for a year and a half.There are two things I don't like about the phone.1. The stupid programs that come with the phone that Verizon won't let you delete. (you can get around this by rooting the phone).2. The camera isn't very good. Although it is a 5 mega pixel camera, the shutter speed is slow.

The battery life is a tragedy but if you turn of the gps, back round data and wifi it is average. Around 8 hours. I've had it for about a week and its working fine, the camera is pretty good in the write lighting but the flash messes up at times. The sound quality is outstanding, but the keyboard slides choppily, might just be this individual phone. I'm very clumsy and have dropped it on the gym floor, my house tile, in the grass, on my bathroom floor, and nothing happened. I takes so long to power up and if you take a picture by yourself it'll make a sound even on silent. You will have to go into  settings to turn of vibrations because it'll vibrate even if on silent.

The screen has a good resolution and the processor can run any app with no trouble. The battery, when new, could last me for 3 days if I had only used it to make/receive a few calls a day and check email.However, this phone loses 2 stars because of a large magnitude of little bugs and inconveniences. My first Droid 2 lasted for about a year, before the lock button on the top of the phone completely broke. I sent it in and got another one back.I have had the second one for about another year and it's limping along, but still working. Unfortunately, there are some rather annoying stability issues that arise with this phone after a few months. For example, the touch-screen interface will occasionally glitch on me, causing it to slide the red \"ignore\" bar instead of the green \"accept\" bar when answering a call, or not allowing me to fully slide the bar to answer the call. Occasionally when receiving a call, the touch screen won't work at all, causing me to miss the call. After a year, these glitches happen fairly often.I play tennis once or twice a week, and would sometimes make a call while taking a break. Even after wiping my phone clean if I got sweat on it, somehow sweat managed to get under the screen through the receiver. As a result, there is a layer of dried salt under my screen that covers a good quarter of it. I realize I should have been a little more careful, but I'm still surprised this happened at all.Overall, the Droid 2 is a good phone. If my experience is any indicator, it will most likely last you a year or so before having a few annoying glitches or a major stability problem.

I'm sure I can get at least 24 hours out of this phone with heavy use before the phone runs out of power.There is one problem however, and that is that you do get what you pay for. $70 for an amazing phone like this does come at a cost- and that is that this phone lags, glitches, and randomly reboots a lot. Not that it feels slow or anything- it's really fast when doing a task or two, but fill it up with a full arsenal of today's most popular social apps though, and you *will* feel the drag of having only 512 mb of ram. My Nokia n900 can handle a *huge* amount of simultaneous windows all open at once with no lag, and it's partly due to the fact that it has 1Gb of ram. With the tremendous weight of apps these days, 512Mb is barely enough for doing two or three things at once.It sucks living in 2014 because developers all over the world are making \"ipads\" and the latest \"iphones\" the standard for whom they develop their web pages and applications. Us stubborn folk who are stuck in 2008 are stuck with a slow laggy internet experience as a result of the sheer amount of javascript and/or ajax that they cram into everything these days.Nonetheless, I don't feel disappointed from my phone.

Well, the phone itself is nice - camera's decent and takes nice pictures, keyboard is fabulous and very easy to use; probably the best I've used. The performance is good too with a robust processor and 4G (at least in the version I have). Video on the phone looks awesome. The sound is decent for the phone, but the speaker isn't the best for speaking. If the phone's not positioned perfectly the person on the other end will complain that they can't hear me (this was less of a problem on previous phones).With that said, the software has a number of serious flaws that prevent me from giving this a higher review. I was used to having a BlackBerry optimized for business-type functions, so I was horrified by many aspects of the UI. For example:- Copy and paste is phenomenally awkward. It's not at all obvious how you're supposed to do it initially and it's unreasonably difficult to do even when you know. It took me at least 10 - 15 minutes to figure out even with instructions and even now I'll often opt for copying things with pen and paper.- There phone comes without a \"built-in\" memo app. You can download one but it's still a very careless oversight on their part.- Calls often take several steps, even once you select a number. It takes an additional step beyond what my BlackBerry took. Suppose it's a minor inconvenience, but you'd think they would optimize the UI to make what's (presumably) the primary use case as efficient as possible. This is UI design 101 and is frankly downright incompetent of the designers.- It's very difficult to take notes on calls and I still haven't fully figured this out.- The calendar app is clunky. It's too difficult to go to a specified date compared to my old BlackBerry. Also, on my old BlackBerry it was easy to type in a specific date or time for a new appointment, but on this UI you have to scroll through the times until you reach the right one. For example, the default time for reminders is 8 AM; if you wanted to set it to 1:45 PM you'd have to scroll through 5 hours until you got to 1 and then 45 minutes until you got to the right one. It takes much longer than it did on my old BlackBerry.I've done a fair number of UI designs before in my day and honestly such careless errors are probably grounds to fire their designers. Apple and RIM have a clear idea of their target audience and designed their UIs accordingly but I see little evidence that Google/Motorola thought that through.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Droid 2", "Author": "The Commenter", "ReviewID": "R3S4PMT47MRHZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Droid 2 is a great phone to introduce you to the android world, there are some small issues, but nothing unfix-able.

I've read almost every review on this phone and there are only 2 comments I have in response to all the good and bad reviews.1.  Either people are extremely stupid and don't have any idea on how to use there hands and brains at the same time.  Or...2.  50% of the phones that are ordered are bad while the other 50% are good.  Which is a terrible ratio.I really hope it's #2, but for some reason I doubt that is entirely true.  Anyway, there is nothing wrong with the phone I ordered.  I used it as a pay by month phone and the service I get basically rides Verizon's network.I truly hope this helps someone make a choice in whether to purchase this or not.

I can type text messages faster than even text message speed demons can on on-screen keypads. It worked flawlessly for about a year and a half and then I started having minor issues. Just crashing every once in a while and apps freezing up sometimes. I upgraded to a 32GB microSD card and it fixed them for the rest of the year. A few months after our contract was up, my phone started to have these issues again but it's nowhere near filled up that microSD. I've uninstalled apps and all sorts of things to try to get past these issues, but nothing has helped. As time has gone by, these issues have just gotten worse and worse to the point that I am beginning to hate the phone I used to love. Now, it doesn't always save pictures, it freezes up constantly, it crashes constantly, it calls the same person twice in one phone call (and when you tell it to talk to the second call it crashes. If you tell it to not talk to the second call it hangs up on the person completely...). There have been all kinds of crazy things. However, this phone was great for most of my contract term and even now, when it's working right, it's just fine.The other two Droid 2s my parents have (they use theirs much less but are more physically abusive) are still functioning like they should. Both have damaged pixels and one of the phones has had to have the screen and power button replaced from being accidentally thrown across a truck, but they work just fine.However, every Verizon salesperson I've ever spoken to about my phone made a face as soon as they realized the model. Apparently, most of these phones had some pretty serious issues. I've been told it's as a result of the slide out keyboard (both the mechanical parts/circuitry and the programming). I'm not sure how true that is, but I don't know that I can recommend this phone based on problems I've been told about from friends who also owned this phone.

I've had nothing but problems, Verizon was forthright and gave me a replacement and I still had the same problems.  Interestingly, my daughters phone had all the same problems and more, they also replaced that one.  Last month we simply threw hers out and got her an iPhone.  The glitches are all software conflicts and could easily be solved if only Motorola-Google-Verizon could get on the same sheet of music in terms of updates.  The more updates I receive, the more problems I have.If you want a phone that:-cuts off phone calls and starts playing music-buzzes or announces \"Verizon Wireless\" every 2-3 minutes-freezes when the mailbox is full and requires a hard reboot-freezes occasionally when you pull the keyboard and requires a hard reboot-has a battery that lasts less than 4 hours when using the 4G network-has an undecypherable file organization-and many more little quirksThen this is the phone for you.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Morgan Sowers", "ReviewID": "RUACP4UYSOGXY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item was fine for the first day.

This phone has the capability of being a good paper weight and that's about it.  The slide lock will freeze up, apps will freeze and the phone has dialed my parents a few times when I'm attempting to get out of the app and into the task manage or turn off the phone to get it to stop.  Its embarrassing to yell \"Dad hang up!  No, its not that I don't want to talk to you, the phone dialed you again!\" and end up taking the battery out while trying to resist the urge to smash it against a wall.  I got the phone shortly after it came out and I know sometimes it takes a bit for bugs to be worked out but the first one was damaged and returned and the replacement sucks just as bad if not worse.  I regret not holding out for the HTC thunderbolt or something else.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "just dont like the phone", "Author": "melissa", "ReviewID": "R2SR5XQA82JW5X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "don't like the phone I want something more like the iphone or glaxy note much better phones this doesn't have everything I need", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola Droid 2", "Author": "ZacharyPlastina", "ReviewID": "R1M1FL8LXXMW91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone cause its da bomb and also my dad has one so we can be like buds.
