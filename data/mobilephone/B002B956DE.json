Hartshorne \"Adarg\"", "ReviewID": "R36BR1JHVRNCT0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for about two years now, and up until my purchasing of this phone, I thought that I'd never be happy with them.Don't get me wrong, they have some of the best plans I've ever seen (I pay $35 a month for everything I could ever need), it's just their phones that never appealed to me. I had the Wild Card a year ago, and let's just say that it kind of scarred me for life. :DI was urging towards the X-tc, but too many reviews stating that it had all sorts of bugs turned me off. And then I discovered the Shuttle.An affordable device that has almost too many features for its price (which isn't a bad thing, mind you), the Shuttle is a great phone that I'll never regret buying. The 1.3 megapixel camera with a camcorder ain't too bad, either.Since this wouldn't be a review without a complaint or two (I'm a poet today), I'll admit that the camera quality isn't the best, especially for one that can take video. I mean, if I'm gonna take a video of something, I want it to look at least half-decent. The 1.3 megapixel makes your videos look like something on YouTube before they came up with the idea for high quality video support. In other words, videos don't look good on the Shuttle. This is minor, though. I mean, it has 3G.I recommend this to any Virgin Mobile customer who wants quite possibly their best phone. Sure, the Rumor2 is nice, but that's for people who love to text. Even though I admit I'm a texter, I still wouldn't pay $130 for a phone that doesn't have as much as the Shuttle. And that's that.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE!", "Author": "Stevens \"Melissa\"", "ReviewID": "R7PESLWHSRW6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good slider phone.  I love it.The screen is sharp and clear.  Web surfing is 3G, very fast and agile.  It runs smoothly with Opera Mini 4.2.It can play music and audio from a Micro-SD card. You load it from your computer and then insert it in the phone.The selection of games you can buy at VXL included two of my favorites, \"Scrabble\" and \"Tetris\". I paid around $6 for each and now I can have them in my phone for life. They are a lot of fun to play.It is bluetooth enabled for calls, is a memo recorder, calendar, calculator, alarm, etc.The cons I find in this phone is that it takes 1 minute video clips which are not the best in quality. The image breaks with movement and the resolution is very low.  It also lacks a \"qwerty\" keyboard.I've had this phone for 2 years now and it still works and looks like new.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Virgin Mobile Shuttle", "Author": "MARKMIXALOT \"MARK GANGADEEN\"", "ReviewID": "R33GKI2Z5J6DDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Virgin Mobile Shuttle is a great phone, I wanted to know if it played music, which was very important, because in the past my son had an Ipod, a cell phone and a Palm, However these were to many different machines for him to have, because he would loose or they would be stolen or to many different communications devices in his hand, and some of them would fall and get broken, Now the Virgin Mobile Shuttle seems to do everything and I have not heard many complaints from him. But I have seen better upgrades from Virgin Mobile and probably would like to start looking into them. Over all my son was completely satisfied with the Virgin Mobile shuttle.Thank You Amazon and to the seller. Thank You Mark Gangadeen.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "battery drains on standby.", "Author": "Paule", "ReviewID": "R35JFP7P45VV9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, I need a phone for making and receiving calls--no frills, music, texting or games, etc. I found this is a nice looking and sturdy feeling phone; the screen is a good readable size and it has a better phone book than what I'm used to with Virgin Mobile. Had hoped this would be a reliable phone. I've had other UTStarcom phones from Virgin, but unfortunately the battery life on the Shuttle phone had issues-- at least with the first one I received from the Amazon seller, and its exchange replacement. Hardly can believe it only got 10hrs on standby--not 10 days as claimed by VM packaging. Seller was responsive, sent me a new battery to try, and then exchanged first defective phone with a replacement.The second phone did no better and needed constant recharging. I can't say much for usage because I didn't have an adequate chance to use either phone. Perhaps they've been sitting on store shelves too long?", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "simplymesmerizn", "ReviewID": "RX3H8Y2PIK3FG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was not very pleased with this product because it did not come with a charger and I had a very hard time finding one that fit properly and when I did, it was nearly the price of the phone, (that was a screw up on my part), however, when I contact the seller they where very polite and had no problem refunding me my money for the merchandise. Which was a very good thing.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid", "Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "R3AHHJXW9ND1Q9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm an on and off Virgin customer, and upon switching back to this carrier after ending my contract with Helio (ironically, now part of Virgin) I decided to get the best device they had available. At that time it was the Shuttle, branded UTStarcom but actually manufactured by Pantech. Normally Pantech is a pretty good device manufacturer, so I had high hopes for this one.The Shuttle is undoubtedly one of the most capable devices in Virgin's lineup. It's a 3G phone- the first one for this carrier, has a micro-SD slot, music player, stereo bluetooth, and touch sensitive keys. The screen is a respectable 176x220, it has a 1.3 MP camera and a neat slider design that looks pretty high-tech.In terms of call quality, the Shuttle is pretty clear as long as you're not using a headset. I haven't tried a bluetooth set, and don't really want to after hearing how bad it was with the UTStarcom-branded wired headset. The sound quality with this is atrocious- and the microphone pickup is really no better. I don't know if you can get a third party set that will fit the jack, but if so it's not available from Virgin's store. The music player is effectively useless as a result. The speakerphone is average, but it has major problems (more on that later). The camera takes decent pictures, which you can save on internal or SD memory, and can also record video. There's voice memo, a simple calendar and address book, and other miscellaneous tools like a calculator and stopwatch. Battery life is superb- I can often get through a whole week on one charge, and when you browse the web it is pretty fast.Now the problems... there's so many it's hard to think of where to begin. First off, the touch-sensitive keys. These are cool... until you try to pull the phone out of your pocket and it ignores the call because it brushed against something on the way out. Or until you push them and they flat out refuse to work... say when answering a call or (ironically) pushing ignore. This issue is inherent in their design, and after a few weeks I really wished they'd just put in old-fashioned regular keys. It didn't take me long to realize that the softkey to turn on the speakerphone was only sometimes working. After a while it stopped working altogether but for some weird reason (which I never did figure out) it sometimes activated by itself. So whenever I wanted to use the speakerphone it wouldn't work, but sometimes it would just answer a call on speaker mode automatically. Not sure what to say about that. After about two months of use, the phone occasionally froze upon receiving an incoming call. It would stay ringing, but opening the slider (even repeatedly), pushing the answer softkey, pushing the talk key, and even pushing the end key produced absolutely no response. After the caller gave up, I could only access my address book and had to remove the battery and replace it to get the handset working again. Even some basic functions like the alarm clock stopped working after a while, and it's clear that the firmware has some serious bugs in it. Additionally, while the web speed is pretty nice, Virgin's web plans are not. Also, the browser that comes with this device is horrible- really no better than what they've always been using. I've heard you can download Opera Mini to replace it, and if so that might be a viable alternative, but it still doesn't fix the fact that you're paying way too much for web access from the carrier.I don't know if I just got a lemon or if it was because I got this device right when it came out, but either way these issues are totally unacceptable. The device was not dropped, immersed in water, or otherwise mistreated- I hardly even used the thing and these issues started surfacing after it was in service for some time (the other reviewers both look like new buyers; I'd be more curious to see how many long-term users had the same problems). What good is a phone that can't even reliably answer calls? Maybe as a paperweight. Virgin doesn't do firmware updates, so you're pretty much SOL if you run into any software bugs, and as far as customer service goes you get what you pay for. They're a very low cost carrier, but trying to get a replacement (or any kind of help, for that matter) is pretty much hopeless. They sent me the wrong car charger for this device, and after 3 useless calls to customer service I just gave it up and wrote it off. They also deleted an existing balance on my account, and when I asked them about this they said 'we can't do anything about it.'After dealing with this $100 piece of junk for a few months, I just bought a new and cheaper Samsung model and am using that now. It hasn't had any of these issues so far and was half the cost to boot. While the Shuttle may be a bold new step for Virgin mobile, it is a device that's clearly got major issues and should be avoided at all costs.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "MP3 Player\nMicro SD Card slot\nDownload and stream tv\n1.3 MP Camera\nHigh end prepaid slider phone", "Name": "Virgin Mobile USA Shuttle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21hzl%2Bsw0zL.jpg", "ProductID": "B002B956DE"}}
