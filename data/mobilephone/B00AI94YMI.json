It's crisp and loud enough to hear well, and the mic blocks out most background noise. The keypad makes texting SMS messages easy. It does have Bluetooth, and it accepts micro SD cards, so it makes a good mP3 player. The camera is only 2 megapixel, so it's good enough for Facebook shots and video clips, but not much else. It isn't a smartphone, so don't expect miracles trying to use email, Facebook or the web. It does these tasks, albeit very slowly, but in a pinch if you really need to get a message or a picture through, you can do it. Be prepared for high data cost on pay-by-minute plans, as it deducts ten cents per minute of use, whether or not the data goes through. So use data services sparingly unless you have an unlimited plan. If you're a power user and love all the apps, you won't be happy with this phone. But if most of what you do is communicate via voice when you need to and don't gab all day, send out a few text messages here and there, and want Facebook or email access in a pinch, this phone works well and is very inexpensive to use on a monthly basis. The battery charge lasts a week, it's built well, has a solid feel and is very reliable. It's also durable if dropped.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Got It!", "Author": "Ms Mel", "ReviewID": "R2XXODESNZ7ZZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I love it.  I previously had a Tracfone without a dialpad and it drove me crazy trying to put in passwords, etc. quickly, so I made a switch to this one.  It not only has a dialpad but also a QWERTY keyboard.  The keys are pretty small but so far no problems with the dialing, etc.  Though still small, it is a little larger than the previous one, which I like.Have used Tracfone for many years and am satisfied.  Why pay for a monthly plan when you only use a phone when traveling or away from home.  Most cell phone plans are like a sieve draining money from the wallet continuously.  I'll take Tracfone or a similiar pay-as-you-go plan any day, and I've had both.  This one will browse the web if needed.  I've not done that yet and am sure it will eat up the minutes, but it is nice to have if needed.  With a triple minutes phone like this one, cell phone minutes cost roughly 10 cents a minute plur or minus, so for someone who uses minutes sparingly like I do, the monthly cost is minimal.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally Reception where I live!", "Author": "Penelope40", "ReviewID": "R222B85ON7UZCA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the latest touchscreen Tracfone but had to let it go because I could never get reception in my home in the valley. Research brought me to the knowledge there are 2 types of tracfones, ones that use AT&T; and ones that use Verizon. My previous one was AT&T.; I bought this because it is one of only a couple CDMA phones that will bounce off the Verizon towers all around me.  Since getting this phone, I have not lost signal once inside my home!  It is more basic than other Tracfones, but does the job for me. Downsides are the buttons are small, yet, my big fingers seem to hit them just fine, not many options for ringtones, and the MP3 player isn't the greatest of sound quality. My biggest peeve is you only get 160 max characters for texting and then you are cut off, just like that, and have to either alter your message, or send an additional one. This includes texts you receive as well - if they exceed 160, you are charged for as many  messages as it takes to view sender's message. All in all, I am satisfied and the phone was dirt cheap. I am just so glad to finally have reception in my home, so if you are experiencing reception issues, check to see if it is a G or a C phone.

I already had a qwerty phone w/double minutes, but up until now, there wasn't a phone with the triple minutes that could be used in my area. This will pay for itself in no time. It was shipped and received quickly. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two of the features of this Samsung s380c phone.  When I want to send a text, I don't have the option to just look for a name in my phonebook from the text area, it needs the actual phone number. I don't have phone numbers memorized, that is why I have a phonebook in my phone. Sure, you can go through the phonebook part and select a name of the person you want to send a text to and go from there, but if you want to send to multiple persons, you have to go through the text way and know your numbers. Also, for the camera part; you are supposed to be able to zoom by using the side buttons, but they do not work on this phone.  That part is a little annoying.

Great Price!", "Author": "Rebecca Anne Grant", "ReviewID": "RO6JCU7X1AS7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter's 18th birthday. We both love them! They pick up here where we live when no other phone seems to. They also triple the minutes for the life of the phone just as stated in the description. We both created an account with TracFone.com and found that they have a wide variety of ringtones that we can purchase and have sent straight to our phone as well. They also hold lots of phone numbers in our phone books. We really like the lock feature that keeps you from dialing by accident. My daughter has been playing with all the features from the stop watch to the alarm, to the voice command feature. The voice command feature doesn't seem to understand very well, but everything else seems great. The battery seems to hold a charge for a long time and charges quickly. The sound when it rings is great and very loud if you want it to be. We haven't tried out the MP3 player feature yet, but do plan to. One of the reasons my daughter wanted this phone. Bought the Samsung Micro SD 16GB Class 10 Plus UHS-I SDHC card for both of our phones just so she could hold more MP3 songs and I could hold more pictures. Camera mode seems to work great, but takes a steady hand.

Very crisp.  People say they can hear me better and I can hear them better.  It's been a good phone.2 things are irritating:1)  Texting.  You can only text 160 characters.  My previous Tracfone, an LG, would let you continue beyond the alloted characters and just charge you for sending 2 text.  This phone will stop you cold with a \"exceeded maximum counter\" message and not give you any option beyond that.  You have to either send the text and then create another to finish, or save it in drafts until you can finish it and then send them both.2)  Alarm.  It doesn't give you the option to NOT pick snooze when you set it.  That's something you have to fumble with when it goes off.....in the dark..... when you're half asleep, which involves more than one push of a button if you choose not to use snooze.  A real pain.Had difficulty porting my number, and my first attempt at buying minutes was a mess.  Called Tracfone and got alot of attitude about it.

I dont know if that is an issue with the phone or the tracfone service network. I had thought tracfone hopped carriers and in the past when i used tracfone (ages ago) it seemed like they would pick up in more areas than the other providers.Also the end button is oddly placed.  I tend to hang up on people a good bit with my cheek pressing the end button.  The phone locking is also annoying.  you have to press two buttons in order to get it to unlock.  THe keys are tiny and it is damned near impossible to place a call while driving because of this.Ive considered getting another tracfone to replace this one with.

I answer the question, and either nothing happens, or another rep will answer me hours later with a second question. I've been given the run-around so often it's just a huge Catch-22.  If you manage to get a rep on the phone, and enter strings of number codes into the phone, they then say, \"Hang up and see if you can make a call. If you still have problems, call back.\"So I attempt to make a call and it fails. When I call back, I get the voice recordings again, NO HUMANS. So back to the PMs and regular Forums, begging for some human intervention.After finally getting the phone set up, days later, I discover that browsing doesn't work. I do live in a remote area of WA, so I thought it was because there is only one tower locally, and perhaps that was why browsing failed. So I tried the phone 30 miles south in a metro area. FAIL.  Back to the Forums. They continue to ask the same questions: phone #, Serial #, # of bars etc, all with hours-or-days long intervals, or complete drops of my issue.After giving up on that, I went to a MAJOR metro area 70 miles South of me. Browser still fails. So I called the help line and chose the \"Change my number\" function and attempted that -- lo and behold, got a human on the line. More #'s to input, and she says, \"Dial *22890 to activate, follow the prompts & get your new phone number (based in the metro area 30 miles south).  Guess what happened ?? Wait for it...FAIL. Back to the Help line (25 minute wait before giving up); so back to the Forums. I put ALL my info on my first message on the Forums, gave my home landline number as well, and now am playing Forum message tag with the TracFone reps AGAIN.My phone will not work at all now, because it is not activated. My old number is \"no longer in service\" so it will not receive calls either.If I can't get it going today, I'm going to return it to Amazon, except my NEXT problem is transferring the ONE YEAR of service and 1000+ minutes I loaded onto it at activation, early Sept 2013.Edited to add, 10 Oct: Never got the phone working, no matter what metro area I tried. More email tag with TracFone & got my minutes and service moved over to my old TracFone...and I cannot return the new one because more than 30 days have elapsed (other vendor). Happily I only paid a pittance for it. I could use it as a camera, still, but my new smartphone, purchased at US Cellular store from a real human, has a great camera, 2 actually, and does everything but my laundry.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!!!", "Author": "Douglas S.
