When I called AT&T; they informed me that it was recalled in 2009.  There is nothing they can do for you either, so don't even waste your money.  It will work for a few months and then NOTHING.  Now I am out the money.

Which I guess was three years ago? For a touch screen this phone was very durable! I'm a horse rider so I useually go through phones like I do clothes. I've had horses \"eat\" my phone before. Anyways, I dopped my phone to many times to count on concrete,in mud among other things, the screen never cracked unlike the Iphone and other touch screens. People say it's a crappy phone, though I do not agree.  I don't think its the phones I honestly think it's just At&t.; I will definitly be buying this phone again!", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "ths phone", "Author": "person000", "ReviewID": "RCCQBLATRL6BS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone worked ok when i first got it, but after a couple of weeks the touch screen would feeze up when i was texting and i had to reset it ever time it did that. Also when i go some where i keep my phone in my back pocket but every time i would put it there it would turn of and i would have to take the battery out to get it to come back on. Theres one more thing you should know before getting this phone. IT IS BIG!! Its so fat and heavy its not worth what i paid for. Trust me this phone is not worth what i paid for,ive had this phone for only couple of months and ive all ready bought a new one of of amazon. i regret buying this phone and i wish i could return it.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "ATT phone", "Author": "dave21", "ReviewID": "R3RGAC73WT7K6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone works fine. But I have come to realize that AT&T; gets kind of pissy if you don't buy the phone from them & add a 2 year contract. I had some trouble getting them to turn on the texting feature as I already had the sim card for it that is not under contract. Instead they turned off the texting to my other phones as well. It took almost a week for them to get it straight. they kept trying to say we had to add a new line & contract. I already had the line for 4 years & definitely did NOT want another contract.& then last week the phone did one of those automatic updates & AT&T; killed the sim card & I now have to replace it. But AT&T; must pay for it. So all in all I am satisfied with the phone & the speed of delivery, however I have nothing good to say about AT&T.; Since they took over Cingular ( who I never had problems with ) they SUCK more than I can truly say. There is a reason why they have the WORST customer satisfaction rating.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery doesnt hold much charge", "Author": "Text machine", "ReviewID": "R2KKDNXWBF275E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Love the phone nice to text with but the battery doesn't hold much charge only get a couple hours out of it", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "love love it", "Author": "mrszman", "ReviewID": "R5DTW1ELBFQV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We ordered two of these phones, one for my husband and one for my son.

This phone has to be charged every hour for it to work, does this phone sound great or what?!  The touch screen is awesome if you like the screen freezing up every five seconds and after five minutes straight you still can't press the button on the screen! My phone freezes up every day once or twice and so does my sisters! The last thing i would like to say about this \"great phone\" is that it's the size of a brick. I mean seriously, if you want a texting brick, then THIS is the phone for you! Oh, I almost forgot i hope you don't text a lot because if you do, then the paint will wear off on the buttons! The ONLY good thing about this phone is that it is orange and orange is my favorite color. Well thats all i have to say here, but beware crappy phones! I will find you and bring you to justice, so helpless people don't have to suffer any longer.

This would start racking up data for a plan I had no data on (which means overage charges).

I haven't charged it in 3 days and the battery is empty and I'm waiting for it to die. Yeah that's the only problem with phone itself it don't tell the battery percent right.
