Cannot access anything on my phone except receive calls. I returned it and got a replacement. Exactly after another 7 months same problem. This time I am not getting a  replacement. This phone is really really not  good. The touch screen is very bad and stops working after some few months. I am highly disappointed in it.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had this phone for over two years", "Author": "T. M. Childress", "ReviewID": "R3OV7VGW4DGVFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone free with a two-year renewal contract with ATT over two years ago--I lost track of time. I absolutely love this phone, more so than even all the iPhones owned by every other member of my family. I'm the hold-out. :o) When this one goes, I will buy another one just like it. Over the years, I have dropped this multiple times on all surfaces, and the glass has never shattered, though there are some minor scratches. The only problem I had for a short period was when it kept turning off at the slightest bump, but that was because of a loose battery (a spare that I had bought). I just cut a thin strip from a jello box, wedged it under the battery, and the problem was solved. I even got it wet because it was on a table where something spilled and ran--but I threw paper towels all around, rescued the phone, opened it up, air-dried everything, checked the contacts, put it back together, and it worked fine. What I love best about it is the texting feature because I've become an expert in typing on this thing with my thumbnails so much that I HATE all other phone keyboards, meaning the ones that have tiny round keys or even the sensitive touch screens like the iPhone, even when using a stylus, like my husband does. I hope that LG never stops making this phone. My husband says I should just buy another one to have in reserve, and I just very well may do that, because I love it. It has served me well, and it is so much a part of me. By now, my phone is scratched, the back is worn, and the screen has little worn marks like little frosty ovals from my thumb nails from texting. Pure character of a very good phone!! It has served me--and is continuing to serve me--well.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "touch phone", "Author": "Akua", "ReviewID": "R1Q1UX1BO39U68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I got this phone it had a problem with the battery but that was fix by the seller. who took care of the problem very fast.
