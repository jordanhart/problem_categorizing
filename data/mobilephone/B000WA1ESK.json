{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A basic phone that works", "Author": "A reader", "ReviewID": "R3TTTF708STVN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed to replace my old cell phone but did not want to pay for the digital plan. I like the VX8550 because it is compact when not in use and, because it is a slider, has a comfortable size when in use. In addition, the VX8550 does not have the disadvantage of flip phones that open at random when they are in a belt clip. The screen is large enough for me to read, even wearing my bifocals. The functions I use (calling, texting, calendar, alarm clock, and occasionally taking pictures) are straightforward.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done", "Author": "Anne", "ReviewID": "R3TCTDVK8B5CJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter's phone broke with 4 months to go before she's due for a replacement.  This phone cost less than the insurance deductible, so I bought it to get her through until her upgrade.  I also plan on holding on to it after her upgrade as a \"backup\" phone (you know, if one of ours ever takes a dunk or otherwise stops working, or even just to switch over for a day to avoid taking our nicer phones on a ski trip for instance).The battery that initially came with the phone was not OEM, and did not properly fit the phone.  Customer service was very helpful and promptly sent out a replacement battery that is OEM and fits perfectly.  Overall very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "worked for me", "Author": "Miss April", "ReviewID": "R3GLZBDV8E6X9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it used to charge a battery for my chocolate phone to get pictures.

Functionality-wise, it stores each text message individually and anytime the phone slides shut you lose a text in progress. There is no way to adjust this setting, I looked. Also the phone is broken. Half the time the face buttons (left, right, speaker, clear) don't work and if you press the clear button twice (accidentally or because it didn't work the first time), a Verizon app ad shows up. This also causes you to lose text messages. Unfortunately I'm stuck with this thing until I can find a new one.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Slide Phone", "Author": "Stefan", "ReviewID": "R15QHRDC7HK75C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone a while back when it first came out and had to replace it with another phone once I stepped on it accidentally. After having a different basic slide phone, I came back to this one. This may sound like a strange quality of the phone, but the old slide phone(not the chocolate) left an imprint of the phone casing in my jeans. This chocolate has a design that will not leave an imprint from being in your pocket of a pair of jeans.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS PHONE SUCKS", "Author": "Ole", "ReviewID": "R710QVF3Q8KW1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is a good phone but it gets really bad service and doesn't hold a charge for more than three and a half hours I would not recommend this phone to anybody.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't do it!", "Author": "Jonathan W.
