{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid, Versatile, Good Option on low budget.", "Author": "GYipster", "ReviewID": "RWPW6NK7M2KPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the White version online on eBay as amazon did not have it in stock at the time, so I'll be reviewing my experiences on the BLU Life Play from the past couple of days.My first impressions is that the phone is pretty amazing, its solid to feel in the hand and feels lightweight. At only 7.9mm thin, its almost as thin as the Samsung Galaxy S4 while having the performance reminiscence of a top-notch 2012 smartphone.So how does it perform in 2013... lets find out!BUILD QUALITY-------------The build quality is amazing, and its feels very solid to hold in the hands. the back cover is made out of plastic but unlike such models like the S4, its has a more matte finish than a glossy, making it more durable to hold in the hands. Has 4GB of internal storage and only ~1GB is accessible but you can add an external micro SD card up to 32 GB (I have one and it works). Has a dual sim slots (1 mini and 1 micro) and its unlocked as well so you can use with any GSM service provider with the correct APN settings.Performance-----------With a 1.2 Quad-Core processor, its pretty fast and also has 1 GB of RAM. The phone runs smooth but you'll feel the occasional lag when opening/switching apps very quickly. But all apps I have tested so far (Facebook, Youtube, Gmail, Maps) runs without any problems. For the geeks, my quadrant score was 4068, so still pretty good but far less than the top-notch.Battery Life------------With a 1800 mAh battery that is removable, I was able to get though a full day somewhere between 60-70% left and that was with a single phone call, some web browsing, and texting. So my rating of the battery life on this phone is pretty good and it will last.Software--------Comes with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.1, while not the very latest, you'll still get things like lockscreen widgets, google now, etc. Its a pretty stock version with some included apps and a settings menu that looks different. Feels pretty quick and easy to navigate as well.Camera/GPS------Has a 8 mp rear and a 2 mp front. Haven't taken any official photos but with a few quick captures, my judgement is the quality is good and pictures were nice and clear. The flash is pretty bright so get very used to it.The GPS also works pretty nicely and you will get a quick lock with the device with accurate location.Call Quality------------Call Quality is good, my first call the user sounded very soft but after using voice mail on full volume, definitely wasn't a phone problem. Speakers work nice too and its loud but not too loud.Conclusion----------Pros that I like about this phone is a) Price b) Build Quality is exceptional and c) Good battery lifeCons are its not the fastest and smoothest device but definitely not slow either, the vibration/volumes could be stronger and I'm still quirky about the support from the company BLU and any future updates this phone will get.Overall, very happy with the device and it comes with a screen protector and case, USB cable, charger, cleaning cloth, pair of earbuds, and of course the phone itself. Definitely recommend buying this phone if your on a tight budget but want something current with the latest version of Android.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good phone at a great price", "Author": "secretasianman", "ReviewID": "R1NBMZZ1ZSBQSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "$230 is a pretty darn good price for this phone which includes a case and screen protector.Pros:- Bright and clear 1280x720 IPS LCD. Great viewing angles with sharp text.- Good 8MP camera. I compared pictures taken with the Life Play and my Galaxy S 2 (IMO great camera picture quality) and found them to be comparable. The 1080 video recording look pretty good as well. No lag or stutter.- The speaker and earpiece were loud enough for me. Phone call quality (this is a phone afterall right?) was good.- Decent battery life. As with most modern smartphones you'll want to charge it halfway through the day.- The MTK MT6589 chipset is powerful enough to play some 720P MKVs containing H.264 video and DTS audio played back through MXPlayer using software decoding. I'm not a big gamer on cell phones but I did load up Dead Space. Extremely smooth gameplay.- MicroSD slot.- Dual SIM: One is a micro-SIM and the other is a regular SIM slot. I only used one SIM.- WiFi and Bluetooth radios worked without a hitch. Phone has support for HSDPA 850/1900 which is perfect for AT&T;, AT&T; MVNO customers, and some T-Mobile customers depending on location. Supposedly supports 42Mbps downloads and 21 Mbps uploads but I couldn't really verify that since I'm running on a AT&T; MVNO.- GPS locks quickly and stays locked. Good accuracy according to GPS Test app.- Phone is VERY thin and light.- Almost stock Android 4.2.1.Cons:- Only 4GB of storage of which 1.75GB is user accessible. Keeps prices down I suppose.- USB and audio ports on top of phone. I prefer my USB ports on the bottom but this is probably just user preference. At least the USB port isn't on the side of the phone.- No HDMI out support.- The battery cover seems to pop off pretty easily. Removing the TPU case from the phone can easily pop the battery cover off. Not a big deal if you don't remove the TPU case often.- Lack of accessories. Come on BLU. I want an extra battery.Overall I'd recommend this phone for budget conscious users who don't want to pay a fortune for unlocked un-subsidized smartphones. I fall into that category and my primary needs for smartphones are: Big screen but not Galaxy Note sized, good GPS, good camera, and good PHONE performance. This phone fits those needs.*** 7/7/2013 Update ***+ Camera: Not so great in low light and the flash is useless. The flash actually causes a glare and drowns out my subject in the photo. On the bright side the camera has an HDR setting which works very well!+ Wireless Display: Found a toggle for Wireless Display. It's obviously not an Intel WiDi device... maybe Miracast? Will test with a Netgear PTV3000.+ Battery life: For a 4.7\" screen device, this phone lasts longer than my Samsung Galaxy S 2 i777 and Galaxy Nexus. Maybe it's the combination of newer low power chipsets and an 1800mAh but it definitely lasts longer and actually charges while the screen and GPS chipset is in use in the car.+ MicroSDHC slot: I couldn't get my SanDisk 64GB microsdxc to function properly. The phone recognized the exFAT formatted card as a damaged card and suggested a reformat. It did so but stopped recognizing the card after I copied somewhere over 1.5GB but less than 2GB back to the card. The card works fine in my Win8 tablet.*** 7/31/2013 Update ***Never able to test out the Wireless Display function as the Netgear PVT1000 I had access to only supports Intel WiDi. Oh well.I did manage to get an AT&T; GoPhone SIM and cut it down to microSIM size for use in the SIM 1 slot. Both SIMs are active but only one can use 3G (HSPA+). The OS allows you to choose which one uses 3G and you can also choose the default SIM for voice, data, text, and video calls. Pretty cool feature since I've never used a dual active SIM phone before.For those looking for extra screen protectors and batteries: This phone is essentially a re-badged Gionee Elife E3. I purchased some screen protectors and a battery for that model and they work on the BLU Life Play. It's a shame BLU hasn't addressed our accessory needs yet.Overall I'm very pleased with this phone and still amazed it only costs $230 unlocked. As component prices come down, I hope to see HDMI out and OTG support for next year's iteration.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "chirma", "ReviewID": "R2JENOAPT8PWAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a phone whiz at all but I've been researching my next phone for quite a while now and the Life Play seemed to have everything I wanted at a great price (ok...I did really want the Life One  but couldn't wait for it). Got it today, and voila! I'm up and running! Set up is easy, all very intuitive. Call quality is great. Main camera is awesome and front camera really darn good. Can't comment on the data speeds yet as I am using a t-mobile sim at the moment and limited to 2G because the phone isn't 1700/2100 (t-mobile's 3g/4g frequencies). My new sim card (for use on AT&T; 1900 band) will be here in a day or two so we'll see but I have high hopes for high speed based on the amazing wi-fi speed. And did I mention that the phone is super light, amazing screen colors and a very lovely blue color. Again, I would have preferred the yellow but was too impatient so I opted for the blue and I really like it. Also appreciate the included cover and screen protector.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLU life play in white", "Author": "Jorge Guillen", "ReviewID": "R3164L5OWQFFQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Impressed! I was a little bit skeptical in buying this phone bc of how new and uncommon this company is to me. Also because I wasn't sure if it would work with metro PCS new GSM card offering that uses Tmobile's HSPA+ in San francisco (im in Hayward, Ca) and metroPCS voice. Works flawlessly!I'm deff a happy camper. I get between 5-12 MBPS unlimited data. I already had Mepro PCS service, I just went to authorized dealer store here in Hayward and bought a GSM sim card from them for 15$ they install it in and ready to go! The phone quality is excellent doe not look cheap at all Cameras are great too. I can Honestly say it feel more premium than Samsung plastic phones, the case/headphones are good quality and  practical. The Android experience is excellent with this phone. At 229.99 plus tax you are looking at 250ish plus shipping cost depending on what shipping speed you chose. I say its just as good as a Samsung or better. Buy it. I recommend it.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Android: How to solve the Life Play's major issues.", "Author": "Shom", "ReviewID": "R2T19AHU1ZVUU1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month now. I was super excited to get it, but also very cautious due to the percentage of people who had complaints about it. As a result of this, I did some EXTENSIVE research on youtube, blogs and other sites, to see if other people have experienced issues with this device. To my surprise, most complaints came straight out of Amazon. Currently, I love this phone. I use only 1 Sim slot, and I consider myself a power user. Fortunately, even with using the camera, instant message apps, gaming for at least 2 hours a day and hours upon hours of music, the battery has NEVER drained on me. I did, however, run into a few issues with it. I'm going to explain what those issues are, and how I resolved it.First, allow me to say that BLU's technical support is horrendous. And I know they read the reviews on this site, so BLU. you really need to step up or this explosion of popularity that you have will quickly dwindle.-The dreaded MicroUSB Cord: DO NOT USE IT! When I pulled out the cord for the first time to charge the phone, I noticed that the end that goes into the phone was surprisingly longer than average. After the charge was complete, I found myself applying way too much effort to disconnect it. So much pulling can't be good. After that point, I decided to use a regular microUSB cable instead. I believe repetitive use of the original cord on the Blu Life Play will cause damage to the USB port. So please DO NOT use it.-Random Restarts/Screen Flickering: I had those problems too. Tech Support suggested that I speak to amazon about replacing the phone because it may be \"defective\". I refused to do that, as I currently reside overseas. I read on a forum somewhere that other has this exact problem, and that a factory reset solved it. It was a bit annoying to have to re-install all my apps, but it was worth it. So if you have this problem, just do a factory reset. NOTE: an app like App List Backup can really come in handy if you can't remember all your apps.These were the main issues that I had with this device. I noticed that I don't have \"gesture typing\" like it claims it does, or \"photo sphere\" but I simply got apps to take care of that. Other than that, this is a great phone for the price. Like I said, its been a month, and hopefully I've seen the end of my troubles with it. Before you call tech support and get disappointed like I was, do some troubleshooting yourself and please remember, it's plastic - meaning it will break if you're too rough.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Mid-Range Device.

I just got it today 12/11/13. I will start by saying I am coming from a Samsung Vibrant...Pros:1)The display is great! (I am used to amoled from the Vibrant which did have better blacks but about equal viewing angle, the Blu Life Play has IPS display type). The Blu Life Play display has higher pixel density and everything seems to be more accurate as far as color reproduction goes.2)The speed of the device is more than acceptable for the cost. I notice no lag time between apps and everything runs well. Web browsing and youtube is smooth.3) Micro SD slot (supported my 32gb card no problem) For those that may be worried about the 4gb of internal storage, you can get a 32gb micro sd card for dirt cheap and install your apps to that.4) At first I had no idea what the connection on the device was, it did not say 2g, 3g, or 4g. I did the (Over the air) update v13 which was released 11/10/2013. After the update near the tower bars you now see how the phone is connected 2g,3g,H+ etc. So far I have seen 3g and H+. I did a speed test while the phone said H+ and saw download speeds of 9.62Mb/s and upload speeds 3.1Mb/s!All I can say is wow! I am using this phone on straight talk with T-mobile sim. (I will include my apn settings at the bottom of the review. On my Samsung Vibrant in the very same location as this phone my max was 3.7Mb/s down and 1.6Mb/s up. So this is quite a step up. I was worried that I may be in an area with 2g only as this phone uses only HSDPA 850 / 1900 (not standard 850/1700/1900/2100 it is missing 1700/2100). I must be lucky because I am 40 miles outside a major city and still have H+!!!! T-mobile has been re-farming 1900mhz bands and eventually most people should have 3g or H+ on 1900mhz frequency.5) The phone comes with a clear gel cover (I have the white version of the phone) and it looks great even with the case. It also comes with headphones that are ear bud style which happen to be my favorite!I have used my Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision Enhanced Bass Ear buds and I can say that it sounds absolutely amazing! I have no issues with my Sony ear buds either. I am not sure why people are having problems with headsets? Maybe there is a problem with mic in line headsets? So far I have not had any problems.UPDATE: Pros 6 and 7) The battery life is surprisingly good considering the size. The FM radio works very well, I get better reception with the phone than I do with my receiver that has a much larger antenna. The headphones are good but have too much bass for me personally.Cons:1) This device has very limited internal storage, user available is 1.64gb out of the box... However since this phone has a micro sd card slot and they allow you to install apps to the sd card, there really is no need to take a star away, People report some 64gb cards working (I have not tried) but if this is true then you really have no reason to complain about storage.2) Accessories can be tough to find, try searching for Symphony W150, Allview V1 Viper, General Mobile DISCOVERY, Polytron W8470, Fly IQ4410 Quad Phoenix, Qmobile Noir A900 accessories as they should work for the Blu Life Play as well.UPDATE Con #3) The camera is terrible in low light. You may as well be using a 1 megapixel camera with a real flash. It is extremely grainy in low light and there are no details. It seems to work well in bright day light.If you have an extra $150 get the Nexus 5 from the google play store, all around the nexus 5 has better specs and kit kat 4.4. (If you're like me and do not game on your phone or don't like spending $349.99 on a phone get the Blu Life Play! I am certainly happy I got the Blu Life Play.

So, comparing the specs online, its better than the iPhone 5, and runs on par with the s3. This device is fast. Ram is 1gb which is still decent. I had several games and a bunch of things open, and honestly didn't know it until I brought up the running apps. It has been a very pleasant experience. HOWEVER there are several draw backs like every device. First, the screen doesn't light up when you receive a text. In the messaging app, you can't change the colors. Every message in a conversation shows what sim it can from (which is fine, just looks clustered) and the big one is the battery. The life is great, but I powered my phone down last night to charge, and when in woke up, it had the same charge. Once the phone turned on, it immediately started charging, so I'm not sure what's up with that. Overall, its a nice phone, and is worh the money. You'll probably want to add some apps to get certain features such as screen light up with the receiveing of a text message. Its pretty good, and I'll do a YouTube review shortly.UPDATE- in the 15 minutes after writing this review, my battery charged from 50% to 100% so I would say its pretty good!Update- 7/20/2013-It seems impossible to turn data off. Even though its \"off\" I still get picture messages. Also, I would recommend a battery saver app installed (I use Battery Doctor, works pretty well!) to extend battery life.

Surprisingly in the box it includes; a screen protector and gel case, since everyone was so worried bout the phone having no case and lack of protection, i think BLU Products did a great job with that addition and a nice pair of headphones to boot.

I don't have to tell you how many new phones have come out since then and how much the technology has advanced in such a short period of time, but AT&T; wouldn't let me upgrade my phone until March 2013 (this was before their new phone financing program became available in August 2013). My Atrix 2 was crashing daily and I needed a new phone NOW but I didn't want to pay $600 for a new unlocked brand name phone...what to do??Well...while browsing on Amazon I learned abou the Blu Life Play phones.

I work in sales for a web development company, but ironically I don't really need the latest and greatest technology to get through a typical day at work. I need a reliable phone that will allow me fast access to email, chat, GPS functions, a web browser on occasion and of course a phone that doesn't lock up everytime I receive a call while multitasking. This phone does all of that very well...and more!One thing you should be aware of (and this really shouldn't be viewed negatively because afterall it is an unlocked phone) is that you'll need to set the APN settings in order for the network wireless Internet to work. The manual that comes with the phone doesn't tell you this, and you might think that there is something wrong with the phone when there isn't.

Also, I cannot explain how excited I was to find out this phone has a touch capture option for the camera :) The only problem I've had with this phone is the vibration on a incoming message. Sometimes it vibrates as it should and sometimes it vibrates  incorrectly. Not a big deal though. I think it might be a software issue. I tested a theory I had by installing 2 or 3 third party messaging apps and they always vibrated perfectly when I received a message.

It is our pleasure to serve you. It seems you have the Life Play L100a. For all of our devices, if the model number ends in the letter a it is compatible with the 850/1900 3G/4G frequency (AT&T;) and if the model number ends in the letter I it is compatible with the 850/2100 3G/4G frequency (T-Mobile). For example, the L100a works better for AT&T; than the L100i, which would be for T-Mobile. Please contact your seller for an exchange for the same model ending in an i as that is the correct model you need.Also, our devices only have support for HSDPA (regular 4G) not LTE.

Kiddy", "ReviewID": "RW358SAQMMHOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone was an upgrade from a Nokia E5 smartphone. I received the phone on 01/06/2014. I was hesitant to make the leap to an android phone since I am usually several years behind in technology. However, when I discovered this phone and found that it was unlocked, dual sims, and just over $200 I took the plunge and I am so happy that I did.Unlike my old smartphone, I can watch YouTube videos, check emails, play games, and can acutally view certain websites that my old phone just couldn't handle. I know that some reviews have given the phone negative remarks because of the internal memory but I was able to buy a 64 GB sd card and after I formatted the card with my phone, it works great so I can't really take away on the memory. Some phones that I found were not able to be expanded so this was a great feature.I don't notice any lagging with playing games but I have noticed that it does get a little hot after I have used it non stop for a couple of hours. I charge the battery right before I go to bed and it tends to hold the charge all day unless I sit and play games for hours and then I need to charge it twice a day.  It took me a while to get used to a touch screen and a keypad but after using this a month, I don't know how I survived without it.The call quality is great and I live in a rural area.  I have Straight Talk on the AT&T; network and so I pay $45 month for this phone. It took me a long time to find the APN settings that worked with this phone and I will include them at the end of my post. The headset that came with this phone sound great when I am listening to the radio and I have not tried a different set on the phone so I can't comment on the other reviews that said some headsets don't work with this phone.Okay, so the one bad thing I can say about this phone is that on 02/06/2014 I had my phone charging (or so I thought) and when I got up the next morning my phone was dead! I tried 4 different chargers and nothing would charge it. I went to work and googled and found that some other people had problems with the charging port. I was very disappointed because I had the phone exactly 30 days and now it wasn't working. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a new phone which I received today and this saved a star on my review. While waiting on the new phone to arrive a co-worker was able to get the original charger to work but only if you held the charger a certain way and if you tried to lay it down to finish charging it would stop which leads me to believe that the charging port was loose. I found a post that said the original charger that comes with the phone is probably the cause of the problem since it is designed to be very snug and you have to pull harder than normal to get the charger to release from the port. I have decided not to use the original charger that came with the new phone and I am hopeful that I won't have this problem again. So aside from the charging issue, this phone is a great deal and can be used on Straight Talk which is also a great deal.For the APN Settings. I found several posts that kept giving the following settingsName: STRAIGHT TALK (or just any name you would like to use)APN: tfdataProxy: proxy.mvno.tracfone.comPort: <Leave in Blank>Username: <Leave in Blank>Password: <Leave in Blank>Server: <Leave in Blank>MMSC: [...]MMS proxy: mms3.tracfone.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: <Leave in Blank>APN type: default,supl,mmsAPN Protocol: Leave it to the Default oneHowever, I also found an obscure posting that said the above settings were for newer phones and that older phone models should use the below settings. Since this model was originally released around March of 2013, I used the old apn settings listed below and my phone came to life and I can text, send pics, make calls, and surf the internet. The below setting is what I used on the phone that was shipped back to Amazon and the phone that I received today so I believe they are correct for any Blu Life Play model.

I will update this review in 30 days to update on how the charging port is working on the new phone.UPDATE: 06/05/2014. I gave it more than 30 days to post my update becaue I really wanted to test out the charging issue that I was having. I have not used the original charging cord that came with the phone; however, I have experienced an issue with other charging cords not wanting to charge my phone unless I am holding it a certain way. I had to replace my car charger and bought a $20 one from Wal-Mart and the cord that came with the charger was a little different than all of the other cords that I have used over the years.  What I found was that my phone really loves this cord. I can use this cord and it will charge no matter what position my phone is in or how it is lying AND it charges SOOOOOO much faster than with any other cord. My only theory as to why this cord works better than any other one is because of its design and how snug it is in the port. Although it is snug, you do not have to pull hard on the cord to get it out of the port so it does't damage the port either. I took my rating down to a 4 star rating because the charging port seems to have issues with the majority of cords avaialble and I only lucked out and found one that it likes.  I have never had this type of issue with any other phone so I feel that this should be looked at by the manufacturer.  All other features are still working great and I am still happy with my phone (even with the charging issues).", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a deal, no strings attached.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RPVSKO2PUBF1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped around for my first Android phone. I was leaving Blackberry after many years, but I was eager to get the functionality of my Nexus 7 in a phone size without paying too much.I picked this phone because it's a US company (though handsets are made abroad) and because it has 1 GB of RAM (more than other similar budget phones) and because it is set up to run apps from the SD card. I have not been disappointed.The other selling point was the dual SIM, though one is micro and one is standard size. My regular T-Mobile SIM worked fine in the second slot. But now I have my UK SIM in that second slot as I was able to change my T-Mobile SIM to a micro.Battery life is decent. It may need a boost in the afternoon when I have the screen up a lot. But when it's just at the ready as a phone, it holds the charge well in standby.I a semi-pro photographer, and I'm happy with the 8 megapixel camera. It's a nice upgrade from my Blackberry Curve. The CNet review pointed out that the camera doesn't do macro well. They're right that you can't get too close to focus. However, 8 MP gives you a lot of room to digitally zoom or crop after the fact.There was no bloatware installed. I did replace a few stock apps, but that all amounts to personal preference. The Android installation is almost as stock as the one on my Nexus 7. The biggest additions are the interface to set up your two SIMs and move apps to the SD card. (There is an icon for SIM Toolkit. Don't use it. Go in through settings instead.)There isn't an LED light for notifications. It's one of the corners cut, but I hardly miss it. I do miss having a camera-specific key, but it's not a big loss.The 2 MP front camera has a wide angle lens for selfie-group shots. 2MP is more than enough for sharing online and even making a small print.I don't game, so I can't speak to that.

Chin", "ReviewID": "R3VCB5PK7NAWJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is surprisingly, a wonderful unlocked phone that is feature rich at this price point, without any carrier subsidy, that is.  The phone's design and build quality are impressive while the hardware specs are at mid level at best.  Nonetheless, from the price-to-performance/features ratio perspective, I feel this phone comes out on top, particularly after owning several types of phones, including Samsung.  In addition, BLU actually provides tech support.  I contacted support once before the purchase, another time after, via email.  Support responded on both occasions within 24 hours.  OTA firmware is available.  I've downloaded twice thus far.Phone reviews are usually very subjective because we all use the device in different ways.  In my case, my phone, besides being a phone, is mostly my internet gateway when I'm away from my computers.  I rarely have more than 15 apps on my phone therefore a small amount of storage doesn't bother me.  This phone does have a microSD slot so storage can be extended that way and the phone provides the option to select the preferred app storage location when it detects a microSD card.I also seldom play games on phone so a 1GB RAM is sufficient to me.  What I rely heavily on is connectivity speed.  Hence, my review will focus on this subject matter where I think is often a grey area on non-carrier branded unlocked phones.  All other features are widely published and there are very detailed reviews provided by other owners already.As an unlocked phone, I used it on AT&T; for 3 weeks and I'm now on T-Mobile.  This phone (L100a) supports 850/1900MHz which plays well with both carriers.  Since T-Mobile has a large re-farmed coverage in SF Bay Area on 1900MHz, getting HSPA+ service is not a problem at all.  What I haven't seen it achieve as advertised yet, is the up to 42Mbps speed on either AT&T; or T-Mobile.  Then again, this speed is probably very subjective to the carriers and none other than a theoretical speed .  The maximum speed recorded in my tests was 12Mbps which is more than sufficient for most activities over the internet.** NB: BLU Life PLay L100i will not receive 3G service on T-Mobile due to the** lack of 1900MHz support on the phone.What I can share with you is that this phone is solid on both AT&T; and T-Mobile networks in terms of mobile data connection.  When using this phone as a hotspot (tethering), my Android tablet allows me to access internet at what seemingly the same speed as using Verizon LTE Jetpack hotspot.  By no means I'm implying this phone can rival LTE speed.  I'm certain LTE speed will easily edge out 3G speed in bulk download tests.  Further, mobile data connection speed varies from hour to hour, location to location.  As such, I sure think this phone is solid HSPA+ device.I've noticed a few issues:1) When tethering is on and the phone is in power saving mode, mobile data will be cut off after 5 minutes when the phone display is off.  The workaround is to turn off power saving mode during tethering session.  I've reported this to Support and hope to receive an OTA update fix.2) Headset with inline MIC incompatibility is quite a nuisance but not without a workaround.  The phone uses OMTP standard which is incompatible with most newer headsets with inline MIC released in the past 12~18 months.  If you run into this problem with your favorite headset, you can simply get a CTIA to OMTP converter.  Regular headphone (without MIC) is not a problem.3) GPS can take up to 2 minutes to lock on.Lastly, I did not have to perform manual APN setup AT&T; or when I switched to T-Mobile.  APN setting is always picked up automatically on boot up.

They both liked the phone so much I decided to order me one. I tried to buy another one from Amazon and they didn't have them in stock so I clicked on a link for another seller which was L2D2. I got the phone in today and the box was not sealed, there is suppose to be a seal on the box that says \"if the seal is missing, don't accept the phone\". I called the Blu company at 1-800-974-3165 to verify that there is suppose to be a seal and was told that ALL the cell phones they make has a seal on the box. When I called L2D2 to ask where the seal was, they told me the phones come to them like that, I informed the guy that I just got off the phone with Blu and all phones have seals on them. I guess he didn't think I had the knowledge to contact the manufacture myself and he got VERY NASTY with me on the phone. I told him I wanted my money back and asked for a shipping label and he said they don't issue out shipping labels I had to pay for that out of pocket. I contacted Amazon and told them what was going on and she placed me on hold to call L2D2 to see what the problem was, she came back to the phone and said that they will be investigating them and that they(Amazon) will be dropping them as a seller on their website. The customer service people at Amazon is so helpful and works with you to get any problems solved, I asked the lady if they had gotten any more in stock and she said yes and placed another order for me.

This phone is by far the lightest and thinnest phone I've ever owned. Snappy like my Galaxy Nexus but so thin and light. The case that comes with it is far better quality than expected HOWEVER, it does seem to cause my phone to constantly reboot because the volume holes and power hole don't align properly. If anyone can manipulate these holes (i.e. cut them out and make the holes bigger than problem solved. I poked holes in it and haven't experienced a reboot in a few days. I also went online and found a case that's suppose to fit it. Still waiting on it to come but we will see. I love being able to set the destination of where my apps download to. Works exactly like Apps to SD though. Now take this with a grain of salt, I put juice defender on my phone and set custom settings, my work place has spotty wifi so i relied on that for syncing, but rarely took out my phone throughout the work day to check things, on a 12 hour workday with minimal use my battery drained 3% to be at 97% when I got home. How this works with moderate to heavy use has yet to be tested. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to keep in mind. After reading reviews about the charging port becoming non-respondent or loose, I found that the usb cable that came with mine has VERY strong clamps that keep in from coming out which is good until you have to unplug it. So when unplugging your cable be advised or find a cable that doesn't hook to securely. Camera seems to be very good. Once again take it with a grain a salt. I was coming from a 5 mega pixel camera but when trying to compare low light photos this phone was way better in low light conditions but I'm not sure if its just the mega pixel difference or if its just an overall better quality camera. Colors are pretty saturated but still nice to eye even though there not true colors. Everyone says the speaker isn't loud but upon playing music mine seems just as loud if not louder than my Galaxy Nexus so it seems fine to me. The app drawer is fine but the apps don't sort in alphabetical order, they just appear in what ever order you download apps. I downloaded Nova Launcher and fixed that but if that doesn't bother you then no big deal. Will update if anything else I forgot to mention.Updated: 10/29/2013-I have used juice defender with custom settings and after a 9 hour work day with moderate use, my battery has been drained to 73%. Not bad, for a new up and coming product. I have received a case from ebay that matches this phones size and I must say it really complements the phone's style. A great secure case for a great phone. The GPS leaves alot to be desired. It works for basic use but don't rely on it. Just gathering a turn by turn works great but actually having street by street turn as you go may not always work. Haven't run into a problem with the charging port but I found an old micro usb charger that goes in and releases without problem so I dont expect to have charging port problems but we shall see. The OS continues to run smooth coupled with Advance Task Manager Pro to end apps every few minutes or so. Most important apps I am using would be Advance Task Manager, Juice Defender Ultimate, and Nova Launcher. I find that these apps replace any flaws that may come up in other reviews as far as a software issue.

I tested the battery as the 1800 mah also had me concerned. No need for anyone who is thinking about buying this cell phone to worry about that at al. After fully charging it overnight. I unplugged it the next morning at 7 am & used it all day making phone calls & downloading & installing all my apps plus restoring all my text massages plus my call log. At 10 PM that night I had 24 minutes to go after using it all day.I installed a 32 GB SD Card from the start & all my apps plus everything else goes directly to the SD Card as to not use up the remaining 4 GB Internal storage. Today has been a light day of use & cell phone has been off the charger since 9 AM This morning & I have 80% battery left. I like that you can turn the data connection off so you don't use up your data as then the phone won't be checking for updates all the time. This phone takes great photos also. I also bought the BLU Studio 5;5 but did not the screen being that big plus only has 5.0 mega pixel camera & pictures are not as good as an 8.0 camera is, so sold it to a friend.One feature I really like is you can have the phone turn off & then come back on anytime you want. I do this how I'm sleeping as it does not need to be on when I'm a sleep. but then I don't need to worry about turning it back on as I have alarms set to remind me to take my morning medications. To me y phone is more than just something to talk on. I'm a computer repair tech so the number is in all my ads & people text me questions & to see how much I charge to fix their computer.I also have a device that plugs into the 3.5 mm jack that I can take credit cards right on my cell phone for my repair service when I do an onsite call. The best part about this phone that I like is no more $90 a month high price for unlimited everything plus paying $350 to $500 for a good cell phone. I got unlimited everything with Metro PCS for $35 a month & no contract. That is the part I like the best.

Since the phone I had for the last two years was similar to the Avail 2, the next step up would have been AT&T;'s Galaxy Express.  Being a college student, $250 (not including taxes) for a phone is a lot of money, and since AT&T; hardly ever has sales, I began searching for other options and stumbled upon the BLU company.  I spent about a week looking up customer reviews on the internet and YouTube and decided to give it a try.I purchased the BLU Life Play in Pink, on sale for $217 (no taxes/taxes included? and free shipping).Let me tell you, I went from having a semi-smart phone to being completely upgraded to this century's technology in just a matter of minutes!  All I had to do was just insert my micro-sim card into the slot and it worked perfectly.  No internet connection problems, fast lightning speeds, downloads apps in seconds.  I really love this phone!The phone is great for Instagram (the 8PM camera on the phone is divine), Twitter, and texting.  The calls are also clear and people on the other end have no problems hearing me.  (It might have just been the age of the phone but I have a friend who is a Verizon customer and he claims to have issues hearing people who have AT&T; services and phones.  With the BLU phone, there have been no issues at all so far.)The BLU Life Play is surprisingly thin and light, and is about an inch longer than a box of soap or a pack of cigarettes.  The phone also comes with headphones that match the color of the phone, a soft-ish, opaque protective back cover that matches the color of the phone as well, and a wall charger that also converts into a USB port for the computer.  I was surprised about the headphones, I didn't know that they came with the phone, which was a nice surprise when I opened the box.I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to all who are looking for an up-to-date phone without the huge price tag.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE/NEW PRIMARY/EVERYTHING I NEED FOR HALF THE PRICE", "Author": "rubenCEN-CAL", "ReviewID": "R1JRUOEQIXZV0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW GOT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK AND IT JUST BLEW MY MIND.

The screen is big and easy to read; I had no issues with any sensitivity on the phone, and the phone itself came with a ton of accessories (phone case, charger, wall charger, headphones, etc).  However, the appearance of the phone does not excuse the quality of the hardware's performance.  I got my phone in November, shortly before Thanksgiving, and by Christmas, it had stopped charging unless I positioned the charger a certain way. (I was NEVER rough with my phone.) By the end of January, it had stopped charging altogether. Because it comes with a warranty, I was able to send it in. I sent it through express mail on the 11th of February and only just today, March 28th, received it back - thanks, I'm sure, to the fact that I sent an aggravated e-mail. The customer service is downright awful.  There was no communication whatsoever on the status of my phone and, even when they finally e-mailed me back on the 20th to ask me if they could replace my phone (it took a MONTH for them to decide they were going to replace it, by the way - a month!), they didn't answer me back until I sent an e-mail a week after asking if they were going to replace it or not.  I've just received my replacement and not only is the phone dirty - the screen has smudges and fingerprints all over it, and the case it literally caked with grime - but there are dents and nicks all over it.

The design language is great the phone is slim and light not too unwieldy despite it being a larger screen phone.Performance wise, there are very few hiccups as the Quad Core Cortex A7 processor can handle tasks easily, this isn't a chart breaker but this isn't sluggish by any means. However don't expect this phone to be a gamer's delight as you can eat through battery very quickly if you're playing more graphically intensive games. Battery life can be mixed as it doesn't have the greatest power user in mind, but with mixed usage you can get through a day easily and if you're a light user you can probably get the phone to last 2 to 3 days by using the power saver function that BLU has built in.The main reason why this phone doesn't get a high mark from me is that there is a possible defect that users could run into with the Micro-USB port, in that it could get bent and thus make it almost neigh impossible to get the phone to charge and or sync with a computer.

There is only a 30 day warranty. Now i have to deal with BLU tech support on Monday and I fully expect delay tactics and red tape to get the phone to a working condition. For $150 more dollars you can get a Google Nexus 5. I own one and it is a great phone. It's made well and I'm sure it will last.When I hold this BLU phone in my hand it feels light and cheap. It feels and functions like something I would expect from a Dollar General store. If you take the battery out of it it weighs about the same as a stack of 10 dollar bills. The touch screen response is sub-par and the case that comes with it feels very, very cheap. No third party company makes a decent case for the phone. When you have the case on; the button to turn the screen on is covered by 1/8\" of rubbery plastic. You have to squeeze it with a good amount of force to get it to vaguely respond.I'm not saying don't buy this phone under any circumstances. I'm assuming that you are looking at this phone because you understand that the total cost of ownership on a subsidized phone is ridiculous and you want to save money. I am the same way. I bought this phone for $200 and put a $45 a month straight talk card in it. On paper that is an amazing value for a full featured android phone with data.Before you purchase this phone ask yourself these questions:1. Is the amount of money I'm saving worth the potential loss of time and money when it inevitably breaks in a short period of time?2. Would it actually be cheaper in the long run for me to spend $150 more and get a quality piece of hardware that will last and has the support of one of the largest companies and communities in the world (Nexus 5)?", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Shu Pei \"Jingren\"", "ReviewID": "RQYK04C7FCQOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two Blu Life Plays for my wife and myself for the Christmas.

Even with the \"quad core\" in the life play I have noticed a few slow points which may also have to do with the meager 1 G of ram. One thing that may just be my device.

Prosser-Gebhardt", "ReviewID": "R3G24IAEH6Z4U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for about 6 weeks.  I have it activated on Ultra-mobile.  Activation process was pretty painless - Ultra does require some configurations to use SMS, but was pretty easy to do with their generic android instructions.I'm a fan of Android.  The life play has a recent version, and works as expected.  All apps have worked fine.  This phone replaced a Kyocera Event I used with Virgin, which is a cheap phone that crashed a lot with processor intensive apps or multi-tasking, but was serviceable.  This Life Play is a big step up in screen size and processing.  I've not had any lag issues or over-tasking type of behavior.  There has been about 2 or 3 times where the phone has locked up and I had to pull the battery to re-boot, but I'm not sure that wasn't caused by an app.  It hasn't happend enough that I'm worried about it.  I haven't tried any 3D gaming, but it'll run youtube/hulu/netflix perfectly (on wifi), and I can play Angry Birds Star Wars while listening to podcasts with podkicker simultaneously without any lag - which was near impossible on my Virgin phone.I haven't had any high level android phones to compare this one too, but my wife has an iPhone 5.  The Life Play has a bigger screen and is thinner.  My hardware feels equal or better, but the Apple software is probably better/smoother, such as her voice commands with Siri are better interpreted than mine seem to be with Google.  But this is more of an Apple vs Google issue that I don't think matters here.GPS has worked fine with Nike running app and google maps.  However, there was one very foggy day when I couldn't get a signal, and my wife's iPhone did, so I guess head-to-head with a \"premium\" phone I'd have to say it failed, but it was extreme conditions.  It's worked most every other time just fine.I use regular headphones to listen to music (no microphone).  The sound quality has been great, I have had no issue with headphones.  Speakerphone has worked as expected as well.  No sound/speaker issues for me.  Bluetooth has connected to my stereo adapter and laptop without issue as well.Battery lasts a full day with \"regular\" use.  Less with a lot of screen time, and more if you are just on stand-by.No accessories available that I find, but it does come with a basic silicone cover, which is nice.Call quality is good.  Probably depends on your carrier, but it's fine for me on Ultra (ATT network).PROS:  Big screen.  Plenty of processing for an average user.  Feels like a more expensive phone.CONS:  no accessories, off-brandI'd recommend if you are looking for an upgraded, unlocked Android for moderate price.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Luis B.", "ReviewID": "R21A2SEG70YFPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it is excellent phone, good cpu 1,2 Ghz quad core, brigth screen 4,7\", take excellent pictures 8 megapixel camera back, ligth.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!... for the price", "Author": "Ariel David Roitman \"Gadget Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1W6C6IO4D8517", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a superb phone, I needed a dual sim phone and this one did the trick, great battery, screen, performance and everything.The only caveat, the headphone jack.

The screen is very beautiful and bright, the colors are vivid and the viewing angles are awesome.  The phone overall feels solid in the hand, well worth the 200 bucks.  The battery life is very good for me, I can get over a day of use out of this phone with no charging. I play games for about an hour, make a few phone calls and browse the net, my on screen time so far averages about 2-2.5 hours a day, and I have about 55% left at the end. The sound quality from the rear speaker is good as well as from the ear speaker (sounds the same as my galaxy S4).  The included headset has great sound and bass (I wish they would have came with smaller earbuds, but hey, they were free!).  The vibration is solid, it doesn't feel cheap like I've had in other inexpensive devices.While doing a speedtest I was able to get 9.33mb down and 2.60mb up, I was about 1/4mile away from the nearest cell tower I could see, this is with net10 At&t; hspa+.  The further away I drove I would get less speed, but I averaged about 4-5mbs down, and 1.5mbs up.At home with wifi I pulled down 28mbs, and 3.8mbs up, on average from my router that was about two rooms away (35ft).  It is a 30mbs connection.The free case and screen protector is a bonus. I found extra cases and screen protectors online under a different phone name, the Gionee Elife E3, this phone also goes by other names in different markets, but I've forgot them.I've read a ton of reviews on this phone, and most people complain about things that do not have anything to do with the phone at all! lolThey may complain about not having the SMS or what not, but they for got this is an unlocked phone and you have to set up the APN with the correct information!All in All, I think I made a good purchase with the blu life play, it's a very good phone so far.  I own a galaxy S4 but I cracked the screen and this is my replacement, I don't regret it one bit.  Other than the extra gimmicky stuff and the screen size that the S4 has, I think this phone is on par with it.

As a Pay As You Go user, I was excited to mix and match phone service providers to get the best and lowest cost voice and data coverage.The first problem I had with this phone, was its inability to run the Audible App. Audible would just hang when a title was selected for play. Eventually an error dialog would appear asking to send a bug report / terminate the program. After emails with Audible and Blu Products, Audible announced a new release, that seems to have corrected the problem. All well and good, but my confidence was somewhat shaken with this product.The thing that made the phone not acceptable, however, was its habit of locking up in standby about once per day. At some random time during the day, the phone would refuse to come out of standby. When its number was called it would not ring, and the caller would hear a \"User is not in the service area\" message. The only way out was to pop out the battery, re-insert it, and power up the phone. This is never convenient. After two weeks of this, I gave up and sent the phone back.I have no idea if this was a defect in the phone itself, or some software problem. But it was enough to make me give up.

It's a very nice looking phone, lightweight, and a clear bright screen. In addition to the usual charger, data cable, and headphones, it came boxed with a screen protector and silicone case.  I really love the choice of colors and the price was acceptable.I purchased this when my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket started freezing several times a day, after only a year. Samsung is my brand of choice, so to go with an unknown brand called BLU was a real gamble.My only problem with the phone had to do with being unable to access my AT&T; data package when WiFi was unavailable. Two lengthy calls to ATT's tech support and a visit to the store were not helpful. The store staff said they had never heard of BLU and suggested that I needed to return the phone to Amazon.My last resort was to search online to see if others had the same issue. I found several postings that provided the APN settings for my service provider. I tried them and WOW!! I'm now up and running. So now, the wait to see how things go with my pink BLU Life Play has begun.  I'll update this review as needed, but for now I'm giving it four stars.Update 8/20/13--- Discovered that pictures sent via email wouldn't download.  Did another search online and found others who provided settings that worked! Callers notified me that my voice mail was not personalized. Will try to find a solution and report back.  Even with these issues I still like this phone.Update 9/29/13--- I still like this phone and it is working fine. I figured out how to record my personal voice mail greeting since my last update. My only complaint right now is that the WLAN does not automatically stay on.Update 1/24/14--- I still like the phone but a little less. The internal phone storage is small and will not accommodate many of my apps. Although I have a nice sized SD card, the phone requires many of my apps to be stored internally and will not go on the SD card. When my apps are updated, I constantly get an insufficient storage space message. Setting the phone to automatically download to the SD card won't work.Perhaps all phones have this issue, so my 4 star rating remains. The BLU tech people were very helpful in explaining my problem.I may need to consider another phone when time for my AT&T; upgrade, but this will make me unhappy. I think the BLU phones are a great alternative to the pricier name brand phones.Update 2/18/14--- Having MAJOR problems with the updating of apps. The phone prompts me that my apps need to be updated.  When I click on update, I keep getting error messages saying there is insufficient space on the device for each application. The majority of these apps are actually on the 32 SD card, so I'm not sure what is happening. For those apps I really want to be updated, I end up deleting other apps to try to clear space.It's become a nuisance, so when my AT&T; upgrade is available in the next couple of months, I will be getting a different phone. I am disappointed because I really loved this phone. Perhaps it's just my particular phone or me. I still think this is a good buy for someone who does not use this phone as their lifeline or need a lot of applications.

It comes with a newer Android OS 4.2.1 and hopefully will be upgraded soon to a newest 4.2.2 or 4.3. Most of my Android apps work fine with a single exception of Netflix but that is most likely due to the software issues on both the Netflix and the BLU side. Not a big deal and most likely will be resolved soon enough. Everything works just fine. Battery life is very, very good. 2-2.5 days between charges.Wi-Fi performance is quite solid but it only support 2.4 GHz band. Would've been nice to have dual 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz support. But than again not a deal breaker since most of the hotspots are 2.4 GHz anyway. Lock on both wireless and Wi-Fi is very good.I would have liked for BLU Products to provide a better support on their webpage.

Beautiful screen, easy interface (though different from gingerbread); side by side to the Galaxy S it looks like a sleek & slender cousin.  Phone calls are clear.  All the built-in's (wifi, bluetooth, video), work well.The Glitchy:1) APN settings had to be manually set before data worked - using AT&T; mvno, had to look up correct settings and adjust a couple of times to get any data at all.2) No Netflix - researched, tried to get working... nope :-( Frustrating, since I could watch Netflix w/gingerbread.3) Charging port felt wiggly from the start.  Within a week it went caput. Not recognized when connected to pc, and have to manipulate charging cord just right and hold in place to charge... grumble grumble...Sending back to Amazon for replacement.  Not giving up because it's great being contract free with a smart phone that does (most) of what I like.  Will rate replacement fairly too.UPDATE 8-7-13:The Blu Life Play's wireless update has fixed Netflix!  The replacement phone arrived and charges/syncs as it should :)  Manually adjusted APN settings first thing.

Is it as good or better than the Galaxy S3 I had? No. Will you be happy if you're the person who needs to have an app for every little thing imaginable? No. Is 3G as fast as 4G LTE? No. BUT, if you need a smart phone for Google maps, email, texting and watching a few videos on your lunch hour, it's great. Best of all, if you have a phone for business and a personal line you can have 2 SIM cards in this phone. I don't know any branded phone that can do that.There are a couple of design omissions though. There is no light that flashes when you have received a message or missed a phone call like the Samsung. The camera only operates through the touch screen, you can't use the buttons for functions. With that said though the camera is great. Also, oddly enough the earbuds that came with phone are the best I have ever heard!In summary, if you are a heavy app/data user who needs to download and watch HD movies while you sit on the subway tweeting every little detail of you ride, it's not for you.

I use Straight Talk with an AT&T; sim with no problems with service in my area (Nortwest US)  This is an Excellent phone.  Lightweight, low-profile, fast, amazing display, great sound quality, and more.  The 4 gigs on board gets eaten up quickly with updates from apps, but just move as much as you can onto a SD card is there should be no issues.The only other thing that is hard is finding a case, but some are starting to come online now with hopefully more soon.About a month ago, my charging port starting going kaput and I called up BLU via their external website.  The guy in the RMA department was super friendly and quickly responded with all the information they needed to see if the phone fell under warranty.  I followed all their directions (make sure you keep your paper receipt that ships with the phone!!!) and shipped the phone to their facility in FL.  Well, after diligent emails from the RMA dept folks keeping me updated on my phones status, not even two weeks had passed and they already have things buttoned up.  But what is amazing is they personally called me to discuss options about what I could do with my phone and I was just blown away in the best way.

As a result I sought an outside brand that had comparable power  but not a comparable price tag.After several unsuccessful forays into some lesser known (and knockoff) brands, I came across the US made BLU series and specifically the Blu Life Play. It had optics on par with the iPhones & Galaxy series, excellent memory and memory management capabilities, superior App controls and rights management built in and it worked exceedingly well with these options.Most of all it was both UNLOCKED and can go from cellular carrier to carrier (without having proprietary bloatware built in that you cant get rid of) and the native apps management system meant that you could controls third party apps WITHOUT ROOTING THE PHONE.No voiding your warranty or dependence on questionable third party apps and hardware\\firmware changes to do what is natively built into this phone in the first place!Pros:good optics, memory, picture and sound quality.All in all the phone is a great value at a good price.Cons:battery life decreases markedly with 3rd party apps, likely due to their desire to communicate constantly over the wireless\\cellular connection so for extended use I'd suggest a second spare battery acquired at time of purchase.Screen is VERY sensitive to not only touch but proximity so a call can be interrupted by your chin being too close to the hang up button.

Great K-line phone!", "Author": "Weegimac", "ReviewID": "R1G9RJUASWTQN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To preface my review, may star rating is for the phone only. The other information is in regards to the experience of purchasing a BLU product, Blu's service and communication as well as trying to obtain this product.The Phone:The phone is not really a Blu Product, it is actually a rebrand of a phone that comes off the KTouch line in China and it's sold as a Geonee Elife E3 in India and General Mobile Discovery in North Asia. Blu, a Florida based company basically patched their intro and English ROM for the US market. The good news is that because this phone was picked up by many \"Rebranders\" over the last few months, it does show its impeccable taste to engineers alike for its durability and ability to utilize JB4.2. The platform is well built, the phone is sleek and I see no issues with battery or processor performance. It is a very good phone for the price and rivals the Samsung line very well.BLU Products Inc.Blu needs to work on Customer Service, they will get it right eventually but this obviously takes time. Facebook and Twitter are their main modes of communication. But they really don't troubleshoot, just tell you to return their phones to where you purchased them... That is another issue; Make sure you buy from the website they tell you. They do not seem to honor specific warranties from select website. Just buy from Amazon and you will be OK.I initially ordered a Grey Life Play, 10 minutes after Amazon's posting. It took 4 weeks to process the order, 1 week to prepare shipping and then the order was cancelled by amazon because BLU never sent amazon the grey phones. They basically just disappeared from existence, Blu never gave amazon or myself an explanation, but I was destined to get the Life Play so I picked my second choice, Blue Blu life play. I'm a bit pissed off about this and have been scouring the websites to find I am not alone ... I also hear that the Life One has also been removed from production.  I call these small company growing pains, ill attention, poor service and communication. The Life was released in March, delayed through June and shipped in July... Select Colors on a broken promise to deliver on time...When BLU grows up and beefs up their service and support, then they will be successful. For now, they are just a small little rebrander.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for a couple of weeks", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R33C73ECSUMBFS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone hoping for a economical option that would be up to date.

They said that an email was sent, but I did not receive it.  It was not in spam, or deleted either.  They forwarded the email and here is the turnaround time for a warranty repair\"The average turnaround time for all repairs is fifteen (15) business days, but in extreme cases the repair process may take a maximum of thirty (30) business days.\"You are reading that correctly.  15 - 30 business days.So unless you are good with being without a phone for 1 - 2 months.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, lets start out by saying I am completely aware that all cell phones have issues.  I currently have 6 phones within my household.  I have have had dozens of phones  Every brand has had a problem at some point in time.I applaud Blu for taking the path of creating an affordable phone that satisfies 95% of what people actually need.  But they have one fatal flaw to the model.  Support!The Life Play that I purchased just 4 short months ago had an issue with the SD card reader.  No matter what card I put in, it says the card is bad and asks to reformat.  Again, these things happen.Here is where the problem begins.  I called in to support and waited for about 30 minutes to speak to someone.  The person was friendly and seemed knowledgable.  The took all of the necessary information, IMEI, Model, part number, problem with the phone etc.  They said that they would be submitting a claim to RMA/Warranty.  Again pretty standard.  He then said that he would send me an email to confirm and that I would here back in 24/48 hours.I received the email which asked for all of the same information, again.  I sent it back immediately.  30+ hours later I had not heard anything, not even a reply that they received the email, so I called back in.  I waited 45 minutes on hold then spoke to the same person who said that they just submitted the claim to RMA/Warranty.  I received the email which states that it would be 3 business days before I here back on the RMA.  So now the process is taking 4 business days to get an RMA answer.  I asked to speak to a manager and waited for an additional 15 minutes.  The manager said that I need to understand that they are the new guy and do not have the infrastructure to support a higher level of customer service and this is the best they can do.So....If you have and issue you will Submit your claim.  Wait 24 - 48 hours to see if your claim is valid, Wait 3 business days form RMA to respond.  Send the phone to them 3 days.  They look at it maybe another 3 days.  They send it back another 3 days.  Grand total:  UP TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS (ALMOST 3 ACTUAL WEEKS) TO HAVE YOUR PHONE FIXED!Morals to the story:1.  If you need a phone with responsive support, this is not the phone for you.2.

Let me tell you the real situation about the blu phones. The decent quality, 2 sim cards, good prices, good specs for a budget phone and TERRIBLE SUPPORT OR NO SUPPORT AT ALL. THINK twice before buy anything from BLU PRODUCTS COMPANY.Short story - you bought the BLU phone and its working with no issues - you very LUCKY !! start playing lottery $) and be happy BLU PRODUCTS owner.Long story - you bought the BLU phone and you have some issues (DOA, headphone jack broken, black pixels on the screen, short battery life, Android is always low on memory, ECHO on microphone .. screen clicking by itself ...etc ) - welcome to HELL !!If you still have refund or replacement period = you lucky again. Otherwise - YOU JUST WAISTED 200$-300$ from your wallet. If you want to find the truth $) be my guest = read the whole story = IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND PAIN !!!First off I had 4 Smartphone's. (3 had issues)2012 1st Blu Studio 5.3 - black dots, bad design of case - the screen was visible detached from system board. = sent for replacement.2012 2nd Blu Studio 5.3 - first half year great phone for its money. (270$) great battery life - 4-5 days with 5.3 screen = very happy. until the headphone jack stopped working normally - some hiss sound with tapping when you plug the headphones. no more movies or private conversations on the go ... Tried to fix it... went to couple stores for repair - the verdict unfixable ... Give it away to my neighbors to use it as GPS on his car.Tried to contact BLU Products for warranty repair - welcome to some BLU marry-go-round - \"please contact distributor\" and distributor replays ... since its out of 30 days from the day of purchase - \"please contact BLU products\" I did wrote around 30 yes its 30 !!!!! emails ... trying to resolve this issue ... still no help.Hmm ... I am still trying to find the truth $) and some service . I did find the email of CEO of BLU Products ... and sent to him all my correspondence with the supervisors from BLU and Vendor stamped by dates ... in one huge email .... just to be relieved of this whole nonsense and terrible customer support.2013 3rd BLU STUDIO 2 - To be honest I was surprised when I got answer from him directly . Very delicate and nicely written letter with apology and offer to get new model of BLU STUDIO 5.3 Smartphone !!! free of charge. OMG all this emails .. looking for help finally paid off... HAPPY END ???? NO WAY only half story ...When I got new Smartphone BLU Studio 5.3 II. It worked nicely for couple weeks than ... its start failing APART.Here are list of issues with BLU smarphone1) Clicking by itself ... and the screen is not responsive a lot of times (even when I did factory reset and as test did capture couple pictures ... it happened again and again)enjoy the terrible unknown feature by BLU products smartphone .... clicking by itself randomly ... can happen 1 time in a week or 5 times during the DAY !!![...][...][...]2) Low RAM ... Even with couple applications since its only 512 mb of ram its freezing and shutting down apps . A lot of freezing with GPS on and map from Google with data connection on and Bluetooth on. Especially when trying to play music on background ... its start freezing and shutting down applications by itself.3) Very low battery life ... the original BLU were holding up to 4-5 days of active use ... this one ... less than a DAY. (I did charging now 2 times a day)4)Echo - a lot of complains from my coworkers and friends .So I did start warranty service on this \"gift\" from CEO of BLU PRODUCTS. I was out of states for work... So it took me a several weeks to send for repair/ replacement.I was assured multiply times that if issues (the main one - clicking on the screen by itself) will be confirmed - they will replace it with new model.But in real life ...another 20 emails ... no real help ... only promises to resolve the issue and make me happy. they tried to charge me 80$ for replacing wet ?? system board .. and finally sent back pretty much same unit with replaced screen, system board and same defective battery ... nice job....when I asked why they not replaced the battery ... I got answer that 6 hours its OK for BLU phones ... so you OK to charge it 2-3 times a day !!!! If you need new battery go buy the new one....2013 4th BLU STUDIO 2 - So for now I did give it to friend as present. with explanation - no obligation from me.... and if something will happen to this phone ???
