Those who doesn't want to be in the iphone world... this is your best bet. Sufficient access to mails, facebook updates and Internet although not as good as the top class smart phones.Only problem I have is with the battery. The battery dies off in 24 hours. Not sure, if it's a problem with my piece. Bought a new battery. Still it doesn't go beyond a day. Apparently, I have to charge the phone whenever I get it home. The spec says that it has a talk time for 400 mins (provided you have additional two batteries with full charge)", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "htc smart phone", "Author": "Cindy Raney \"Craney\"", "ReviewID": "RNTRC02AAUV27", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a good world phone, but lacks a lot of features that the htc aria has. runs off of brows os and does not have the app store on it yet. other than that i find it to be a good phone.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "piece of crap", "Author": "b", "ReviewID": "R3T9UB43SNF1XZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone arrived on time i was so happy to recieve it but then soon as i started using it it turned out that it wouldnt open apps and it wouldnt even send or recieve pictures so i got rid of it and got an iphone and i recommend an  iphone for anyone! forget htc and this seller. i contacted them about the phone and they said they would charge me to take the phone back. thats so dumb. do NOT buy", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfied", "Author": "Casey J.
