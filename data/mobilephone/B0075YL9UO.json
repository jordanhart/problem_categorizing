I very soon found out how easy a touch screen was to operate and seldom bothered sliding out the keyboard.I do like the durability of the Merge.  One of its downsides, weight, is probably also its redeeming quality.  Since it practically lives in my pocket, the heft is sometime a problem.  This is even more evident if the phone is in a shirt pocket, it'll droop and sag under the weight.All in all, it's not a bad unit and is pretty easy to navigate.  I especially hated to say that just after giving up my beloved BlackBerry.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not unlocked,", "Author": "M.

I tried installing a different rom and that might of caused it to act this way, but it keeps freezing, crashing, light sensor doesn't work properly anymore.  Android 2.2 is a bit outdated and you cannot update it past 2.2, which is bad if your a person who wants it constantly updated, and running the latest version. If your just making calls, texting, maybe a light browsing on the go, this would be a perfect phone for you.(One other thing, to activate this on verizon you do NOT need a sim card in the phone, which i thought it did.... hope this helped someone).", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as user friendly as we'd like", "Author": "Mishell Magnusson", "ReviewID": "R18XB9J9O1KE6Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this for an 18 year.
