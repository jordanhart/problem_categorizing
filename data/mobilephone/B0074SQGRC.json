I got a cheap chinese wall charger, and no connect cord with a usb end for connecting to my computer.The charger was wrapped in shipping tape that melted all over the cord so it's sticky any where I touch it.He said he used it for only 3 weeks but I think it was used for a lot longer than that.I will NOT buy from this seller again as his shipping packaging is cruddy - my phone could have been damaged or cracked, and he lied about the accessories.

I called Sprint and was told that although data roaming on iPhones may be turned off, it still uses data roaming and that you have to turn ALL roaming off. Seriously?!

I need this phone, that i paid for, deactivated so i can use it.Thank you!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Good Price and Honest Seller", "Author": "S.

It came in a crappy box not apple, wrapped in tissue paper  with 2 nonapple chargers everything in Chinese.its not even a sprint phone its a non brand phone IDK if that means its locked or unlocked but i know it is not a sprint phone. I called Sprint they told me I cannot activate this phone because it is not a sprint phone so i contacted the seller for a refund since i just got it 2 weeks ago and just tried to activate it.  The seller responded that it just needs to be taken to the Sprint store.(well he said it was ready to be activated so right there that was a lie).  So i was very doubtful but decided to try anyway and they told me the same thing, you can't activate the phone it is not a sprint Iphone.  and its also not new if it was new it would have been in apples box, not some chinese knockoff box.  It may not even be an iphone it may be some Knockoff chinese brand.all I know is the seller did not want to refund my money he made me waste my time going to a sprint store and waiting for an hour just to be told the same thing.  Now I have filed a claim to get a refund because i paid 199.00 for a phone I cant even use and I have an upgrade in 3 weeks anyway.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "This was NOT a Sprint phone!!", "Author": "R.

It is a very deceptive business practice not to advertise the fact that the phone looks pretty, but you will NEVER be able to use it. I must assume the phone is likely stolen, if it has not been released by the customer. Two hundred dollars worth of hogwash. I am sorely disappointed.  This was a birthday gift for my son.
