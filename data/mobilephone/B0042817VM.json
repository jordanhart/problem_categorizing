{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid Phone", "Author": "stallion", "ReviewID": "R1VHDW3RY52PX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Mantra is a fantastic phone, and I give it 5 stars all the way.  The phone is sturdy, well-built and really gives you that \"they don't make 'em like this anymore\" feeling when holing it in your hand.  It makes me feel like I'm back in the late 90's early 2000's which were awesome, simpler times in my life, so I enjoy the feeling.  My first day with Virgin Mobile was May 1st, 2011, which was 2 months before they adjusted their plans and increased the $25 plan to $35, but I am grandfathered into the $25 plan for life as long as I don't switch to another Virgin mobile plan or stop using the phone for more than a month.  Before I settled on the Mantra,  I tried the Rumor Touch, then the Loft, then the Intercept, then the Rumor 2.  I didn't like ANY of these phones.  I don't like QWERTY keypads because I like to have one arm free so I'm not so locked into some electronic device with both hands feeling overly geeky and introverted.  If I want to write a long message or surf the web, I'll use my laptop with all 8 fingers and 2 thumbs and get much more done with my time.  Not a fan of the QWERTY keypad (or the touchscreen either).  Both are just frustrating to me because they take way too long to communicate.  A simple text and/or my voice is all I need.The Mantra is great for the two of these.  Calls are crisp and clear, and the keypad is user friendly and comfortable.  Has everything you need down to the emoticons and a nice \"xylophone\" keypad tone selection which is very pleasing to my ears when I use the keypad.The camera is not great, but who cares.  If I want to take tons of pictures and/or take video, I will use a camera.  The phone doesn't take video probably because IT'S A PHONE.  If it took pictures and video it would be a camera or camcorder.  There is so much technology \"crossfading\" as a I call it nowdays.  Sometimes it is good (like Google Voice which negates one's need to have a landline...ie all you need is an internet connection, and you can use Google Voice on your computer to talk FOR FREE anywhere in the US and International with the best, lowest rates available.  I LOVE GOOGLE VOICE!  It's because of this program that I'm able to actually get away with having a $25 Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk plan which includes unlimited data and web but only 300 monthly talk minutes).  I just give people my cell number and google voice number, they'll leave a text or voicemail on either my cell or google voice, and I'll just call them when I get home (or wherever I can use a computer with internet access for free) using Google Voice for FREE)).  But, some devices are just way too intricate and overexending.  A camera should be used primarily to take pictures and some video.  A phone should be used primarily to talk and secondarily to text.  A computer can be used for all other forms of computation and communication these days.The Mantra is also actually pretty great on the web if you install the proper programs (ie Opera Mini 3.2 (low-memory version) and/or 6 (3.2, I think is better b/c it is faster b/c of the low-memory usage).  Using Opera Mini 3.2 makes surfing the web on the Mantra quite delightful.  Then you can also install Googlemaps into the Mantra.  IM is included, but it's only with AOL and Yahoo, which I don't use.  I use Gmail, which works just fine with Opera Mini 3.2 and 6 (3.2 low memory version is better, in my opinion, even though the interface is more bare, it's speedy).  I can access gmail and Google Voice flawlessly (however, the holy grail of using Google Voice to make an actual phonecall is not supported unless you have a phone with a Wi-Fi connection which the Mantra does not have.  It would be so sweet if you could make calls using Google Voice over the network.  I haven't found a way to access Google Chat.The Bluetooth only allows the Mantra to pair with a headset.  There is no Bluetooth file transferring.  I used to make my own ringtones for my previous phone using makeownringtone.com.  It is free.The phone has very few built in wallpapers and ringtones like all other Virgin mobile phones, but sometimes less is more.  But, you can always use pictures you take with the phone as your wallpaper and screensaver.  The included ringtones and wallpaper are all pretty solid in my opinion, and the keypad is so supple that it feels very nice on the thumb(s).All in all, this phone is a superb buy, if you can still find it...this Mantra has lasted me almost 2 years now, and saved me a ton of money in the process.  I hope it lasts a whole lot more.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "A typical low-end handset", "Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "RVYPOPCKJ6BMS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using Virgin Mobile pay-as-you-go since I started using a cell phone. Over that time I've had a chance to try out five or fix different VM handsets, and this one is my current one. Overall I'd rate it roughly average as far as Virgin handsets go.The M340 is a typical low-end handset, the sort that Sprint and others will gladly give away for free. In fact you'd be doing them a huge favor by accepting one on a contract plan nowadays, which is why it's great that Virgin doesn't do contracts. It has a small color screen, even smaller external color display, VGA camera, standard mini-USB power/headphone jack, and bluetooth. Samsung always makes pretty decent hardware, and this is probably the 50th incarnation of a very old, tried-and-true design. It's tough, has a battery that lasts forever, and generally works.The phone itself is a clamshell design, and pretty standard size and weight. It doesn't look anything fancy, has a standard keypad and D-pad, and extra keys for volume and camera. Let's just say you won't be drawing envying looks from iPhone/Android users :PThe big downsides are the standard Virgin Mobile interface, which is pretty much 100% static and has very few features. You get things like a simple scheduler and alarm, basic messaging tool, (very) basic web browser, and a calculator and world time tool that you'll probably never use. It has speakerphone and limited voice commands as well. In short, you get what you pay for.The speakerphone is loud and clear, and the pickup is quite good. Call quality is so-so. This isn't a 3G device, is piggybacked on Sprint's CDMA network, and the reception (both incoming and outgoing) can be very poor at times in my calling area (Silicon Valley, CA). One big problem I've had- which I'm not sure if it's just me or not- is that when people leave voicemail the entire handset tends to lock up. I literally have to remove the battery to restart it; not even the power button works. So far this isn't that big a deal for me because I don't get many calls, but I can imagine it might annoy others to no end.In summary, this is a good phone to get for people that don't expect to be making very many calls. If you talk, on average, less than 20 mins per month then it's a steal as far as affordability goes. Just don't expect any serious features and you'll be perfectly satisfied. I must admit, however, that Virgin's new monthly plans and devices are getting extremely tempting. Even now, I spend close to that amount right now on the pay-as-you-go plan, and I'm considering changing over. And I'll readily admit, one major reason is that this device is embarrassing to own and use for a high-tech professional.Pro:Cheap. Really cheap.Tough and, since it's cheap, you won't be scared to lose it.Insane battery life (about 1.5 weeks/charge with infrequent use).Makes calls...Con:Pretty much zero features.Poor customization.Call quality is mediocre.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Died within a few months", "Author": "S.
