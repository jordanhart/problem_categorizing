{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LG Product!", "Author": "Daniela Morales \"cherry blossom\"", "ReviewID": "RA65JFP0XUSHG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is great. I bought it because of the price and all the features it has. It does everything other phones do but under 200 bucks. 2 MP camera, mp3, radio, video and one of the most cool features newer phones don't have: the ability to listen to your mp3 music through your bluetooth headset device. Although you have to make sure your bluetooth headset is Stereo, Mono will not play the music.It worked fine with my SIM card, once I put it in, it recognized the signal with no problems. Reception is very good as well.Design is very sleek and compact. Very lightweight and stylish. The leather case protects it very nicely.I rated 4 because of several reasons:1) I could not figure out a way to configure the phone to send multimedia MMS. If you love to send pictures or video, unless you know how to configure it, this is not a phone for you.2) The speaker function is not loud enough.3) The provided earphones are not comfortable for me. ( if you are use to wearing earbuds, then these are fine).4) Spanish is not included on the languages list. Only English and Asian languages.Overall, this is a great phone. I love its design and features. Plus, no US cell phone carrier has it, so you can be sure none of your friends has it ;-).", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very stylish fashion phone", "Author": "Clint Tran", "ReviewID": "R2UORTIRXR4NWI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nice fashion phone that I have owned for about a year. And when I said \"fashion phone\" that's mean don't expect it to do everything, such as e-mail, web browsing, IM, etc because it can't! it's not a smart phone, but it's a very stylish phone, you definitely won't find any one with another one like it and everyone who see it will comment on it unique design. Aside from that the performance is pretty ok in term of a phone that answer call and everything.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "LG ke820", "Author": "Herson Batz \"Nosreh\"", "ReviewID": "R24A4LAV7E6KHU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes, Actually I bought a cellphone lg ke820...But a just found some problems the two next days..

I am very dissapointed as well! Wish these reviews had been on here when I bought this piece of crap!! Not only does the internet, video messaging, downloading, etc. (anything that requires you to know your company's 12 digit IP address- can't figure out for the life of me!!) NOT work, but it also gets HORRIBLE!!! reception. In fact, just while typing this review I attempted to answer a call to not be able to hear the person AT all and had to restart my phone to get a service connection! oohhh the pain of ordering through the mail! It just looked so snazzy! It is very sleak and comes with a cool carrying case that makes it appear to be a flip-phone, but MY flip-phone is half leather!! hehe I love the smell! I also love the toggle button and cool sounds it makes (click for toggle and door knock for text message-people always say, someones at the door! its funny!), it has excellent sound quality as its meant for mp3 playing. I have yet to get around to downloading songs onto it. I also quite enjoy the plug n play feature. I can take photo or video and plug right into my laptop!i love the big widescreen (great for taking pictures!) And it's camera is well above most phone cameras. That was the reason I bought it. It has worked for the reasons I bought it for. It seems to have good hardware, just no reception, and alot of confusion over where I can find the codes I need to plug in to it to use all the capabilities. I doubt my cell phone provider will know what I'm even talking about. Anyways, hope all my rambling is helpful to SOMEONE out there! It doesn't do me much good, but some enjoy it. :-D", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "not too bad.", "Author": "D. Pintor", "ReviewID": "R3OO7P5JM6UIBS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I rate it four because my company didn't have an option to connect this to the internet. It ok though since it's going to save me money in the end and avoid me from downloading stuff onto it.  It's a little heavy but it comes with a nice case and has some fun option it it.  I definitely recommend this item even though in retrospect seems a bit overpriced but it's unique so it balances out.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
