I was in a situation where I could not be without a phone and it helped me out during that. I guess what I can say is, if you're looking for a long run phone....look elsewhere. But if you're like me, and your phone has broken and you're in need of a phone this week or asap just to do the fundamentals...then yeah, this would be a good short term buy. I'd keep a phone like this around just for backup. Waiting for a phone seems really long when you have to order one", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "No contract Sprint cell phone ready to activate on your Sprint Wireless account\nExcellent Conditioned Pre-Owned Phone, You Will Be Very Satisfied\nUsed No Contract Sprint Cell Phone\nFull 30 day customer satisfaction warranty\nPlease contact us with any questions and we will reply ASAP", "Name": "Samsung Ace SPH-i325 No Contract Sprint Cell Phones", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pl48YHXnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006YC9GFI"}}
