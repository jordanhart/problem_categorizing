{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nokia 6101/6102 Early Impressions", "Author": "Jesse", "ReviewID": "R20L8GV4B1RFMR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved the Nokia 6101 (which is essentially the same hardware as the 6102) cell phone from t-mobile a 2 days ago so here are some of my early impressions about the phone:Pros:- The great reception as with most nokia phones: My appt does not recieve a great coverage from my t-mobile and the only phones that work are ones from Nokia. I used a 6610 and a 6230 and there are no problems with the reception of the 6101.- IRDA to sync data: I own an IBM laptop which have IRDA build in. So it is convinent to use the Nokia PC Suite to sync the phone with my outlook.- Supports Mp3 ringtonesCons:- No Bluetooth: Unlike the 6230 the 6101/6102 does not have bluetooth.- Limited memory: I do not understand why Nokia did not include the external memory card slot, and music player compatibility with this phone. If it can play Mp3 ringtones then surely it can play mp3s, and it would have been great to add a 512 MB card to play music on the go.- Size and Weight: The phone is a bit bulky and heavier than other flip phones but not so much that it becomes uncomfortable in to carry around- Different charger: For some reason Nokia has a different charger for this phone. So your chargers for older models of Nokia will not be compatible.Overall I think this is a nice cell for business use. For entertainment and such, I think 6230 is still the Nokia leader.", "Date": "October 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice Well Balanced Phone", "Author": "Adam L. Safianow \"Kiddo\"", "ReviewID": "R3LWHD7ULA7NOW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is coming from a person that has actually done a lot of research in phones, and is upgrading from a Nokia 3595.  Some people have been raving about the Razr V3, but in all honestly it isn't a very good phone.  The sound quality isn't very great, the phone although skinny, is very wide, and the camera is lack luster.  The keys are bland, and hard to use when not looking, and with the exception of Bluetooth and a 2nd LCD screen, it doesn't really do a whole lot.I consider this phone a great rival.  This phone and the Razr are in great competition for Cingular customers because both have great deals going on for 2-year agreement customers.  I actually got mine for roughtly 90 dollars because I upgraded as I previously mentioned.  I could have gotten a Razr, but this phone is much more practical.This phone has plenty of features:It has video captureCamera feature (which is pretty clear if you can hold the phone steadyA bright vivid LCD screen (2 actually)A sleek designGreat sized keysEasy navigationOverall very simplisticThis is Nokia's first successful flip phone, and they didn't do anything too outrageous.  It does have MP3 playback on ringtones, and full color graphics with available moving screen savers.  Sound quality is excellent, and the phone feels very durable.  Its a great size, and feels good in your hand.  Not only charges quickly, but has a very fair battery life.  I'm not sure about other 6102s, but mine came with NO dead pixels on either screen, so that's a great thing to not have to worry about.  Although this isn't important to a lot of people, it is to me... and this phone DOES not get face grease on it very easily... which is nice... because my friend has the one LG flip phone that you can use for 10 seconds and have the screen covered in face grease.With everything however, this phone does not have all the gadgets you may want.  It doesn't have Bluetooth, so you can't be lame like everyone else and get one of those earsets, at least not the \"cool\" ones.  The cases for it aren't exciting.  There is no expansion slot, this ISN'T a SmartPhone, so you can't do a lot of PDA functions.  The sound quality on the ringtones aren't too great, but there are a lot to choose from.  Its your call if you can justify spending $2.49 for one.  I personally have The Outsider by A Perfect Circle, and its pretty decent quality.  Unlike the Razr, this isn't meant for those who have hearing aids, but honestly, that feature isn't that great on the phone, the newer Razr phones coming out will better utilize that feature I believe, but they will be a great deal more money.This phone did recognize my Sim Card VERY quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not much configuration involved.  I didn't even have to set up the time or date.  The phone didn't set up my numbers into single name folders like my last phone, but it did default put a number next to it: i.e. Corey had 2 numbers... so now I have Corey and Corey1.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just something I noticed.  The interface is really nicely set up, but the only way to access the camera is to click the button on the right side.  The volume rocker is on the left side, and is very simple to use, and the ringtone can get LOAD, so you might want to make it a lower setting, unless you are hearing impaired.  Sim Card enclosure doesn't seem very durable, and I was nervous when I need to take it out breifly... it was also pretty difficult to open.BOTTOM LINE:  This is a very durable, easy, phone to use for anyone, and will definately last you until the next phone generation arised.  At a great price, with some great deals, this is an ideal phone to suit all your NEEDS, even though it doesn't supply all your WANTS.  This stylish phone is a great addition to the Nokia line, as well as the flip-phone craze.  In my opinion a more balanced phone than the Razr V3, but like everything, it depends on who you are, and what you use it for.SUSPECTED LEARNING CURVE: 30 minutes to 1 hour... very quick considering the number of features...

I have long wanted to switch away from Cingular again due to the poor reception and frequently dropped calls on my original phone. The phone was a Samsung entry-level model, zero cost with 1-year plan. I spoke with a few of my friends in the area and they swore that their Cingular experience has been better than mine. They all have more expensive phones. After some research, I decided to give Cingular a second chance by buying the Nokia 6102 out of pocket (rather than getting an upgrade \"deal\" with a 2 year contract extension.)It was a good decision. This phone has turned me into a happy Cingular customer, for the most part. The reception is much stronger. My old phone would give 0 bars at my house, this one gives 1-3 bars and holds calls even inside my house. It still drops calls in a few low spots that I drive through, but I figure that's unavoidable.The camera is a cute toy. It takes blurry pictures in poor lighting, but decent shots in good light. I got a USB download cable to retrieve my photos. I have yet to get Cingular's multimedia messaging to work to email the pics to my account. (I suspect that's a Cingular problem, not a phone problem).The wireless web browser is nice, and it's a real convenient way to upload pics and sounds to the phone. The data cable also works well for that, and the free (from the Nokia website) software for the cable includes tools to help construct images and sound clips.Managing my address book took some work. I had all my numbers stored on the card from my old phone. The new phone didn't read the card quite the same way: it kept all the numbers, but lost the flags that told me which number was home, work and cell for each person. Eventually I moved all my numbers to my Windows Address book and use the cable and software to sync the two. That works beautifully.Bottom line: The phone is great. Cingular still has a few quirks that I live with. Toy camera is fun. Data cable is a highly recommended accessory.Followup on Nov 29, 2005:Still love my phone. I've not noticed any problems with pushing buttons by accident when it's closed.My USB cable is *not* the one that Nokia sells for $50. It's an asian unbranded cable that I paid around $15 for. Use Google to find one. Had a bit of fun getting the drivers straight at first, but otherwise works like a charm. Also, I think the IrDA function is supposed to work with the Nokia software as well, if you have an IrDA laptop or similar device.Finally, if you have a website somewhere that you can put files up for download, it's pretty easy to load images and ringtone sound files into the phone using the wireless web browser. Just upload to your website and then download via the phone browser. All you pay for is the airtime to download.", "Date": "November 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice sound quality, great speakerphone, lacks battery time", "Author": "Z. Simkins", "ReviewID": "RYBWL246J93G0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my sony ericson with Nokia 6102 flip phone, and I found the following differences:Nokia has:1. Better sound quality2. Better reception3. Great speakerphone: clear and loud though sometimes echoes on the other side, depending on my location.4. Camera is nice but the quality is grainy and flash/evening mode is not great at all. Pictures come out real dark and not clear.5. Less talk time (4 hours) and I have to charge battery every evening, as after 2 hours of talking, which is my average daily use, the battery is real low. Compared to my ericson, which I charged once a week, this is a real setback.6. Battery also seems to take longer to charge. My ericson after 15 mins was 2 out of 4 bars up. Nokia takes 30-45 mins for 2 bars.7. It is very hard to find a nicely fitting case for flip phones. If you like a swivel belt clip or a pouch case, you will like it, but if you prefer a sleeve-case you will find it difficult to find something suitable for a reasonable price.8. It's not bluetooth, so you won't be able to use wireless gadgets, but I find speakerphone sufficient for hands-free-conversations. The only problem with the hands-free option is when you receive a call, you have to flip open the phone to push the button for hands-free talk. If you are placing the call, you have to wait till the other party picks up - only then you can use the hands-free button.9. Recently I discovered a voice-call option. Pushing a button on the left activates a voice tag receptor. If you saved someone's number in the address book and assigned voice to it (such as \"Home\"), saying \"home\" while the voice receptor is on will dial the number. Very nice when your second hand is full of groceries! But the number of voice tags is limited. I think it is 10 maximum.In overall, I gave it 4 stars because of a comparatively weak battery, but in terms of serving basic phone functions it works very well.", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "best cell phone i have ever owned", "Author": "Michael Ryan \"MR\"", "ReviewID": "R38XDTJ5D1EF5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the coolest and best cell phone I have ever owned.

Is it battery life, features, design, or call quality? Well, let me tell you, you will find all of those in the Nokia 6102.I have had many phones throughout my 2.5 years of being a Cingular Customer. Many have caught my eye, but none like this one has.The design of this phone is amazing. It is the second flip-style Nokia phone I've owned. The flip itself is very sturdy, and the phone does not feel plasticy at all. The spring in the phone feels much better than any Motorola or Samsung flip phone I've ever had. The buttons are a very nice size, which is a good thing for many people. The color, grey and black is an awesome color scheme.All Nokia phones have the basics, text messaging, picture messaging, wireless internet access, etc. This phone takes all of that a step further with class 6 EDGE, FM radio capability, and it has dual displays. The menus are also much easier to use than other phones, and other Nokias.The battery life on this phone is amazing!!! I've made many calls after receiving the phone a few days ago, and the battery strength indicator has not gone down at all! That's pretty amazing. The battery also charges very quickly. A newly designed Nokia charger is used with this device. It's very unique, and is alot smaller than other Nokia chargers.Nokia phones have always been known for their excellent call quality, and ability to keep calls in very low-signal areas. This Nokia phone is no different. There is no traditional GSM hiss noise with this phone, only crystal-clear calls that stay connected for a very long time even in low-signal areas.My overall opinion of this phone is that it is a very trustworthy phone, that won't let you down, especially when you need it most. It has excellent battery life, call quality, and it has all of the features that you will ever need. I have had many phones in the past, and I would recommend this phone above all others.", "Date": "December 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "This is a  very nice phone", "Author": "J.

No, I can't!  So I took advantage of Cingular's 30 day return policy hoping I could make a call and not lose my signal.  After a week I can honestly say this phone lives up to and beyond my expectations!  I have great reception, no dropped calls and am very pleased with my purchase.To me, the slickest thing about this phone is the infrared port.  One less cable to keep track of!  I beamed my Outlook address book on my PDA into my phone in seconds.Although I didn't need a camera, it is a nice addition.  In fact, it is capable of taking a photo in low light without a flash.  The documentation on it's' use is poor, so I would advise you to play with the camera options key to get the most use out of it.A lot of reviewers have complained about low volume, and I did too until I repositioned the phone lower on my ear.  My natural tendency to hold the phone almost against my lips caused the very small speaker to be above the opening of my ear. Try it, and I bet you will notice a marked increase in volume also.I have not used the radio yet and contrary to one review here, a mini headphone jack is too big for the jack on the phone.  I guess this is my only disappointment and I can live with it.After reading many website reviews I think that most negative reviews are from people who did not tale the time to READ THE OWNERS MANUAL.  Now I admit the documentation can be overwhelming, and trying to find out how to use a specific  feature is time consuming, but here's a tip.  Download the PDF owners manual file, (a link is on this page) and use Adobe's search function to find the answer to your questions.Well, thanks for letting me share my opinions and I hope they help your decision.", "Date": "February 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not the best, but best for the price.", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R1OWB0J4AEAMXJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just wanted to quickly clarify and respond to something another reviewer said. It is in fact possible to assign individual ring tones to people. You just have to create a group and then add that person to the group. Once you do that you can assign a ring tone to the \"group.\" Yeah, it's not as simple as my last phone, a Motorola, but it's still pretty quick and easy.Additionally, you can in fact use a photo you took a while ago to attach it to a contact. Click on the entry in your phone book, Click on Options -> Add Detail -> Image, then search through your saved images. Again, a little time consuming, but I just did it under 10 seconds. In the grand scheme of the phone's features, I wouldn't let those things deter me from purchasing the phone.I am having the same issue about accidentally pressing buttons while the phone is closed. It's more a puzzler than an annoyance at this time as it doesn't seem to drain the battery any quicker or cause any problems besides the fact that I have to click out of the feature.Overall I love my phone, and would highly recommend it. I actually like that the phone display and ear piece is larger than some other phones, I find it to be more user-friendly, personally.

I got my second Nokia 6102 in March 2006. It is now April 2006 and I'm looking for a replacement. Here's how the story goes:When I first got this model, I really liked it a lot. I had no complaints whatsoever except that later wished it had Bluetooth capabilities. That is no biggy for me since I'm not one to carry around a cell phone every where I go. It stays in my car when I'm at home and it usually stays on my desk at work. If I'm out of the office for a few minutes, I'll bring it along with me. Cell phones are nice to have, but..... I'm getting off track with my story.Like I said, I really liked the phone. Occasionally, I'll use Yahoo Instant Messenger at work to communicate with a couple of others while in meetings. For five months, my daily routine of using this phone worked flawless. The suddenly one day, it reset itself when I was attempting to access Messenger. I lost some settings and the \"G\" vanished from my main screen. Normally, when I used Messenger, it would time-out after a few minutes and the phone would switch back to the main screen. I would get a pop-up if a message was received, and I could go back into Messenger and be connected.After this reset occurred, if Messenger times-out and goes back to the main screen, my connection is lost. After the error, when I attempt to connect to Messenger or the Internet, it asks me if I want to allow network access.Anyhow, after going through three layers of Cingular support, they first decided that there was nothing they could do and gave me the impression that they wanted to end the conversation. I eventually had to get a little ugly by telling them the problem is your problem; either the phone you gave me, or your network, and I want it fixed. They sent me a new phone overnight.The new phone worked flawless for almost two weeks. One day, I was in Messenger and decided I needed to exit out and place my ringer on silent, so I did. When I attempted to call up Messenger again (it runs in the background), I get this Java error and some error codes. Then the phone resets itself. Lo and behold, I back with the very same problems I had with the first phone.As I'm writing this, I have an email out to Nokia looking for a suggestion. I like the phone and I don't see any other current Cingular compatible models which I think I would like any better. If Nokia doesn't have a clue, I'll have to call Cingular for another replacement, and I may go with a different make and model.For this to happen twice, I'm beginning to think this may be a software bug. Anyhow, if you don't plan on using the Yahoo Messenger application which comes with the phone, you should be very satisfied with this phone.", "Date": "April 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Better than expected!", "Author": "The Miss \"safe side shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R22GXZ8JPZ6CDX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a vey particular consumer.

I thought the picture quality was good. (I mean you're probably not going to take professional headshots with a phone camera so...)I was pleased with the quality of the video. The sound was fine, as was reception. I was very plesantly surprised by the quality of the phone itself. It is sturdy, has a very strong flip. and though several parts are plastic it does not feel light and flimsy as many other reviews stated. I would suggest ordering a case, the shiny black outershell just seems like it may scratch easily. This phone has a lot of features including a FM radio, the headphones needed to listen to the radio are not included. (Another service provider who sells the same model includes the headset with their phone...tsk,tsk Cingular)however, I found that an inexpensive earbud will work just as well.(I purchased one from a dollar store)All in all I think this phone is a good choice for someone looking to purchase a multi function phone without all the frills and unneeded extras.", "Date": "January 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "A great phone", "Author": "D.

I do agree the phone could use more memory, but if you download Nokia's PC suite(off the Nokia website), you can use their media player to change MP3 files to a true tone file format which takes up far less space and sounds the same on the phone. I would suggest a program like Goldwave to create Mp3 file clips.I have about 10 tones assigned to groups and plenty of space left over! Also the FM radio is a great feature!  I bought a headset off of ebay and use them when I go for a walk. The phone will automatically pick up the call and then return to the radio when the caller hangs up. I never move a finger! The camera is basic, but that's all I needed from a phone. I have a digital camera. I don't find it flimsy at all.  I am very pleased with the coverage of the phone.

There are some who complain about the speaker quality, but mine was pretty decent and I didn't have many problems with it at all. I should disclaim I use the headset most of the time though so this review may not be a good barometer when it comes to the speaker issue. I have no problems with the navigation with this phone, adding tones and pics with a data cable worked perfectly with it, and text messaging is intuitive and speedy with the 6102, the T9 system on it is one of the best I've used. I also enjoy the FM radio, which has a good range and does get distant stations well. The headset is the antenna, and that makes sense since it's how most regular Walkmans and equivalents have worked since the creation of the portable stereo.However, the downside of the phone is because of the large color front mini-screen, you definitely want a soft case for it. I learned that the hard way after a nasty meeting of the screen with a seatbelt buckle that left the inside plastic cracked and a nice big purple battery-sucking bruise on the LCD. Unfortunately I went with a $2 plastic holster that left no protection for the phone, and that turned into a $115 error as I had to pay full price for a new phone to replace the cracked screen as Cingular considered it cosmetic non-warranty damage. I stomached the loss of the money and got a new 6102, and shortly thereafter got a case that offered plenty of protection (and I intent to pick up their extended coverage). It's a cool looking phone and does everything well, but with all that comes extra complicated electronics, so before you buy this, make your second purchase a good-quality soft case so you don't end up six months later with a cracked phone because you went with the cheapest method of carrying you could get.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone!!!!", "Author": "Chad Thomsen", "ReviewID": "R21GUZ9F13SQX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

Anything that could go wrong with a cell phone went from with the Motorola, and it was time for a change. I go through Cingular, and did not hesitate at all when a free Nokia 6102 was offered, as I have had only great experiences with Nokias in the past. In fact, since my Moto had gotten so bad, I popped my sim card into an older nokia i have (3 yrs) and it worked like a charm.Pros of the phone include:-generous outside display - bigger than any other phones I have seen, but the megapixels are not as good as the inside screen, but can't win them all and it definitely works well-Sleek, black outside, so refreshing that it is not standard cell phone silver which is way too played out.-Menus are easy to navigate, but I fing a 2 second delay when pulling up the main menu, but definitely something I can live with.-camera is very good, considering this is not a phone you would buy specifically for the camera.-Construction is sturdy - those who said that nokia flips have a \"cheap\" feel are way off - this one is substantial, dense, but not too big or too heavy.the only cons are that I sometimes the earpiece volume is not that great. even in quieter settings I sometimes struggle to hear the person on the other end, even when the vol. is at the max. Also, this may be a function of the area, but I also hear static in the background at times, but like I said, may be the other person's phone or the area I am in. Also, the wallpapers and images that are included are few, and they are not the best. I believe there are only 5 different wallpapers and 3 themes, just wish there was more of a choice.I am still within a 30 day return period, but I am almost sure that this phone is a keeper - unless I have many more issues with call volume.

I wish that I had actually played with it some before I bought it, but I only purchased it because I needed something cheap and temporary. I guess I got what I paid for.Before I go into the annoyances, I will say a couple of good things about this phone.  First of all, the speaker is very loud, especially if you have an mp3-type ringer.  I also think the camcorder feature is pretty cool, even if it's not very high quality, just because it's not a feature you generally see on this type of phone.  I also like that it's compact without being overly fragile.  And it looks a lot better than most of the Nokia flip-phones I've seen.Now the bad stuff.  My main problem with this phone is the menu system.  It's not that much different than other Nokia phones except that there's even more there to confuse you.  To put this into perspective, I SELL cell phones for a living.  I play with phones all day long and I usually know how to do just about everything on any given phone within a few days.  Yet I have had this phone personally for five months and I still have trouble navigating the menu.  First of all, the names of the various menus are confusing and oftentimes misleading; for example, under \"Tools\" on most phones is where you would find the calculator, calender, etc. On this phone it's where they hide the camera, radio, and voice recorder.  The camcorder, however, is not in this menu.  The only way to get to the camcorder is to open up the camera first and then go to the \"options\" menu.  There is a menu for \"profiles\" which I have also seen on other Nokia phones but I have yet to figure out its relevence.  I'm thinking it might be a way to make your ringer louder or quieter, but it would be a great deal simpler if you could just do that through the volume control.  The address book is about halfway down the menu page instead of right up front where it should rightfully be.  But really the worst thing about the menus is just the fact that you usually have to go through so many different little submenus to get to just about any actual function, and which options you choose are not always obvious.Now some of the less important things that bug me.  The camera is really bad.  I don't necessarily think that a camera is an essential function for a phone to have, but if it's going to have one it should at least be able to take something that resembles an actual picture.  The biggest problem is that if you move even the slightest bit while you're trying to take the picture it will turn out very blurry. Should you manage to take a picture worth saving, you may notice that you can zoom in on it.  But only AFTER you've already taken a picture, not before.  Furthermore, you can't save a picture in its zoomed-in state.You also can't set different ringers to different phone numbers, which is a feature that I had really come to take for granted in a cell phone and it frustrates me to no end that I can't do it with this one.  You can set a different ringer for your messages than what you have for your voice calls (although you can't distinguish voicemail from text) but it took me ages to figure out how to set my message ringer to something that I had downloaded rather than one of the default ones.Overall, I think this phone would be fine for someone who only planned to use it for voice calls and nothing else.

I used to have a Samsung flip phone and after time the lid become lose and eventually broke. This Nokia phone, however, has only been with me for a month and the antenna black piece popped off. It looks like it was held on my glue (NO SCREWS!!). The quality of it is not as good as I thought it would be. When I flip open the phone the joints that open the phone seem lose and it has only been a month.

Nokia said they aren't authorized to send a replacement phone either, because first I'd have to send the two phones back so they can assess whether the problem was created by \"physical or liquid damage,\" so even it is the fault of poor manufacturing, I may end up having to pay to repair the phones.

I give it five stars because, \"What did you expect for a twenty-dollar phone?\" I got this phone reluctantly, only after my old-fashioned Nokia brick was stolen. I asked simply for the cheapest phone with a camera, and I couldn't be more pleased. Well, actually, I could, but only after picking nits. So here we go:My first issue was with downloading photos, I shoot a lot and at twenty-five cents a piece to email them to myself a cable seemed like a reasonable solution. I wanted to avoid spending $50.00 on an OEM, so I tried one from Ebay. Then another. Then another. I called Nokia for tech support, and was surprised to talk to someone who was both knowledgeable and had no accent.There are a few separate issues here, the first being the necessity of downloading Nokia's \"PC Suite\" to facilitate connectivity. The version touted for Windows 98 was erratic and is no longer offered or supported, but before this happened I finally got a tech email admitting it was a known problem. And with regard to the non-original cables having some sort of DRM capabilities, the tech just sort of chuckled and said, \"I really can't comment on that\". Not only did they not work, I had to uninstall and reinstall the app after each failed attempt. How amusing.Realizing the cost of the cable would be paid back very soon I ordered one from Nokia and had it almost immediately. From then there was no problem, although I could only use it with XP.The file transfer protocol is a bit odd, but works OK. The synchronization with Outlook seemed flawless and works in both directions. The new automatic picture transfer will completely empty all the images in the camera, including graphics, wallpaper and screensavers, which seems like a mistake not present in the earlier version.Removing the SIM chip to another phone will save the bare basic info, but so thoroughly scramble to formatting you'd be better off doing it by cable. You can't save games or photos to the chip, either, I don't know if other phones enable this.Oh, games: No Tetris, but I found my favorite and most addictive one, \"Zuma\". The screen is far to small for a pleasant experience, but it's a novelty for me and helps pass the time in waiting rooms.All the other features of the phone work adequately and are quite useful- stopwatch, countdown recorder, calendar, notepad, alarm clock, etc. I did have to spend a few days with the manual to get an understanding of the software but it made sense fairly quickly. One unbilled feature is that the display is bright enough to use for a flashlight or nightlight when stumbling around in a strange hotel room or parking lot, it gives off enough of a glow to see well.The phone features? Oh yeah, I hardly ever get calls, but from what use I have had, the service is OK. You do need to hold the speaker right next to your ear to get the best volume, I picked up a no-name headset/mike for $8.00 and it does just fine.I live in a rural area that is a canyon, and Cingular consistently has the best signal here. The hot spots around the house are different between phone service and messaging, which is slightly irritating in that I will get a missed call message right after the phone doesn't ring. The camera works OK for what it is- great for catching rare moments in still or video. Same for the audio recorder, I use it for notes and catching info from the car radio. A speaker phone seems to work OK, but playing music is pretty much a waste of time.Not unlike writing a review for an obsolete phone on Amazon.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "I couldn't be much happier", "Author": "S.

I decided to throw caution to the wind, and order it anyway.  When it arrived and I made my first phone call, the volume was a *little* soft.  I asked the other party to hold a sec, mashed the Up button on the side of the phone a few times while watching the volume meter increase on the display, and resumed my conversation.  The next time the person I called spoke, I couldn't believe it.  It was not only clearly audible, it was slightly alarming.  Perhaps the other reviewers forgot to peel the protective shipping plastic off?Anyway, the phone is great.  It's tiny -- neither as long nor as wide as the Razr (although it is thicker).  It doesn't have Bluetooth, which gives me a little bit of comfort.

Having been a Nokia user (and FAN) since 2000 when I first signed on with Cingular, I definitely had high hopes and expectations for the 6102.  I had no reason to be disappointed since the Nokia brand has served me well.  I loved their candy-bar style 5190 so much, that I even got my second upgrade phone from Cingular for the same model in 2002 before Nokia discontinued it.  To this date, I hear Nokia's biggest seller is still the 5190.So imagine my disappointment and surprise when I finally plugged the 6102 into play.  First and foremost, reception is average at best.  I know my comments will draw the ire of other users here who have raved about this 6102's reception.  80% of the time, I have to move the earpiece and reposition it over my ear several times over the course of a conversation.  The old 5190 NEVER had this problem.  Again, I hope this problem is due to a sample defect.  Even at that, one rarely hears of quality control issues with Nokia.  It is supposed to be second to NONE in the cell phone industry.  Also, battery life isn't great.  I have to recharge the phone every 3 days and I don't even use the phone all that much, maybe up to 1 hour ++ each day.This underwhelming performance from the 6102 comes as a shock.  I have since returned the phone back to Cingular's eStore for a replacement.  I have declined a replacement for the same model.  While I ponder my next selection, perhaps the Motorola V557 is a good alternate choice, though I was shocked to hear from Cingular reps that the V-557 actually PALES in comparison to the Nokia 6102.  But the reviews here on Amazon for the V-557 are VG, but then so were reviews for the 6102.Already I miss my Nokia 5190.....perhaps I will never give it up again if the Motorola V-557 fails to perform as well.", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "You'll love it!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1FOPJA2FLKYAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone.

I had my first one replaced in March because the side buttons (the volume and camera) would no longer work. The camera's okay (it's a phone) - video quality is horrid. No Bluetooth, which my girls friends have 'dubbed' a hassle, because there are many times they want to Bluetooth me sound clips and pictures from their Razrs. It doesn't have much memory capacity (only about 3 MB), so you can't save much. That's ultimately why I bought the Motorola MPX 220 to replace it.

The speakerphone, however, is exceptional.  The navigation buttons are easy to push - quite possibly too easy particularly if you've got larger fingers.  The alarm clock allows for customizing the snooze :)  Ringtones are okay, the polyphonic tones are a bit tinny but that is probably due to a smaller chord range than most mid-range cellphones.  As with all Nokia's customizing to your liking is a snap!  The backlight turns off on its own which means you could be in the middle of something when it shuts down.  It is an active-flip so its not necessary to press extra buttons to answer or end a call.  The phones come with a PTT button - a feature that isn't yet available.
