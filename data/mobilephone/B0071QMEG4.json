Its a great PDA phone, I can do all of my necessary task. I LIKE KEY PAD BASE PHONE ! I love to text on it because its so easy and it looks like I am on instant messaging and it has a full keyboard. I also love the built in PDA and how it helps me to remember tasks and events because I cant remember anything. The other thing that helps is how when you want to dial a phone number you can go to the keypad and just touch the numbers and that makes it so easy to make a call.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "old and difficult to use", "Author": "K.
