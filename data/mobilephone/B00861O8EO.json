{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Data/WiFi/Phone Tablet Detailed Review Below...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RFAO4QE0QMTW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "September 8, 2013 (UPDATED REVIEW).First let me say that I own TWO of these tablets. One I let me sister-in-law use and one I use. Both are EXCEPTIONAL Tablets. The newest one that I received in August, 2013 came with Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 and I am using that one now and very pleased with it. However, my first P3100 I have had almost a year now and it still has Ice Cream Sandwich. But I heard that 4.2.2 may be coming to this tablet soon (November 2013) so this is good news!- Archived Flash: I have installed Archived Adobe Flash and now can play flash videos including Amazon videos. If you need instructions, ask me in the comments.The fact that it has a built in phone and is 3g and 3g+ capable, I love this device and use it as BOTH A PHONE AND A TABLET. The size is PERFECT and easy to carry around in my bag or purse.This are my pros and cons on this DATA/PHONE TABLET Tab 2 7.0:Pros:1) Data capable (this works perfectly on my AT&T; and I get 3g and find the speed is very fast! Gets extra star for this.2) Phone capable (note that this device nor the P3113 Student one comes with a phone headset and does not come with headphones). I already had headphones for my Galaxy Note, so I use these for making phone calls with this device with no problems and the connection is strong, loud and very clear! Gets extra star for this.3) Easy to set up with STANDARD (regular full sized) SIM card. This device is unlocked and will work for 3g on AT&T; and 2g on T-Mobile and other GSMs. And I did not have to enter the ATM settings, it did this automatically when I started the setup, opened the data and I logged on to my Gmail, etc and then turned off data and then on to WiFi settings, etc. See next section for how to set up WiFi.4) WiFi setup (EASY): Here is how I set it up: I went into Settings, WiFi and turned the WiFi on. When it turned on, it showed my home WiFi router modem. I then selected this to connect and it asked me for the passcode (the router had it on it ). Then I typed in the passcode and my WiFi started right up with a excellent connection!5) Came with ICS 4.03 but so far there is no update to 4.04, but I am hoping in time there will be as Jellybean is coming out OTA in November. The ICS 4.03 runs very fast (more on this below).6) I use the KEYBOARD DOCK that came with my P3113 and USB adapter to transfer files from USB drive to device. The same accessories that came with P3113 (WiFi only) work great on this tablet as well...CONS:1) NO US Warranty for this International Version. However, since most devices fail within the first 30 days, I have found, so you can bring it back to the store as defective.2) No Adobe Flash installed (this is NOT the fault of Samsung, it is an Android problem). However, I found a workaround and installed Archived Adobe Flash and watch online videos all the time. Ask if you need more info on Archived Flash.Bottom line: Would I purchase this device all over again? Yes, in a heartbeat as I purchased it for the phone and data capabilities and have been very happy with this device. However, if you DO NOT NOT need data or phone in a tablet and have your favorite cellphone/smartphone you use then get the P3113 WiFi only version and save yourself $100 and also you will have a warranty.Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it has been helpful for you. Also, if you have questions or comments, please ask as I am a techie person.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect size, great phone", "Author": "Unzar Jones", "ReviewID": "R27O0LLLUPTAHX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet was purchased  through Amazon from FPS Trader.I already had the US version of the Tab 2 7\" from Best Buy, but wanted the 3g radio for phone use. This tablet is GSM.  The device came with version 4.0.3 of ICS and really made the interface much smoother.  The US unit has an infrared beam for use as a TV remote,  the 3g one does not. The 3g tablet has a speaker at the top, when held in portrait mode, and a microphone at the bottom for phone use. The top(ear) speaker only works during a phone call. I prefer speaker phone, which it has, of course, but am looking to get a pen style bluetooth handset to clip in a front pocket, like the Samsung HM5000.  I downloaded Dialer-ex from the Play Store and it works very well so far.  On a risk, I bought the Netzero full size sim card and $50 unlimited talk/data card. Activation was done through their website with one issue- cannot send or receive pics through text. I still need to recheck some settings, but don't miss that funtion. The data seems pretty quick for 3g here in So California. Fits too tight in pockets for siting unless I'm wearing cargo pants, it's okay for standing/walking.  I'm very happy with this tablet for what I use it for- writing, reading, web, email,  phone, text, some games. The slower processor is the weakest point for the most demanding games.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "like it very much", "Author": "Absolut", "ReviewID": "R3OOVPT6CDCCDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i consider this a good buy for me, fair price... have had it for a couple of months now and have the sense i still haven't used it at its full potential. i use it to surf, check mail, weather, alerts, gps and other little applications... i'm satisfied with it... could use it as cell (does work) or use the 3g for data. I think it may be a little small for movies loaded with special effects, or for constantly surf the web, or read an ebook for more than a couple of hours, ...but for what I use it, it is excellent for me, works smoothly, fast, clear, never acts up, very practical to carry around, battery lasts for about 10hrs for me... got the pencil to click around as i noticed i would fat-finger a lot, and that made it much easier.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great \"Phablet\"!! Works with AT&T; and T-Mobile 3G data network!!", "Author": "bcw448", "ReviewID": "R2EMOA1WN20K4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 GT-P3100 is a great \"Phablet\"!! I am not going to write another product review on this great \"Phablet\" since there are already great detail reviews made by other users.I just want to confirm some of the questions that people have asked regarding this product.1) Will this \"Phablet\" work with AT&T; and T-Mobile 3G data network?The good news is YES.I confirmed that this \"Phablet\" has inbuilt 1900Mhz HSPA/WCDMA band which works with AT&T; 3G band.Then how about T-Mobile?Lucky us in the USA, the answer is YES. T-Mobile has started a \"refarm\" project in 2011 on the 1900Mhz HSPA/WCDMA band under their towers(since they want a share of the iPhone customer), and the project is now 95%+ completed. And these towers are start operating since late 2012. And the coverage of the T-Moilbe 1900Mhz is now upto 14 metro cities and expanding. I am living in Oakland, CA and am using the T-Mobile $30.00 prepaid plan, 100min talk/unlimited text/5Gb data plan with this \"Phablet\" with no problem. In my area the T-Mobile 3G data speed is great and stable. Very happy with the service.2) No Adobe flash installed???This \"Phablet\" does support flash. But unfortunately, Adobe and Google has pulled away the Flash player app from the Play Store since 8/2012. So in order to install flash player on your device, you need to go to the Adobe site to download the .apk and install it. Just google \"Archived Flash Player versions\" download the .apk, install it and you are good for flash contains and games.3) No 5 GHz N band wifi???This \"Phablet\" does have dual band support which means it does support 5 GHz N band wifi, but sadly, due to the 5 GHz N band usage problem in Europe, so after ICS the 5 GHz band is disabled on the device by default. You can still re-activate it but this requires rooting of your device which I am not going to cover it here.So hopefully these Q&A; helps!Enjoy your great \"Phablet\" the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 GT-P3100!! :-)", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Product.", "Author": "Vincent Clemmons", "ReviewID": "R2OA268L0X6F2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am merely here to say that I love this product; although Samsung U.S.A. provides absolutely no support for it whatsoever because it is a so-called \"International Cell Phone\" (not to mention the fact that it is \"unlocked\").

She ordered it and posted to another friend in America who then posted it to me in Sierra Leone. It arrived safe, in good working condition and every other item arrived safe and good.I had yearned for a tablet for years and have been saving my hard earned cash for the best. Research on tablets/customers reviews made me to believe that the Samsung galaxy tab is the best. Indeed, I strongly believe it is the best. I love everything about it but very, very much disappointed with the battery life. I have read from reviews that once fully charge, it will serve at least 8 - 10 hours. This is not true for mine. After turning off all applications that I think can consume more power, yet my battery runs so fast, less than three hours, just doing simple things like typing, taking/watching photos, browsing. To me, this is a great disappointment and I regretted buying this tablet.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERRY GOOD", "Author": "JOSUE", "ReviewID": "R3HYGW2YCWMKNX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.The only downside is NOT BRING FLASH.

Knote", "ReviewID": "R2E42TS7YRCUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I had a dollar for everytime I've been asked \"Is that your phone?\"Yes, it is my phone.  It is also my alarm clock, calculator, ebook reader, camera, email, gps, mp3 player, video player, portable harddrive, etc, etc.As a phone it is big.  My reality is that I stopped holding a telephone handset up to my ear about 10 years ago- I'm either on speaker, on BT headset, or BT in the car.  That being said I probably use my phone as a phone less than 10% of its total average daily usage.  The other 90% is surfing, emailing, texting, e-book and e-magazine reading.  For that 90% the 7 inch display is absolutely worth it.I'm about the average sized guy, 5'10\", 185 pounds.  I wear a 42 jacket, and 32x34 jeans.  The galaxy tab fits in the back pocket of my jeans, it fits in the front pocket or cargo pocket on my cargo pants.  I have to take it out of my pocket when I sit down- I had to take my htc, droid, g2, and galaxy S out of my pocket too- no change.  It fits in an inside pocket of a sport coat, blazer, or suit.  I think it actually fits better than the handset sized phones because it fills the pocket rather than settling to the bottom and sliding back and forth.It is not 4G.  That is a good thing- unless you have totally and truly unlimited data.  When I used a phone with 4G I tended to use up the first 5GB in about 10 days.  My carrier then throttles my bandwidth to what seemed like 2g speeds- it was terrible.  With 3G being my cap, it limits the amount of things I try to do that are bandwidth consumptive.  I use about 5GB a month at 3G speed without getting throttled.It is a GSM phone, that means you have to use a GSM carriers SIM card.  I have never had a problem with my carrier having a problem with me using a device that I didn't buy from them.  The carriers name doesn't start with an A.  I had the A carrier before, they were always a problem using now carrier provided devices.  I don't know if that has changed, but Im not willing to go back to them.  Prepaid SIMS are no problem- they all are just re-sold airtime from the two US GSM carriersThe main reason you would buy this device over one from a us mobile carrier is that it does have voice-calls enabled.  The devices you buy from the US vendors have this one single App blocked out.  I believe this is to get you to carry around two devices with two data plans and yes- collect more money.  I believe that the 7 inch platform is the most all around useful.  I believe that if the US mobile carriers would sell voice-call enabled 7 inch tablets they would become much more common.Yes, I am that guy with a huge \"phone\"  I appreciate having a tablet that is not dependant on wifi.  In fact I probably would not enjoyt a 7in tablet without mobile network.  I appreciate that that I can actually make or take the occasional phone call with my tablet- for everything else that there is an App for I want the most screen real-estate that I can fit in my pocket.  As compared to an IPad mini- the shape is also right.  The IPad mini is wider (5.3 in x 7.87 in) which means it doesnt fit in my pocket.  Reading books on the mini is odd due to this screen shape as well.  The Tab at 4.8 in x 7.6 in, like the Kindle and the Nook is the right shape, familiar and comfortable, like an old paperback.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "High Performance", "Author": "Troy L.

Big mistake.I had read most all the reviews before buying, but some important facts were left out.Anyhow, aside from being pretty kludgy - slow on internet, temperamental touchscreen, LOUSY battery life..the worst part is that even with a 32G SD card installed you cannot download movies from Google Play onto the external storage, so at best, you can download maybe 1 movie to internal storage, and hope there is enough memory left so it can play.When I took a flight 2 weeks ago the movie just locked up the Tab [not enough memory].Tried to research this problem [no download onto ext SD], but no viable results were found. I had this same experience with an HP netbook running Linux about 5 years ago  ..absolutely no support...you're on your own with any problems. Just gave it away. Guess I will do the same with the Tab too.So Apple, your share price can recover now [weirdly enough the stock tanked the day my Tab arrived in October] ...I am back after wasting almost $450 with shipping and taxes on the Galaxy Tab.I think Samsung is mucking up its chances of competing with Apple on the tablet market by having too many models and no service.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simcard slot has a micro sd inside.", "Author": "EDCREATIVE", "ReviewID": "R2WL3RCA97DBTG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was posted new but it was used.

I don't have to depend on silly iTunes to put my songs and books on my tab. The best part is the built in phone. Though it turns heads when I answer a phone call.7 inch screen is good enough for reading books and watching videos. I use Kies(free download @ samsung.com) to move my stuff to the tab. On the tab I can either use file manger to browse books/music or I can directly use Adobe/Ploaris to open PDFs and music player to play my mp3s.When I try to copy mp4 videos to tab, Kies issues a warning that \"This video may not play\", but after downloading to tab, it plays without any glitches.Camera on this tab is though not top notch but still works optimally and images though have some noise are still OK. If you want to use the tab as a dedicated camera, then you have simply bought a wrong device. Videos shot with this tab too are similarly of acceptable quality.I also use Fongo, a phone app for making phone (VOIP) calls on this tab and you can't tell the difference between using GSM phone or this app. The switch is seamless. It provides you an option of either choosing a default phone, built-in or the phone app, or you can choose before dialling which one you would like to use. For incoming calls, it automatically routes the call to either builtin phone or the Fongo app. I am almost thinking of getting rid of my GSM phone and just getting a data plan and use Fongo as may main phone. Just FYI Fongo is a great free app for making free phone calls to Canadian numbers in most major Canadian cities.Since now Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.0 has been announced, I am waiting eagerly for it.

So after my budget had reached the $400 level, I finally sold her on the tablet angle. This tablet also seemed perfect since she was always deep in her phone and didnt have internet access at her apartment. So I thought it would be good if she could use her data plan with the tablet.When the tablet arrived, we were both lost and it seemed like a big let down (especially since this was both of our first experience with a tablet). After a few hours, however, we quickly learned how to use the built-in apps and add other apps. It was just awesome. I can't tell you how bad I wanted to keep it for myself.
