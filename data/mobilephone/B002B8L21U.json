My opinion of the phone gets better and better first after I set it up also when I find new apps and with Nokia updates (more about that later). The Symbian OS works well for me, some other reviews say it is outdated but I have had very few problems with it. I base my opinion after the updates I have received from Nokia which honestly have helped it a lot. This phone was made for work, but I still have fun with it. The dual setup is fantastic for setting it up with 2 personalities, one is my fun side, and the other is all work. The keyboard is very user friendly, I like it a lot more than all the touch screens I have used in the past. It is set up in a very logical manor and very easy to shift from letters to numbers.Pros:Dual setup - You can switch between two modesSolid keyboardSetup wizards make it easy to set up the phone as well as email, internet phone, etc...WIFI saves $$ if you don't have unlimited data, not to mention faster than 3GNavigation (GPS)Cons:Battery life is short when surfing or using some gamesChrome trim doesn't like to be dropped!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
