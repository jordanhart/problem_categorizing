Phone completely doesn't work.  I bought the phone about a month ago.  Haven't even had the phone for a month because the shipping took so long.  Which is fine but then after 20 days of use the phone stops working.  All I get is some person named  \"Lilly Lilly\"  responding to my messages once every 2 days telling me to send jpeg format.  I sent jpeg video in several different formats.  I even have a video of the issue on youtube.com.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73pjGeboN1IThis has been going on for weeks.  THL does not want to help or correct the issue.  All they do is say \"thank you\" for sending a message and hope you dont respond back.  I advise anyone NEVER TO BUY FROM THL.  There return policy is a LIE.  There customer service is a JOKE - to say the least.  I'm Laughing to hard when I think of there year warranty on there phone.  LIES LIES. The phone was cool for 20 days with jelly bean and a seemingly fast quad core.  However you are taking a RISK with quality.So I ask again,Why is that THL's customer service IS THE WORST???-PHONE DONT WORK after 20 days kids", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "impressive", "Author": "paul andrews", "ReviewID": "R2E1MKA3VNHGK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone.
