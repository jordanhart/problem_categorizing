{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone, be careful of your model and the misleading description", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R2814C2QU2HSBZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off -- I love this phone. The gaming controls are awesome to have and I use this for playing emulators mostly. I purchased this phone and am using it with Straight Talk.One thing to note! The description says this is an unlocked phone...this is a bit misleading because the phone is just \"sim unlocked\" which means you can use another sim card in the phone for a different carrier such as T-Mobile or Straight Talk. The phone itself still has AT&T; firmware/software on it so you will see the AT&T; boot up screen and there will be some unremovable applications on the phone that new AT&T; phones are programmed to have. They don't bother me and don't take up much space, but it would be nice if they weren't there in the first place.Another thing to note is that you can't get into the bootloader settings on this phone...so if you want to really change some settings on this phone or easily root it, you will have to do some more tricky stuff at the risk of bricking it.One of the downsides to this phone on Straight Talk is that I can only connect to the Edge network (2G) and not 3G in my area (which is supported). The reason for this is because I can't get into settings on the phone to change my network carrier to 3G T-Mobile (which is what I would use for data under Straight Talk)...I could do this if the phone was actually UNLOCKED, but it's not... Be wary of this if you are looking to buy the phone.I should also note that the phone I received was a model r800at, not r800a as listed (if it really matters).The phone itself runs pretty fast. Like I said, if you are looking at emulators with this phone, it's totally worth it, even with no 3G in my opinion. I have WiFi at home and work, and 2G is good enough for me when I'm traveling so I don't complain. My phone did not come with a 8gb mircosd card or headphones like a retail package. I ended up buying a 32gb card which is nice. Nintendo 64 emulated games will run a little slower depending on the game and Playstation games depend on the emulator, but that just gives you an idea of how well it can run games that aren't even meant for the platform.The phone could use more internal memory (512mb isnt much with so many new and big apps) and I found myself moving everything I could to the SDCard and installing smaller sized app alternatives. The battery could also last a lot longer, but I think I may buy a 3400mah version. The phone comes with a 1400mah battery.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone... items missing inside the box", "Author": "Darth Nihilus", "ReviewID": "R1R0AGU5UC0NMS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My review about the phone is 5 stars to it..
