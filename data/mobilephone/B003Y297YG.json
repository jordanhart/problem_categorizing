And my dog, OMG, my dogg. one time i left the battery holder thing on the couch cause i was gonna wipe my battery cuz it was wet, then i came back and my dog was EATING it. there's a chunk gone from it. I've dropped this phone in water 3 times. and it's still alive. Very high quality. It takesa while for all the keys to work, but rice isn't necessary. jst wipe the battery, hair dry it, and if it still doesn't work, put it in the oven for 20 minutes 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyway, it's good for texting. Features are ohkay, but it doesn't really matterr. this is definitely a good phone, for first timers because they like to drop their phones xD", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG T456 GRAVITY UNLOCKED GSM PHONE", "Author": "luvsteddybears", "ReviewID": "R11KO495Y11P72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SAMSUNG T456 GRAVITY UNLOCKED GSM PHONEI bought this as a replacement phone.. I had a gravity phone for a couple years and I accidently spilled something on it. So I ordered this phone because I knew that the phone itself was a great phone. The phone came rathr quickly. I had only one problem with it. I ordered the white gravity and ended up with a gray one. It even said gray on the box. I could have returned it but I decided not to because I needed a phone..But other than that everything was great.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "One INVINCIBLE Phone!", "Author": "My Pen  Name", "ReviewID": "R2SRRR7HDH3XNZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is WONDERFUL! It is very easy to use and I am very pleased with how it was. I happen to be very clumsy and I have dropped it like a million times and it never broke or slowed down or anything. That is why I would call it an invincible phone. The only problem that I had with this phone was that when I was texting, when I pressed a letter it would sometimes skip it or it would double or triple the letters, so for example, if I were to type \"bubble gum,\" it would go \"bbuuble gggum\" or \"uuble gm.\" I don't see this as a big problem, and it only started to happen about a year and a half after I purchased the phone. All in all, I give this phone a 4.7 out of five, 0.3 off because of the keyboard. This is a great phone for a younger phone user, a person who loves to text, a clumsy person, or a first time phone user.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ripoff", "Author": "S.

I'm ok with having two chargers, one for work, and one for home. Also, I ordered this phone on the 14th and it arrived on the 19th, 4 days before I was expecting it, which was good for me, because I dropped my previous phone in the toilet :( but I like this phone a lot, and will update this review if anything new comes to light.

I dropped my phone multiple times a day, it went through the washer twice and my dog tried eating it- it is nearly indestructible. When my phone finally died I was determined to buy another. The phone was delivered on the expected arrival date and it was in great condition. No scratches on the front and there was still a screen protector on the phone. There were a few small, barely noticeable scratches on the back but that's to be expected when buying used phones. The only thing that bothered me was it was not EXACTLY the same as the phone I was replacing and it won't let me set it on vibrate. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Gravity", "Author": "J. Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R27F795QLSQXMC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Works  OK.

The keyboard is great for small hands and I've dropped it dozens of times without a cover, and it still works. Now, it's been down one toilet and into one pail of dirty water. It takes a licking and keeps on ticking! Cons: it sometimes turns itself off, it sometimes doesn't save numbers. Love my text screen, although not a fashionable phone, does need more memory to store old texts.

Excellent sliding qwerty keyboard, perfect for texting2. Good basic features3. Good looking4. Inexpensive5. Prepaid locked (T-mobile) version can be unlocked (by T-mobile) and will then work on any GSM network worldwide.Cons:1. Now an old model2. No firmware updates available3. No synching features with Mac4. Occasional software glitch where incoming call is mis-labled as a different address book item (usually the last text message)5. Pressing alt-key to get symbols in texts doesn't revert to regular text unless you click it again. If you forget you get a string of symbols. If you hold down the delete key to try to back up to where the symbols begin, the entire text message is lost.Bottom line: Good basic phone especially for texters. Minor glitches.Other comments: Using this phone now for over a year and have been happy with it. Bought it at a brick and mortar store as a prepaid Tmobile phone, but also works fine with Tmobile postpaid accounts.

It works great no problems thus far. The only thing is it came with a rather weird charger. I have to plug in a peice thats a adapter for it to go in the wall and its so bulky it doesnt stay in. Its a bit of a problem for me. Plus i don't wanna loose part of my charger! As far as service it was hell to get the product to me because something I did not do. But something happened with shipping where my address was not written down correctly. The funny thing is I was ordering a phone because I didnt have one. I put a friends number down for this phone I had ordered but my number down for a previous order. Yet they left me voicemails on my phone about the samsung? As for as communication they didn't do too good, i was just being thrown around in circles by UPS and the Seller.

Also, when I hang up, I have to press the \"end\" button like three times before the thing will recognize my command.But you know, the design is just fine. It's an attractive little bugger, and easy to use.
