This is a great basic phone strictly for making calls and texts. It doesn't come with any minutes (except 10 bonus minutes for activation) but you can buy these cards pretty much anywhere that sells prepaid cards. The minutes are THE cheapest of any prepaid service and your minutes roll over each month. AWESOME! The phone doesn't look cheap at all. It is shiny, sleek and modern looking. The best deal on cards is the 300 minutes for $30 and 60 days of service. Thats $15 a month. Texts only use half a minute of time! One of the best things is that Net10 uses the AT&T; network so you are covered everywhere and they don't charge roaming charges! If you are thinking of getting pre-paid service go with Net10, it is the best hands down!", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for what it is...", "Author": "Isabelle Belzile", "ReviewID": "R2HKL3KUKAGVUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone as a temporary substitute after my Blackberry died, and I couldn't find any of my old cell phones. For $15 retail it's great for what it is: a cheap, no contract, disposable phone. No fanciness here to distract you. No pesky camera or Bluetooth or web access to trick you into thinking it's somehow high end. It does phone calls and text messages, and not much of anything else. Ok that's not quite true. It has a tip calculator, a regular calculator, alarm clock, stopwatch, unit convertor (miles to kilometers, feet to meters, etc) and (wait for it) sudoku and Battle Reversi. In all it's very reminiscent of cell phones, circa 2003 or so. Battery life is utterly phenomenal though. I've carried the phone around all day, making a number of phone calls, and the phone was not only still alive, but instructed me to disconnect the charger almost immediately as the battery was full. Quite a contrast to modern smartphones. The charger is standard micro USB and interchangeable with most other new phones. Net10's actual phone service is a function of the networks they piggyback on, AT&T; and T-Mobile in the case of this phone. I activated the phone on Net10's website, thus avoiding dealing with their human based customer service, so I can't speak to that experience.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value!", "Author": "L. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R95HZAKP7BCQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For someone who uses less than 100 minutes per month, $56 a month (Amazing how that $39.99 monthly fee blossoms to over $56 after taxes and fees!) for ATT's cheapest plan was too much. Now I spend $15 a month for 200 minutes and have had no problems. It also has the loudest ringer of any phone I've ever had, which is great when I have the stereo turned up in my truck! Great value for someone who just wants a basic phone to carry and doesn't use it much.ONE YEAR LATER....This phone is still going perfectly after all the banging around it gets in the console of my truck - awesome!", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible customer service", "Author": "Albert B", "ReviewID": "R3BCXKS9ZXIOVD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would not recommend any Net 10 phone if you think that you will ever need any type of customer service (eg activate phone, transfer phone number, buy minutes).  I have spent over 2 weeks on the phone every day with Net 10.  They have sent me 4 sim cards because every person I speak to inputs the incorrect info into their system.  I feel like I am speaking to high-school drop-outs who weren't able to get a job and hence are working as \"managers\" at Net 10.If you doubt this, do some internet searching for Net 10 customer service.  If you think you are getting a bargain for a cheap phone or phone plan, it's because you are purchasing something that has zero future value.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unless you get it for around $10, you just got ripped off", "Author": "Hao Zhang", "ReviewID": "R2775N72M5A9YB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was actually my first phone. My dad bought it for me from Wal-Mart when I had to go to a conference in another city. This phone is about as basic as you can get these days, so it's good for kids under 10 years old that just need emergency contact. You MUST find this phone somewhere else for around $10, any higher would just be a ripoff (unless it comes with a bunch of accessories) because this phone doesn't do much.Let's look at the phone's physical form. The front has the small LCD screen and the keys. The left side has the micro USB port for charging (you cannot put anything on this phone). The top left corner of the phone has the hole for a lanyard/wrist strap. There is no speakerphone, so you must do all your listening from the earpiece on the front. Well, that's it really, there's not much stuff to gasp about for this phone other than the simplicity and the low price.The phone has basic features such as voice calling, contacts, text messaging, tools (alarm clock, calendar, notepad, calculator, tip calculator, world clock, stopwatch, unit converter), and a few mini games such as Sudoku and Reversi to keep you company if you are literally dying of boredom. You CANNOT put ANYTHING on this phone, so no custom ringtones, no apps, no games, no custom wallpapers, nothing. The phone has about 30 polyphonic ringtones preloaded, which sounds tinny and not the best. The call quality is surprisingly well, so if you want a phone JUST for calling, and maybe a few text messages here and there, this is a good phone. You can text with this phone using T9 prediction, so you don't have to keep pressing the same key to type a specific letter.This phone cannot browse the web, or do anything that uses data. It is a simple cellphone, so do not expect it to do anything more than calling and texting. The reception on this phone is pretty great, but not phenomenal. The battery has a capacity of 950mAh, which can last for about a week if you leave it on standby. If you need a phone that does a little more, go with something like the LG900G or other flip phones that NET10 offers. This phone is good for backup/spare/emergency purposes, which is great for parents with kids under 10 years old.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "5/5 for Phone, 3/5 for Company", "Author": "Gar Polky", "ReviewID": "R1S7GJG9EGKQC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 5 of 5 rating is for the Phone.  I'd give the company a 3 of 5.I was already a Net10 customer when I dropped my phone and half broke the screen.  I decided on this phone because it was the same manufacturer and was cheap.  There was a bit of a learning curve on re-adapting if you are used to a different phone, but it has all the basic extras.There is one problem, and I'm not sure if it's Net10 or the phone, but when I receive a text message from an iPhone that includes emoticons or special characters (\u00b0) then text message uses the iPhone character limit of 74 instead of the normal 160.  This is a bit annoying, but hasn't even cost me a full dollar yet and a heads up to friends can curtail this a bit.  Also the emoticons show up as question marks, so no, you don't even get to see them for the extra price.The company is a bit user unfriendly in my opinion.  When I tried to use their website to transfer my number and minutes, I was redirected back to my profile page with no further links and I had to call support to get the number transferred.  Took less than 5 minutes for the transfer to take effect though.  I also called support about the character limit problem and after several hours on the phone I was told my phone was charging me correctly per each incoming text.  After I did the math on the extra cost, I just decided to drop it.  And I feel like a sleaze for saying this, but I do wish their support wasn't in India.  Most of the support I've talked to have really heavy accents so I can't understand them, and if I try to get help through email, I'm given a number to call at.  Also, for a while the 300 minute 60 day cards were an endangered species in my county so I had to do some hunting to find them.But for $15 a month, you really can't complain that much.Also, despite the Tracfone symbol on the face, the phone WILL WORK with Net10.

I am not crazy about Net10 customer service, but I hung with them when I reactivated my phone because I needed something affordable. This phone works really well..at work or in a store. Nothing fancy, just talk and text, of which I don't do much of. It has a nice loud alarm clock ring, a voice message noise & indicator, a few pretty scenes for the display and great battery life. I only paid $15.00 for it at Walmart. I used to be with Verizon, but their prices are too high. The 750 minutes for $25.oo is excellent...and I don't even use them all.

The alarm clock doesn't have a repeat alarm feature, in case you would want the alarm clock to go off at the same time everyday.  If you want instructions for the calendar feature, forget about it.  At best you'll get the basic instructions for the phone, but nothing specific about such features.  Also--NO ONE is interested in creating an adaptor that would allow a person to at least use a headset with the phone.  And, there is nothing available in any stores that has any hopes of working with this model.  I've even contacted the manufacturer, which is LG.  Even LG begs off on this issue!  Their excuse is that none of the contractors who sell this make and model asks LG for the adaptor or a headset specifically for this phone.  Guess what the contractors say?  They say to contact the manufacturer!  While I'm not using this phone through Net10, that's really not the point here.  If you are in the situation where this is the only choice you have for a cell phone, you'll still get absolutely nowhere if you want any added features, should you even try to purchase such features on your own.As a pro, as a basic everyday phone, it is a good phone.  But, the supposed \"added\" features that come with it--DON'T WORK for the average person!To LG:  Not everyone wants or needs a Bluetooth just to have a headset device for their cellphone.  Some of us just want something that's actually affordable and doesn't have all the issues with it that I keep hearing people who have bluetooth devices talking about.  Enough already!
