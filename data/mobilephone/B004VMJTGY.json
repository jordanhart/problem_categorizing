This phone has freakin powerpoint on it, I mean COME ON, amazing!!! To make the story short, I took the phone for a test drive and checked for it's pros and cons.Pros- Very clear and loud call quality, easy for texting, very organized, long lasting battery, lots of apps to keep you occupied, amazing camera, very fast, durable.Cons-you could get lost using this phone, so much to do. blue-tooth sync is a bit complicated. no flash but, no biggy. lots of software that you will eventually need to install. setting everything up is a pain, but well worth it. And my contacts are set to go last name to first for some reason, but I'll figure out how to fix that setting later.After I showed my mom the ropes, she learned how to use the phone's basics, but I'm telling y'all this...it's a windows phone so it will naturally come with lots of stuff. My mom later bought me the amazing Imagio, because my little Sony ericsson had horrible call quality, I couldn't hear a thing, just loud and crackly.I'm very impressed with this phone, and glad that we could find it for such a good price. I just hate how some people compare everything to the stupid i phone, like they have nothing else in their lives to do but purchase apps. This phone is a challenge but one of the best I've ever seen or used. I give it 5 stars.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "HTC imagio unlocked phone", "Author": "E.

It is not an Iphone but for the price, I am not complaining.  I purchased my phone from \"OEM.\"  After I placed the order, I kept checking my Amazon acount to see if my phone had been shipped.  Much to my chagrain, it took \"OEM\" three days before they shipped it.  I received my phone almost a week later.  So far, I was not complaining, I am an easy person to please.  I opened my box and I was so excited.  The phone had some blemished on the screen and it was a refurbished one (not the new phone that I had originally purchased).  I was not upset (at least not yet).  I checked the slip.  The phone I bought was with a US warranty, the one I received had no warranty on the slip.  I checked the paper, much to my surprise, the phone was not intended for me; however, it was for somebody else who lived in Florida (guys, I live in Virginia).  I had all the information of this other person in my hands.  This is a serious security breach.  People can steal other people's identities.  So I sent an email to OEM.  It took them 3 days to answer.  Mr. Scott (I think that was his name) sent me an email telling me to \"advise him of what I wanted!!!\"  SO I am still following up with him.  The phone is fine.

Made 28 phone calls so far and did some web surfing and multimedia stuff and still has 40% battery remaining! Sound quality is exceptional because it's loud and crispy clear as if the person on the other end is standing right next to you talking to you. I think overall music/call quality on this phone is well functioned. Try listen to the MP3 musics that came with this device and you'll know what I am talking about. Resolution 400X480 on a 3.6 inch screen is on par with some of the best resolution phones on the market. In addition, you can set more than one alarm with this phone. Aside from multimedia, work/business features are great. I've tried using Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on this device (which are all built-in already) and they work very smooth so far!The only concern, if I have to pick one, is that the phone is not compatible with Blackberry HS 300 version 2.1 bluetooth, which I owned before as my previous phone is a Blackberry. It could be due to the fact that Blackberry bluetooth are more tailored towards Blackberry devices and thus not compatible with some HTC phones. It does work with the Blackberry Premium Stereo Headset though, which is nice!Other than this very minor issue, I call the HTC Imagio a superior smartphone. :D", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "HTC Imagio on ATT network", "Author": "Leonid Zolotarev \"leo\"", "ReviewID": "R1K99XN7ZQTKWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone came in an excellent condition (brand new)one day before it was supposed to arrive.

I agree with a prior reviewer who mentioned that the phone has a slow processor. I would also add that the WI-FI does not seem to work nicely, but the reason may also be the same: processor. Other than that, it is a pretty good phone for the price (I paid 129 dollars and 5 dollars for shipping and handling).

Would require taking out battery and rebooting the phone to get a signalphone automatically downloaded any pictures viewed on the web or Facebook, ect.Very easy to unlock this phone, which led to an unprecedented amount of \"Butt dialing\" at least 50 in the few months I had it.Texting worked great but the auto correct was far to ambitious with its assumed word choice. For instance, I would type \"Le\" and it would auto fill in \"Legitimate\" Not that i never used that word, but it jumps the gun a little to quickly.Toward the end of this phones very short life it began to give me random \"calibration tests\" nearly every time I wanted to use the phone. It was completely inoperable until the test (up to 5 min) was complete.They make listening to your messages a task.Once again I will say that this phone was really great for the first 6-8 months, after the \"meltdown\" all of the cons started to pop up. Did put this phone through several different sim cards which may have has something to do with it.To this phones credit I did put it through a lot of serious use and it really did take some abuse. But for the serious phone user, I would not recommend.For those who would be purely using this as a phone for calls and occasional texts, this is a good buy.
