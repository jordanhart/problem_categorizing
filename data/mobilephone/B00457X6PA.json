I have been a Nokia fan for more than 9 years now, all Nokia phones(and 1 Samsung to be honest!). i was looking 4 another Nokia since i lost mine on a plane last month, then i saw this one & it was love from first sight! Stylish, cute, but don't let it fool u!This phone is far more capable than you think, I could easily compare it to any HTC or iphone!i tried the iphone not the HTC though..1st the screen is gr8, the touch is soo smooth, difficult if you have big hands though, if you have big hands then dont buy it, you won't be able to enjoy this phone. the full keybord is really good, the Android market..what can i say...endless fun & applications...the camera has really good photos, the phone is sooo handy...though i gave it 5 stars coz i got it for less than this price from a friend..but for its real price ( $250 ) i would give it 4 stars..still good *edit* the screen after a couple of month is rather smaller than it should!unless u like small stuff, when u compare this screen to an htc aria(3.2\" instead of the 2.6' on this phone) the difference is HUGE !Nothing is perfect of course, the cons:- the battery lasts for only a day, a full complete day if you install application killer from the market also when u use the battery power app, it was installed on my phone as well, it lets u control the bluetooth, wifi, background data and LCD light all in 1 touch which is so convenient.- the 2nd problem was the bluetooth, u can't receive and send files through bluetooth except if you install the bluetooth app from the market, which isn't gr8 as well *edit* upgrade to 2.1 version solved this problem ( but i wouldn't recommend this upgrade over all, it slowed the phone down a bit)These were the only problems i found till now ( after almost 2 weeks)..i hate those bulky new phones they are releasing everywhere, so this just so conveneient 4 mebottom line, if you are ok (better,if u like them!)with small phones, and want one capable of doing ALL the smartphones do, then buy this one..but if you have a problem dealing with small LCD or charging the phone almost everyday (which i was used to do the past 3 years withh all my Nokia phones, the N80, N85 & N97 mini!) then it is gonna be hard 4 u to get used to it!*edit* The plastic-look of this phone( even though some might like it) takes down its rating, even for the price! when u take the back cover off, u see a slim phone that would have looked gr8 with a metal back or something, also could have been much slimmer, instead Sony Ericsson added a curved plastic back that adds real bulk to the phone for no reason! this takes the rating even to less than the 4 stars given!", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R3S6X5XCZKAT7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this!!!Nice and easy interface, great 5 MPX camera with led flash.

NOT", "Author": "C. Popovich \"Addicted to Reading\"", "ReviewID": "RRZRKUMPFXWFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was a huge disappointment.The 5 MP camera is slow and the pictures are not 5 MP quality. The flash on this camera is so blinding!! I took a photo of myself not knowing and saw spots in my vision for an hour. The pictures are blurry if you or the person you are taking a picture of move even the slightest bit. I didn't get a single decent photo at all.The qwerty keyboard buttons are stiff. Maybe in time they would work better but I wont be finding that out.The buttons and menu were tricky to figure out. I couldn't send picture messages at first. Had to go through all sorts of trouble to set it up. Then sending the pictures from my phone to someone else- they received the pics all messed up with half the pic \"grayed\" out.After all this I go to answer a call today and cannot hear the person at all- yet they can hear me? I clicked speaker phone and that's the only way I could hear them. I'm not even bothering to figure that out.Then I tried making calls and they were not going through. Texts stopped going through. I have no clue what's wrong.Phone is being returned! I won't get Sony phones ever again.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love these phones!!!", "Author": "E.

There were another variants too, which were cheaper but I've selected and bought this phone because of its color.Today it came in my country, I have taken but it is not RED. It is black. Even though the information showed that it was a red phone. I am unable to send it back to you, because it's impossible to send from my country, they didn't allow me. I've been you client for so long, and i really loved shopping on your site, but now I am very disappointed and I don't think to buy anything else on your site. My friends who were your clients too, have decided not to buy on your site because of my big disappointment. Please, try your best to compensate me or send me the phone I've seen on the pictures and I wanted to have.Thank you in advance.Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 Mini Pro (U20i) Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone with 5MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Touch Screen, QWERTY Keyboard--International Version with No US Warranty (Red)", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Missing Black Back Cover", "Author": "Progressychedelic", "ReviewID": "R1H2MKI5Y2T8QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the order with no problem.
