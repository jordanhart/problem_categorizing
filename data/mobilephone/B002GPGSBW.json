I have dropped it many times, it is durable.Nice looking as well. I have an 'issue' with texting and having to do upper case manipulations which is necessary. Needs to be charged every day. Decent sound though I tend to like using the speaker. The keys are a bit small..overall a good phone/PDA>", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "False advertisement", "Author": "Unhappy Customer", "ReviewID": "R2174AG2IIR2E0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone (for $159) because it was advertised as NEW.
