{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nokia C3-00 -  The BEST phone for an affordable price!", "Author": "Magpie", "ReviewID": "R2AJTYCRH0E75G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone after my old one stopped working. Because of that I wanted to buy a phone truly worth the money, and one that would last.For someone who isn't willing to pay for 3G service, but still wants internet, and a modern looking phone, THIS is the perfect cell phone. Phones like this are very hard to come by because most do require data packages (the ones considered smartphones anyway). I can't say how it compares to a smartphone having never owned one, but for someone like me it's perfect.- QWERTY keyboard is well spaced, text messaging capabilities are wonderful- WIFI! Can I stress how important this is? It's probably the best feature of the phone. Wi-Fi is pretty much everywhere nowadays, so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with Wi-Fi capabilities for a much lower price, and without having to buy a data plan?I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery lasts about 3-4 days and that's with a good number of hours using it (mostly texting or listening to music).So if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only functions great but LOOKS great, this is the phone for you. Best $120 I ever spent!", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone but a little work for the AT&T; users!!", "Author": "Chad's Opinion", "ReviewID": "R2N7LVNPXOHOUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off I love the phone after I got everything figured out.  Basically all I had to do was pop my sim card out of my existing (AT&T; Customer) phone and I was good to go, sort of! lol  From that point I could call my contacts, send text messages, and even connect to the internet via wifi.  Now the problems I discovered shortly there after was it connected to the wifi but could not go to any webpages because it would time out.  It would not even go to the nokia pre-loaded store icon on the phone.  Well, I could tell that there was settings not configured somewhere because it is unlocked for different carriers and needed at&t; settings entered.  Another problem I encountered was I could send text and recieve them just fine but could not recieve or send pictures with text messages succesfully.  That was aggrevating because I could do that with my old phone just fine, but not this one.  I found the solutions to fix these problems on-line after searching for awhile.  So if you want these problems fixed here they are:MMSMenu > Settings > Configuration > Personal Settings > Options > Add New > Multimedia MsgAccount Name:  AT&T; MMSServer address:  [...]Use pref.

I'm not going to repeat the technical specifications. It is very light, portable and has excellent battery life. You can talk for a really long time. Make sure to turn off WIFI when it's not being used. This phone is perfect for everyday use, or as a backup or a second phone. I love the FM radio.It also makes a decent gift.I would recommend it over any carrier branded phone.

Redman \"American Patriot\"", "ReviewID": "R217HVXO62KX4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product.  It's small, but feels solid in your hand.  Has a GREAT battery.  I text a lot and I was used to having to charge my battery daily.  With this phone, the battery lasts AT LEAST two days, and that's with heavy texting and limited internet usage.  Well constructed.  Shows conversational style text.  You can attach ringtones and photos to your contacts.  You can set up recurring appointments. It has an alarm which works really well. You can use up to an 8GB micro SD card with it.  If you have AT&T; service (which I do) you need to know how to configure it so that you can receive multimedia (picture) messages and access the internet. I have the instructions for the configuration, which I will enter below.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good phone, but doesn't want to pay for a 'smart phone'. You can get unlimited data (internet) usage for $10/month (again, AT&T;) versus $25/month for what they consider to be a 'smart phone'.  Okay, it isn't blazing fast on the internet (uses Edge rather than 3G or 4G), but it's fast enough for me.  I don't actually use it for the internet a lot because I prefer to use my computer for that.  Multimedia messaging works great. It does everything I want it to do and I've been used to using the Samsung Blackjack II and Jack. I've been a cell phone user since 1995.  Again, I highly recommend this product.

Phan \"yimnvs\"", "ReviewID": "R166D1K0Z72BOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you know what you are getting, then this phone will pretty much keep you satisfied. If you are expecting full feature smart-phone capabilities, then you will be very sorry. One shouldn't expect all those feature for this price. Fair enough?- WiFi for under $100? Wi Freaking Fi!!! No phone to my knowledge at this price range has that. Useful to check my email and do some light informative surfing on the web at hotspots.- This phone has the same battery as my Nokia Xpressmusic 5800 but lasts two to three times longer since this isn't a touch screen. With light use, my phone can last a week before charging again.- Cannot multi-task; which means you would be able to use one program at a time. You need to close an app to use another. No biggie, I knew that.- Qwerty fairly easy to use after getting used to. All buttons are nicely lit for night use.- Symbian S40 is the handicapped version of Symbian S60. It is basic and easy to use but lack the additional tools of S60. Once again, I knew what I was getting.- Has access to Ovi store to download free apps and games.- Call quality is clear and it does not drop calls. Sound is crisp and clear.- Good and nice bright screen.- Camera has no flash, but pretty decent quality for a 2MP phone camera. I don't expect Nokia N8 picture quality.- Micro SD card slot is on the side and not under the battery like some phones.- No physical volume control button. Can turn off some people. For me, I can just use the on screen volume control.- Decent build quality.- Just for reference, I compared this phone side by side with my friend's iPhone 4 and this Nokia phone is smaller in size.- Unlocked. Popped in my T-mobile simcard and I was good to go.Got this phone as a temporary phone for now after losing my main cell-phone. I will upgrade when I have more money down the road.Once again...know what you are getting and you will be happy with this product. Don't expect this phone to be something more than an entry level smart phone. This phone gets the job done for me and it looks great.

I thought that for $120 on Amazon, that the Nokia C3-00 was a steal that combined a good amount of features like wi-fi and EDGE network access and custom shortcuts balanced with a reasonable and frugal price, so I got it.When the phone arrived, it was as simple as just swapping the SIM cards (as it usually is with any GSM phone, and some newer CDMA phones) from my old phone with the Nokia C3-00; I still wasn't able to use picture messaging, but I was sold on the Wi-Fi, the EDGE network support and the Mail and Contacts custom shortcuts.I started doing some occasional internet browsing with the phone; while not all websites are available or nicely viewed on the phone, Google Mobile adapted most of the webpages to be viewed with the phone. While on Wi-Fi I was able to attain speeds of 1500 kbps (kilobits). The phone was UNLOCKED !!!! I was finally going to be able to run Gmail and Google Maps without having to get a Blackberry or an iPhone, and it did so beautifully (read the instructions on how to use Google maps, otherwise you'll be a little frustrated when trying to pan in/out and zoom in/out the map).One good day TMOBILE sent me an update, and the phone did ask me if I wanted to apply the update, but I must have pressed the wrong key and it applied the update which rendered my phone unable to do all the nice things that it was able to do before: I was left with a boring gray background, only the Nokia ringtone left to choose, the custom shortcut keys no longer worked (couldn't even choose something else for them to do), and clicking on the browser did nothing.To cut a long story short, I called Tmobile asking them why they were sending updates to my phone...they were not aware. They told me that they couldn't provide me with much support since I had bought the phone from somebody else...that's perfectly understandable.I was however expecting good customer support from Nokia and they failed to deliver: I called a total of 5 times that solved nothing, and in between those calls, Nokia would advice every time to contact T-Mobile to provide me with values to access the web..I just couldn't get them to understand that it was the applications that failed to respond. I was asking to return the phone to its factory OS condition. They got me to update the phone from OS version 4 to 8, but did nothing either.I am looking now at going to some sort of Android OS phone....Symbian is just dead and you can't get as much info.The phone itself is a nice one, but since I assume that you'll be buying it to run on either AT&T; or T-Mobile, I just wanted to warn you about what could happen to you, and complain about the poor Nokia support", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"Smartphone Features\" Without the Annoying Contract", "Author": "Kinetix50 \"---kinetix50\"", "ReviewID": "R293DPC7S58H5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing. For $120, Nokia really hit the nail on the head this time.Wi-Fi:This is probably my favorite feature of the phone. While most phones that have Wi-Fi are smartphone and require a data plan from the carrier, this phone doesn't. It has wi-fi, but it's NOT a smartphone. This is a great feature for those of us who want to browse the internet or check email, without being tied to an annoying contract. And let's face it, there's wi-fi almost everywhere now so finding a connection shouldn't be hard. The wifi is fast a reliable on this phone, and it's just so convenient.Screen:The screen is terrific for such a budget phone. The resolution isn't crazy high, but it's very crisp and easy to read. As far as I know, there is no option to adjust the brightness of the screen, but that's not a big problem because the brightness is perfect for all situation. Even in sunlight, the screen is remarkably readable.Battery Life:I only go the phone yesterday, so I really don't know about the battery life. According to other websites, however, it has 7 hours or talk time. Not impressive, but still pretty good. It also depends on if your wi-fi is turned on and stuff like that.UI (Interface):This phone uses the Nokia S40 use interface. This interface is pleasantly simple, yet has all the features you need. There are a few apps that come preloaded onto the phone, but whenever I try to go to the OVI Store, it says this phone is not compatible. This might be an issue with the browser or maybe the phone just ISN'T supported. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem because people shouldn't buy this phone expecting an iPhone. The phone also gives you easy access to your favorite social networks from the homescreen, which I find a great feature paired with the included wi-fi (I don't have a data plan).QWERTY Keyboard:The keyboard is perfect. The keys may a little small and intimidating, but even for those of us who have thick fingers, typing will become a breeze. The keys are stiff enough to prevent accidental presses, but at the same time, they are easy to press. Perfect combination, eh? Also, I've noticed that on a lot of phones, the keys make a loud *click* noise when they're pressed. This phone barely even makes a noise. I would have to say that the navigation pad above the QWERTY keyboard is a little \"loud\" at first, especially the directional pad, but you soon get used to it.Text Messaging:I couldn't be happier with the texting experience on this phone. The messages are displayed in a conversational manner for each contact, and you can even assign the dedicated e-mail key to go to the conversations (texting) screen. I find this really helpful because it let's me keep track of who I was talking to and what I was talking to them about.Email:The email on this phone is good. The \"app\" takes about 6 seconds to load up after you press \"Mail\" in the menu, but then it's pretty quick. You can have multiple accounts, and all you have to input is you username and password. The phone does the rest, so no need to find the server addresses and ports or whatever you need. I've never really had email on a phone, but I must say it's very convenient.Internet Browser:There are 2 internet browsers that I'm aware of. I have no idea what the default first one is called, but the second one is Opera Mini. I personally like the first one better better, and that's because you control the cursor with the directional keys, while in Opera Mini, you basically use them to select an element..... It's hard to explain. Also, the internet is fast if you have fast wifi. This phone only supports EDGE and GPRS, so no 3G. (YouTube works, but the videos only play in low resolution).Media Player:The media player is great on this phone, too. There are many different file formats that the phone can play. It can even play MIDI audio files (I've never seen that on a phone). My favorite part about the player is them including a 5-band equalizer. This equalizer greatly improves the sound quality. I have mine set to - left to right - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. The headphones that come with the phone aren't the greatest, so using a different pair would drastically improve the sound quality.Classy Look:This phone looks pretty awesome. The area around the screen is this plastic material but it's reflective so it's looks really luxurious. The battery cover is made of metal (aluminum I think), and that really gives it a \"heavy\", quality look. I actually ordered a case with the phone (Premium Crystal Skin Case for NOKIA C3 / Clear Tinted) and it fits perfectly, I highly recommend it. The keyboard is sort of a matte finish, and it makes the key comfortable to type on. The device as a whole is just gorgeous, and to be honest, it really looks like a \"Nokia BlackBerry\" or something. I really like the look.Camera:The camera is a 2 MP camera, with digital zoom, but no flash, and no auto-focus. The picture quality on the phone is average for phones in this price range. The pictures look like visual effects have been slammed onto them. I would recommend using the camera to take the occasional picture of somebody to put as a contact, but that's about it. The video camera is, I believe, QVGA resolution @20FPS, (or 15, not quite sure), which isn't great but it gets the job done.Call Quality:The sound quality of the phone is great. I've had no problem hearing anybody, and vice versa.--VERDICT--I would say the only flaw with this phone is that it doesn't make me sandwiches. But all kidding aside, I really do love this phone. My favorite features are the amazing QWERTY keyboard, the included wi-fi networking capabilities, and the threaded text messaging. What more could you want for a $120 phone that's not \"smart\" (hehe). The fact that it has wi-fi but isn't a smartphone is great. You can browse the internet without getting tied up in data plans and contracts and all that stuff because it's unlocked. The browsing experience is good, and the email is convenient. The social network integration to the home screen is great because you don't have to browse to the website or whatever. All-in-all, this is a great phone and I'm very happy I bought it. Oh yes, by the way, it makes calls. :PEDIT 2/5/2012 - Regarding the battery life, this phone has AMAZING battery life. In the review I said it was average, but after using it for a longer time, I can go 5 days with average/heavy use and still have 2/3 bars. It seems insane, but it's true. However, that might be due to the fact that I don't access AT&T;'s data features, which may drag the battery life down a bit if used frequently.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love It!!!", "Author": "Cayden'sMom", "ReviewID": "R1IZM0VHUNB28M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Couldn't find a phone with Wi-Fi for under $200 in The Bahamas but this one is awesome.

Sadly, there were just a handful of options, half of which were unappealing flip style phones that I used over 10 years ago.  AT&T; store personnel stated that AT&T; is intentionally driving existing customers to higher revenue smartphone and data plans and de-emphasizing messaging-only phones.*sigh*.  Thanks for reducing customer options AT&T.;So the search began to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones.  The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility.  In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T; would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system.  AT&T; said the phone's IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI's.  I've gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data plan charges were assessed.As for the phone itself, day-to-day use has been great.  Plugged my SIM card into it from the old phone (Pantech Link) and its worked beautifully right out of the box from day one.  No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work.  Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks.  Just don't expect an iPhone-type browsing experience.  It's basic but gets the job done.  Better than expected.  Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it's an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level.  Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception.  Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout.  I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good.  No dropped calls.  I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience.  It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well.  Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text.  You have to drill into the text to see it fully.  Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process.  I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I'd have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me.  At $99, it's priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement. It's a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value.

The phone is great.  It has good sound quality, useful features, good fit-and-finish.  The speakerphone works exceptionally well.  I searched around for a decently priced phone (you can get this unlocked for $120 shipped) that could sync my contacts, calendar and task list, would work as a tethered modem, could link to an email account and had web access.  This is what I ended up with.The down side is that the sync software offered by Nokia is total crap.  DO NOT use the Ovi Suite software if you need to sync your Outlook data - it has a nasty habit of overwriting your Outlook data file. If you are lucky, it will just create a mess.  If you are unlucky - well, I hope you backed up your data lately.  Much less problematic is Nokia's PC Suite - it is the predecessor to Ovi Suit.  It too has problems (I could only get it to sync 30 contacts at a time) but it is much less buggy.  The down side to PC Suite is that Nokia is abandoning its support/updates for this software.  Right now, there are plenty of forums that provide good answers to common problems.If this phone does not have the features you want go to phonescoop.com and click on the \"phone finder\" link.

I have left the phone on with bluetooth connectivity on and it has been 5 1/2 days on one charge with light phone and internet, I am down to one green bar on the battery but the thing still hasn't given me a low battery warning.  Battery life is awesome.I use t-mobile and since I have wifi at home and work I don't need a data plan.

The Nokia C3-00 is a great phone for beginners (people who have never owned a smartphone), people who are not very handy with all these technological things and also teens. I say teens because it gives a lot of room for things like social networking, pimping your favorite contacts and putting them on your screen with picture and all, keeping your mail and Facebook close (also on the screen).

I have nothing positive to say about the camera, but seriously, if that's my only complaint, then someone should give Nokia a prize for this thing.

It's not the ultimate mobile computing experience, so if that's what you're looking for then you need to look elsewhere. Personally, I look for my laptop. Anyway, two major features which smartphones have that this phone lacks are a GPS and office document support. Google SMS directions can substitute for a GPS, if you're in a bind. But if you need office documents you probably shouldn't be looking at this phone.It makes up for this in other ways, though. Its battery life is amazing. With data always on and a constant stream of SMS, it lasted 9 days for me. It's more battery life than I need, actually. That may be the only area where this phone goes above and beyond. And while S40 has terrible support for applications, it is probably the most stable phone OS available, which is good because I find the idea of a phone crashing to be ridiculous. But in practical terms this means the phone is very reliable.What more is there to say? Unlike many \"phones\" these days, it has a real keypad and it assumes that when you dial numbers your plan is to call someone.  This phone is not going to make you throw away your digital camera or your computer, which is just fine with me because I don't think a phone can replace those things.

My wife wanted a new phone to replace her old Motorola flip phone, and I asked her if she'd like to get one like mine. I use Consumer Cellular as my provider, and bought mine from them originally, but they no longer offer this phone, the Nokia C3-00. I tried buying her a Samsung smartphone, but it sucked the battery down in less than 2 days even with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Maps, etc. and other power hungry functions turned off. Also the Smartphone for some reason started using up my very limited data allowance I have with Consumer Cellular. I saw the Nokia C3-00 offered by Amazon as a brand new, unlocked phone for 110 bucks, so I jumped on it. When it arrived, I charged up the battery, put the SIM card in from my wife's other phone, and there it was. The greatest things about this phone are its simplicity and battery life. After charging my own C3-00, I usually get 8 days out of it with moderate use before the battery indicator goes from 4 bars to 3 bars, but I charge it again at 3 bars. The voice clarity is great too. Texting is fairly easy as it does have a QWERTY keyboard with alpha numeric and symbols. We are not big \"texters\" by any means, and I'm not sure if a \"power texter\" would like this, but maybe they would. It gets the job done. I did check the warranty status of the phone on Nokia's website, and the serial number came up as \"out of US warranty\", but emails back and forth from Amazon customer service says that my Amazon invoice as buying this as a new phone here in the US would cover it as being under warranty. I hope to never have to find out. The phone is brand new; it's just that these phones were produced and sold mainly in 2010 and 2011 I think. I guess this is what they may call \"old new stock\"?The firmware version of mine and my wife's phone is 3.65, and Nokia's OVI software suite when connected to the phone, says there is no newer version available for the phone. One more thing: both our phones have no obvious Wi-Fi connection choice under \"Settings/Connectivity\" menus. Love the phone anyway for the pluses I mentioned, and for me, there really are no negatives at all. It has all the features mentioned in Amazon's specs, but for email, I really do not remember seeing a \"dedicated email\" key, but email is doable under messages where you write a message, and then chose \"mail\" instead of \"number for the intended recipient. It may have been there before I customized the display layout and shortcut key assignments: yes, just checked it, and it is assignable as a shortcut to one of the keys.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "My second one.

The result is that you must have some type of a data plan to transmit the picture or video.

It was a touchscreen Samsung with a slide-out keyboard.  Because the phone unlocks if the slider is budged, there was no way to secure the phone from pocket dialing.  While I was camping one night the phone called 911 four times even though I had \"locked\" it.  I couldn't access my employer voicemail with this phone because it had no hard keys, and the screen keypad presented no pound sign (#) which is needed to get into my voicemail system.  And, if my cheek brushed the screen on other voicemail systems, it would activate a number on the screen causing the message to be deleted, passed, saved, etc.So I paid retail to my provider (GCI) for my next phone, an Alcatel qwerty candybar style phone.  Although I wanted a non-touchscreen phone, GCI only sells GSM texters that have touchscreen menu systems even if they have hard keys for texting and dialing.  This phone had a better locking scheme than the Samsung but it too was regularly defeated in my pocket (but it did not make spurious 911 calls).Both the Samsung and Alcatel are of high quality but I hate them for their touchscreens.So...A couple of months ago I bought the unlocked Nokia C3-00 phone from Amazon.  It is a dream compared to my other phones.  The radio has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it.  Call quality is excellent.  WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick.  I don't want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon \"Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer\" for about $10.  The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down.  It also muffles the Nokia's enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don't want to buzz the desktop.(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding.  So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod.  They are sufficient for providing the Nokia's superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I'm camping or fishing.

The other star is for how much I enjoyed using the phone's features: the keypad is great for texting, the screen is adequate for a non-smartphone, and the call quality, reception, and battery are fine. The problem with the phone is to do with its tone dialing error: e.g., if you dialed the 1800 number of your credit card company, and then on cue, dialed the 16-digit number of your credit card, then these numbers would just not be recognized by the machine at the other end. I tried this with a number of banks/cc-companies, and for me, this was a deal-breaker because I make international calls using a common network and after I had dialed into the network, I was never able to reach the specific number of the person I wanted to speak to.

BUT, due to his job, he's always banging himself (and phone) on wood pieces, metal grating, ladders, etc.  SO a full screen front was out of the question.......that's how he damaged the other one.  PLUS cost was a major factor knowing he'll damage it again, probably.  He liked the fact that on the school wireless he could always check email with this phone, too.  Again, important to his job.  This phone is NOT 3G, it is NOT a smart phone, it is NOT able to access internet/email from anywhere.  Just places where wifi is available (like a college campus).All that said, it fit the bill for him very well.  He likes it thus far, though he's only had it at school less than 2 weeks.  He says it seems fine for what he needed it for.

All 4 bands, 2 MP camera, nice keyboard and color screen, unlocked. It's pretty and inexpensive. Bingo, I thought, I can use it in the US as well for SMS, and I can use it for simple internet tasks over WiFi! Dream on, dreamer! You know the expression \"too good to be true\"?The problems are HUGE.1) The design of the interface is miserable. It's even hard to explain. Tasks are accessed from a menu that is programmable. There is an icon menu too, and it's programmable. But where is the full list of tasks to pull into these menus? That's so buried I can only find it by chance now and then. Everything is counter-intuitive. In the end it's more like a Rubik's Cube than anything. I've spent hours trying to set it up. Good Luck. You will also discover its countless ways to unexpectedly go into data mode. See item 2.2) The selection of data modes does not allow you to turn off cellular data completely in favor of WiFi. You never know when it's going to go into roaming cellular data mode. It's like a diabolical billing trap. Sitting on a strong WiFi connection I've managed to inadvertently consume all 25 Euros of credits repeatedly within an hour of trying to use the device solely over the selected WiFi. More than the phone itself cost. Assuming that there is any way to turn off billable internet, you will likely spend so much money on unintentional cellular connections trying to figure it out that it's immaterial. For instance, you want to change the color theme. Bam, it connects and finds big files to download. The video mode is terrible. The camera is bad. Why do they give you a 2 MP camera? So the phone can run up a bill \"synchronizing\" big files. Do stick to prepaid. I'm glad I wasn't using it on a billable plan, or I'd be looking at a bill in the hundreds if not thousands. The idea of putting an open-ended account's SIM card in it is suicidal. I'm going to load it up again with 5 euros and I'm never going to use it for anything stateside but SMSing, and as a basic phone when not roaming. The worst it can do then is deplete the 5 Euros.3) The Energy Saver feature requires hitting keys to keep it from turning off the screen. There seems to be no way to change the 9 second time-out. This alone makes it useless. Try reading the news or doing anything other than basic SMSing when the screen keeps turning off unless you keep hitting keys! It's designed to make you hit random keys in desperation, and mine came pre-programmed so that hitting the right key would connect to Plus! data services (see pt 2 above). Oops, there went another 2 Euros.I'm amazed some people like this thing. The positive reviews must be from people who have never used a decent smart phone. It makes an iPhone seem like it came from some advanced extraterrestrial civilization, whereas the C3 was designed by greedy phone carriers and programmed by imbeciles.

I guess I just like solving puzzles and taking things apart.Initially, I was mainly looking for a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard, not a touchscreen keyboard, which I hate, that could do Wifi without requiring a data plan with my cellphone carrier (AT&T;).  So many of the full keyboard cellphones nowadays have Wifi, but will not allow you to do Wifi without also having a data subscription.The C3-00 fulfills these requirements.  The biggest downside to this phone is that Nokia has pretty much abandoned all further support for this phone and its old Symbian operating system.  That means no easy way to get the apps you need to do simple things like blocking certain incoming phone numbers.However, because this is a simple, basic, and slightly smart phone (think of it as a C-minus level smartphone), that has been out for some time, the phone is relatively cheap to buy and use, and numerous tweaks are out there posted on the internet that allow you to tweak it.  If you do want a data plan through AT&T; for example, this costs only $10 a month, as the phone uses the older slower GPRS/EDGE  data network.The phone also takes up to a 16Gb micro-SDHC chip to play your music  and store your photos for the 2MB camera (you need the latest firmware, earlier firmware versions only supported 8GB).  It will play MP4s by the way (my son figured this part out).Having said all that, the next thing that has to be said is:  BUYER BEWARE!  There are several DIFFERENT versions of this phone!  I have purchased around 10 of these phones now (one has failed).  Here are the versions I have encountered and what can or needs to  be done to fix them:1.  Regular American/Western standard English QWERTY keyboard.  May come locked or unlocked.  Found on Ebay, AliExpress, etc.  Firmware level highly variable from the  6.-- series on up to 8.70.  RM614  8.71 is the last Nokia firmware update, but there is no American or European version.  The closest you get is the English language Australian/New Zealand/Singapore English QWERTY firmware which works fine.  If you are lucky, you will get one of these with this 8.71 firmware.  Depending on the firmware  level, this type of phone is the closest you can get to having a ready-to-go phone that needs minimal programming/hacking to work properly.2. English QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type with  non-English characters (Cyrillic?)  for certain of the uppercase keyboard buttons which do NOT correspond to what is on the keyboard.  These phones need to be re-flashed with the English QWERTY 8.71 firmware (see above) to work properly.3. Partial QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type.  The uppercase keyboard buttons for certain buttons are blank.  These uppercase buttons will generate the same set of non-English characters as type #2.  These phones need re-flashing of the firmware and a replacement full-set English QWERTY keyboard.  As of this writing, these keyboards can be found on Ebay and elsewhere, and there is a Youtube video that shows you how to take your phone apart to replace the keyboard (need a T4 or T5 Torx screwdriver)4. Cyrillic version QWERTY keyboard with same 8.71 international firmware.  Same fixes needed as type #3.5.  AT&T; Go-phone.  These have a dark blue body and silver keyboard.  Comes with 3.63 firmware WITHOUT WIFI!!!  These were sold really cheap for a time by Walmart, and are now often found on Ebay and elsewhere.  Re-flashing the firmware to 8.70, 8.71, whatever, will place a Wifi soft key on this phone, and allow it to seek out and identify nearby Wifi hotspots.  This indicates that these phones do indeed still have the Wifi chip in them.  However, the MAC addresses of these Go-phones have been wiped out and set to ZERO, meaning that the cellphone WILL NOT CONNECT EVER TO ANY WIFI SOURCES!!!  So far, I have not discovered any hacked software out there that will allow you to reflash a MAC address onto the Wifi chip on this cellphone.  So these AT&T; Go-phones have very effectively had their Wifi permanently castrated by Nokia, most likely at the behest of AT&T;, to force users to use an AT&T; data plan.In regards to re-flashing the firmware:1.  Get the cracked Phoenix Software.  Need a good quality micro USB cable to connect to your PC computer.  See Commentary section below for websites where you can download this software and instructions for how to use it.  The original genuine version required a dongle, so you need the cracked version(s).  Phoenix WILL NOT WORK on 64-bit Windows 7!!  It will work on 32-bit Windows XP and Windows 7.  For those of you righteous legal purists, know that Phoenix Software is a now defunct software no longer being sold or supported, and so the cracked version is not defrauding anybody of their rightful profits.2.  Some sites still tell you to download the Navifirm software to get the latest firmware from Nokia.  Well, Nokia shut down their website for the Navifirm software in early-mid 2013, so forget about using Navifirm.  See Commentary section below for best websites currently to get the last firmware version 8.71.Other reviews have already discussed how to get the phone set up properly to send MMS Multimedia text messages.  Go to the Commentary section below for a full update on the details.  One KEY FACT not mentioned by other reviewers so far is that you need to ALSO change the IMEI number with your cellphone carrier in order to get the Multimedia text messaging to work.Also in the Commentary section is a website description of how to get the Wifi to work.Onwards, to the Commentary section ...", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cell Phone", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R5SY31G072020", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a an Okay phone however its limited in the features it says it can perform like being able to play a variety video media.

I even watched a video, although interrupted a couple times.  Unlike my other phone, this phone making switching on/off bluetooth and adding/deleting pairing devices very simple and secure.FIY: I do have unlimited grandfather data plan with this phone.--------------------------------------------------------Original reivew after owning this item for 8 months:I have own this phone for 8 months and have travelled to Asia with it.I must say I was not very used to a phone with full keyboard.  And the full keyboard is not very useful to me as I do not text messaging/email a lot.  In fact, it gave me quite some headache at first as so many phone numbers were remembered as letters in US (such as 4-police).  However, after all the time being, I like it more and more.It is not a smart phone.  However, it serves the purposes to surf internet such as for checking Train schedule, weather...etc.  Unlike my another Window phone which will get on line without my permissions and caused me $$$ and endless trouble with phone bills, this Nokia C3 phone has very clear and easy operate WLAN controls and warning to allow me to always choose the right WLAN provider.Not like some other easy broken toy-like phones, this phone has a decent look and is nicely built.  The battery life is desirably long which makes it a perfect travel companion.And recently, I notice NOKIA provides many free games for downloading that I spent quite a good time playing them.

I have always been a Nokia fan, but for my last upgrade, I was looking to switch to a QWERTY phone for easy text-messaging, and I discovered that all the technology is going into smartphones, meaning there are very few decent-quality dumbphones available.  For my current upgrade, I did some extensive research and decided to go back to Nokia.  First of all, I was very happy to have the return of what I think would be expected features on any phone, like a decent calendar and calculator app, and reminders.  Here are the other pros/cons of this phone:PROS:1. wIfi-  the internet available on this phone is not going to make smartphone users happy, but it makes me happy that I can download wallpapers and ringtones without using data2. conversational text messaging- it doesn't look like an iphone or anything, but it serves it's purpose so you don't have to scroll through your sent messages to see what you were talking about when someone replies a few hrs later3. customizable- you can make all the shortcut buttons do what you want them to do, so you won't accidentally connect to the internet all the time, and can easily access the features that you do use. you can also customize the appearance of the homescreen with preferred shortcuts, such as top contacts, etc4. can check time and missed calls/messages by just pressing the hangup button, do not need to unlock keypad5. nice display, camera is decent, easy to navigate, user-friendly, can change call volume during a call by pressing the navigation key6. Battery life is AMAZING!  I used it a lot when I first got it to set it up with some wifi use, and it lasted me 8 1/2 days before my first charge.  During the second week of regular use but no wifi, I am now on the 8th day and still have half the battery life remaining.7. Feels sturdy and well-madeCONS:1. Mine came in portugese.  There is a utube video that demonstrates how to change the language, so it is fine.  There are a few keys you won't use, but no big deal.  Came with European charger and a converter.2. Keyboard is a little small for typing.  I am getting used to it, but still have some typos.3. Media messaging and internet do not work when you first get it.  Need to configure it.  The instructions are listed in one of the Amazon reviews by user P Redman (thanks!).  I am going to copy and paste below because it is tough to find the specific review.  Once configured, everything works great.So after the few quick fixes when the phone arrives, the only real con is a small keyboard.  Overall, a great phone and does everything I had hoped for and more.  Perfect if you want a decent phone without wasting money on smartphone data plans.Nokia C3 -- MMS and Web settingsMultimedia MessagingMenu > Settings > Configuration > Personal Settings > Options > Add New > Multimedia MsgAccount Name: AT&T; MMSServer address: mmsc.cingular.comUse pref.

I'm not that bothered by that because I tend to call the same people again and again, who are saved as contacts. The web browsing is a joke. You have to float the arrow around with the up/down keys.

So far it seems to do everything I need it to do, and I only paid about $80 for it.However, I am starting to discover little things that bother me. First, there is no external volume button. You have to press a few buttons to get to the menu to change the ring volume.Second, there is not a brightness control. If you are in a bar (which I am in a lot) your face will light up because of the bright screen. I end up holding the phone at an angle to avoid embarassment. Also the screen will go black after 8 seconds and there is no way to change this power saving feature.When you are composing a text message, there is no quick way to save it to send later.I would exchange the phone for another but I think it is too late (I bought it at a local store in Mexico). So I will keep it until it breaks. It just annoys me that these little features have been excluded so that you will want to buy another phone (Nokia hopes you will upgrade I imagine).

But there are a few things to note:+ There is NO way to change the screen brightness.  I even checked to see if there are any free hacker apps to enable this, but there are none to be found.+ There is NO way to change the screen timeout function.  If you don't press a button, the screen will go dim and turn off after about 10 seconds.  And yes, this phone does play videos which makes this hardwired timeout just plain dumb.+ Music volume at the absolute lowest setting is still quite loud through my earbuds.  It makes music unbearable after a short time.+ Internet can be excruciatingly slow even at full signal strength.  I'm talking WLAN here... haven't tried over GSM yet, but I can't imagine it's any faster.Overall, aside from a few MIA features, this is a fine phone for certain functions.  I was able to set up my nonstandard e-mail account quickly, and the phone has built in e-mail setup for Gmail, AOL, etc.  The Nokia store has a few free apps as well as pay ones of course.  Because the features are fairly limited, the menu tree is easy to navigate.

Bluetooth works well with my MacBook Pro for file transfers, both sending music to the phone memory card and sending photos/videos from the phone to the MacBook. The bluetooth also works in our 2011 Toyota Sienna, at least as far as making and receiving calls, but the stereo music features do not work at all. The camera is adequate but unimpressive and photos look grainy. The full keyboard while small is nice, although I do no texting and only very little emailing.

video either). I had to hold everything and still use sunglasses. Still I hope some people can find it useful. As you can see, in this example it takes a second or two to go into menu and settings. It's a more advanced phone, but that doesn't mean everything should be slow.)My Samsung a177 wore out, and I got this phone. I'm returning this Nokia and just getting the Samsung again.Pros:1) The other reviews have covered this. I mean, sure some of the features are very nice.Problems:1) Dialogue is only partial. Long messages are cut to two lines. Also, you can't switch to the next message if you're in one (even in inbox and sent. come on. This is really really important.). The advertisement of it having \"conversational layout of back-and-forth messages\" is mostly false because most of the messages are cut off.2) Slow. The phone will display \"Opening message\" for about a second when you want to do that. Settings takes about a second to open. Most of the stuff does. It's like dealing with slow internet, car traffic, etc.3) Keyboard would stick or something. It would think I held the key and put in whatever is the secondary (shift) character. Happened more than once.4) Another person said this. No side volume. It does have a silence button though.5) Someone said this as well. Screen on time is fixed. For me it was 20 seconds. Basic cell phones have better options.6) Manual was weak.7) Message settings is only in messaging and not in the general settings. (very minor)8) Sometimes you can't go back. Flow of the buttons could be improved.9) No brightness adjustment either????Company specific problems (the above was enough to give it one star so I'm not being unfair to the product's star rating by also listing something most people wouldn't experience):1) \"Contacts not ready\" glitch initially. Fixed itself but strange.2) Consumer Cellular has WLAN disabled. Still using them but wish more emphasis was made.Basically this is a bad phone for texting because of the fake dialogue and slow speed of getting from one message to the next. I do not recommend it, but I do see why other people like it.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Rodney Garnes", "ReviewID": "ROBO2S9R27TPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its really nice and is very user friendlyNokia C3 Quad-band Unlocked GSM Cell Phone with 2mp Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-fi,Qwerty Keyboard--international Version with no US Warranty (Grey)", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Attention !!!

First of all it was not an unlocked phone instead it was an AT&T; phone which was in a contract period. Moreover they send the phone inside an plastic envelop with a duplicate battery charger, apparently  without any accessories and manuals.I contacted the seller for the refund then he started giving excuses like you should 've read the details. It was clearly mentioned on Amazon that its a NEW and UNLOCKED phone with all accessories. Somehow I was able to convince him for the refund and shipped the phone back to the seller's address given by the seller himself.Its been more than three months now and I didnt even get a penny back. The seller is saying that he didnt receive it back however I confirmed from the shipping company that it was delivered on the destination on time.I lost my money and still didnt get the phone I ordered. I had to order another phone from some other seller.So guys think twice before you even visit this seller's page on Amazon. Friendly advice to all of you find some other seller.

Just like the Prior Unhappy Buyer of this Same device did a few months ago, I have to return this crappy cell phone to the UPS store tomorrow morning (Jan 6, 2012) for a 100% refund. I'll explain below how I know there is a Prior Unhappy Buyer of this defective Cell Phone.Today (Jan 5, 2012), I'm extremely disappointed about 5 minutes after I opened the package. First, I noticed a PRIOR UNHAPPY BUYER returned this piece of crap, defective cell phone in October 2011 (just a few months before me). The \"Return due to Defective Product\" notice dated in October 2011 was still attached to the package sent to me. The seller is Warehouse Deals, Inc which is a subsidiary of Amazon. The seller Warehouse Deals, Inc must be thinking that if the Nokia C3-00 is defective in one unhappy buyer's eyes, it must not be defective in the next buyer's eyes. HELLO! Defective is defective - it means internally mal-functioning, it's not merely external/superficial beauty in the eyes of the beholder.I have owned several older Nokia cell phone models, so I began testing several functions. Immediately, I noticed that the Right and Left Key (just above the alpha & numeric keyboards) are not responsive when I try to select on-screen options. The only time the Right key works is when switching on/off the device. I gave my benefit of the doubt by pressing the key at different strength: hard, medium and soft, but nothing worked. Then I immediately went to online chat with Nokia online support to explain my problems with this device. The Nokia online support confirm what I know about Nokia devices from my own experience, that it is NOT normal for the Right and Left Key not to be responsive to on-screen selections (in other words, I wouldn't need to press more than 1 key to pick on-screen selections). On all my prior Nokia cell phone, you only need to press 1-key (either the Right or Left key to select your on-screen option).I've had a string of bad luck ordering this Nokia C3-00 unlocked cell phone (a very long story, prior to receiving this defective cell phone, I made at least 3 telephone complaints about an Amazon Rep. called Amit Y. who made unauthorized cancellation on 2 good, valid and in-stock orders without my permission. This is really testing my patience on purchasing electronic devices from Amazon. I am totally disappointed with this device and I will return this crappy defensive cell phone at the UPS store tomorrow morning for a refund.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "i didt like this phone", "Author": "javed  akhtar", "ReviewID": "R3NJETL31FD9NP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it has very small screen,video quality isnt good.you can buy better phone with different brand in same price range.i never recomend this phone to anyone", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "buen celular", "Author": "Pedro A.

Really, I'd like something I can download apps AND have the great functionality of a Nokia, so gonna search for something that fits my need and my budget, but for me, this phone wasn't it.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "first nokia.. liked it but has some bugs", "Author": "Nisa09", "ReviewID": "RIF1N0VEXDPNH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So despite some of the negative reviews I still decided to buy the phone and I was disappointed with this purchase. This is my first Nokia. I have been a loyal SE customer for many years and since my C905a broke, I thought why not give another brand a try? Overall, I think I prefer SE models more. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to them but I think their UI is just more user friendly. However, I have gotten use to this phone and I do like it. I love the fact that it has a lot of smartphone features. The wireless internet is awesome. I don't have to worry about the stupid data plan AT&T; makes you sign up for. I like all the many shortcut buttons. So even without the widget bar, I still have access to most of my applications. However, I think it's the luck of the draw. Some reviewers had no problem with this phone but within the first couple of days of using it, it would just freeze up and shut down on me. So frustrating! And video playback sucks. Everytime I would play a video the screen would freeze after just a few seconds. Plus no volume rocker. I knew the phone didn't have one but I didn't realize how much I would miss it! I like to listen to music while I'm doing other stuff on the phone. There's no way to skip to the next song or change the station or adjust the volume other than quitting the application you're doing and going back to your media player. (I guess I'm spoiled from my other SE phones.) I do have my phone settings like ringtones and such set to files on my SD card. And everytime I would take the card out and put it back in, my settings would be reset to the original. What the heck?! So I'm sending it back and because I do like the brand, I'm going to give Nokia one more chance and upgrade it to a C6 and try their touch screen phones now. I'm crossing my fingers that the upgraded model will have gotten most of the bugs out and I won't have the same problems. If not, I think I'll have to go back to my SE roots and give W995a a try instead. So if you're thinking of buying this phone, I would recommending upgrading and getting an E5 instead.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, Bad Battery", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R29MA6KTW7O4S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like the phone, looks great, sound is great, quick learning curve, but the battery life sucks.

For a few days, it was fine. Then this little phone developed a mind of its own...  The best thing I can say about this phone is the Nokia Ovi Suite is very handy for backing up all pictures, music, contacts, etc. Since multitasking with this phone is impossible, the Ovi Suite came in handy for texting via computer while I was on a call. While the phone does take good pictures, sending more than one at a time often caused the phone to \"black out.\" The screen would go white and quite often I would have to turn it off and back on to resolve this issue.  The phone memory is virtually nil. Almost daily I would have to delete messages or pictures or video to free up phone memory, even though I had a 4-gig micro-sd card in the phone. And I couldn't see or hear over half the items on my memory card, as the phone didn't recognize them.  The web browser is a joke. Surfing is pointless, as the phone will pull up certain websites after a ridiculously long load time, then stop before I could access anything I needed to see, i.e., my bank site, email, etc.  This is the ideal phone for someone who doesn't use a phone for more than calls or simple text - although on more than one occasion, when texting with more than one person at a time, the messages began to intermingle with one another. One person's texts and responses would have another person's name on them.  I went through two of these phones, thinking the first was just an isolated lemon, but the second one was as bad or worse. This one is not Nokia's best work. It does not support a 3G sim card and performance is beyond limited.

Two months later I was playing with her son at a park and I had the phone in my back pocket upside-down and the bottom part broke off again and got lost. So then I had a phone that looked really crappy. Later on the buttons on the bottom row started breaking off. Luckily they snapped back in and worked fine. They also got lost. The function key was one of them and it is needed to unlock the phone. So I turned off the auto-lock but kept locking anyway. Soon the speaker on the phone went out and it texted the wrong person. Ex. I texted my boyfriend: Hey can you tell your mom that I can't make it to dinner Saturday. Work stuff. And it sent to my co-worker who totally got the wrong idea.
