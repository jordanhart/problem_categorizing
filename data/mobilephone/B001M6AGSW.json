{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does a LOT but...", "Author": "Steph G", "ReviewID": "R14HE49HFMORF2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the Blackberry Curve 8300 for about a year and a half. It does a lot of things, most of which I haven't had the time to learn. In addition to phone calls, texts, web surfing, and listening to music, I use it for synchronizing MS Outlook's contacts, calendar, memo pad, and tasks between this phone and my desktop PC. Since this phone is for personal use vs. work, I can't synchronize my emails (you need MS Exchange software installed on a server for that). That's one of its downfalls. My old Palm Pilot synchronized emails too.RIM's software does not synch consistently with MS Outlook.  I have to re-configure the synchronization about every 10 times I synch the Curve with Outlook. Once you know how to do it (see instructions below), it only takes a couple of minutes. But it's really annoying. The phone in general is not very intuitive/user-friendly, so I strongly recommend against buying this phone unless you are pretty technically savvy.  And don't bother with the phone's help files - they rarely answer your questions.On the plus side, it is the perfect size and shape for my hands, small purses, and jean pockets.  It is also built very well. I have dropped it on hard surfaces from 4 feet high at least five times and it has survived perfectly -- even when I have to put all the pieces back together. RIM's technical support (which is where I got the synch fix instructions below) is pretty good if you have the patience to navigate their phone system to get to the right person. And you get a native English speaker - yay! The sound quality of phone calls on this phone is excellent.  Texting is a piece of cake - the keyboard rocks.  The web browser works well.INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING MS OUTLOOK AND RIM BLACKBERRY CURVE SYNCH ERRORS:Close Blackberry desktop mgr.Unplug phone.Open Blackberry desktop manager software.Open Synchronize.Configuration tab.Reset configuration.Plug in phone.Configure synch (yes, again).", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "John Garvin \"JRG\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ4CXTCDUY7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the money and as a first time Blackberry owner very happy with this phone.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "good seller", "Author": "Ermida L.

In fact it appears that this phone was used by someone and has been advertised on amazon as new. The phone came with a password protection on it which I did not have a clue as what to do.

I bought this BlackBerry 8300 unlocked phone factory refurbished. But I received a phone which does not looks like refurbished iten rather than looks completely a used phone with silver coating gone off from the switch pad and from the body. Damage to the rubber side coating too. The LCD cover has pupped out, not sticking to the body.Lot of dust inside the LCD space. Moreover there was not headphone and the leather pouch which alway comes with the box. Never before this happen when you buy a factory refurbished item.
