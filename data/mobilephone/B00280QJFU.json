However, the option requires accessing a secret menu.  This is how:Open the slider and type *#4777*8665# and a menu should pop up.  Go to menu number 5, Attach Mode.  Select Manual attach.  OK.  It will inform you that you need to restart the phone for this to take effect - do this later.  Then go to menu number 2, GPRS detach.  The phone will notify you that it has done the GPRS detach, which means that it is no longer connected to the GPRS network.  Now restart the phone, and there should be a blue and white G at the top of the screen instead of a red and white one.  Success!  Of course, you may reverse this at any time by going back to the secret menu and selecting Auto attach and GPRS attach.This will NOT adversely affect your ability to add minutes to the phone via [...] or by using a minutes card purchased in a store.  If blocking the browser makes you unable to add minutes directly from the phone, just GPRS attach again and you'll be fine.

My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing).  Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down!  Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction.  The 376 has a \"flimsy\" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily.  The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear.Samsung produced some features you don't see in the average \"prepay plan phones.\"  The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors).They'll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Browser button will eat away your minutes", "Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "R16RORZTR30QWS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just had to add my two cents. I read the reviews about the ease of accidentally hitting the browser button and losing minutes, and I ordered this phone anyway. And I agree 100% about the browser. While setting up the phone I have lost a few minutes already by accidentally hitting the darn browser key. What a dumb place to put a browser key! (It's the top right button on the front of the phone, and if you bump it, hit it, press it accidentally (even when the phone is in the closed position), if your phone is on, you will lose 0.5 minutes.  I have searched all over the web and there is no way to disable it, or at least have it ask you if you want to connect. Terrible terrible feature. I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and entered *#4777*8665# and followed the instructions, and it doesn't work for me, and from other sites I have found out, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  I am going to see over the next month how much time I lose, and then I may have to take another reviewer's advice from another website and glue the button shut. (He said this worked for him fine and you can still get to the browser from the menu button).  I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who has kids, your kids will drain their minutes by accident.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best one yet - except for browser", "Author": "Mattie's friend \"offshore1\"", "ReviewID": "R13LZKJ9I7BA11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I each have one of this model Tracfone.  Neither has been a problem with outgoing or incoming calls.  No dropped calls.  Voice quality has been clear and natural sounding.  We haven't yet found any areas where the phone won't work, and this covers New England to Oregon.  Those are the \"pros.\"  The following are the \"cons,\" along with some physical features we would like to see improved:-  One of my biggest cons is the fact that the browser key is fixed and cannot be changed or disabled. The prompt that gets you into this limited browser can  be easily activated and cost you fractions of minutes.-  I carry my T301G sideways in a belt holder.  I have occasionally missed a call when extracting the phone and quickly pressing the \"off\" button by mistake.  This won't shut the phone off, but it will cancel the incoming call.-  The little, raised line under the display is used to slide the phone open.  This line is too small and and just about useless to use.  A rubber, or ribbed area on the side of the phone would be much more useful to slide the phone up.  I find the process to be a \"two thumbs\" operation if you don't want to press on the LED display all the time - or activate one of the soft keys which are much too close.-  My previous Tracfone was a \"clamshell\" V176.  This has a rubber feel to the phone, and I never thought I might drop the thing because of a slick, or slippery exterior.  I wish the T301G was made from the same material - although I have not yet dropped this phone.-  The four soft keys can be programmed for whatever you want.  I have found that assigning your \"contact list,\" messages, list of incoming calls and phone info (minutes and time left) works best for me.  The keys themselves, however, are still too small.  The \"incoming calls\" one is needed for when I mistakenly disconnect a call as mentioned above.-  I found the phone information that constantly scrolls across the screen to be distracting and irritating.  I was able to shut this function off through the menu though.  The press of one of the soft keys now tells me this information.The above \"cons\" are not a deal breaker for me.  Life with this phone would be just a little easier if they were addressed.Some other thoughts:-  I have never had trouble adding minutes to either phone.  I do it over the internet.  All they want is your phone number (as long as the phone is registered with Tracfone - easy to do).  You purchase the minutes/time and they appear on the phone almost immediately.  Keep the phone \"on\" while doing this.-  My V176 lasted almost six years with no problems until the last two weeks of it's life.  If I can get this same performance from the T301G, then (for the price)I think it will be worth it.-  I know it would make the phone a bit larger, but I wish the soft keys, menu and browser keys, and key pad itself were a little larger.  Less room for error and more comfortable to use.-  I have the phone set to answer (or call) when the slide is used.  I don't think the browser will activate, by accident, when the phone is closed, because it's locked then.(Edit on the above - If the phone is \"on,\" then the browser will activate even when the phone closed (locked).  This \"con\" continues to grow larger)Not a great camera, but it will do in a pinch.The volume control is on the side of the phone.  Ascending from 1 thru 7.  One press below 1 puts the phone on vibrate.  Easy.All-in-all, this is a nice little phone, for the price, and the fact that no contracts are involved.  Much less expensive to operate than than most any other phone. It would, (at least for me) be the perfect little phone if the above \"cons\" could be ironed out.__________________________________March, 2014 -I have to add these thoughts to the above review.  It's been just about four years since I wrote the above comments.  The necessity of opening the phone by placing a thumb on the screen has not been a problem at all.  The rugged little screen is no worse for the constant manipulation.  My wife and I were up in mid-Maine last May.  I had my new Apple iPhone with me.  Three of the others I was with had iPhones and one android phone.  It was necessary to call a person at the local historical society. These four \"high end\" phones got \"no service\" in this remote area. I remembered that I had the Tracfone in the glove compartment, because I still had a couple of months of time left on the phone. Yes - you guessed it - the Samsung T301G made this call just fine.  No, the T301G doesn't take really clear photos and it's difficult to send a text or record appointments. But, it was the only device (out of five) that actually made a telephone call!  You know I put another year on the T301G and have it with me when I need to travel to these out-of-the-way places.  I can now add \"dependable\" to the list of positive comments above.  I don't know why the Tracfone was the only one able to make the important call - I just know that it did.  The above \"cons\" are still valid, but have not been the problem I anticipated when writing the initial post.

The one thing that is really bad about this phone though is that if someone texts you, something will pop up on the screen that says \"1 new message\" and the time and date that the message was sent, that's good but it doesn't say who the message is from until you view the message. So sometimes it doesn't matter if it shows you who it's from or not, but a lot of times it does because after you open the message, minutes get deducted, so you could open a text from someone you don't know or open a text that you don't want to respond to, and you won't know who it's from until after your minutes get deducted. I have wasted a lot of minutes because of that. Although, when someone calls you it DOES say who the call is from.

I had tried a Common Cents option when I wanted to upgrade to a phone with Bluetooth capabilities to work with a newly acquired car and bought in to the Common Cents hype about lower per minute cost and the round down on partial minutes of airtime. What Common Cents does not emphasize in their advertising is that there is absolutely no roaming. If you are outside of the Sprint network coverage area the phone will not work. Just because you have a friend or acquaintance with a Sprint Contract phone that gets coverage in the areas that you travel does not ensure that a Common Cents phone will work in those areas.I subsequently upgraded my Tracfone to the Samsung t301g which did pair with my Ford Sync system and allows hand free calling. I was unable to get the contact list from the phone uploaded to the Sync system but Ford does have some free downloadable software that allows you to create a contact list on your computer and then transfer it to the vehicle via a USB data key.The phone documentation is minimal and the download available from TracFone adds very little information.  The default ringtone is progressive, starts out soft and gets louder, and I doubt that anyone will hear the first two rings in a store, restaurant or car. There are several other ringtones built in and I found one that was satisfactory when the volume is adjusted upward. The call volume is also adjustable during a call and most people will probably need to set it near the maximum for use with the hands free calling options with Ford Sync.One peculiarity of the phone is that there is no provision for setting the date and time manually and the time picked up from the network is about two minutes slow. I initiated a support request via email and one week, four emails and about 2 hours spent on the phone with three \"customer support\" representatives I finally received an email confirming that there was no way to manually adjust the time, that they could do nothing about the incorrect (Compared to NIST)time, and stating that the \"issue had been addressed\", which in my opinion is not the same as the issue being resolved.While the \"Customer Support\" representative were courteous, they speak a dialect that is difficult to understand and one every call you spend at least five minutes repeating information that you provided in you initial support request and all of your previous calls and then long periods on hold as they \"check with a supervisor\" or search \"their system\" for additional information regarding your problem.In summary the phone is usable and does provide some functionality with Ford Sync systems at a reasonable price when you factor in that you get double minutes for the life of the phone. TracFone support is basically non-existent. If you are the type that reads manuals and are willing to do some internet research Tracfone provides \"as needed airtime\" at a reasonable cost. If you are the type that likes or needs some hand holding you should probably look elsewhere and if you have become dependent on a cell phone to provide the correct time you definitely need a different phone.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "got rid of mine", "Author": "Joel Lidz \"jwl\"", "ReviewID": "RKF2T12IOABHQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So long as you don't require customer service, tracfone is fine.

The simple fix is to wait about five seconds for the screen to go blank before placing the phone in the holster. This locks the keys until you press unlock then OK or slide the phone open. The browser will not dial if you wait these few seconds.

Based on that, the Samsung T301G has got to be one of the worst phones ever made. The main problem is that when the phone breaks, Tracfone sends out a REFURBISHED one. The refurbs were probably returned for the same reason as I returned my first phone (it was freezing and finally became unresponsive). After I called to ask that they send me a new phone, they said OK but they again sent a used one. I'm only going to activate it because most of their other phones have also gotten bad reviews.I picked this Tracfone after my Motorola broke after 2 years of use. This phone has very, very short batter life (needs to be charged every other day even if it hasn't been used very much) and it's Bluetooth function does NOT work with my Bluetooth enabled GPS and other devices for hands-free calling. The only positive is that the phone looks better than the Motorola and that it's faster at sending/receiving text messages, even though the controls and buttons to type the text are very small and hard to get used to.To sum it all up, if you can, please buy a different phone and save yourself the headache of having a broken phone every 3 months (and that's in the case of a NEW one. Used/Refurbished ones are broken OUT OF THE BOX). Tracfone used to be good, but with this, one of the worst phones ever made, and the fact that they keep sending me a used one makes them one of the most annoying companies I've had to deal with.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "HAVE 3 OF THESE-MAKE THAT FOUR", "Author": "P.

In addition, even with the loudest ring tone I can find, I can't hear it ring unless I'm in a totally quiet room--though I have no difficulty hearing my Motorola 370.  Most annoying perhaps, is the fact that once you reach the name & number you want on the contact menu, you still to scroll through more options to reach \"Call\", instead of being able to just press the green button to \"Send\".  And why in the world is \"Call\" not option #1 instead of #4? It's an unnecessary step.  Sending a text could be simplified.  Having said all of that, sound quality and volume levels are excellent when making calls.  It also has an excellent system of options for being able to view and delete information for missed calls and messages.Tracfone itself?  In 7 years with them, while it sometimes requires a wait (like most companies!), once you get through, they're usually able to solve the problem pretty quickly.

Perhaps Samsung fixed this issue.2) The screen is 2\" diagonal, which is a good size for a low end phone, however the low resolution makes it a bit grainy.  Also it has a narrow viewing angle, i.e. you have to hold it at a certain angle or it appears dark or washed out.3) The mobile web capability is very limited because of the phone's low memory.  Originally Tracfone only allowed you to go to a set of preselected sites.  Now you can enter any URL, but most of the time you get an insufficent memory error because the site is too large.  I mainly use it to get info. by searching Google, in lieu of the Google SMS service that they discontinued.4) As others have noted, when you close the slider the outer buttons don't lock immediately, you have to wait a few seconds before putting it in your pocket, otherwise the browser button could get pushed and you can lose a lot of minutes.5) Battery standby time is less than a week, which is lower than other phones I've used.  On the other hand it recharges faster than usual.  EDIT: I recently charged the phone on a Sunday night, and it lasted until the next Monday morning, with light usage during the week.  It will stay at one battery bar for a while and still be functional.  When you recharge it, there doesn't seem to be any alert when it is finished, you have to just see if the battery icon is full.6) The menu screens have a black and orange color scheme which, while readable, is a bit odd.I got it when it was $8, from Dealathon, and I'm still using it.  Overall I'd say it is worth the current price of $5, for those of us who are not into the complexity and cost of smartphones.  You can upgrade to another Tracfone later on.  You can connect it to your Windows PC using a free program from Samsung and a cable you can get from Amazon for a few dollars, see this thread on the Howard forum: [...]ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unlike some of their other phones, Samsung doesn't provide a PDF booklet/manual for this phone.

The window lit up when I shook the water from it. My brother said I would have to take it apart right away and dry everything as quickly as possible. I wasn't sure how to take it apart, and didn't have any tools, but it was still working, so I figured it might be okay. Later the screen wouldn't come on, and I thought it was done.An hour or two later, the screen began to work again, but the key pad wouldn't work. A couple of hours later, the keypad began working again, and everything was fine. It has been fine ever since and that was over a week ago. The only thing I don't like is that the only way to retreive the pictures is to send them via e-mail to the computer.

However, Tracfone customer service (foreign call center), after troubleshooting on another phone call with me for 45 minutes finally agreed to send me a new SIM card (took 9 days to receive) and then I could activate again and port the 2nd number. The second time, I decided to give the phone to my son after porting, and called customer service and this time they were able to re-activate on the same 2nd SIM that had just finished the same procedure the first SIM did.
