{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Luxurious Phone", "Author": "J. P. Anthony \"J. P. A.\"", "ReviewID": "RQ0J134W3ZPY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Motorola KRZR K1 is a very stylish phone.  It will surely impress people.  The only thing you need to worry about buying this phone from Amazon is that it may come from another country.  This means that an American adapter is included for the foreign plug and the language is in British English, which is not a big deal but odd for people used to Personalize instead of personalise.  The phone is extremely shiny because it is made of polished metal and glass.  Glass is an odd material for a mobile phone, but looks nice considering how fragile it is.  The screen color and resolution are also very nice.  Call quality is decent.  All in all a 9 out of ten for looks and 8 out of ten for quality.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "A good first flip phone...", "Author": "Patrick Byington \"Strangely Engaging\"", "ReviewID": "RS9CO4V18R262", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, before I get into this.  I have to let everyone know that this is the first flip phone I've ever owned.  All of my previous phones were candybar style Nokias.  The KRZR is an excellent phone, still a little pricy, but beautiful to behold.  The MP3 player function is quite good.  The volume and clarity for such a small object are top notch.  Colors are bright and vibrant.  I think my favorite feature of all of them is the voice command function.  That in itself made it worthy of a five star rating.  I have only one complaint.  The menus can be quite complex and detail intensive at times.  The manual deffinitely came in handy a couple of times.  But otherwise this thing is worth its weight in gold.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "a nice upgrade to the RAZR", "Author": "Joe the Critic", "ReviewID": "R1P368CALB70B6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased an unlocked, midnight blue version of the K1 KRAZR for $99 by renewing my T-Mobile contract for 2 years at my neighborhood cellphone store.  (Not many stores will sell you an unlocked phone, so this will not be an option for most people.)  Compared to the RAZR, I was surprised at first at how much heavier it feels in the hand and also how much thicker it looks.  It is actually just slightly thicker than the RAZR, but because it is so narrow (and heavy) it feels much thicker than it really is.Even though I miss the elegant styling of the RAZR, the KRAZR beats it hands down on features: a camera with half-decent resolution (finally - why did it take so long?), video camera, memory card slot, voice recognition, and MP3 capability.  The form factor, while not as pleasing to me as the RAZR, does fit nicely into the hand.  The voice recognition could come in handy for hands-free phone use when driving, and each time I have tried it, it has worked flawlessly.By the way, the memory card you need for this phone is a Micro SD card.  If you buy a SanDisk Transflash package, it will come with an adapter that allows you to read it in an regular SD card reader (which is standard on some cameras and desktop computers).  I bought a 256 Mb Transflash package on Amazon from Blue Proton for $9.48 including shipping.As for negatives, the Motorola software is still not up to par, and you will need to refer to the manual to figure out how to do some tasks that should be obvious.  My pet peeve is that the Recent Calls screen will only list a number once, so if you missed three calls from the same person, the phone will only show the last, most recent call.  Apparently the folks at Motorola don't care if someone has been trying to reach us urgently but didn't leave a vmail every time.  I also haven't figured out how to copy the phone book from the SIM card to the phone memory all at once, rather than one number at a time -- what is Motorola thinking?", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "The RAZR is great but the KRZR is better!", "Author": "Kaydeebee \"DB\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q8NE1EYC228A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The KRZR is easier to hold because of its slimmer design. Plus, the features are better in every way but there is something to beware of. I purchased mine from Amazon as an unlocked phone about three month ago, and when I called about repairs for a small part on the back last week, I found out my phone was manufactured for sale in the United Arab Emirates and that phones headed for that country (or possibly others, I don't know) are \"not\" covered by Motorola's warranty in the U.S. And when I asked who I should call, presumably in the United Arab Emirates, I was told they didn't have a phone number to give me. Needless to say I was a little surprised to find out that one, I don't have a useful warranty, and two, Motorola couldn't provide a phone number for a different part of its operation. Very strange, especially since Motorola's website says \"if it says Motorola on it, we can help.\" Well, apparently, that isn't true. So buyer beware. And by the way, the part that broke was the little loop that holds the lanyard. It isn't made of metal like the one on the RAZR. I had the back replaced by a local repairman for $30. Other than that, I love my phone!", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "David S.

Facings very shiny, reflective & streamlined.  Good weight to the phone, front reflective facing as good as a mirror.  Features a horizontal right side button on the flip piece for clock viewing on the cover screen (avoids having to flip open the screen to view date & time).Cons:Pieces seem thin and fragile (facings, framing), basic handling caused chipping of silver coating & deforming of edges.Inserted my SIM card & provided memory card, but back cover does not latch/stay attached/closed. Silver coating on edges flaked off as I did so & buzzing heard from the electronics when held upright looking at the screen.Came with a VERY basic operations manual, had to go online to find settings how to change basics (how to insert SIM card- via inner side slot, how to change to regular texting mode vs. iTap automatic mode- had 2 b done twice: once in texting, once in address book, so didn't change the typing mode across the entire interface, couldn't find setting for changing text alert sound to uploaded ringtone etc.).All in all, an attractive phone with a fairly user friendly interface, but outside materials seem of poor quality.  Give 2 stars for attractiveness & convenient design (size, reflective front, side clock button), but rapid deterioration NOT ok, since use matters most.

It looked very nice when I first got it, but very quickly the reflective coating started to chip off and has gotten much worse. Half my phone is now black. It's like chipped nail polish. Also, the face has cracked twice (I don't drop my phone, this had happened just from being in my purse). Also, the middle buttons have fallen off. The phone works ok, but it looks awful now. Also, the metallic finish is nice looking, but in the sunlight, it is impossible to read the screen, so you can't see who is calling you unless you open the phone, which of course answers the call. This is very inconvienient for anyone, like me, who feels the need to screen their calls. I am forced to either answer a call when I don't know who it is, or let it go straight to voicemail and then see who called. This happens even if I'm in my car, or outside in the shade. Only when I'm inside or it's dark out can I see the screen on front.

Works ok with my T-Mobil account but every time I turn it on it wakes up thinking it's supposed to connect to AT&T; and takes some extra time to figure out who it's supposed to connect to.  Once fired up it works ok and I've had no problems with voice quality others mention.  Has a very annoying form of text messaging - first you press the alphanumeric key and gets you to, lets say A.  Then if you want C instead you do NOT push that key, you use the 4 way cursor to scroll down through BC2abc, which means if you are a one handed typer you are constantly having to shift back and forth.  Might work ok for someone with real tiny hands who could use one button on the cursor and one on the alphanumerics.  Oh, one tip.  If you have one of the older, larger SIM cards it won't fit in the slot you see when you open the back.  Trick is there is a second slot just under that area  -- you have to slip the card in sideways.  Look for the symbol engraved on the bottom of the battery well.  So far the battery life is good, lasts 2~3 days on a charge.  Note -- I don't have Bluetooth turned on nor a data account, both of which use extra juice.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "OPINION DE VICARS", "Author": "Victor Vergara", "ReviewID": "R2MKLGHX3VX6RQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EL EQUIPO FISICAMENTE ES MUY ELEGANTE DE EXCELENTE CALIDAD PERO EL SOFTWARE PRESENTA CIERTAS FALLAS (ES MUY LENTO).", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEWARE NO WARRANTY", "Author": "N.

It's mis-marketed as a high-end phone, however.The camera is wonderful and the 2 music players superb. It's an American media phone. That is, heavy on the music & games, but not so great on the Internet. Motorola should've placed an operating system on this puppy. Nevertheless, the memory card is priceless.American carriers have found that Americans are willing to pay $20-30 MORE per month for a PDA so they needn't offer smartphones anymore. So, all of the so-called 'high-end,' non PDA phones are only high-end in the media department. The thing is, T-Mobile offers unlimited web browsing for a flat fee which makes smartphones a better buy than PDAs.High-end phones are media-rich and net-rich. This phone is only the former and, at that, has no FM radio.  This is one of T-Mobile high-end offers, but isn't quite high-end.Anyone who wants a phone which is high-end in the media and Internet fields, but doesn't want to pay $20 extra for a QWERTY keyboard should stick w/ T-Mobile and purchase an unlocked smartphone from AMAZON. It won't come w/ an American service plan because Americans are forced to pay the extra monthly fee for PDAs, but you can do everything a PDA-er can, sans the keyboard. In fact, the Nokia N80 does tons more than ANY PDA on the market right now.... but it's 360 bones.This is a great phone for teens... stylish folks who want good reception and media. If you want this plus slammin' web and MS Office offerings, I'd opt for buying a smartphone.
