{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing piece of hardware", "Author": "Kev", "ReviewID": "RK62S6HPDIGKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy my phone here, but I felt the need to leave a review about this device.Sony has finally delivered a top tier phone. The look and feel are absolutely premium. I get the feeling that I am using a solid piece of hardware, unlike that glossy plastic feel and look you get in products from Samsung SGS line and the new iPhone 5C. The stock rom (Android 4.2.2) is the 1st stock I actually really enjoy using and don't feel the need to switch over to a custom rom. I really don't understand why this phone is not getting 5/5. Sony has put in a lot of effort into the design. With the ever so slightly edges at the corners. A real nice touch with the glass backing. They even went as far as putting in two holes in the bottom right corner to be used for a camera wrist strap. Such as one like this Nikon 25770 AN-CP19 Black Strap. There is a nice discreet LED notification light at the top middle of the phone. A small but well liked feature. It flashes white when you have a notification, flashes red when on low battery and stays orange when charging.The screen is so nice. Out of the 5x3 inches of the phone the screen is 4.5x.2.5 inches. It looks right and when using it you really feel there is a really nice amount of screen real estate available to you. I am also glad they did not include and physical home button on the screen.I haven't even got to the best part. The phone is waterproof and dustproof receiving certificate of military resistance IP58. How great is that? The phone has 16 GB of internal storage. Most people will never go over 10GB of data their phone. I don't understand why people try to point out it has low internal storage space in comparison to the Note 3 which has 32GB or 64GB and can take external microSD. Great for the Note 3! But, who really needs that much internal data on a phone? Try going on the cloud. If you need the extra space the phone can take up to 64GB microSD for the people who need to horde data. If you need to go that route I suggest getting a Class 10 64GB such as this SanDisk SDSDQUA-064G-U46A Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with AdapterThe phones response time is so quick and smooth. I'm not going to give you the specifics on the internals but there is some seriously good hardware in the phone. I ran AnTuTu Benchmark and got a rating of 34789. If you do not know what that means, the Z1 is amazing. To give you a comparison the Note 3 got a 33814, HTC One 25651 SGS S4 25161 Nexus 7 20438. As you can see the Z1 is beating the rest in the benchmark scores which basically means it has the superior internal components.My only bad thing I have to say, is i'm afraid this lovely glass finish is going to get scratched so I had to get a very nice case for it and a screen protector. VSTN\u00aeSony Xperia Z1 Honami L39H ultra-thin PC Case Cover (For Sony Xperia Z1 Honami L39H, Black)If you are going to install the screen protector yourself I highly suggest getting some anti-static spray and apply it before installing the screen protector. Getting a spec or 2 of dust under the screen protector looks ugly. If you are going to be spending all this money on a phone, go the extra mile and buy the spray. ACL Staticide 530 General Purpose Topical Anti-Stat, 4 oz Trigger Sprayer BottleThis phone is the international edition so it recieves many different GSM radio frequencies and can be used with just about any GSM mobile network across the world. Just don't forget if you want to use your Mobile network data you have to put in the providers Access Point Name (APN). This can be found in Settings > More > Mobile networks > Access Point Names.You will also need to set up your MMS network if you want to receive or send mms (picture messages). Go to Settings > More... > Internet Settings. Hit Accept then Select your Service Provider. It will install Internet & MMS settings.The phone takes only microsim and is fully LTE capable, which I have no problem using on Tmobile's USA network. If you have a normal sim card and can't get a microsim immediatly, you can make your sim into a microsim with this. QQ-Tech Nano Sim Card Cutter Mini /Standard & Micro to Nano Sim for iPhone 5 iPhone 4, 4S and other Phones + Metal Tray + 2 Sim Adapters + Sand Paper, All in One Pack (In Stock Ready to Ship) Though, I highly suggest to get your providers official microsim if possible.If you are into rooting and installing custom roms, the phone is easy to root and to unlock the boot loader.The camera is 20.7MP. It takes good pictures during day time and has good flash for indoors, but the focus seems to \"stutter\". Nothing that can't be fixed, they just need to release a better software update to it. It is just an annoyance at most. The pictures I have taken so far have been really good. I haven't used it to take night time pictures yet, so I can't comment on that. There is a nice little added feature of a physical camera button on the bottom right. It makes it feel again as if you where taken pictures with a camera. It is a welcomed feature.If you are worried about breaking the small watertight flaps for the phone when charging it, you can get the Sony charging station for it. Sony DK31 Cradle or Patuoxun Magnetic Charger Charging Dock Station Cradle For Sony Xperia Z1 L39h /Xperia Z Ultra XL39h BlackOverall this phone is an A+.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone that now replaces my iPhone", "Author": "MajesticRa", "ReviewID": "R494I8PTEE11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it is best or one of the top phones on market right now. I was fascinated by Xperia Z which my best friend obtained this summer. So I bought this Z1 and absolutely happy with it (had iPhone before).1. 4G.I have T-mobile and 4g works with it. The phone has pretty good connection most of the time network is accessible.2. Sturdy.The phone was severely fallen to concrete floor for 2 times. No cracks or any scratches on the glass sides. Small scratches on a flank side but no dents or deformations. I'm happy it is so sturdy (or I'm so lucky)))2. Camera.It takes good looking pictures even in tough exposition conditions like sunsets, background illumination etc. Can't say it is much better than iPhone 5 camera but I find it generally better. Night pictures have high iso noise. Focus has been improved after the last update.3. USB.I really enjoy the fact that if I plug the phone to pc by common micro-usb cable it may be detected as a simple storage. No stupid iTunes (You can install sony app from the phone if so you WANT. But you don't have to. At all).4. Sync, Charge and Watertight flaps.I sync the phone by wireless and use dock station Sony DK31 Cradle to charge it. So I don't open watertight flaps at all.5. Water.I haven't taken any photos under water yet but I did call the phone in spa bath and got the phone under rain. Also once it was in sand. No problems. Since that I like the idea that I can receive a call if I'm interrupted in a shower))6. Software.I've found much of the Sony software useless. Can't say it is bad nor good I just get used to other apps. Android has a giant apps market with a lot of alternatives.7. Hardware.The hardware is pretty fast. I haven't found any slow running or laggy application or game yet.8. Battery.As all slim smartphones with high-end hardware you have to put the phone on charger often. It takes 1 day or less to discharge in normal mode. 2.5 - 3 days in stamina mode. 1.5 - 2 days in normal mode with battery saving soft installed. I'm sure it will worsen when the battery exhausted in 1-2 years.9. Screen.Pretty sharp. I've found it good but not exceptional. I mean it is good, bright and sharp for reading, surfing, gaming. But pictures on my old iPhone are looking the same good as on calibrated LCD. Pictures on Z1 looks worse than on PC. I know the description is very subjective, but that is what I can say. Video works fine.10. As a player.I REALLY like that I can download any player from market and listen possibly ANY file format. WITHOUT iTunes. After 3 years of using iDevices I couldn't get used to it. I mean, managing my library by folders, putting music to phone by simple copying what I need and WHERE I need is much much more convenient for me than using iTunes.11. Sound quality. I compared Z1 output with V90-HPA headphone preamp using Sure 535 earphones. Surprisingly the difference is not so big at all. Z1 sounds brighter while V90 sounds softer and deeper. But there is NO such a gap like between laptop internal sound card and V90. I would be really impressed if the phone sounded better. But... I'm still impressed with the comparison.FINALLY...I'm happy I have it. I would recommend it among all the other devices of the same class that are currently on the market.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "You can even use it as a phone", "Author": "Frans Hoynck van Papendrecht", "ReviewID": "RBE5UC1LM119C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do a lot of photography for my work, using a Canon dslr and two Nikon compacts.

When I started looking for a phone my top must have was the camera.  Sound weird?  Yeah, the sales guy thought so too when I finally went to look at new phones after doing my research.  I knew going in that the Xperia Z1 had a great camera so it was no surprise I was immediately pointed towards the Sony.  I'm a working Mom with a very active toddler.  I don't always have my nice camera with me (which is ironically also a Sony) to snap pictures all the time--so I take a lot of pictures on my phone.The Xperia Z1 takes amazing pictures.  It also takes the pictures quickly.  So when my toddler takes off, my Xperia Z1 keeps pace.  Bonus--water resistant.  And yes, that works too.In regards to other items I like on the phone--the screen size.  I have an iPhone for work and the screen just doesn't compare.  I'm not anti-apple (I'm deeply in love with my iPad), but as phones go the iPhone is just....a shrug for me.I've had no other problems with the phone.  Battery life seems good (I stream music all day at work and have not had a problem) and it's light weight.  But, again, it's all about the camera for me and this phone has that in spades.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Heero91", "ReviewID": "R1GXF9Q5NC4Z6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, the seller did send the LTE version of the phone as it was stated.For the phone itself it's definitely a top of the line device, with one of the best performance and android phone can give you. You could definitely take off a few points due to the fact of their speakers, but its an understandable tradeoff considering the water and dust proof.

I recommend it.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone overall!!!", "Author": "Rob B.", "ReviewID": "R37G10PBGY34LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best phones you can get without a doubt.  The feel of it is just amazing.  It feels like a top of the notch piece of hardware and not a plasticky cheap phone.  I have had it for three months now and I am absolutely satisfied with it.  It is extremely fast.  My last phone was an iPhone 4s and it was fast.  I tried the Samsung S4 and it was a lot less responsive.  It lagged when flicking and was not as fast as one would desire from a high end phone, so I went for the Z1 which is extremely responsive.  Apps open really fast and it never gets stalled.  You can really feel the power of the processor.  The screen is superb.  Very clear and true to colours and the size is just perfect.  The installed Chrome explorer works very well and every website renders fast and with no glitches.  Very customisable and widgets are great if you like to change your home screen once in a while and don't feel stuck with the same home screen forever as you are with the iPhones.  The Small Apps features is also great.  It lets you have two \"windows\" opened in the screen at the same time.  The camera takes outstanding pictures with good and bad light and works great underwater.  The special shutter button located in the side of the phone makes it very easy to operate.  The battery lasts a full day with heavy usage and has the low battery mode and stamina mode that really help when you are running low.  Led notifications on the front of the phone are really helpful too and very cleverly located.There are a couple of things that have been critiqued about this phone, like vision angles.  I really don't understand what is the big fuzz about that.  You never watch your phone holding it in an angle position.  At least I always hold it looking straight at me and it looks perfect.  Secondly, the size.  If you want a small phone this is not for you.  If you are tired of small phones where everything looks, well small, this is the one.  It is big, but thin and does not feel bulky at all when you are holding it, and it is definitely the most high-end-looking phone out there.  The speakers are not that great so if you use your phone a lot to hear music out loud, this is probably not the best option.  However, most people normally use headphones (which sound great) or bluetooth speakers which you can connect very easily with the NFC connection, just by holding the two devices close to one another.  And there is the issue of the scratches.  Turns out that Sony for reasons that I cannot understand, decided to cover the glass front and back screens with shatter-resitant screen protector that are very bad at scratch-protection.  The phone scratches just by using your fingers to unlock it or by flicking.  I was very dissapointed because of this so I called Sony and they told me about the factory-installed screen-protectors.  They told me that I could get rid of them but that I should take into account that the SONY logo would be gone since it is printed in the screen protector and not in the glass (??????!!!!!!).  Anyway, I decided to retire the front screen protector and leave the one in the back.  I lost the logo (which doesn't really bothered me), but the screen looks perfect and the glass is really good with scratches.Overall, I am very satisfied with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent performance", "Author": "Drakula \"Born2Die\"", "ReviewID": "R1V2BU5W0IRV57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update : After 10 days of using this phone I have to put that I was surprise with performance and options on this Z1.

This phone is a beast! Out of the past phones this one is all of the positives combined! Has the battery of the Note Series, the premiem materials of the HTC ONE, and the Dev support of the S4. When I first opened this phone I loved how nice it felt in my hand. Now the phone wasn't perfect though! I believe the model I received was for a German T-mobile carrier. It had a bit of bloat, but was neutralized after I flashed factory 4.2.2 firmware. Since then it's been dead reliable and is often a conversation starter! If you're not getting data or LTE, make sure your APN settings are correct under the settings. Okay on with the review, It's battery lasts me all day (5-6hr screen on time @ 15hr+ overall life). If you're not getting near those figures make sure you cycle the battery a few times (Cycle = full charge to 0 percent battery). Then there's the Sony Camera. It performs great and shoots excellent quality photos. It's waterproof and dust proof. The only con of this phone is the tiny sound it produces, but his is the trade off for being water proof.The only other Android snapdragon competitors are G2, Nexus 5, and the Galaxy Note 3. Overall, the device is great and durable. I'd highly recommend it to people who are interested in a mature and elegant phone.**Update** I found out I have a dead pixel where the captive buttons are on the bottom part of the screen. I am a little upset that I only had this phone for a few weeks and had this problem. I enjoyed my short ownership with it, but I am upset a $600 device would suffer from this.

The screen is not a AMOLED but still, it's good enough for me. The camera has tons of possibilities. The 4 stars is due to the glass screen that tends to scratch way too easily, although it supposed to be reinforced glass. Also, the speaker for the ear should be lower on the phone.

I picked it on the basis of specs - it has no breakout feature (such as the Nokia Lumia 1020's knock-your-socks-off 41 meg camera), but unlike every other phone I looked at, it has zero deal breakers.  The screen is large and has excellent resolution, the styling suits me perfectly (looks good, feels good and very little plastic), it's water- and dust-resistant.  It works great on my month-at-a-time t-mobile service (unlimited data and more talk minutes than I'll ever use).  It has a fast quad-core main processor and a fast graphics processor.  But specs don't tell the whole story.  It's great to use as well.  Sony, Google, and t-mobile have so far worked together seamlessly to provide me with a really nice phone.  And the camera, though second to the Nokia 1020, is really really good.  The Z1 upgraded to Android 4.4.2 automatically.  I honestly don't see why more people don't buy these phones.  It's flat-out terrific.  My only qualm is the fact that the warranty on these unlocked international-model phones is somewhere between slim and none.

Some people think this is not really important but there are a multitude of circumstances where your phone could get wet unintentionally.I find the size to be perfect, the screen resolution to be much kinder on the eye than The Note. The phone has a much more refined and quality feel to it. It is a well engineered phone.I used to be a loyal Sony customer...i moved away for a while and now i am back.

Here are some pros bout the Z1 20MP CAMERA, water proof dust resistance IP CERTIFIED which is the best feature on the phone. I got a lot of compliments. 2nd is the battery life. as long you turn off your data on your phone your battery will last all day which I always do. When I listen to my music or watch videos/movies on my Z1 i come home down to 50% usage battery life left over. I currently use net10 service powered by AT&T; which have LTE to replace my previous carrier AT&T; which over charges on data and calling. I have a 32GB sd micro card but you can expand it up too 128GB memory. The only bad thing bout the Z1 is you CAN'T REMOVE the battery which I have no complaints on. Plus if you drop your phone the screen gets scratches which i have minor but not damage and i recommend that you BUY  A CASE for this glass covered body which is made from TEMPERED glass still very fragile. Overall i have this phone since OCT 13' never have any issues. just make sure when you get it up date your phone which i have 4.4.2 KIT KAT. You have to install the MEDIA GO MANAGER if you want to organize your music plus update your ANDROID OS through SONY PC COMPANION. When you install the PC COMPANION make sure all your browsers is close and any other folders are close too cause it will take a while for your phone to update by USB plug in since SONY DON'T do OVA ( OVER THE AIR update).

The reason why some people might say that a 13mp camera phone might produce better results is because those phones do not have true Hd 1080p screens!! You can see every imperfection with this screen Cuz it's just that good, other phones are not good enough to see the smallest pixels to the dot. Take these photos and load them on a computer and they are look professionaly finished!Color saturation is amazing!!  beats every phone and it's comparable to Hd TV's... Sony is just that good with technology.The att and Verizon model are not out anywhere in the world so the c6906 does not exist!!!!!!!  it's in the bluebooks but Sony doesn't plan on rolling them out soon.... Shows how little some people know!This phone is crazy fast and is very elegant and sturdy.This phone is comparable to the lumia 1020. The lumia uses a 5mp camera hardware and it's the software along with a slightly bigger camera sensor that makes the photos DIGITALLY 40 megapixels, the xperia has true 20 mp hardware built into the phone.The phone does not have sharp corners, are you kidding me? They're rounded fairly well...I've gotten stopped around 15 times in the first week of having this phone because people were that amazed by it.Oh, and also....  the video on this phone is phenomenal.
