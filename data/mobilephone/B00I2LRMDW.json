{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BLU Studio 5.0 II Unlocked Dual SIM Phone", "Author": "Robert J", "ReviewID": "R2W8MZ0KZ57GCO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Studio 5.0 II is a fairly nice way to do inexpensive, yet big.  The manual is sketchy on a few things, like sim card, micro-sd card placement, which can make for a bit of headache for the non-techie types.  The stock Launcher has that search bar on the top of all screens, and wont let you position some things the way you might like, but, by getting Nova Launcher, or another off the googlePlay  site, all these flaws go away.  Sound on calls is clear and not tinny to the other party, although the earpiece could be better, it is usable. The micro-sd slot is under the back cover, which is a pain, in my opinion.  The ips screen is great on color, and evenly lit.  The 512mb of working ram may be small to some, so consider your needs carefully.  It may not be a perfect fit for some, but its quite usable if you want a low cost android phone.  The 5mp camera takes VERY nice pictures, although the front facing camera is weak, and mine needs serious color correction. In My Opinion... Tech support is not effective to call, but do respond to emails within a 24-48hr window, so dont expect fast answers if you have a question, but they WILL answer.  This sucker IS huge, making cases that fit a rare find in local stores, compare to a Galaxy Note 3, or LG G flex, so best you can hope for is generic cases or holsters, as the buttons and charge port  dont line up with the other phones.  Hmmm, maybe check some of the great buys on Amazon? :-)  After buying this phone sight unseen, I would have no problem buying one of BLU's  more expensive models based on what I have seen and handled, but think this will last me a while if handled carefully.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "laura", "ReviewID": "R16T2QX4MWMSAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this phone 2 days ago and love it, The only problem I have with it is front camera has poor quality, and the phone is a little big but it dont bother me too much.

I've never owned an unlocked phone before. I bought it because I wanted a prepaid phone to use for my business phone. I have it turned on with Straight Talk's service and it works great! I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone. I knew before purchasing that the front camera was low grade and the rear camera was 5.0 MP because I read the specs on the BLU Products website before purchasing, so nothing about the specs bothered me. There were no surprises because I knew what I was buying. If you want a great phone with a great camera I would recommend one of the other BLU Products phones with a higher grade front camera. The features on this phone are amazing.The biggest thing on the list of amazing features is the conference call feature. You can initiate a conference call and disconnect one line without disconnecting all of the callers and having to call back. Another feature I loved was the call waiting. When switching calls, it does not prevent you from initiating a conference call after one caller disconnects. I run into this issue with my personal cell on the Verizon Wireless network.(upadated) I did have one issue with this phone. I could not figure out how to get the SD card in the slot, but someone commented on my review and told me how to. View the comment if you cannot figure it out. Another minor issue is with the text messaging. At times there is a slight glitch that will select a emoticon/emoji in the middle of your typing. It doesn't happen all of the time, but it does happen.This phone is the perfect work phone. I get all SMS, MMS, and e-mail messages seamlessly and there are no issues with the phone thus far. I have had the phone connected for 8 days now and I love it. I'm seriously considering leaving Verizon Wireless because this is a GSM phone and does not work on CDMA (Verizon Wireless, Sprint, Boost Mobile) networks.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is fantastic", "Author": "Jose Estrada \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R1SZPHF92K2B1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I am just going to rate this for what it is...an inexpensive version of a Samsung Galaxy S4. I am a major Apple fan, and have transitioned all of my PCs, tablets, and phones over to the dark side...however, as a previous Android user, I like the flexibility that they offer.Since my dad needed a phone, I heard about the BLU Studio phone, and for the price of a new phone on a 2 year contract, I got this beauty for him, and boy, am I impressed!The phone setup was the easiest transition I've ever done, and I've had all carriers. The phone has 2 sim cards, which I don't need but find very cool.Straight off the box there is a set of headphones, charger, cover, and screen protector...the only thing missing was a SD card, and those are so cheap now, you could have a 64GB for $30.I've downloaded a ton of apps already, and my dad seems like a kid with a new toy. The only problem is both him and my teenager won't stop texting at the dinner table, but that's not the phone's fault! :)", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "win", "ReviewID": "R3D0KLE4YP7VS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im a 23 year old student,I have had an iphone for the longest time, and just switched over to andriod and this phone is amazing. I have used the every iphone up to the 5c, and this phone  is up in the runnings with them. Big screen, fast processor, not a lot of bloatware that you get with the galaxies. It is all around a simple great phone.The video quality is good, not perfect but it is better than i expected. it is almost HD, but not quite. It plays netflix very well.The speaker is good, the head phone jack is ok.Call quality is ok i need a little more time with it.Camera is good for what i need it for. 5.0 is not tooo bad. Front camra is similar to the iphone 4 in quality or the ipad 2.The touch screen is ok, im still getting used to the texting on the phone.overall it is a great phone for the money and feel good having it.oh also i have straight talk and i use a micro-sim. but to use a micro sim you have to position it just right for it to read your sim card bc it will be too small so make note of that. (i used my iphone 4s sim) or do as another guy mentioned on here and by another sim.anyway I love the phone and the Size wish i could try more of this brands phone and do more reviews. may add a review on youtube bc this phone is that good.Who should buy this phone?people who dont want to be in a contract but also dont want to pay over $500 for a large screen phone to do basic web browsing, emailing, texting, neflixing, and some gaming( havnt play many games yet on the phone, but it did have some lag while playing splashy fish).This is just my oppinion, i have never owned a galaxy s anything so i am just comparing it to the iphones.I hope this helps you choose the right phone for you. it was either this or the $300 pure life by blu. that will be my next phone!!!!", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "good product", "Author": "Endreina Garcia", "ReviewID": "R2UGRX8OPQ375R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works perfectly in Venezuela with Movistar and movilnet not have any problem with these very good operators and good quality product", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Fletcher \"fletcher\"", "ReviewID": "R8CO70R8WRIX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the 5\" screen.

I was surprised at how large it was (length & width), but after working with the phone over the weekend I've gotten used to it especially coming from an iPhone 5 which was longer but not as wide.Pros: Everything works well. I'm using a 64gb SD card, Straight Talk 4G Sim and so far no issues. Cameras decent. Speed is pretty good.Cons: The software installed is not the most current available but phone is capable to get updates I suppose once manufacture releases them (dum). Also, on occasion some apps have crashed while in use or while others are in use (problem but not major).Overall for the price and if you dont want a new cell contract this is a good buy for your buck. It was brand new not used or refurbished. Came with battery, screen protector and cover. The only other draw back is because this phone is soooooooooooo large its hard to find a case but Amazon does appear to sell them but hard to find any locally.So give it a try, all this is just my opinion based on my use - you may feel differently and thats okay.

So far he really likes the phone and it does all that is promised. The look is sleek and classy and there is no difference in appearance from other higher priced phones. It is easy to set up the dual SIM cards. But the SD card is a bit problematic to install.  There is a small metal clip to the far left that must be opened by gently pushing up (towards the top of the phone or in the same direction of the arrow) that you must needs to be raised before it can be installed.  The dual SIM is a very nice feature as you can keep contacts and information from more than one source. The Bluetooth and GPS Navigator both work well.If you see a message at the a message at the bottom that says \"no service\" next to the name of  your provider, (eg. T-Mobile) don't be alarmed, it's because you have two SIM cards and you did not activate service on both. It will go away if the phone has two service providers.  I THINK THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE especially if you travel. You can use your U.S. SIM and a local provider SIM.Things that can be improved are: higher volume, especially for the ringers; definitely more storage space, 1GB is seriously inadequate for today's high paced/high tech world; the camera needs improvement (both front and back) Pics indoor even with the flash and lighting is not crisp and clear; increasing the MPX to about 10 would readily solve this issue; and adding about 1.5 or so pixel to the front facing instead of a VGA would help a great deal.The speed is great and getting on the internet is fast and easy whether for email; Facebook, Google or anything else. There are no issues with messaging whether instant or hangouts although I saw comments that there were lag times.  Despite a few negatives, I really like this phone and so does my hubby and we will get another one gladly.It is a great phone for the money if you can live with the few shortcomings mentioned above.

With speed test I get about 10mb/s down and 2mb/s up speeds. It isn't real 4g speeds but plenty fast for me. There is a fix for the gps taking a long time to get a lock. WiFi signal strength is good, at least at my home. I get a echo when I'm speaking, the other party doesn't hear it. Call quality is average. If your a heavy phone user your battery may not make it a full day. For the price I paid, I would call this phone one of the best phones available anywhere near this price or even up to $100 more.

Unbelievable Price!", "Author": "Tom Koz \"Tom K.\"", "ReviewID": "R3RX396E9XFORG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As promised below, I have returned to give you an update on this phone. I have had it for over two months and I still absolutely love it. It is great. Battery life is fantastic and I truly feel I got a considerable value for the money I spent. My wife's phone is at the end of its life and I am getting another one for her! I have had no problems with it whatsoever and would buy another BLU product without hesitation!I have had this phone for a week and I love it. It fits in a dress shirt pocket or any shirt pocket just fine. I keep my display screen toward the inside of the pocket so that the display does not get scratched by a pen or pencil.The screen is brilliant and the phone feels good in the hand. I coupled this with a Straight Talk sim card and for the price, I could not be happier. My only hope is that it lasts, , , , time will tell. I may be back in a few months to update this review.Here are a few things I experienced that I want to share.* This phone takes the larger (not the micro) sim card.* The tiny little manual that comes with the phone comes was printed in a very very small font and it is very generic. I did not find it to be very useful. A note in the box with an address for a manual in PDF or a tutorial on Youtube would have been nice. I have owned other cell phones, so I kind of knew the routine to get started.* I carefully removed the battery cover at its starter notch with a medium thickness guitar pic and that seemed to work well. The cover is very tight which I'm happy with.* I had to be careful about which sim card slot I was using. I mistook slot 2 for slot 1. No big deal to swap it though. The sim slots are marked in very very tiny print on each slot. I think the diagram in the phone is printed upside-down.* I discovered I needed to slide the Micro SD cover horizontally with my finger to unlock the Sim card holder.* Straight Talk was good about providing the APN numbers that I needed to get started. The only problem I had then was attaching photos in mms, ,  BUT, , , then, I went to the BLU website and they show how to address that issue in their very first FAQ question at their support forum.  Voila!Someone else wrote it took them hours in another review somewhere to resolve their setup and several fellow reviewers helped point me in the right direction. I hope my experiences shared here can save you a little time if this is your first BYOP to Straight Talk (or some other GSM provider as well). Thanks to information that other reviewers left for me, this was very easy to set up.Battery life is great but keep in mind, this phone has a 5 inch screen and so far, I have not found anything about this phone that I dislike. For the price, I got an incredible amount of smartphone, earbuds, screen protector and phone cover in the box.

I have a Galaxy s4 with T mobile service so I really only wanted and mp3 player. The biggest factor in my choosing is that this little phone comes with an FM radio tuner that can also record from fm stations. I kept running out of data every month because I would use apps to listen to the radio online. I tried several mp3 players including Ipod nano but I did not like the functionality. I was able to get started with this phone right out of the box. I first put on an old SIM card that was not active and a 32g micro sd. After 3 days of using it I went to my local T moobile store and got an active sim card. I am using this one way more than my Galaxy s4 and I really like it. It came with Android 4.2.2 already installed so it is comparable with any other recent phone. I noticed that the processor is a little slow for texting but I am an old man that don't really need texting.

I use H20 wireless.Design and Screen: Very thin and fits comfortable in the hand. It feels light and the screen is the perfect size. Its not too small and not too big. The screen is 5 inches.Battery Life: Its battery life is average and acceptable. I can moderately text, call, game, listen to music, etc. throughout the day without charging it.Screen and Resolution: EXCELLENT! It's beautiful and clear. The colors are very vivid and the graphics are detailed.Speed: This phone isn't the fastest phone on the planet. Its noticeably slower and more laggy than the Iphone 5 or the Samsung. Although the speed is acceptable to me, so do except some lag when playing games or sudden crashes to heavy apps.Camera: This is probably one of the most complained faults about this phone. The back camera takes decent pictures, but the front isn't very good. So I don't recommend using this phone for video chat. If you are the type of person who takes a lot of \"selfies\", I do advise for you to look for a more expensive phone. Memory: This phone has 512 MG RAM, which isn't a whole lot to most people's desire. For me it was ok since I don't download a lot of apps, but do be aware when you are downloading a lot of apps of how much this phone can store.Overall, this phone is extremely good with the price. I would definitely buy this phone for someone just looking for the basics in a smartphone.

It took a week to download all of ESV Bible, then hid or lost the 66 Bible boks of audio.  Another week of downloading got ESV Bible playing strangely but phone switched to KJV Bible.
