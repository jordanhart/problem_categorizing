I cant figure out how to get the internet on my phone but that is the least important to me.  I have the internet at home.

The camera is not good - I got what I paid for and what I excpected to get.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "don,t buy it..", "Author": "k & J", "ReviewID": "R3M77V1P7UBSZP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "want to wash your money. buy this one.  just  one week used it.  i need go to best-buy buy other phone.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get your  money's worth,  no less no more.", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R2Q1S0720C33J6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Does what a phone should.
