It's not the amount, is the fact that you sold something that is not true.Unfortunately I can not make the return and get my money back, since I live in Venezuela and is more expensive to return it.I just hope to have international warranty, I really would feel very disappointed with amazon.com if it doesn't.About the smartphone, previously had a Bold 9700 and migrated to this phone was a giant leap.Very fast, VGA resolution, 512 MB ''of program memory, 768 MB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage, very bad battery life...Compatible with 1,2,5,6 bands such as AT & T, so in Venezuela with Movistar up the H+ as it should.If you live in venezuela, you should know that you have to paid BsF. 100 for unlocking this device....", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best Blackberry ever built", "Author": "carevalo", "ReviewID": "RH8PF1W8CDV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned 5 Blackberry devices in a period of 6 years.  The one I liked the most was the Blackberry Bold 9000.  The last I owned was the Blackberry Torch 9800 and it was the worst nightmare I ever had in my professional life.  So I started looking desperately for another device, even seriously considered going back to the old and known Bold 9000 but they are not built anymore.  I do not like touchscreen, I do NOT need touchscreen, I type very fast, \"I need tools, not toys\".So, I stumbled upon the Bold 9900 with a certain hesitation.  The \"faster processor\", \"touchscreen\" ads did not touch my heart, I was already heartbroken with the Torch.  But I bought it.  What a pleasant surprise !  It was BETTER than the Bold 9000, but improved !  Instead of the trackball, the touchpad now is a real update, the screen size is just perfect, the combination of phone, internet, email, GPS, compass, etc., makes sense for a power user like me, taking care of hundreds of customers with just one device for emails, SMS, phone calls, instant messages.  It is blazingly fast, sharp screen, wow !I am seriously considering buying another one before RIM decides to update it and scrap the good job they did with this one.  It always happens to multinational companies that some marketing initiative designed to supposedly innovate and bring better numbers destroys a company's own market. Those experiments work well with PowerPoint presentations, endless conference calls with Engineering departments and hundreds of layers of middle managers but end up being disasters with the consumer.  I am crossing my fingers so that the good people working at RIM today stay there and keep providing us with good tools.Make no mistake.  This phone will reinstate RIM's reputation as the prime manufacturer of business-oriented smartphones.

Outside the box, they pasted a sticky Blackberry - 9900 Unlocked and a printed MEI ID. Surprisingly when i opened the box, i saw a Verizon phone - which generally CDMA (9900 is purely GSM). Then i start the device and see in the settings, it was a Blackberry 9930 instead of 9900. I was very upset in the begining but i have thought that they may made a mistake when packing. But then when i replace the back cover and the battery to check the MEI ID printed on, i found that the MEI ID was exactly the same with the one on the sticky note on box. Deal Grabbers has done it on purpose, they fake the device (9930 which they are selling at the about $40 cheaper than the 9900).
