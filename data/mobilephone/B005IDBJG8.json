Even at that, I need to keep reminding the camera to save the pictures there, and not the internal storage--which, have I mentioned?--is miniscule.Why, oh, why, TMobile, do you not give your consumers the ability to remove software from their phone that they do not want?My contract is up in March and I'm done.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warranty replacements fee keeps them in business.", "Author": "Hmpayton", "ReviewID": "R1W52U34MDS123", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I originally got this phone with a new line in September of 2011. I'm now on my 5th replacement through the warranty exchange program and, while it's nice to have that protection, I shouldn't have to replace the phone that much. First phone: Sept 21, 2011- October 22,2011 (brand new)- Screen no longer turned on when the keyboard was slid out. Second phone: October 22, 2011- November 15, 2011- Same deal. Third phone: November 15, 2011- December 28, 2011- Phone reset every time the keyboard shut. Fourth phone: December 28, 2011- January 2, 2013- FINALLY got a phone that worked for longer than a month. Stopped being recognized by any computer as mass storage. Fifth phone: January 2, 2013- ??  Moving on: Thanks to all the normal bloatware, the phone's memory is eaten up quicker than most Samsungs. Even with app-killers or just clearing out old data periodically, still insane how quickly it gets bogged down. Battery life is good, except the fact that the damn battery only lived for just over a year and I had to buy a new one. I kept the old one to see what would happen...now it's so swollen it won't even stay in the phone. (Ok, so that's not a phone deal...but seriously, the last time I had this issue was with a first-gen Lithium-Ion battery years ago.) Soft keyboard is nice in a tactile way but gets stained, with no options for cleaning unless you disassemble the phone, too easily. Upsides: Phone is rather sturdy physically. Didn't have phones 1,2, or 3 long enough to drop them but phone 4 was dropped numerous times and lived to tell the tale of a new text message. For being free, it's done everything I needed it too. No problems with sound quality, dropped calls, etc. Easy to work with and would be best fit for a starter smart phone. Blue paint chips easily but the under material is also blue so it doesn't look terrible when it chips. (A case would solve that issue though as well.) In summary: Don't buy this phone if you know up from down (second smart phone I'd ever have and was coming off of a Huawei Comet) or if you don't plan to carry insurance for the warranty replacement deal.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "worked for a year", "Author": "C.

It is not expensive, and as long as you don't abuse it, it lasts for a long time. I have one going on three years and it's fine.It does overload or say \"out of memory\" if you have a ton of apps, or a ton of pictures, but it has a memory card for pictures (it comes with the item when you buy it). And I do mean a ton, I didn't delete any until there will over 100...So the complaints are coming from people who have overloaded a phone with benefits. This is not a ipad, or an iphone5, but it's perfectly capable of getting the job done. Buy it if you love the benefits of modern technology, but not if you are in need of a ton of memory, that is really all one can say to complain about it, and it wasn't made that way to begin with.I also must say I much prefer this keypad style as the touchscreen kinds can make mistakes. It is also a nice small size.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "** DON'T BUY THIS PHONE **", "Author": "ROBERT BONNER", "ReviewID": "R2S732559QWYGQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This by far has to be the worst first smart phone experience that one could have. TMobile & Samsung should be ashamed for sticking people with this crappy phone.If you want to find out for yourself - simply Google Samsung Gravity Smart internal memory errors & you'll see the sea of complaints about about this phone's ridiculously low internal memory.I bought this Samsung Gravity Smart phone in November 2011 primarily because of the Wi-Fi calling, large screen & QWERTY keyboard thinking I really only needed to be able to make calls when I'm at home & my crappy TMobile reception fades out. This phone has a shamefully non-existent 150 Megabytes of internal memory compared to most phones that have at least 4 gigabytes.So what does that mean for you?;it means that you'll never be able to install ANY APP what so ever. It also means that you won't be able to receive any text messages because the memory will always be too low to allow the phone to receive messages. You'll be able to send them, but you'll daily have to delete every text message.Trust me even if you're thinking that's okay, I'll only be using this phone for just this or that, I don't need a bunch of apps or games - it won't be okay... it won't :( You will be frustrated.Even though it has virtually non-existent internal memory, T-Mobile & Samsung still chose to ship it preinstalled with 100 Mb of junk software that further helps to make the problem worst.Please save yourself the inevitable headache that is sure to come & buy a different phone.Also when you call T-Mobile to complain about the phone not functioning properly, you'll literally get a rep that tells you to check to see if apps are installed on the SD card. Well most apps aren't written to be installed on SD so that suggestion sucks. Also, even though an app may be saved to SD, the data it generates while you're using it goes in the internal memory. So guess what, you're still suck!If you look on Samsung's site for internal memory problems, well here's how severe it is. They answer every other question about this phone online... YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM TO GET INTERNAL MEMORY ISSUES ADDRESSED!That's how bad this phone is, they don't even want to answer the questions in a public forum. They throw rocks & then hide their hands! They're ashamed of even making this phone with this ridiculously low functionality.If you only want a pretty phone that you can only make calls on, then this is the phone for you. It has pretty colors, nice screen, the keyboard isn't that good - it doesn't have arrow keys & a lot of the symbols take forever to get to like $.Again to sum it up 150Mb of internal memory is a horrible thing for anyone, even a teen of housewife to deal with. And I got the phone free & I still paid too much for it. With an extended 2 year T-Mobile contract (which they messed up the billing & charged me 3 times what I should've been paying - TMobile you all have to get it together - please) & it still isn't worth what I paid for it.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of Issues", "Author": "Mely", "ReviewID": "R2ZSHPOSB9IDN9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first smartphone ever and I was very excited to get it but I had nothing but problems with it. It has a serious memory storage issue of just a few hundred MB even though I inserted a memory card with 8 GB of memory. This phone did not allow me to use the external memory and I even took it to a tmobile store and they told me this phone just couldn't use external memory so I better just get another phone. I was sooo frustrated that I could not even receive texts for days because the memory was full. I had to manually delete data at least once a week and that would cause me to delete my contacts. It was also sooo embarrassing because the calls would drop all the time! Even when I was talking to possible empoyers! I felt awful. I hope no one has to go through this. I can't believe such a dis-functioning phone is on the market and actually has good reviews. For me, this phone was basically a warning that there are some awful products out there.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone won't last its warranty period", "Author": "caralily", "ReviewID": "R3J8GCB22TNQG6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved a lot about this phone when I first got it. I prefer slide keyboard texting to touchscreen and wanted a phone with wifi and 3g capability. Being on t-mobile pay as you go, this limits the choices of phones, so I chose this one, having had a regular gravity previously that still works. Within two months, I began having to delete my data almost daily if I wanted to use wifi or 3g. Then, six months in, the phone started dying over a week-long period. One day, calls worked fine and everything was fine. Then, I tried to call for a reservation at a restaurant and found that I could only be heard if speaker was off, but could only hear people with speaker on. So, I reset my phone, hoping that would help - it didn't - and then continued to use the camera and texting features as I searched for the receipt. A few days later, the touchscreen started freezing once and awhile until it stopped working altogether. My phone had a few scratches on the back cover but was otherwise kept in good condition, mind you. Again, I did a factory reset on my phone to no avail. Unfortunately, I've moved 3 times since I bought the phone at a store, so I don't think I'll find the receipt for warranty service, and I can't call the service number anyway because I don't have a phone. Really, a phone should not just stop working for no reason after 6 months, especially because warranty service usually has a fee. I've heard that most of these phones end up getting turned in under warranty, too.
