Her phone was a prepaid T-Mobile, so we looked around for a decent replacement.  Costco had this phone for sale for prepaid use at a very reasonable price, far less than above.The good:Free maps from Ovi Maps.  Free navigation can be had by downloading maps and voice and telling the navigation program to work offline.  Our phone came pre loaded with the entire US, which takes about 2 gig of the 4 gig card which was included.Free access to the Ovi App store. We have been downloading some free apps and so far, no charges against our minutes... knock on wood.Small size but very high resolution.  It's about the length of an iPhone, but only about 3/4 as wide.  The screen is 3.2\" but has a resolution of 360 x 640 pixels. It only has a 2mp camera, but that's plenty to shoot great video.Bluetooth is fully functional. You can transfer files using it, unlike some other phones that only allow earpiece or speakerphone use through BT.It comes with a 4 gig card, but with maps and pictures and music and whatever else, I can see it filling fast.  It can take up to a 16 gig card.The so so...It comes with a little \"guitar pic\" thing to use the pressure sensitive touch screen.  You can use your fingers too, but sometimes the things you wish to click are too small for fingers, so the pic is the better choice.  Time will tell whether the touch screen is durable.No wifi.  Wifi would have been nice, but I guess this is what you give up at this price. Oh well.As a phone...Calls are clear and no issues with call quality.  It has a proximity sensor so you don't accidentally press buttons when you hold it against your face.  Dialing or texting by feel cannot be done since there is no physical number pad, it's totally touchscreen.

The phone itself is great, excellent reception, sound and call quality. The interface isn't bad. People who cut down Symbian typically never gave it a chance, or used it. It is a FINE interface for just about everything you would need to do. It doesn't look as cool as the newer DROID or iPhone GUI, however look at the price compared to them, and you don't have to sell your soul to AT&T; or T-Mo. Battery is OK. Email support is better than before. OVI Maps is really good for navigation, not so good for finding points of interest. I would recommend Google Maps as a back up for finding Points of Interest, getting that address, then putting them into OVI Maps and use it's navigation.PROsCheap Unlocked Phone (For use with AT&T;'s 3/3.5G network)Free NavigationDecent EmailSound Quality/Call QualityNo Contract NeededComes with some pre-loaded AppsCONsSymbian OS can take a little time to learn - it is NOT difficult - it is LOGICALBattery could be better for a 1320mah BatterySmall Data CableOVI Store - Getting Better All The TimeOVI Maps iffy for POI'sNot the fastest phone/GUI out - but ample - even for a heavy userNO Wifi - But for it being so cheap you can't complain", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the money. Has all the features!", "Author": "MyPenName", "ReviewID": "R1KXVSUJY1WY7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say that this phone is an excellent value in every aspect. It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T; so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data!!  I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous \"Smartphone Plan\" fee. The camera works great even though it has no flash. You just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings. The internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an SD card for more memory. My husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an iPod or any other MP3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work (he is a residential/commercial remodeler) if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music. You can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature. The touch screen is great, the screen size is great. It has fast response time from input or touch. We have absolutely no complaints at all.Some people might not like the idea of not having wifi, but if you think about it, if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid $30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use AT&T; internet. With this phone you can just get the $10 unlimited data plan and be done with it. The internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience. Very happy with the purchase and the price is amazing. Call quality is great as with all Nokias.

Onal", "ReviewID": "RNXRLFSWQ6Z9N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this phone. The dealbreaker is that it doesn't support 3G on Tmobile network. It is roughly 3 times slower compared to an TM506 when downloading. On the product page if you look carefully, it does show that 3G is not supported on Tmobile. This should be emphasized more -- here in the US you basically have two options AT&T; and Tmobile, and if you have Tmobile you are pretty much out of luck.Hotmail ActiveSync -- Exchange implementation on this phone only partly supports hotmail activesync. After doing a software upgrade (which wasn't obvious) on the phone its hotmail email support is actually not bad. It synchronizes 2-way with your inbox and other folders. It also synchronizes with hotmail calendar, but only the main calendar, couldn't figure out how to synchronize with other calendars (like the birthday calendar). Contacts is the worst -- it didn't synchronize in my case. I probably had a couple of hundred contacts maybe that is the reason.There is also a nokia email app that supports multiple services which has a decent interface. I don't think it supports custom folders on hotmail though.I've read bad reviews about its touchscreen, but it is not too bad. It is no iPhone, but given it doesn't require an expensive data plan and its price, it is certainly perfectly fine.Browser seems to be working fine.Didn't have issues with GPS locking, it was pretty reasonable. (similar to TM506, maybe a bit slower than iPhone)I haven't tried gmail synchronization yet.It does take a bit of an effort to get all its software updated and configured.I probably would have kept this phone if I had AT&T.;", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone if you can get it cheaply", "Author": "Joseph \"jck09\"", "ReviewID": "RN2WTQQGCA1NA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just over a year ago, I got one of these for free with a two year contract with T-Mobile.  Fourteen months later, I'm still delighted.  It's no Iphone or Android, but as a platform for phone calls, texting, music, and GPS, it's been great.This is a basic smartphone using Nokia's symbian operating system. Using the internet or a PC, you can connect to Nokia's \"OVI Store\" to download apps, update map files, etc.  I basically just wanted a phone, but the non-smart phones seem to be falling behind, and the smart phone features are nice, even without a data plan. Small touches like a hidden off-screen touch point to launch the media player, smooth switching between portrait mode and landscape mode, and other nice interface design add up, and I have ended up really liking this.There are a few minor annoyances, but I can live with them. In particular, it's a pain that Nokia has a proprietary charging point instead of charging through the micro-USB port that Nokia uses for data connections. The contact book seems limited - you can only store 2 phone numbers per contact, which is a pain when someone has work, mobile and home numbers, and there is no way to assign personalized ring tones. Since it's a smart phone, those issues may be resolvable by getting the right apps, though. The biggest drawback is that there are nowhere NEAR the number of apps for this that you can get for an Android phone or i-phone, but you have to figure you get what you pay for. The phone is thicker than an i-phone and feels a little plasticy, but still fits fine in my pocket. (I invested in a screen protector to cut down on scratches).  I wish that it had wi-fi so that I could use the internet features when in hot spots.As a phone, it's great. Reception and call quality are as good as anything else I've used, and it works well with my Jawbone Icon bluetooth headpiece. Texting is also good - it only took me a day or so to get used to using the virtual qwerty keyboard with my fat fingers, and at this point I can type quickly with few or no misses. The phone defaults included vibration feedback when you type keys, but that was easy to turn off, and also has handwriting recognition. The music and video player is fine but hasn't blown me away. Like most phones, the camera is adequate for spur of the moment shots, but has no flash or optical focus, so I still carry my point and shoot if I think I may need photos.The nicest surprise is that this phone comes with OVI maps - a decent gps and routing program that is completely free.  You can download maps over the USB cable from your PC, so the map program works fine for a cheapskate like me who won't pay for data.I'm too cheap for a data plan, so I just have a phone plan plus texting.  (If I was getting data, I might spring for a used Iphone 3g or gs or an android platform).  There is no wifi, so I use the PC connection to load songs, maps, apps, and videos. Unfortunately, Nokia's OVI store will only download directly to phones over a data connection, so if I want apps, I need to get them from the non-nokia sites. (Grrr! Nokia could at least allow me to download the friken FREEWARE to my PC!)The screen is not as responsive as an i-phone, but is fine. Instead of a stylus, Nokia included a \"plectrum\" - a guitar pick thing that you can attach by a lanyard. I've left mine off and just use my fingers or the back of a pen. The scroll bars are occasionally hard to work with my fingers, but I usually get them by the second try.The phone can take up to 16 GB of memory, and includes a 4 GB chip, which is nice of Nokia and has been adequate so far. (Of course, if you want the street maps for the whole US, that costs 1.4 GB right there, so I may be upgrading my memory soon).All in all, I'm very pleased. The phone does what I want - makes calls, sends texts with a qwerty keyboard, and does a lot more. A great value for the price.Accessory recommendations: My favorite accessories so far have been:- Jawbone ERA Headset:  A pricey bluetooth earpiece, but awesome for those who aren't bothered by the fit issues.- SanDisk 16 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-016G (Bulk Packaging): So that I can carry tons of music, video, and maps.- Accessory Combo For Nokia Nuron 5230: Screen protector, belt case, car charger, and silicone skin.- Rapid Travel Home Wall Charger (CLA) for Nokia Nuron 5230: The proprietary charging port is enough of a pain that I wanted a second charger for the office.- Black Mesh Gym Armband Case Cover for Apple iPhone: Originally bought for an iphone, but great for using this phone as an mp3 player/radio/etc while working out or mowing the lawn.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for price", "Author": "Archana", "ReviewID": "R3H1BCVWHGVPWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I travel a lot and this is what I needed at a very reasonable price.

I feel like these days it's as important a decision as re-mortgaging. It seems that every other day there is a new cellphone with new capabilities and I end up feeling like an over the hill and out of date old fogey than the 30 something that I am.Mr E is frequently breaking and destroying cellphones due to the fact he works on building sites and I have therefore only got friends and work colleagues to keep updated about what is in and hip (Christ almighty did I just say that?). So after realising that 90% of the people I know are plugged into the latest I-Phone or smart phone which I seem to have some phobia about, I realised I was on my own.Is my cellphone smart?Now I am by no means stupid but sometimes I feel like I don't know what cellphone companies are harping on about. After a bit of research I discovered that a smart phone is exactly that, smart. They seem to have more capabilities as `normal' phones and many of them have added features such as touch screen, social networking and media players. I knew that an I-Phone was a no no for me and to be truthful I was sceptical about getting a touch screen at all but relented when I say this Nokia 5230. I have always liked Nokia as they are pretty simple and easy to use. I figured that I could upgrade with no cost to me (always a bonus) and that I would manage to get some nifty little features in addition to this.The BasicsThe Nokia 5230 is a reasonable size at 111 x 51 x 15 mm and weighs in at only 115 grams. This for me is the perfect size, not too light and little that I lose it, and nowhere near brick proportions. The screen itself is pretty big too (360 x 640) and it is a quad band phone meaning you can use the phone on most continents. It's actually a smart looking phone and comes in both black and white although the covers are not interchangeable.MusicThere seems to be quite a lot of features available for the music player side of this phone although I admit I don't use it. You can have dedicated music keys and can playback MP3, MP4, AAC, eAAC and WMA file formats. There is also an FM radio (always handy when you run out of something to read). Nokia also comes pre-loaded with Nokia Ovi Player which again I can't comment on as I haven't used it.Camera/VideoAs always it seems that cameras and video quality gets better the more cellphones get released. This Nokia has a 2 megapixel camera with 3x digital zoom as well as a photo editor built in. The picture quality is very good with the few limited photos that I have taken. It certainly won't replace my usual camera but is handy when you are out and about and haven't brought your camera with you. The video recorder is 640 x 480 pixels and up to 30 fps (with a TV of high quality) and decreases for the type of output you are using. The video also has the added bonus of both automatic and night scenes as well as colour tones of normal, black and white, vivid and negative.Web BrowsingIt seems that it doesn't matter where you are or what you are doing you have to have the capability to access the internet, at least that what it seems like. This phone has the usual web support mark up languages of HTML, XHTML and WML. It also has a Nokia search and surprisingly integrated GPS. There are also some handy shortcuts already set on your home menu for links to the likes of Facebook and Ebay. I have used it very occasionally and can't complain at any aspect of it. It was very straightforward to use and the download speeds were pretty good too.MenuThe Menu screen is easy to change to whatever style you like. You can choose to have a screen full of little shortcut widgets or a list, or like me have nothing but a small shortcut bar at the bottom of your favourite or most used add-ons. Like nearly all Nokia's the menus are easy to navigate with basic menu choices such as; Calendar, Internet, Contacts, Call Log, Messaging, Gallery, Music, Settings, Applications and Help.MessagingThe messaging side is again straightforward although it takes some getting used to having a touch screen rather than hard keys. Thankfully the screen is big enough that even those less nimble than others should be able to manage a text message. You also have the capability to set up, send and receive email.Other BitsWell you have a memory card slot so you can essentially use a storage card to increase its memory should you want to use it more for music or photos. It has Bluetooth version 2, a micro USB connector, flight mode feature, automatic switching between GSM bands, integrated hands-free speakerphone, vibrating alert and probably many more which I have forgotten to mentionThe Drop TestIn my house it makes no difference how great the capability it, or how many features there are. The most important things are that it stands the test of time in a home where cellphones are just that, cellphones. Neither me nor my husband care what the extras are, they are merely there for killing time if we are bored. Essentially cellphones have to live up to the drop test (and with a husband who is averaging 8 phones a year it's quite important). I have had the phone for nearly three months and so far it has survived the following.Test 1: Being dropped over the balcony in my block of apartments (I live on the top floor) and whilst I was trying and failing to open the front door. It dropped two floors hitting the banisters on the way down but miraculously had not a mark on it?Test 2: My husband being slightly worse for wear and stepping on it in work boots. Small scratch on the back of the case but otherwise unharmed.Test 3: Whilst throwing a ball to hubby at soccer on a Sunday morning I inadvertently threw my cellphone too so a football boot at high velocity managed to meet my cellphone unexpectedly! The phone gained another scratch at the side of the phone, but no marks otherwise.NegativesIf I am being honest I had to actually try and think of some. I can truly only think of one and that is that when you send a text message you have to touch type the text and instead of there being a direct `send' button you have to go to the options choice at the bottom of the screen and choose from the menu to send it. Aside from this there have been no issues with it at all.OverallOkay so you can all see I am certainly not one for judging a cellphone by its capabilities more by its practicalities. In this sense the phone is perfect. I get great reception; texting is easy as is taking photos. It certainly stands up to the durability test which is a godsend for me and in addition to this the battery life is outstanding. I think for a free upgrade cellphone I have ended up with a smart looking and durable phone that I think would have most accessories to please the majority of people.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Phone", "Author": "Timewarpone", "ReviewID": "R2MIF6D6BTBCPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No complaints here.

Let me tell you all about the good first.Great LCD screen.OviMaps is free; Ovimaps has saved us on long trips!Touch screen works well.Never had a problem with hearing someone or them hearing me.Speakerphone works well.Comes with a 4GB memory card.Not much phone memory.The non-butt-calling feature on the side is great (locking feature)The camera is adequate.The Facebook app that the phone comes with is fantastic; uploading pics is so easy!I was able to pop the SIM card out of my old phone and into this one, no problem. I have $5 texting and unlimited internet for $15 on AT&T.; Very reasonable.And the bad...Keyboard is a bit small; I always make mistakes typing, and many time I press a key but it doesn't register.A stylus is an option to buy, and would make using the keyboard a lot easier.The Ovi store needs more apps, though the free ones they do have are good (like Endomondo for exercising)Can't buy movies, which is a pity (but a blessing in disguise b/c I'd be using the phone ALL THE TIME)Battery life is good if the phone is the only thing used, but when you add in music and/or internet, the battery is drained and needs recharging within a day.Using the contacts is kind of a pain: if you have one contact with a home phone and cell phone saved, and then call them, the 5230 only shows that person's name (not if it was a call to their cell or home); this is a problem when using the \"Recently Called\" list to call that person again; you don't know if you're calling their home or cell.Double-tapping the touch screen is a must much of the time (that's the way it's supposed to work), but sometimes you can single-tap the screen; I still haven't figured out when I can single-tap.There's a limited amt of personalization for the home screen.The Help search feature on the phone could be more helpful (for example, if you search for \"phone memory,\" nothing is found).Some of the things I use all the time (like pairing a phone) are hard to find and there should be a shortcut or at least a feature to create a shortcut from your home screen.There are few accessories to be had for the phone, like an exercise pouch thingy (what are those armband phone things called?)There are definitely a few things that could be improved on the phone, and many of my \"bad\" items are nit-picky. Overall the phone is great for the money (I paid $125 with tax and shipping in May 2010). It sends and receives calls just fine, I can get to my email and Facebook, and I can text. It's small enough to fit in my pocket. It has a typical headphone jack (not the mini). I can get to the memory card easily and switch them out when I need to.But today while I was jogging and listening to tunes, the phone just stopped. In the middle of \"American Idiot,\" there was no more singing. When I looked at the phone, it went nuts on me - went to a blank screen, then there were lines in one corner of the screen, then it went back to normal, but lost the time and date. It was weird. I tried to shut off my phone, but it wouldn't shut down. I kept messing with it (turning it this way and that) and I finally got it to shut down. Phew! When I restarted it, the same thing happened. So I shut it down again and I took out the memory, reinserted it, and powered it back up. So far, so good. It's charging right now, but I'll find out more tomorrow when I play tunes again. Lame. I hope this was just a weird glitch. I googled this issue and it seems I'm not the only one having this problem, specifically with the 5230. From what I hear about smartphones (though this one isn't classified as a smartphone per AT&T;), things like this happen a lot. And I know other phones have issues with phone memory and having to restart the phone often, definitely more often than once every (how long has it been?) eight months.To sum, I'm happy with the phone. But just in case, I'm going to figure out if this phone has a one year warranty. :\\ Hopefully it does.UPDATE: 1/29/2011 The phone has been working fine since the little glitch. It seems to be a little slow at times but nothing out of the ordinary and it doesn't last. I guess the reboot did the trick. Phew!UPDATE 9/4/2012 I just bought a replacement battery for this phone. All the functions on the phone are still working, so I thought I'd save a hundred bucks and keep the phone that's served me well over the past couple years. I really love this phone, esp the GPS function that works without data/wifi.  I couldn't find another phone that had the same functions without having to spend money on data.Nokia had updated their maps and programs, so I needed to upload new maps recently, which took an hour or so. That was kind of a pain, but it was a one-time thing and everything is working fine.I also have not had the issues with the screen anymore. I keep the phone locked when not in use, or in my pocket and that took care of the problem. (I really think the phone got \"confused\" when the orientation was switched back and forth too quickly over and over.)  Anyway, just wanted to let you know I still have the phone, and with a new battery, I am one happy camper.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too many bugs!", "Author": "Daniel P. Peddle", "ReviewID": "R1PV2UEQBOAE63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone since the the beginning of May 2010. It started ok for a cheap smartphone and Nokia sent a software upgrade around the beginning of June. I thought this was a good sign with Nokia, since I liked their previous phones. But, I have not had a software upgrade since and the phone is way toooooooo buggy! First, do not store too much in memory, it cannot handle it and gets very slow. Then get used to your phone just freezining or turning itself off. It will even freeze in the middle of a phone call. Their are so many little pain-in-my-butt bugs, it drives me crazy now. They were not so bad in the beginning, but keep getting worse. Now, the radio... Sucks! They use a cheap IC and have the antenna built into the headset, so you MUST have the headset attached for the readio to work. I like the alarm clock on this. The only problem is you cannot snooze or stop the alarm clock when it is sideways. Other things will disappear when the phone is turned sideways, including that long text message you write. The touch display is very bad at responding. Sometimes you go nuts trying to get it to recognize your finger press or swipe. I hate the stupid camera, it really sucks and has no feature or no LED light for night shots. My old Motorola RIZR had a 2M camera and took far better shots and had a ton of features for it. The GPS is OK, when it does not freeze. I actually like this if it was not so slow and buggy, it is pretty accurate. Nokia needs to spend more time with writing good applications, most fall short of simple. The software is so slow and you need to use your finger nail to try and scroll. The menuing is awful and can be very confusing. You will get lost! You cannot even charge the stupid phone on your USB! What morons!!! I feel duped that I bought this. Save your money and buy something better, Nokia is not reliable for a smartphone and they do not support their software. This phone has a lot of potential, but Nokia has decided not to support the software and fix the frickin bugs and this, to me, is extremely important in my phone. I will not buy another Nokia until they come to their senses. It will be Android or Iphone in the future for me, something that has better support.

Basically our TomTom device died and I didn't want to spend $150 to buy another GPS device and then have to deal with buying maps whenever I needed or so forth. This phone has GPS and costs the same so it is no brainer. Also, we have family overseas and we travel annually so it is handy to have a GPS device that covers the whole world and has so many languages for driving instructions. In addition, we can use the phone any time we travel as well - just swap a new SIM card.The phone's quality is good. There are some nuisances, but not important enough to make me dislike the phone. Voice quality is good. It doesn't have WiFi and some people are put off by it. But you get what you paid for. Nokia has dozens other phones that have GPS and WiFi. 5800 comes to mind as being very similar and having WiFi. For me it is non-issue. I specifically purchased the phone unlocked because I don't need internet on the phone and I don't want to pay for data plan or have a WiFi capability. GPS was my \"killer app\". Speaking of apps, Nokia has an extensive library. Not a gazillion of apps like Apple does, but certainly enough for myself. I pulled a few such as games and other stationary apps (not requiring internet). The OVI application works flawlessly. I wish it worked in Linux, but it doesn't. You have to have a Windows machine (I am not sure of Mac).The interface is great. People claim it isn't as good as iPhone, but it doesn't have to be. That's what N8 is for. The interface is as good as you want it to be for $150. The touchscreen is very responsive. The camera is OK. We use it knowing the pictures won't make it to a magazine cover. Again, that's what Nokia N8 is for.Overall, this phone serves a niche in the market and caters to certain needs. If you like Nokia and are looking for a little more, you can look up 5800 and other models.

The touchscreen not receptive at times, pressing the button over and over again to get it to respond and when it finally does you wind up pressing another then spend forever trying to close that one out. The call volume is terrible. I would put it on speaker then turn it down just to hear. The lock only works sometimes.

The sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate. Sometimes, you need to put much force on it. Moreover the scrolling is not easy. It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake.2. The phone is greed to use up the battery's energy. For instance, if you only use music player for about 4 hours, then the phone's battery will decharged within the next 24 hours during which the phone is actually in stand by and everything is off. Besides, the actual standby time of the battery is not 432 hrs as it is advertised, but about 200 hrs, not more. Considering this issues, what's the use of all the functionalities of the phone when you should turn them all off to save battery energy.3. The alarm is a devil. You cannot set the alarm's volume to the level you desire. I contacted Nokia customer service concerning this issue and they suggested that I use a tone with a low voice. Although, this answer does not solve the problem in general, I examined that and noticed a bug of the phone's firmware. I reduced the amplitude of my favorite tone to 10%. When I set the alarm tone to this one, I understand that this is not a simple problem. Because, the phone, when starts to alarm, the volume increases from that 10% to as much as the phone can make noise. The next time I checked with 2% tone. No use. Really silly, because the increasing state of tone has no upper threshold.4. The design for SIM card and RAM places are kinda trouble. In the package there is nothing help you to bring out the SIM card. And RAM won't come out easily.5. No wifi6. The one I bought, has a Chinese RAM. While transferring data to the RAM, it sometimes goes crazy and prevent data transferring. It doesn't matter how you this. I tried that via both the phone's usb connection and a seperate RAM-reader usb connection. Well, I cannot expect more from Chinese products.Overall, if you seek some mobile phone with such functionalities offered by this phone, don't waste your money on this.

I still use it today (nearly a year later).  The screen is small compared to more expensive phones.  The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it).  It manages my gmail accounts nicely (though it can only be set to auto retrieve at most 2 accounts).  You can do basic web browsing to get information you need.  You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen.  Speed is okay with 3G, painful with Edge (roughly equal to dial up).

Thought maybe it was my problem.  No.  Gave it to another coworker to test it and he also got stuck on entering the most basic: Contacts.1. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to use QWERTY to enter my contacts.  I had the Alphanumeric keypad up and I tried to find how to turn the QWERTY on.  Click on the icon that looks like a keyboard.  And they trick you!  A dropdown comes up and it only has 'Handwriting' and 'Alphanumeric keypad' on it.  No QWERTY.  I tried turning the phone horizontally.  Nothing changed.  Little did I know I had to turn the phone \"anti-clockwise\" to trigger the QWERTY keyboard to come up.  If you turn it the other way it won't work.  Fine!  Now I learned.  But that keyboard icon just totally got me.  If a keyboard can't be turned on from there, then don't make the icon looks like a keyboard for goodness sake!2. The MAP interaction is unintuitive.  I have the phone for 2 days already and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it properly.  First of all, who would use a SmartPhone MAP for the sake of looking at it these days?  Its main purpose should be for user to \"get directions\" to a place!  Not for the Nuron.  I open the MAP and I don't know what to do.  I see an \"Options\" button.  I click on it and was hoping to see a \"Go to place\" link.  No.  Instead I see a bunch of useless links.  The MOST important link isn't there.  Then there's a \"Search\" button.  EVERYTIME I click on it, I keep forgetting that I have to ERASE everything I typed in before in order to enter new entry.  OH and to make it worse, you have to repeat that for 3 total fields (ZIP code, Street Name, Street Number!)  (Why not combine Street Number and Street Name????)  Then you have to click 'Options' again to hit 'Search'.  Then it tells you how many miles afar... (I didn't know that the number of miles is THAT important.  It's the first thing I need to know?  I DON'T CARE!!!)  THEN you click that Address again (took me awhile to figure that out) to hit 'Drive to'.  Took me 30 minutes to find that out.3.
