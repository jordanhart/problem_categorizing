This is a dumb phone that is very good for people who don't feel the need to spend every waking second of their life texing, tweeting, facebooking, or making a general cyber-nuisance of themselves. The slide out keyboard is very nice. The only drawback to this phone to me was that the phone was pretty dumb. It always need to check with you about what kind of message you wanted to send when you were trying to send a text. Very easy to use and well worth the money if you're looking to save some. I sold my first one and am thinking about replacing my smartphone bill with this one again now that I have a netbook.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3DMTWL2XF9NBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the phone.

I also loved that it had a slide function versus flip. The first phone I received just basically exploded without the fireworks. And it would never ever ever charge, even with the charger they sent me it would always just say \"unauthorized charger\" I sent it back thinking it was faulty. The second one came, worked fine, then decided I wanted a smart phone, upgraded, and decided to downgrade due to finances. I tried to charge this new one again so I could prep it for the downgrade...and what a shock. \"Unauthorized charger\" displayed again. Then froze. Basically it's good to look at, but don't use it.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola A455 Rival....not at all happy with it!", "Author": "critterfixer", "ReviewID": "R6E5LTEL5HGCU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I like the color....that's it.  When I'm texting someone (when it will let me text) it will send them before I'm finished.  It keeps going to another window asking if I want to save or delete the message, or if I want to add contact, or something else crazy like that.  It's part touch screen, and starts bumping in your hand to the point that you have no control over what you want to do.  You have to completely close the slide, exit out to the home screen and start over.  Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.  I definitely would not recommend this phone to anyone!!!I don't know if it's this particular phone that has something wrong with it, or if it's a problem with all of the Motorola A455 Rivals.  Whatever it is, I won't be purchasing it again.  If I could afford to do so, I'd swap it out for an LG Cosmos 2, but the purchase price is way too much right now.  I'm going to have to deal with this until June of 2012 when I'm eligible for an upgrade....and believe me when I say that ANYTHING will be an improvement!!!I have done many purchases through Amazon, and this is the only time I've had any problems at all....I'm not afraid to buy through them.

I have had this phone for two-plus years, and have never, ever been happy with it. The volume control is terrible, and the camera is pretty useless unless you are outdoors. I am not sure who the brain-trust was that designed the text pad, but the buttons are so small, unless you have very long fingernails you will find it hard to use. It also jumps from screen to screen without warning, and for no reason at all, when you try to compose a text, check voicemail, search contacts, look at your settings, charge the phone, and sometimes even when it is closed and in your pocket.

In the 1 & a half I had this phone, it was a nightmare. The first one wouldn't charge correctly because the connection of the charging cords were never tight enough. I would have to wedge the cord between something and the phone to get a good enough connection to charge. I dealt with this for 3 months before the screen went out too. It just decided in the middle of a call to go completely white.... It was only 6 months old. Luckily, I had a warranty, so I took it back to get a new one. Within a month the charger didn't work. I tried a new charger, same problem. Pretty soon, it simply wouldn't hold a charge. It would just die when it said it had all bars. It was a piece of crap.

I, for one, like this phone so far.  I had to replace my Verizon Cosmos (cell phones really shouldn't go in with you for a swim), and I could't shell out a quick $100. This '09 model cell phone was more in my price range.  I like the color of the Rival, the slider works easily, the back has a rubber-like feel so it's easy to grip.  Sound quality is better than the phone I had before.  It is part touch-screen, part keypad, so that takes some getting used to.  I do not want an all touch-screen phone, so I think this will work for me.  It also records short videos, something else my Cosmos (later model than the Rival) didn't do, which I really like.  And, probably the best feature, the battery has a VERY long life and you don't have to charge it every couple of days.

I was really important to me to have the keyboard and that feature with the cost is what ultimately made my decision. The phone was as described and the shipping was good too. It works fine other than freezing up in the middle of texting and the touch screen was very sensitive. It would keep pressing it's own buttons while I was texting and sending half. I do not blame the seller for either of those issues. The camera lens has a huge scratch on it to the point that when you take a picture, it always comes out blurry. This was a huge downfall to me, seeing as I use my camera often for many things. So after about 2 weeks, I bought a new phone and sold this one and so far the other person is pretty happy with it.

The screen dims very quickly, and every time it does so you need to \"unlock\" the phone again. This mainly consists of pressing the \"menu\" button twice, which is fairly annoying for someone accustomed to quickly accessing his phone.Second, the memory is very limited. It can store around 200MB of music and around 400 text messages. When your inbox reaches 80%, it's impossible to access your inbox without receiving an annoying reminder about remaining memory. On top of that, it can take around 5 minutes to erase the inbox.Still, I give this phone three stars because it does what it's supposed to do.

I am very displeased and will never order another phone off amazon again.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "terrible", "Author": "Jodi Lindsey", "ReviewID": "RDS6937CYUJNS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was the worst cell ever.

It's a great phone for texting and making calls, but I've never even tried it for internet access.  I'm just not that addicted to the internet.  Some other reviews said the battery wouldn't last.  That's only true if you live in a place where the signal isn't good because the phone is constantly searching for a signal.  I've had no problems with mine until lately when it occasionally locks up and makes a high pitch sound.  I just turn it off and it comes back on OK. As for it asking what sort of message you want to send, there is a button on the keyboard just to the left of the space bar that looks like an envelope with a pencil beside it.  If you press that it automatically puts you in the texting page.  The voice activated portion is little more than a great laugh.  You tell it to call Ryan and it asks if you said Diane. We have fun just testing it.  I've had no problems taking photos in the house with it but then it's a phone, not a camera.  If all you want to do is send texts and make calls it's a great phone. Also, when you live where there is little signal like I do, texting is about the only way to make contact.  Digital cell phone calls drop too many packets when the signal is weak but texting can usually get through.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "SWTMELISSA", "ReviewID": "R38FJA3VBLJYNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DEALER MADE SURE I WAS SATSIFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.

My sister has the same phone and we are constantly complaining about them to each other.  I thought I'd love it since it was small enough to fit in my pocket or small purse. The keyboard is way too small and takes a lot of getting used to. I have small hands but it is still hard for me to use without hitting two keys at a time.The worst thing about this one is when you try to check your voice messages you will constantly hit the keyboard with your ear and either have to redail and start the process over again or get the annoying beeping sound and still lose your voicemail connection.You have to put in your code to check voicemail and then cut off the dial pad to stop this from happening.The sound quality is also pretty cruddy, the camera is awful unless you are taking outside pictures and no amount of changing the resolution will fix it, and don't even try to take a video more than 30 seconds long.I am so sorry that I wasted my upgrade on this phone!", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola cell phone", "Author": "biddy", "ReviewID": "R21GLRP8VMDCHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love my new phone.
