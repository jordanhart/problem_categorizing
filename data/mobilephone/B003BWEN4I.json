{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TM717", "Author": "Chris Pagoto", "ReviewID": "R1ZPTU777ZSX35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To address any prior review(s)....the SE TM717 is a dumb-phone, NOT a smartphone. Comparing this phone to a Blackberry, Android or iPhone isn't fair because it's not that type of phone. For one, you do NOT need an expensive data plan with this phone. The minimal $5-$10 data package that is available for these phones allows you email access, internet and possibly some text messaging allotment depending on your carrier.The good: GPS, 3.2mp camera, bluetooth, expandable memory slot, visual alert notifications, extremely thin design, lightweight, external display, RSS reader, (including podcasts) and 3G speeds. (Some of you may say \"why not 4g?' to which I reply that there is no dumb-phone on the market that has any need for anything greater than 3G speeds.)The bad: T-Mobile has blocked out certain JAVA apps from executing and utilizing the network in order to function properly. Hence, when you download an app via the phone browser or one that you transfer on to the phone, there is a good chance it will not work. I'd say you have a 50-50 shot.What this phone is good for: People who are active and do not want a huge phone to shove in their pants pocket. This phone will slide into any shirt or pant pocket and nobody will ever know it's there. You can utilize Google Maps via the GPS and find your way to/from any two points with no problem. Need to take a quick picture?...no problem with the 3.2mp camera. For a flip phone the quality is above average, however compared to other 3.2mp camera phones available today the quality is average. If you need to listen to music/audio in the car you can use Bluetooth to sync up and play everything on your phone.Overall: It's a great phone at a great price that will satisfy anyone who is incredibly active and doesn't want to have to worry about big phones with big displays and big, costly data plans. This phone is great to grab, throw in your pocket, run out the door and not have to worry about anything else.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a good for ... for 2006", "Author": "Carrot Juicelover", "ReviewID": "R2EM3ZROMGNC8O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As of August 2011, this phone is still for $100 on Tmobile's website. I had the chance to use this phone since my own phone died.My Sony Ericson background: I use to have the sony walkman phone. That was THE BEST PHONE EVER. It was great, the software was nice, and everything worked well. The older walkman phone lines were amazing when they came out.Flash forward several years later.I have this in my hand. The phone looks great. When it rings it gives a nice effect of halos. The little digital display has a easily read time function.I love the fact it;'s a flip phone since I wont accidentally hit any keys.As soon as you activate it you know... its going to suck. BAD. This is pretty much the same software that I used years ago.. but SLOWER. seriously? slower? there is a slight delay navigating between menu items. Sony, you have had YEARS to update your interface. In the days of iphones and droids, charging good money for a phone with a bad interface doesn't cut the mustard.Another thing, to use head phones you need to use special dongle sony headphones. the phone doesnt have a headphone jack! or a usb port! You have to use their proprietary cabling. lose the cables? fork over another $40.For free this phone would be good,or $50 or less without contract , but when a droid can be had for $100, this phone wont do.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent non-smartphone, but now too expensive!", "Author": "Penina", "ReviewID": "R246XIYDT1C4MD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "See my review of the same phone, above, under Comments to Carrot Juice Lover; Sony-Ericsson and T-Mobile came up with a real winner on this one.Unfortunately, the price is now so high I had to lower my 5 stars to 4.

My last one died out and I wanted another one, so was lucky enough to find it here and new on amazon. For people like me, that just want to use a phone for what a phone is for, its perfect. It has lots of options, great texting, messaging, can get online when needed, camera, etc...but its still just a great everyday phone. I am not wanting to take on a smartphone yet, as my Mac does all that for me. So for now, this is great for another couple years I hope! As far as the peeling paint issues, my previous one did do that, so I just bought a skin for it and who would ever know.

My issue with the last purchase was, I bought a \"New\" phone through Amazon. The phone looked good but the box and contents had obviously been disturbed. Since my history with Amazon was good I started using the phone, but soon discovered that the graphics on the outside of the flip lid were not working. This means you can not tell who is calling until you open the lid to answer. I also later realized that the ear piece was missing from the box.

I encountered the same situation as Lex...charging issues.  I thought perhaps the battery went bad so I bought a new one cheaply here at amazon.  The phone recognized the full battery, but would not charge it.  It also would intermittently not recognize the SIM.  So the fault lay not with the battery but with the phone itself.I think the first phone lasted just shy of a year, and the other one lasted even less.  I'm very surprised by this bad quality as I really stick with phones for ages until they die...and in my case that means years!They both came to me free via contract incentives, which is why I'm not more bitter.I'm glad somebody else had this experience as I thought my dad simply man-handled them to death!This is a real shame as my dad really liked them and I'm on the hunt for a used one...I would prefer to move on though.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't last", "Author": "Roshel", "ReviewID": "R2J6YACLM872L4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The thing is, this phone is actually pretty good, in terms of user friendliness and function. However, it has a LOT of serious flaws, and I know because i've had this exact same phone on THREE different occasions.Keep in mind that the first day i got this phone, it had a case, and i took relatively good care of it.2 months in: if you would drop the phone, it would restart and say \"Inactive SIM,\" and would take a minute to restart3 months in: the paint started to chip4 months in: the vibration began working occasionally, and eventually it just never vibrated.4.5 months in: the battery life decreased DRAMATICALLY, it used to have 3 days of usage without a charger, and it went down to less than a full day.5 months in: the point of attachement between the phone and the keyboard was getting loose.5.5 months in: the phones speaker did not work, as in I physically could not make a call with it unless I was using a headset or speakerphone.6 months in: the overall speed of the phone went down to about 1/3 of what it was in the beginning, and to load any screen took much longer than in the beginning7 months in: the connection between the keyboard and the screen just broke, luckily the wires sustained it, so i had to tape it together.7.5 months in: the phone did not turn on. it was gone.The thing is, the phone itsself is not bad at all. its a very good phone, but it doesnt last long at all. I've had my ipod touch for about 3 years, and there are no problems with it, and I use it about as much as I use the phone, and it has survived longer without any problems than three of these phones. Unless you treat this phone like a piece of glass ready to shatter any second, i would not recommend this phone for anyone.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Peeling paint", "Author": "Lowell", "ReviewID": "R2OTZWPINCLGQB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my wife's phone. We got it and the paint peeled after a few months. T-mobile would not replace it for peeling paint, but after a few more months it started having problems charging the battery, which T-mobile considered serious enough to justify a replacement. A few months later and the paint on the replacement phone is peeling. If you check the internet you will see that lots of other people have this same problem.This phone looks really AWFUL with peeling paint! In other respects this is an adequate phone. Not great, but adequate. But the paint issue -- it is like walking around in a shirt with a big stain on it. Peeling paint makes it look like the kind of phone a hobo would carry.
