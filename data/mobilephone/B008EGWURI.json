She doesn't even need her reading glasses to see the screen or the key pad.She even enjoys the camera.  She is always taking pictures with it.

I first checked out TracPhone and decided that most of their flip phones were on the cheap side plus I did not like the idea of running to their website to buy more minutes, so I ruled them out. Next up was Consumer Cellular. Their rate plans are almost neck and neck with Great Call with some minor differences, but their phones have a lot of negative reviews. Their cheapest flip phone is a Motorola WX416 that sells for $35 and does not even come with an instruction manual or volume control. They have another called the Doro PhoneEasy which is a fairly attractive model with green trim that sells for $60 but almost everyone agrees that this model has charger issues big time that still have not been resolved by Consumer Cellular. When I signed up with Great Call I went with their 700 minutes deal for $30 vs 750 minutes for the same price that Consumer Cellular offers. However, your minutes with CC do not roll over but your minutes from Great Call roll over month to month for up to 60 days. With CC if you go over they charge you .25 a minute with Great Call it is .35 so there are trade offs to be sure. CC has a 4000 minutes plan for $60 a month and Great Call has an Unlimited Minutes Plan for $80 a month. In the end the phone was the deciding factor for me. This is not a cheap phone. It has weight to it and is very solid. I bought mine at Best Buy for $99 and they offered to register and activate it for me at no charge but I passed. I went home and went to their website site and activated it and the whole process took less than 30 minutes. There is a one time activation charge of 35 plus tax that is clearly stated on the box and their website. You can sign up with auto-pay or have a bill sent to you each month, but if you go with auto-pay they credit you $25. The instruction manual is huge and covers any topic you can think of. One last thing, when you charge the phone for the first time, let it charge for 12 hours. After about 2 hours it will say charge complete, but that is for impatient users who can't wait to play with their new toy. Plug it in before you go to bed then when you wake up you will have plenty of power for the activation process. Just follow the instructions either from the manual or the website and you will be fine.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for us Old Geezers", "Author": "Lon Tanner", "ReviewID": "R1GDD5NE0XJKU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am computer literate and cell phone deficient.

This phone is just what I was looking for and then some. It is very well made, very study and feels like it will hold up for a long time. The displays are very clear and large and most importantly, simple with the minimal amount of text which makes navigating the phone easy. The buttons are have back lighting. There are no extra buttons. On/off, Yes, No, Speaker and up and down arrows. The phone makes it very clear on what you need to do and what buttons to push to navigate the menu, make a call, etc.When you sign up for service, the choices for plans and features have a good variety. They offer quite a variety of services geared toward Seniors but you only pay for what you need or want. There is no contract and you can add or change calling plans with no penalty if you need to. They offer discounts and free minutes on the website if you sign up for automatic billing.Activation is very easy. You can either call or do it on-line. I chose online and during the activation process I was able to create a contact book for her with all the aunties and grand kids numbers. Saved me hours on manual entry. I can still manage her contacts online and upload to her phone remotely. I can also change the order they show up as she navigates the contacts on the phone so she sees the ones she uses most often first.I didn't choose any extra features for her because she is in a skilled nursing facility at this time. When she comes home, I know there are several I plan to add. Many of the features are geared towards seniors still living independently. One I particularly like is the abiliity to setup automated calls on a regular basis. If the phone calls are not answered, they designated contacts will receive notice so they can check up themselves. This service is $4 per month.My grandmother has severe arthritis in her hands with very limited finger mobility. This phone is simple enough for her to use. It was also very simple for me to teach her how to use it. It took less than 10 minutes for her to understand everything. I researched most of the phones geared for seniors before I bought this and I am very happy I choose the Jitterbug Plus. She also loves that it is shiny red.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Jitterbug for folks with marginal sight", "Author": "Donald K Whaley", "ReviewID": "R2XSSG8L7FVAI0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Jitterbug Plus Cell Phone (Silver)I have Macular Degeneration, and need larger type sizes and better contrast than most cell phones offer, so my last effort was the Jitterbug.So far, my expectations have been met.

It took 4 phone calls and 4 different reps to get someone to understand the issue and begin to clear it up.  In the meantime Great Call has disabled my online access to my account as it was associated with the previous phone's number, and makes it more difficult to make sense of the overbilling that Great Call has done so far.

I want a simple phone like we had in the 80's.  Not the old brick but a flip.  The old Motorola razor I think was the best flip I ever had.  I have an iPhone for work.  I hate it. All I want is a phone.  If it is important to call then call.  Don't text me.  Call me old school but a mobile phone is a mobile phone.  I priced others phones as well.  Ntelos, AT&T;, Verizon, Trac all prepaid. I don't talk a lot and I like the fact that my minutes do roll over.  I am going to call and see how long they stay on but I thought the sales person said longer than 60 days before they fall off.  I have voice mail which is an extra 3 dollars a month.  My bill is 24 dollars a month for 200 minutes and voice mail.  The ease of the phone is great.  The only down side is that if you want to add phone numbers you have to do it one at a time on a website or on the phone directly.

I have been using cell phones for about 10 years so have some experience behind me. .  What I don't like is that I have missed calls if I'm in a different room than the phone because of the not so loud  ringer volume.....even when it's on max..  Callers to you can only leave a 90 second message before they get cut off. When I have to look through my phone directory to find a name, it takes me take longer then other phones as I  have to scroll through all the names before I come to the one I  want. They are in alphabetical sequence...but...it  still takes longer then I'm used to.  The clarity of  the call is just ok. I could not fit all my  names in this directory as I did with other phones. I have also missed texts because of the  low volume also. If a text is a little long....you won't get any of it.  If you are on a call...you don't get any notification a text came in until you hang up from that call.  I guess  this phone does not have much memory. I have never \"dropped a call\" and that is a good thing. What I really like  about this phone is the display. Easy to read large numbers that light up. It is also light weight.This phone is simple, but perhaps too simple for me even though  I'm 75 .I chose this phone mostly  because of the good reviews about the provider and the display feature. I am a heavy phone user...for both social  and business.

However, be aware that the company that provides United States service for the phone, Greatcall, seems to have a policy of high-pressure sales tactics. The phone cannot be used without Greatcall, so it seems pertinent to relate my experience.I talked to Greatcall three times. The first time I called before I'd bought the phone to ask some questions. The support person kept redirecting the conversation into making an immediate sale. After about five minutes of that I had to hang up rather than complete the sale.The second time I called to get the just-purchased phone provisioned. I wanted the simplest/cheapest plan, but the salesman really, really wanted me to buy into the high-priced plans with various service options. It took some work, but I finally got what I needed.Today I called to cancel service, and the support person again started to work as hard as he could to keep me as a customer, or even add on extra-price services. Only when I threatened to go through my credit card company to block their charges did I get the service cancelled.If you are buying this phone for an elderly relative, I would be concerned about letting that relative deal with Greatcall's salespeople; they might get persuaded into ordering more and more expensive features (which can be close to five times as expensive as the basic plan).
