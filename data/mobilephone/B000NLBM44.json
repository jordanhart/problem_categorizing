It is very user freindly and I am not big on instructions LOL.  I took my time reading the manual and I was able to figure out the Ming without getting frustrated.  The only thing that I haven't learned to do is get picture text, being that it is a phone not quite like our technology here in the USA, I have to call Motorola and see if they can configure it do this feature.  My cell phone company couldn't get it after spending an hour on the phone.  The phone takes great pix clear and crisp, you can also take a picture of a  business card, you never have to type all that info again, and it is a flip.  No more accidentally pressing buttons while the phone is in a back or your pocket that might drain your battery.  The ringers are also loud enough for you to hear you phone if you are in another room, in your purse or work bag.", "Date": "April 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "need work on volume", "Author": "tkmelka", "ReviewID": "R2V4VJ7TID1J7G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the phone overall is a good product, the one thing that made me decide to abanon it and buy another phone is, the earpiece volulme. the phone setting doesn't have anything to adjust the volume which makes it impossible to use outdoor even indoors it's a struggle to hear. i don't know the reason they setup the earpiece volume so low, but if they were to fix this problem i would probably buy another one.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola A1200 - Great cell phone", "Author": "Marcos Aurelio Dias", "ReviewID": "R34KMAIXZE2FHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the product on time, and it is working fine.
