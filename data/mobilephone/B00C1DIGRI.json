{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unquestioned Best Productive Smartphone Yet", "Author": "Sean P.", "ReviewID": "R3B0TLJEI1Z7UK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not usually one to write reviews for products.  I've written a couple on books, a couple products, and that's about it.  I read them frequently to make decisions on purchases where I am going to spend over $100 for an item.  That can be dangerous if you believe that the people reviewing don't work for the company for products they review.  That is NOT the case for me, and I have now used this phone for a solid month and feel it's time to tell the truth about the device.First, you need to know about me and what I do.  I'm in sales...I travel a LOT for work..15-20 flights a year, extensive heavy driving around the New England/NYC Metro area for work.  I manage a team of 8 salespeople and responsible for Sales Enablement and Development for the entire company coast to coast.It's important to mention that because I need a phone that allows me to be productive.The problem today with smartphone industry is that they have gone 85% marketing to the casual consumer and 15% to the power user.Then I laugh at people who call themselves power users.  To me, power users are not the You Tube surfing, video watching, game playing, constant texting consumer.  That would be my daughter or sons.Power users do find a need for those features, but for me, productivity combined with need for occasional use of those features in important.What phones have I used?  I started with a Blackberry Pearl back in 2005 or 2006 (can't remember) when they first released that device.  LOVED IT.  It was small, intuitive, and did what I wanted.I gradually went to Curve and when the Bold series hit the market, I was in heaven.BUT BUT BUTWhat I realized was that I did not to open a few more web pages for work related issues and view some videos that I need to see for work as well.  Blackberry had terribly slow web browsing, videos were slow to load, and the screen was dim and washed out.  I started to fall into the trap of wanting something COOL.  I needed to have the newest and coolest phone that could answer my need for those things.Enter Android and Droid OG.  I bought the 1st version of the Droid smartphone with keyboard.  EXCELLENT device.  At the time, it was fast, had a very good keyboard, and did all the things I mentioned flawlessly (for the most part).  Android allowed me to make my phone what I wanted.  It was visually appealing, light weight (enough) and handled email well.I receive and send over 100 emails/day so that is the single biggest aspect.  What I noticed was that Blackberry still killed it in that area, but often times, my Bold would freeze up or just reboot itself and it was getting worse and worse.  It seemed RIM didn't really focus on the user experience that much and just got complacentWithout lecturing, the only thing constant in the business world is CHANGE.  If you are unwilling to change, you will fall behind.  Great salespeople are not complacent.  They will make a huge sale, and while happy, not complacent.  Great companies are the same way.  RIMM was NOT that great company.  I felt it...I abandoned the platform for the exciting new world of Android.I used the Droid OG, then Droid 2, then Droid X, and finally went to Droid 3.  Loved them all.When Samsung released the Galaxy II, I made the change and loved that device more than all the others.  Slim, fast, great screen, etc.  BUT BUT BUTOver time, I realized one thing.  I HATED NOT HAVING PHYSICAL KEYBOARD.  HATED IT.I don't care how many keyboard apps Google could come up with, I hated them all.  Inaccurate, slow, quirky, etc.I began to remember that I needed a PHONE first (many many calls) and a device I could be productive with.  I stated using signature for my emails on phone with \"Please excuse spelling errors\" because I was using a phone that was not very good at autocorrect and was terrible to type on.GREAT for web, videos, texting, good apps, but NOT very good for the 1 damned thing I needed more than anything.  EMAIL, CALENDAR, productivity.Never used Apple for phone.  I have a Mac Air (that I am typing this on now), I have a iPad (showing PPTs and videos to customers quickly is amazing)...I even have Apply TV (used to hook to projectors and I can show PPT from my iPad wirelessly for presentations).  Apple is a great company, but I DO NOT LIKE the iPhone.  Keyboard is small, worse than Android. Beautiful hardware and cameras, etc..Not for me.ENTER THE Q10Now, I have read all about RIM, now Blackberry, and their troubles.  Let's face it...they were complacent.  They did not innovate and keep one step ahead.  They blew it.Does it matter that they seem to get it now?  Probably not...too little, too late.  BUT, I LOVE THIS Q10!!!!!!  Why?The keyboard is phenom!!  It's best I've ever used...the device itself is a premium feel.  Hell, I switched from Samsung Galaxy III to this device.  People called me NUTS.  Said that was stupid.Realize something.  The Galaxy Line is excellent..might be best in class on the market.  But again, I needed to be productive, not check to see if my lengthy emails were spelled properly or if I missed something because I accidentally erased a couple lines hitting wrong keys, etc.The Q10 is BB best work by far.  I can hammer out emails flawlessly.  The autocorrect they employ is best on the market, BAR NONE. It's a joy to type on...The feeling in the hand is perfection.Is it a PERFECT phone overall?  Well, for me, it's as close as it gets.  So, let's start with what I DON'T like or wish they would change:1.  Hub...I actually kind of like it, but there's too many layers to it.  The back and forth nature of checking messages, then checking the thread, then backing out, can get tedious.  Seems like they could do something to minimized the left to right swipes needed.  I like Peak, but issue there is that if you swiped out of the email you were in, and you want to peak, it might not show you what's waiting if it's a text or other message in Hub...you have to be in the HUb view to Peak at all of them, and then, redundant if you want to go and actually open the message.If they were able to allow you to look at email via Hub and give you a breakdown of what's in the hub quickly without 3-4 swipes, would be easier.  But am I lazy?  Are we all lazy now that we cannot make those extra gestures?  Probably.2.  Apps.  Now, I am not REALLY upset at this, because I don't play games.  A smartphone for me is a PHONE and EMAIL/CALENDAR device.  If I wanted to play games and not squint to see them, if I wanted to watch movies, I'll turn on my iPad.  I watch movies on airplane and do so with iPad  Why the hell people want to watch it on those 4-4.5 inch screens is beyond me.  So if you're a gamer, stop reading and dont buy it.How many of the 750,000 apps that Apple claims or others claim are REALLY USEFUL?  You can have only so many fart apps, etc.  I mean, come on now people...give me a break.BUTIt is missing some of the basics that I really use constantly.  Like Evernote.  I'm a premium subscriber and Evernote, while sort of baked in, does not have a native app (heard there's one coming but still).There might be a few others use, but I use the basics, and really, it has most of what I want.  FB kind of basic, but that's ok.THAT folks is the ONLY things I do not like.  Seriously..And I bitch about a lot of stuff, but that's really it.WHAT DO I LIKE?1.  Keyboard..Nuff said..Already said it.2.  Email - Easy interface, this is what BB does best.  Best in class, bar none.  I set up via Microsoft Exchange Sync and get my emails even faster than my Android delivered them (send email and I have it on my Q10 in 3-5 seconds).3.  Screen.  Yeah, it's small..but it's EXCELLENT to look at.  Clear, bright, almost perfect.4.  BATTERY - At first, I was mad because it really didn't seem great. But after two cycles of battery, it's EPIC.  I send and receive approx 100 emails per day, 20-30 texts.  I read the WSJ app on it, look at and check some ESPN stuff, others articles occasionally, and RSS Feeds that I subscribe to.  Once in a while someone sends me video file to look at, and it runs great BTW.  Listen to music here and there.  Screen is on quite a bit.Result?  I'm unplugging at 5:45am and at 11pm when I plug in, I've got between 35 (lowest) and 50% battery life still left.  AMAZING.  And I am TRUE POWER USER.5.  Maps.  Is it Google Maps and Nav?  Nope...Not close.  Does it do what I want it to do?  YUP...On the mark.  Very good Nav app here..basic, but clean and works.  Sure I wish I still had my Google Maps, but I need to get places and it has NEVER let me down yet...not once.Those are the things I need, and those are what it does GREAT.So, LONG review..but let me say:It's a premium feeling, premium looking Power Users dream.  If you are into getting stuff done for WORK, with a little bit of play in there, it will not disappoint.If you want to use your PHONE as a gaming tool, chatting tool, Facebooking Tweeting device, look elsewhere.  I'm about getting stuff done.  And the Q10 does just that.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gave it a month and concluded that the Q10 is a downgrade from the 9900.", "Author": "Shawn Mccleskey \"Neo-Geo\"", "ReviewID": "R1BP5K9IUG92BU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a dedicated Blackberry user since the 8700c (circa 2005), upgrading to the latest iteration of Blackberry's flagship model ever since.  As an intended upgrade to my trusty but dated Bold 9900, I purchased the long awaited Q10 at release from AT&T; in the USA and have used it thoroughly/exclusively/hourly since June 20th (a full month).  I really wanted and tried fervently to like this phone.  It supports Skype, the display is beautiful, the keyboard is an upgrade, and the feel in your hand is quite nice. While I did become more proficient with the swiping gestures (although still cumbersome and too often are ineffective/misinterpreted), the lack of the trackpad and other key buttons are too detrimental to productivity.I miss the literal PIXEL precision of the trackpad, the ability to answer or end a call with a single click (though I've since learned that there is a well hidden secret combo that will end an incoming call; this is allegedly achieved by touching and holding the answer bar and then performing an upwards swiping finishing move), and the ability to quickly highlight for deletion/copy/cut/paste.  The Q10 has the precision of a THUMBPRINT.  When web browsing, you must literally enlarge the screen with a combination two onscreen and simultaneous finger `gestures', then when all you can view is a small but grossly oversized section of the webpage, you attempt to click the right hyperlink with the mash of a fingerprint.The process to highlight text on the Q10 is a laughable and remarkably ineffective process that involves extreme patience, time, and LUCK!  Highlighting is essentially dead on the Q10, or the process is so impossibly silly that you are forced to do without this crucial feature.  I assure you, the task of highlighting on the Q10 will provide you with greater challenge and frustration than this Operation Game. Imagine the absurdity of playing two games of Operation simultaneously and you'll get the idea; it's because of the finicky way OS10 is designed that you will find yourself highlighting when you don't want to and not being able to highlight when you do want to. Even moving the cursor to an exact spot is a daunting task. I find myself settling with the rough proximity that the 'disc/Frisbee' takes me, then I delete the text and type what I intended from there.  Any user/owner of the Q10 will know exactly what I'm talking about, and while the glowing reviews are obviously based on the potential of OS10 being 'fixed', this review is based on the Q10's current performance.The subsections of the `hub' are a hassle to access from your homepage and should have a dedicated button instead of a series of swipes and touches for accessing.  You can attempt a diagonal swiping gesture and then a touch, but you'll risk inadvertently touching the tab buttons at the bottom of the homepage that will take you several pages away from your intended destination.  Which reminds me, be certain to purchase the optional insurance policy from your carrier; you'll want coverage when you inevitably hurl your Q10 at the pavement at full force while screaming obscenities.  The text messaging uses a bubble chat layout with no other layout options. While you can shrink the text to a font size of 5 or 6, the bubble chat layout pervades. It's as if this OS10 was designed for the buttonless Z10 and RIM was too lazy to fully test and revise it for the Q10.  If you and your correspondents are limited to texts that are comprised of 3 to 5 words per message, then this probably won't bother you much, but if you send elaborate texts that convey extensive information, then the Q10 is currently a FAIL for texting. While this can be resolved with an update, it's no guarantee that RIM will address this major issue.As many have said before, for virtually all tasks, it takes multiple actions to achieve what the Bold 9900 could do in one or two clicks, and that's assuming that you executed the `gestures' to the Q10's liking.  OS10 is akin to navigating the Windows 8 splash/metro page without the use of a mouse. Want to view the screen on your Q10? HA!! You'll have to swipe a couple times from the bottom to wake it up, or you press the top button to wake up the display but then you still have to swipe swiftly and fully (starting from the very bottom) just to be able to begin using your phone. It's a painful experience that will never be sufficiently resolved because of the missing trackpad and corresponding buttons.It's obvious that the Q10 was not designed for traditional Blackberry users; it's intended to win market share away from the users of the iToy, and whatever corporate imbecile(s) approved that course of action should be canned or restricted to sorting in the mailroom.  If we wanted a phone with a larger screen for watching flash videos and playing games at the cost of productivity/efficiency/accuracy/simplicity, we would have bought Apple's iToy to begin with.  A Blackberry should excel in productivity of it's callendar, calls, texts, and emails, but RIP... er RIM, apparently forgot, and for the time being, has abandoned their roots.  I can't help but ponder if the programming team of OS10 had ever held a Blackberry before, it's either that or RIM was infiltrated by competitors that wanted to insure RIM's expedient demise.To serve as a semi-upgrade to my Bold 9900, as the Q10 was one step forward in hardware but two steps backwards in nearly all other regards, I ordered the BLACKBERRY PORSCHE DESIGN P'9981 8GB QWERTY IN BLACK COLOR UNLOCKED P9981 MOBILE PHONE from Blackberry's affiliate, Porsche Design, this very evening. The 9981 has a straight and larger button keyboard that the Q10 took design pointers from. My next upgrade will be a future Blackberry release that isn't a crippled touchscreen device. Come to think about it, my biggest complaint of the 9900 was it's inability to disable the touchscreen (my cheek or ear would make unintended calls or put the other party on hold), a touchscreen that I NEVER found the need to intentionally interact with as the trackpad + buttons were more efficient, otherwise it was a near perfect design. If RIM/Blackberry has officially abandoned their core product in hopes to compete exclusively in the touchscreen market then you can safely hold onto your put contracts or simply don't cover your shorts until Blackberry is delisted.This rant has constructive consequences in mind.  If you share the same sentiment in that Blackberry should not abandon the trackpad + buttons concept (which IMHO was the crux of Blackberry's competitive edge), then vote that you found this review helpful and perhaps RIM will listen to their remaining patrons. I bet the bulk of  the remaining Blackberry employees have the common sense to know what their buyers want from their products, they just need to oust certain corporate nimrods to prevent future blunders of this magnitude.February 27th, 2014 update: Rejoice ye faithful Blackberry 9900 users... we need only wait until sometime after Q2 of 2014 to upgrade our 3 year old 9900s, for a worthy upgrade known as the Q20 will be available this year!! The official press release states that the Q20 will be complete with a trackpad and action buttons.  Thank God for John Chen, a CEO gifted with enough common sense to give Blackberry users a device they want.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but immaturity of the OS shows.", "Author": "Demon_Mustang", "ReviewID": "R3EIJ30F9QTY3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[UPDATE] More than 8 months with this device, and with the new OS 10.2.1 update, I have updated this review to reflect the new things I've learned and some of the fixes they have released.First of all, let me say that although I'm giving the phone 5 stars, I am in NO WAY saying it is a perfect phone. There are definitely faults in the OS, and I will detail all of them in this review. It is a 5 star phone for me since I love having a physical keyboard and the problems it has are problems that can be fixed with a software update. And I am actively participating in their beta zone program to make sure these issues are brought to their attention so that they will be fixed.Hardware:Let me start with what you'll see right away when you pick up the phone. The build quality of this phone is top notch. I'm actually a little sick of the plastic and glass slabs that make up 90% of the phone market. The only ones of those phones that stand out are the original iPhone with the metal back, and the HTC One. The back of this device looks like carbon fiber. Everyone's first thought is that it must be fake. It is actually a proprietary material they made for this device, they call \"glass weave\" so it's actually really close to being carbon fiber and it's 100% legit, not just a pattern printed on plastic. The fret going across the back above the battery door is stainless steel. The bezel surrounding the phone is black, but it's actually steel, so still not plastic. The frets in between the keys are stainless steel as well. So basically, the only plastic you'll ever touch while using this phone are the individual keys on the keyboard. To me, regardless of how nice the HTC One is compared to the other slabs, it's still just a slab of glass on a slab of metal. The HTC One doesn't have a back cover so you can access the battery, so you're stuck with the battery like you would be with an iphone. This is bad if you are a power user that normally would either opt for a 3rd party high capacity battery replacement, or someone who will carry around a second battery to swap out when the one in the phone runs out. Yes, there are plenty of people who use their phones that much that this is necessary. It's also bad for the rest of us because batteries don't last forever. They start to lose their overall capacity soon after you start to use it and recharge it. Eventually you will NEED to replace the battery. On phones like the HTC One and iPhone you're stuck either figuring out how to open the phone up to replace the battery, finding someone who knows how to do this, or buying a new phone. The Q10 manages to combine premium materials with a lot of intricate lines. It really looks like a lot of craftsmanship went into putting these phones together. The frets actually dovetails into the bezel like different parts of furniture interlocking together. The only complaint about the build quality is an issue with the spacebar that I've read some people having. Mine is actually rock solid, but I've heard enough people say the same thing to know it must be a real issue with at least some of the phones out there.The screen is a Super AMOLED screen, and the touchscreen is responsive. The Super AMOLED is very vibrant and the pixel density is impressive. So images look sharp and colors really pop. I really like the screen. One issue with the screen that I've read about is that it's not as bright as a normal LCD screen, and this is true. So some people complain that in direct sunlight it's hard to make out what's on the screen. Personally, I live in South Florida and the sun is blazing here year round, and so far I don't find it that bad. I have used the Q10 outdoors without an issue, but it is definitely not as bright as other phones I've used with LCD's. Another issue with the Super AMOLED screen is if you've seen pictures or videos of the phone running and sometimes you're viewing it from an angle, you'll notice a greenish tint to the screen. This happens with every Super AMOLED screen I've seen, but it only really happens from an angle. For you looking right at the screen this effect doesn't happen. And even from an angle, the tint on this particular phone is VERY light and barely noticeable.[UPDATE] And now with OS 10.2.1 they added a \"white balance\" slider where you can slide it from cooler to warmer in color tone. I've read that the warmer setting is easier on the eyes if you're using the phone in complete darkness, buy I kept mine in the middle since it hasn't bothered me.Software:Now this is where the phone shows its immaturity. I hate comparing it to my previous BlackBerry because I understand this is a brand new OS, they are trying to move forward and not get stuck in the past, which is what doomed them to lose their place as the number 1 smartphone in the first place. But it is a fact that regardless of your feelings about how they lagged behind in their hardware, the way they had their software configured to run for the sake of efficient communications was actually very good. So a lot of these features would be amazing features to have on the Q10. That's the only reason why I might make that comparison. I do not want them to go back to their old ways, I simply want good, common sense, features to be added to this phone.First, there is something called universal search. This is a great feature since the phone has a keyboard that never goes away. You can start typing from the homescreen without needing to launch an app or anything before, and it'll start populating options and searches based on what you're typing. For example, if you wanted to search the internet for something, instead of launching the browser app, navigating to google or bing and then typing your search query, on the Q10, all you have to do is start typing the search query right from the homescreen. Then out of your options, just touch the icon for google or bing and it'll automatically bring you to the search results. It's blazingly fast to get things done this way, and to me it's worth losing screen real-estate to have this feature. Now here are a few issues with the universal search as it is now. The contacts results are only sorted alphabetically, when they should be sorted by relevance or by how often you contact each individual. For example, when I want to call my mother, I'll simply start typing \"mom\" from the homescreen. Even though \"mom\" matched my address book entry \"Mom\" 100%, it'll show me \"Jenn's Mom\" and \"Juan's Mom\" before \"Mom\" simply because j comes before m. And unfortunately it only shows the top 2 and I actually have to touch the icon for more results to see the mom I wanted to contact in the first place... It SHOULD order it with \"Mom\" first since that matches what I'm typing the most, or if they go by popularity, it should also put \"Mom\" first since I make sure to regularly talk to my mother while I pretty much never call those other two entries. They are just there so if they happen to text or call me for some reason I know who it is...[UPDATE] One of my favorite features of my old BB phones was the universal search and the extended search options. One in particular that I was really sad to find missing from the Q10 when it first came out was youtube. Basically before, if I wanted to find a video by searching for it, instead of launching the app or going to the website and then clicking search, and then typing, all I would do is start typing, then touch the youtube icon, and it would automatically launch the youtube app and show me the results of that search. It was super quick and I loved showing up my friends when they went to look for a video how I would have it up and playing before they even got it to where they can start typing the search. And this was back with my old Bold 9900 on that old outdated hardware and software. Well, when I first got the Q10, the youtube extended search option doesn't show up anymore, and I was a little disappointed in that. HOWEVER I found out that the extended search options are not really something the OS control, but the apps themselves. And since there isn't an actual youtube app (made by youtube for the BB10) this time around, that's why the universal search option for youtube isn't present. There is a 3rd party youtube app called Super Tube (which is FREE) that actually adds the universal search extended search option. So once you download that app, this awesome extended search option makes its triumphant return!! And the Super Tube app is a great app, better than the normal youtube app in my opinion. So no compromise there.Another issue I have with the Q10 is that it appears they tried to simplify the interface a bit when it comes to setting notification sounds and profiles. With previous BB's like my Bold 9900, I was able to not only turn vibrate on and off, I was also able to set how many times it will vibrate and even the length of each vibration. And this was for each individual notification type. So for example, I could have my text messages vibrate 2 times quickly (short vibration length), and my facebook notification would vibrate one long time (one vibration but long duration), phone calls would be 3 vibrations quickly, and voicemail will be 2 medium. So even if I have the phone on vibrate only or I couldn't hear the tone, I knew what just came in by the feel of the vibration. With the Q10, you can still set the number of times, but you no longer could set the duration of the vibrations. I really wish they add that feature back in a future OS update. Another notification feature that went away that was useful was individual volume controls for different notifications. Now you just have one master volume that applies to notifications for phone calls, BBM, texts, emails, etc. Before you were able to change them individually, so maybe make texts ring louder than email because you find them more urgent, or make your phone ringtone a little quieter than the BBM messages. Or any combination you choose, just giving examples. Again, hopefully that will be added back in a future update.Right now they are considering ideas for more locking options instead of just a password lock. I personally like using a normal password instead of the pattern lock (since some people can figure those out by looking at the smudges on the screen), but more options never hurt anyone. They are considering facial recognition, pattern lock, and pin lock. I hope they do expand on this in a future update. I will keep using the password myself, but I think it's a good idea for them to give options to those who might want to choose them.[UPDATE] They have added what they call picture lock. It is actually quite clever. It is hard to explain how it works, but let's just say that even if someone is watching over your shoulder and clearly watches you unlock your device, that person still wouldn't know how you did it. I want to see people say the same about pin lock or pattern lock... Heck, pattern lock is so easy to break since you can most of the time see the pattern streaked onto the screen since that's the motion they do the most besides scrolling up and down...Here's an issue I really don't like. Their music player doesn't allow you to pick the folder it includes in the library. It basically scans your phone and memory card for any music files and they automatically show up in the music library. The bad part about this is I have a whole folder of mp3 files that are just custom ringtones I use. They are for notifications, I don't want them being mixed into my music playlist... The music player is also missing an equalizer, something the Bold 9900's music player had, so don't understand why they had to cut useful features like that.[UPDATE] I'm not really sure if they fixed anything in the stock music player or not, but I've found a great 3rd party music app called Neutron Music Player. It's not free unfortunately, but if listening to music is important to you, I am telling you it is worth it. Not only does it have an equalizer, but it actually makes your music sound better than the stock music player. It processes the music much cleaner and if you're an audiophile you'll notice the difference. So I definitely recommend that.[UPDATE]One huge advantage of having a physical keyboard that never goes away was the ability to set almost every key as a speed dial for your contacts. So from the homescreen, without having to launch the phone app, contacts app, or anything, all you had to do was hold down the key you set before and it'll start dialing. For example, if one of my friends was set as the letter \"c\" on my speed dial list, all I had to do was hold down \"c\" from the homescreen and it's already calling that friend. It makes making multiple phone calls EXTREMELY fast and efficient. That feature didn't make it into the Q10 at launch, but with OS 10.2.1, they finally added back one-button home-screen speed dialing!! Now all you have to do to make a call to someone on your speed dial list is from the homescreen, hold the button corresponding to the contact you assigned to it, and it'll make the call. Fast, easy, and no need to even look at the phone once in the process! :-)Lastly, and everyone should already know this, apps. Now before people start complaining about how BlackBerry 10 doesn't have the millions of apps iPhone or Android has, remember that those platforms have been around for YEARS. Even though the name Blackberry has been around for years, this new OS is completely new, not at all backwards compatible with their previous OS's, so that means they had to start from scratch with apps since none of the old apps will work in the new OS. So considering this fact, it's quite impressive that they have about 100,000 apps already within the first few months of these new phones being on the market.[UPDATE] With OS 10.2.1, you can now install Android apps the same way you would do it from an Android device. All you'll have to do is load one of these Android marketplace apps on your phone and then browse, search, download, and install, just like you would on an Android. Please feel free to comment if you need further assistance in accomplishing this.Now I'm sure you're wondering how I'm giving this phone 5 stars while listing nothing but what I consider negatives or places where the phone can improve. It's simple, constructive criticism helps people make a purchasing decision more than blind praise. But here are the definite positive aspects of the phone.The mindset behind this new OS is to fluidly move from doing one thing to the other. Other smartphones seem more like app-loaders than phones, since you go back and forth between a home screen into an app, back out, then into another app, then back out, then into another app. With BB10, you can go into apps and do what you need there, while using the communications functions of the phones in a fluid movement from one to the other instead of the back and forth. From any app, all you have to do is drag your thumb from the bottom of the screen upward, then slide it over to the right, and you basically end up dragging the screen you were just looking at over to the side a little and doing that exposes the \"Hub\" (which is the communications backbone of the phone) so you can see who just texted you, emailed you, or what facebook notification you just got, etc. etc. without having to exit the app you were just using. It's still there, off to the side a little waiting for you to make your decision on what to do. If you choose to address the notification, just continue that movement to the side and the app will slide away and now you're in the Hub to handle that text or whatever. If you decide that your activities in that app is more important than the notification that just came in, just reverse that motion and you drag the app back to being full screen and you continue doing what you were doing. I've found this feature very useful and very intuitive once you get used to the gestures.Speaking of the hub, it's a really great concept that I'm liking. You can fully customize it, but it's basically a \"grand central station\" for all of your communications. All of your texts, emails, facebook notifications, twitter notifications, whatsapp, etc. all go into this hub. So no matter how someone decides to try to contact you, you don't need to go searching, it goes to one place. And from that hub you can actually reply without needing to exit and launch the app. Meaning if someone sends you a facebook message, you go into your hub, read the message there, then simply type your response as if you're responding to a text, and hit send, and you've just sent your friend a facebook message back. All without even touching the facebook app. This is the same deal with Twitter and any other social group you belong to.[UPDATE] With OS 10.2.1, they added something called a \"priority hub.\" You can't say that you ONLY talk to your best friends or family members. No matter how much we try, we end up communicating with people we find \"important\" along with those we just don't. I guess it's like the difference between an acquaintance and an actual friend. Well, with the priority hub, it lets you organize that a bit better. You assign your close friends, your significant other, your family to your priority hub. Now you can switch your hub to only display priority messages and it'll only show them. This update also added a pop-down instant preview of incoming messages, working together with the priority hub you can now set it to only display previews from your priority contacts, so not every incoming message will show the instant preview. Those are just quick examples of how those new features can be used, you can customize them any way you wish.I mentioned universal search before, but there's another neat aspect to this. They call it \"Type and Go\" and basically from the homescreen, there are several shortcut commands you can start typing that will perform certain functions. Like you can simply start typing \"Email Chris\" and it'll have an option to start the email that you simply type the text you want and hit send. Or you can also type \"fb I am hungry\" and it'll actually update your facebook status to \"I am hungry\" without needing to go into your facebook app. You can also type \"tweet Going out tonight\" and you guessed it, it'll tweet that via twitter without you needing to open twitter. This feature is a very nice concept and helps you be very productive so you spend less time staring at your phone but you complete everything you want to get done anyway. There are still some minor issues like I've mentioned before about the search contact listings, but it's all issues that will probably be fixed or ironed out as the OS matures a bit. It's still very early on, but it's a very polished machine for what it is.[UPDATE] When the phone first came out, swiping down from the top of the screen is generally the gesture to pull up settings for whatever app you're using. From the home screen, swiping down from the top will being down the quick settings available for the phone. In the beginning, these quick settings were set and you cannot change them. Now, you have full customizing ability with this menu. And along with that, they added a ton of different things you can set to the quick settings. My favorite is the flashlight. No more launching apps, just swipe down and touch the flashlight icon. Repeat to turn it off.[UPDATE] Another thing I've started to notice in the 8 months of using this phone, is just how quickly I get the camera up. You might think I'm making this up, but literally I've found myself [cheekily] commenting to my friend \"Wow, takes you that long to find your camera?\" when I see my friend trying to get to it. Apparently the camera app is just that, an app, on most phones, namely Android phones. So when you scroll to another page of apps, the phone app icon will scroll away with that page it is on. So if you're not already on that page, you have to scroll around to find it. Of course, this is after waking up the phone, and unlocking the phone. Well, on BB10, the camera icon is static, like the phone call icon. So no matter which page of apps you're on, the camera button is always right there on the bottom right. Also, even if your phone is locked, the camera button is still there for the using. And no, this doesn't mean your phone will switch to the camera all of the time accidentally while your screen is locked. While the phone is locked, you have to press and hold the camera icon for it to turn on. Pretty hard to do this by accident. But I've really started to realize just how fast and easy this is when I watch my friends clumsily fumble about their phone looking for the camera app, lol. I kind of feel bad while pointing it out, but I kind of don't, lol.[UPDATE] Another addition with OS 10.2.1 is lock screen notification previews. You can see a quick preview of your notifications from the lock screen with this update. Which is nice, didn't like that you had to unlock the screen before you know if the notifications you have are important or not.Some people will argue that with all of these autocomplete features that they can type just as fast or faster on their touchscreens, but the fact of the matter is the physical keyboard is more accurate. I don't NEED autocorrect at all while typing texts to my friends. You will never see an autocorrect fail where I meant to say one thing and my phone decided to post something completely different and sometimes really inappropriate. If sending out clear and precise information to everyone is important to you, then having this keyboard is a definite must. Imagine saying something very inappropriate by accident to your boss or some other business contact. That could mean some serious issues down the road... And although honestly your options for phones with a physical keyboard is very slim, I'm happy to say I don't only recommend the Q10 simply because of a lack of choices, but it's actually a very nice phone. Just be warned that there is a learning curve. There is no back button or anything like that, navigation through the phone is purely via gestures on the screen. So you do have to memorize and get used to these gestures, so it might be a little clunky and frustrating at first, but once you get used to it (took me less than a few hours of playing with the phone to get used to them) it's actually very fun and intuitive to use. But give it some time, maybe up to a week if you're really ingrained into the way other phones work...For keyboard lovers, it is definitely the best phone out there, hands down, no discussion. I really hope this review has been informative enough for you to make a decision on whether or not this phone is worth your hard-earned money. If you have any questions please feel free to ask them in the comments. :-)[UPDATE] So after 8 months of using this phone, and especially after the OS update to 10.2.1 I went from thinking this is a great phone and a great start for a new OS, to simply really loving the phone. There is definitely still room for improvement in the OS, but so far most of the important things are definitely covered, so the 5-star review stands. :-)", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best BB10 phone yet", "Author": "Keith.S", "ReviewID": "R2OVBF4M7IZFK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I jumped in and got the Z10 when it came out.

The Pros of the phone: It has Skype like the S3 and iphone 5 which makes a big difference to me with all the international calling I do. In comparison to the other previous blackberrys i've owned the touch screen is much bigger and smoother. Also like the S3 and Iphone 5 it had a front facing camera. The operating system is also just as fast as the s3 and iphone. There are several features however that I enjoyed about the previous blackberrys that are no longer available. When it comes to hardware, there is no more convenience key. Second there is no more trackball or back button which can be annoying at times. When it comes to software, there is no longer the option for auto power on and off, this was one of my favourite things about the blackberry that i am hoping they will bring back in a patch in the future. Another like I liked about the previous blackberry operating system that is no longer there is the fact that you were able to change the size of the folders and icons. When it comes to the Apps, there are also still are missing that i would like to see come out like some more banking applications and news applications. This phone is still brand new, so I think many of these software problems can and will be fixed quickly and it is by far my favourite out of all my phones i've had.

A. Dumas", "ReviewID": "R1U28VBM2F7FRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not able to buy via Amazon because I needed AT&T; LTE, and so had to go elsewhere. But I've had the device for several days now and absolutely love it. In the past, I've used all versions of the iPhone, a variety of Android devices, and more recently Windows Phone 8 for the last two years. I really liked the various Nokia Windows Phone 8 devices I had but was intrigued by the central hub of Blackberry 10, the keyboard, and highly rated browser. And so:About me: I'm a complete gadget freak, who has never found nirvana in a phone - smart or otherwise. I do need a mobile phone to be a good *phone* however, and this is where most smart phones fall down.  The Blackberry q10 is almost better than talking on a landline - an experience I had forgotten about after so many years of mediocre call quality.  It's blazing fast - on many of my other devices, I wouldn't bother clicking on links because even with LTE, it wasn't worth the wait. The Blackberry q10 loads so quickly, it's unreal.  Embedded videos play without a hitch. Nothing hangs, dangles or lingers. It just works.The biggest selling point for me is the hub. Many professional reviewers questioned the value of centralized communications, but I can't think of a single negative for having everything in one place (plus, you can select what you want to appear there/or not).Other features that work for me:- \"Remember\": Fabulous and easy way to manage lists, emails and to do's on the go.- Type and go...you just type and go. Searching, emails, texts, searching for a contact. It's very cool not to have to go to the special search page to do this.Oh yes - and it has a keyboard. No matter how I've tried to love typing on glass, I've never mastered it the way somer teenagers have.  Having the keyboard makes a big difference in my desire to respond to people before I get back to a computer or tablet.Will I play games on it? No - the screen is pretty small, and that's what my iPad Mini is for.  But it's easy enough to read the news, and use other apps, such as Flixster,The logic built into the UI works for me - other OS's (except for WP 8) don't seem to have pure productivity in mind. And so if that's your bag, I highly recommend this device - just make sure you get the one that will work with your network: all unlocked phones are not created equally!I think if BB comes out with a slider version of this device, nirvana might be possible.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "waste of money & time", "Author": "Xiaoyu Z.", "ReviewID": "RGG2AHAYZF55Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After days waiting i got this Q10, i planned to use this phone in China instead of my iphone 5, however, after i changed my mini sim card to micro sim card and inserted the card, i found this device's internet is locked, it says i need to contact to the original service provider.

Let me begin by writing down some cons, because there are very few:1. If you use a lot of apps (current iPhone or Android user), this phone will disappoint you. Many apps are not available, or are made by 3rd party companies. But in my opinion, apps are generally overrated and over appreciated. The safest app is always your \"browser\". It guarantees SSL and other security. I should never trust a banking app, for instance. Always, access sensitive accounts through your phone's internet browser.2. Smaller screen than iPhone or the BlackBerry z10. If you are used to watching videos on larger screens, then this phone is not for you. Although, I feel the screen is only about an inch smaller than the iPhone. But the Q10 has greater pixel density (336 dpi vs 330 dpi) than the IPhone 4.That's it! I cannot think of any other drawbacks.The pros:1. The call/voice quality is SUPERB! It is amazing how clear the voice of the person I am speaking with sounds. Just compare it with any phone (iPhone, HTC, etc.).2. There touch screen gestures are very useful: swipe up and left to access your communication HUB is great. Also, the ability to multitask and shutdown unwanted apps are way better than iPhone or android.3. The keyboard is the BEST yet. I can type so fast that it astonishes me. I can type a whole paragraph and not make any typos. The autocorrect/learn is exceptional.4. Finally, ActiveSync is here. So your Microsoft exchange/OWA and IMAP e-mail are fully accessible. You can access contacts, folders and subfolders.5. BlackBerry messenger is absolutely amazing. You can call other BBM users via Wifi and send them text, voice, and other attachments. NO SIZE LIMITS!6. The phone is very responsive. I have used the Q10 for a month now. I never had to wait for the phone to wakeup or reboot. It has never \"crashed\". My wife's HTC android phone does that occasionally.7. Front and back camera is finally here on the BB. You can Skype!8. Expandable memory up to 32 GB.9. More system memory than the iPhone 4 (2048 MB vs 512 MB).10. Finally a note about apps. I mentioned the lack of apps in the cons. But I have all the apps I need: Twitter, YouTube, Maps, GoogleMaps (very good 3rd party build), facebook (that I care less about), Navita Language translator, Pandora (3rd party build), DropBox (3rd party), Box (alternative to DropBox), Skype, Weather, DocsToGo (word, excel, power point), Calculator (incl. scientific), Clock (Alarm/World Time/Stop Watch/Timer), QR/Bar code scanner, scanner/convert photos to PDF app, GasBuddy, Slacker Radio, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and more.If you are a current BB user, please buy the Q10 . It won't disappoint you. If you are first-time smart-phone buyer (or looking to switch from iPhone or Android), please give this phone a try. Most carriers allow at least 14 days returns. I believe you will love it.I shall update my review in a few months time.===Update===The BlackBerry 10 devices can run Android apps. Surprisingly, the process is quite easy. Please visit CrackBerryDOTcom or another BlackBerry user forum for instructions and download the application that lets you do this. I have \"sideloaded\" over a dozen Android apps on my Q10.

I can't remember a phone that just flows so perfectly when you just need to get things done. The keyboard is just a delight to use.Also I may add that the call, reception, and sound quality on this q10 is 2nd to none. I can't count the number of dropped calls with Androids and iPhones.No restarts or battery pulls like BB's of old either  I'm now on my third week of use and still have not restated this q10 with the exception of one OTA update !I can't imagine using anything else now that I have the q10, with the exception of q10 with a LARGER DISPLAY !! Yes Blackberry. are you listening? Not a 5\" inch phablet, but com'n mein I know a manageable 4\" inch display could be designed into the q10 !!A larger display could have been crammed into this unit when you consider how large the bezel around it is . Blackberry you have a winner BUT PLEASE BUILD A LARGER DISPLAY VERSION OF THE Q10 BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ONE SIZE FITS ALL.Wouldn't mind having da LCD screen ILU the Amoled also. The battery life as it stands gets 2 days. i'd be willing to sacrifice battery life for the super bright screen like on the z10. z10 is the only current phone that completely readable display in direct sunlight.Oh, and while your at it might as well start giving app developers some tools and incentives to create more and better apps.And fix the voice command, it sucks !!Although for me this is not as big an issue as display size.Thats it, the new q10 is just awesome yet the tiny display can be a bit frustrating at times.

Imagine my shock when I looked at the Q10's main pages, where it has 36 shorcuts/icons (spread over 3 pages of 12 each), ranging from \"Contacts\" to \"Browser\" to \"Calendar\" to \"Text Messages\" to (for me) utterly useless ones like \"Story Maker\", \"Videos\", \"Games\", etc. And where is the shortcut for email, you may ask? THERE ISN'T ONE! Nor (according to my IT guy) can you create one. So now the quickest way to get my emails is by going to Text Messages, \"slide back\" to the \"BlackBerry Hub\" (for which there is no shortcut/icon either, another \"duh!\" moment) and then select email. An inexcusable flaw.-- I miss the trackpad that was on the Bold. The 'swiping' interface on the Q10 is awkward, and when you want to \"click\" on something when you are on the internet, good luck! Likewise when you want to schedule something on your Calendar, or even harder, when you want to make a change to an existing item on your Calendar (say, to shorten a meeting from 60 to 30 min). Good luck with that!-- Speaking of the Calendar: want to try the \"Go to date\" function? Sorry, gone! So if you want to see what day of the week it is on, say, February 28, 2014, you have to go month by month to get there. Wow.-- Why are there separate screens for \"Work\" and \"Personal\"? There is no such distinction anymore in real life. We take our work everywhere, as we do our personal life.And on and on. I can list a number of other minor irritants, but the clumbsy way in which the emails must be accessed is the one that I simply cannot get over.The only true upgrade from the Bold is that I have now joined the rest of the world and can access the internet quickly and without any problem. I admit it's nice to have.Aside from the Browser function, I cannot say with a straight face that the Q10 is in any way an upgrade from the Bold. Bottom line: as a longtime fan and user of BlackBerry devices, I must tell you that I find the Q10 frustrating to use and disappointing. Buyer/user beware.*UPDATE (late September)* now 2 more weeks later, I have turned in my Q10 and have gone back to my old BB Bold. So I'm missing out on the great internet browsing that the Q10 provided, but I have all the things I loved about the Bold, and still love...", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Careful what u wish for", "Author": "Lincoln", "ReviewID": "RD024Y3TY0Q15", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be careful what u wish for.

James", "ReviewID": "R32VKFHF4YFXMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cell phones are really about the software. The look and feel of the hardware is important, but it's the software that you are really interacting with.I'm assuming that anyone reading about the Q10, has owned a BlackBerry and is aware of the BlackBerry OS 10 and \"The Hub\" feature, so I won't bother mentioning that here as others have written about it elsewhere.If you're a game player, than this phone, with it's small screen is not for you...When BlackBerry's new OS 10 Z10 touch screen phones came out one year ago, my carrier sent me one to replace my malfunctioning Bold 9900.But using that phone (running on the new OS 10.1) for business quickly proved to be a bad experience.Slsewhere on Amazon, I wrote a review of the Z10 as a business phone.I don't think that I kept that phone more than a few days before I returned it and went back to my dying Bold.Then last November I  had read that BlackBerry's new Q10 had the latest operating system update, 10.2 and the review listed the improvements to the way the phone operated as well as the features that had been returned to the phone.So, I bought one.. only to find out that the 10.2 software update had only been released in Europe and Canada, but not in the U.S.As a business phone, the Q10 on 10.1 was a huge disappointment to use and I was going to write a review about it, but the first review listed here, written by Sean P. really accurately summed up my experience at the time with the Q10 and so there was no point to that.To put it mildly, trying to use the phone with BlackBerry OS 10.1 software was time consuming and frustrating.Especially if you were typing a document or even an sms and needed to edit it... The editing tools took forever to get to function..With OS 10.1, text editing is nearly impossible, because the touch screen sensors wouldn't respond to the touch inputs.. (Inputs and editing which are identical to an iPhone).At the time, in my opinion, the only features that were great about the phone, are the battery life (in heavy usage, it seems to last all day), it's ruggedness, the width and therefore ease of use of the touch screen and the predictive typing (as much as I like the iPhone, BlackBerry is miles ahead with that feature).I was getting ready to return my Q10, when I learned about how to get the 10.2.0 update (via a \"Leak\"... something that owners of other types of phones don't have to deal with).When I installed that, many of the problems with the phone, like text editing were lessened or resolved.I had also read that the 10.2.1 update was due to be released soon and so, I kept the phone, because it was at least useable and showed promise.With 10.2.0 they phone's screen responded more accurately to the touch inputs and reinstalled was one touch speed dialing, but only from the call screen.Plus there were new features, like lock screen notifications, that I found useful and other features, like the Dark Screen background in the Calendar, that I visually liked.But with the new OS 10.2.1 update installed, it's like having a souped up Bold 9900.The Q10 running on OS 10.2.1 combines a physical keyboard and the functionality of a touchscreen along with the availability of the same apps as all of the other  smart phones.Back is universal one touch speed dialing from the home screen as well as the call screen.Back is the organization of your contacts into category folders.Back is a manual type of selective sync, where individual folders and files from your computer, can be dragged over to the phone (in the BlackBerry Link application).Once you get used to it, there is a quickness to the flow of gesturing with the Q10 which, in terms of navigating around the phone, seems to be faster than the iPhone 5S. Combined with the physical keyboard, it makes for a very easy and efficient phone to use.As an example, with the iPhone, if you're in an app and you want to perform a search of the phone, you press the home screen button to move out of the app, and then gesture down to bring up the keyboard and then start typing.With the Q10, if you're in an app, you gesture up to move out of the app and then start typing.If you're in an app on the iPhone and you want to make a phone call, you have to move out of the app, press the phone app and if the keypad is not up, press that and then dial (tap) your call.On the Q10, you move out of the app and start dialing the phone number.Or if the number you want to call is a contact that's been assigned a speed dial button, then you can just hold the button and the number dials.Also with the release of OS 10.2.1, BlackBerry has finally addressed the issue regarding the lack of apps that are found on both Droid and iOS phones.They have done this by opening the door that allows for the  direct downloading and launching of the .apk apps that are available for DROID phones.Business apps, like credit card readers, invoicing and estimating programs as well as the endless host of apps that are only supported on iOS and Droid, can now be run on BlackBerry OS 10 phones.My only real criticisms are of the native Voice Control feature, the camera, spam and the lack of call blocking (either native or via a 3rd party app.)BlackBerry's Voice Control is really a hit and mostly miss affair. It sort of reminds me of an Abbot and Costello routine. The phone just doesn't understand the commands most of the time. And when it does, after confirming the command, it asks you if you want to the phone to perform that command \"now\" which is redundant.Siri on the iPhone 5S buries BlackBerry's voice control in every way.The camera, both in it's image quality and it's functions, is mediocre at best.Unlike the iPhone 5S, which has built in native call blocking and junk mail filters or the Legacy BlackBerry's which have really good call blocking and spam apps approved for the phone, OS 10 phones as of this writing, lack the ability to selectively block phone calls or filter junk mail, either natively or with a 3rd party app.If you are a business owner who constantly gets calls from telemarketers, you'll find the inability to set up call blocking lists, to be annoying.And to address those of you who still use a Bold or other phone with a track pad, gesturing is not faster and it's not more efficient when it comes to text editing. It's never going to be.But the use of track pads on smart phones is being universally discontinued. Until someone figures out that track pads and jog dials are much smarter to use, it's a reality that has to be accepted.Galaxy has returned the use of the stylus, because it's more accurate than your finger... (I always thought that Jobs was off base when he introduced the iPhone and said that \"your finger is the only stylus you need\").And the other reality is, that track pads are only a second to a few seconds faster. Even though mentally it can seem like it, seconds are not minutesTo sum up:BlackBerry was always a phone for business and with the Q10 now running on OS 10.2.1 we are seeing a return to the concerns of using a phone to facilitate the running of a business.There are trade offs between all of the top smart phones out there and certainly the Q10 running on 10.2.1, while it may lack in a few features, does some things better than other phones.You just have to decide what features in a phone are important to you.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Blackberry OS 10 is the best !", "Author": "Luciano Magno Barreto Paiva", "ReviewID": "R7X7UVZN7WAFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owned the Q10 a 2 weeks past, and i can say: the black berry OS 10 is the best at this moment.

I came to the Q10 from the blackberry 9900. The transition was a bit difficult, since the phone's UI has a learning curve, and the initial OS builds lacked some functionality and had a few bugs that I didn't like. I think many old time BB users got the phone thinking that it would support every function that their old phone did. The problem is that OS10 (which the Q10 runs) is entirely new, so there will be some features missing (like very robust USB outlook sync). That being said, this is an excellent phone.I like the OS on this phone because it is extremely well designed, consistent and fast to use. Whereas IMO, an android phone feels as though it was designed by committee with inconsistent look and feel, OS conventions, etc. In any case, the OS is very fast, intuitive and powerful. Yes, it doesn't have the apps that android does, but it has everything I need and is far superior to the old BB OS in terms of app offerings. The phone is also constructed well and has an awesome speaker - easily the best I've heard on any phone. Call quality is top notch. Imagine a smart phone that you can actually use as a phone ;-)But the real kicker is this - if you want a powerful smartphone with great battery life, a modern OS and a keyboard, there is simply no other alternative.If you buy the phone, makes sure you upgrade to 10.1 MR release of the OS and use the latest version of BBlink.

Let's be honest here, most of this stuff (reviews) is all opinions and personal preference, and I do not care too much about apps., I am more of a functionality type person and I really like an actual keyboard, and that 1 actual function means a ton to me. That being said, this new keyboard feels at least 35% better than the previous updated Bold's model, it is slightly larger, softer keyed, and just feels better in your hands. The Q10 (for me) runs about 3 days between charges (moderate texting & 15 min or so a day wifi), and the phone itself responds very fast. I would recommend this phone to any Blackberry lover, anyone who likes the qwerty style keyboard, and if you like the touch style screen, grab the Z10, because these 2 phones have been made amazingly well (warning* if you buy a Z10 outright online make sure you get the correct model # that goes with your provider).Corry", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's Different....

Very quickly, though, you'll realize the second nature use of the keyboard is still there and makes this a completely utilitarian device, too.  The slightly bigger size is not enough to hinder the one hand type input that many BB users can do in their sleep.  So, you get a little classic and a little leading edge all in one device.  The bells are there as well- high quality camera, voice commands (suspiciously like Siri), video calling, shared device viewing and even the little tap of the phones data sharing.

The phone works but certain features are not available and I had to charge the battery at least 4 times a day.  Eventually I called Verizon tech support to see what was going on (because the Blackberry was an unlocked Verizon phone) and was informed that Verizon phones cannot be used on other networks because of the complexity of Verizon's network.  So essentially I was having that battery issue because I was using a phone built for the Verizon network on an AT&T; network and they use different frequencies for their reception and different internal components, and for that reason I was having such bad battery life.  So, if you are with AT&T; don't buy a Verizon phone.  It will probably still work, but not every feature will be available and your battery life may be non-existent.

It was time to replace my 9900 Bold (which I liked a lot). I spent the summer in Europe, forced to use an iPhone (a topic for another day) and disliked it. I seriously considered the Galaxy S4, but decided to stay with my trustworthy, familiar Blackberry. I love the hard keyboard because I find it next-to-impossible to type on a small screen. The 9900 was the worst web browsing device ever, so I was hoping to get something better for that. I use very few third-party apps, so that was not a big consideration.I am sad to say, the Q10 phone has been a step backwards in almost every way. I use a smartphone for calls, email, texting, camera, and browsing (in that order of importance). The biggest problem is, what was once possible with one action (holding the phone in one hand, using the thumb to type, select, whatever, while on the go) now takes at least three actions. This is made worse by the unreliable screen (if at first you don't succeed, swipe, swipe again).My top 10 things that are worse on this phone:1. Can only move the cursor and/or select apps with your finger on the touch screen. (9900 had a pad on it and a clearly contrasting cursor that you could easily see and move.)2. Can't run spell check as you exit email. (You must manually check your spelling by looking at the squiggly underlines.)3. Can't put email on desktop. (You must swipe to get to the hub, scroll through email account/text/messenger/calls, then select.)4. Can't put memo on desktop. (You must select \"remember,\" then notes, then pick your memo file.)5. Touch screen is hard to use, usually takes multiple tries. Also, locating the cursor in a file is MUCH harder than other smartphones I have tried.6. Can't change font size in email, calendar, or text messages. (I only use glasses to read and cannot read it without my glasses.)7. Speed dial is now slow dial. (It requires three steps, might as well use contacts. On the 9900, just hold down the speed dial key.)8. Calendar doesn't adjust with time zones. (I travel internationally a lot. This may be a setting, but I have not found it.)9. Calendar is slow to update with meeting changes. Sometimes it fails to remove a meeting that was cancelled.10. Camera takes square pictures.Sorry Blackberry, it was good while it lasted.

Q10 is a good phone with two fatal flaws, and I ended up ditching it and going to an iphone with a Typo keyboard case instead.Flaw #1: the main reason I switched to the Note is because BB always had a habit of giving up on sending an email after few minutes if it couldn't get a signal. It would sit in the email list, and you would never know it had not been sent. Unbelievably, they left this bug in the new OS. Yes fellas, Q10 will fail to send your emails and let it sit on the device forever and never alert you except for a little red dot next to the email. Of course if you get a lot of emails (why else would you have a Q10) it drops below the fold quickly and you never see it.Flaw #2: lack of apps. No Docusign. No Waze.

Schmitt", "ReviewID": "ROV3JB2K29LB9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my Q10 on 6/21 and after getting through all the activation issues, I'm still having some very basic, elementary lagging issues with my texting/BB Hub. We all know that texting is important and that it should be something that is very quick, especially nowadays, should be immediate. The issue I have is NOT NOT NOT with my network connection as it does this throughout the state and is solely within the OS. When I send a text, it takes about 30 seconds to actually show up in the conversation. I'm not referring to the time it takes to actually send, which would be fine, but physically show up in the conversation. On top of that, I can't send a text and then continue to my next text in that conversation until after the last text shows up. And all on top of that, I can't quickly move back and forth between conversations as it will keep going back to the last message I sent until the last message appears. I have spoken with AT&T; Tech Support and they couldn't do anything, now I'm going to have to do a full system restore and see if that kicks out any bugs in the OS. If that doesn't work, I'm taking it back to AT&T; and trying another Q10. If that still has the problems, I'm going to get a Samsung Galaxy S4.Please be aware that this is not just a personal issue, but blogs such as Blackberry and Crackberry, people all over are having this same issue and no OS update or resolution have been able to fix this problem. I will update if necessary, but if I don't, I've finally gone with a full touchscreen as I love the physical QWERTY keyboard. Its a disappointing problem as Blackberry was so confident with its marketing of the new 10s and multitasking through the new Hub software. Fingers are crossed for now that my issue somehow becomes resolved. Please heed this warning however because it may happen to you.***Update 6/25: I took the Q10 into AT&T; and they were as dumbfounded as I was. While there, I changed my mind about swapping for a new device and went with the Samsung Galaxy S4. I was hesitant to not only get a new device as I was worried it would occur in the future, but also with getting a full touchscreen keyboard as I have been Blackberry loyal for 10 years. I loved being able to feel the keys as I typed and not having to look down at the screen, much like typing on a computer keyboard, so it was an end of an era for me. Fortunately, the S4 was so much better in so many ways (ie, the keyboard is easy to get comfortable with and prediction is spot on but doesn't screw up your messages, and the S4 is so much more user-friendly and customizable than the bare bones Q10 - it seems like you can't customize anything with the Q10 like you used to be able to with the older BBs, and there are so many more useful apps available with the S4 - Gmail and Google Maps for two examples). So, with that said, in my review, I would definitely recommend doing away with a Blackberry and going with a more modern phone and be happier in the end after making the switch. This whole process was a huge let down and disappointment for me as I have been a big supporter of BB over the years, but this time they just fell flat on their face and let a lot of us loyal customers down.

So I gave blackberry a chance. I used to have a blackberry (about 5 years ago) and loved it because of the keyboard so I thought this would be great for me. But it's far from great for me! Here are the reasons:-Maps function was so horrible and slow that I didn't even get around to finding the actual directions. Lost my patience while typing in the address. It was just so slow-I use google docs and google apps for my business and this one didn't have that option. They did have some kind of 3rd party app for google docs but you'd have to pay for it and I did not want to buy any apps since I had a feeling I will not be using this phone.-when you scroll through a page then the swiping motion gets confused and brings you to whatever menu \"swipe up\" goes to if you swipe from too low in the screen.-Web Browser is slow and doesn't work well. It didn't open a lot of links within the 2 hours I used it. And some of these sites were blackberry's own sites! Also: that was on a good wifi network, don't even know what it would be like on 4g-I like that with Android or iOS you can see a quick glimpse of the incoming notification (email, text message etc) at the upper bar. With blackberry you have to go and \"peek\"  if you hear a notification. It's another unnecessary swipe you have to do. I have a lot of texts and emails come in and some of them are important and have to be dealt with right away. Some can wait. I don't want to have to peek into the notification hub every time I hear a text come in when I'm in the middle of typing another email or in a video call.-Pretty much the whole os is just slow. I am very fast and want my phone to be as fast. I don't want to wait even 5 seconds for something to open. I would probably be ok with it if I never got used to iPhone's speed.-Everything just seemed crowded and confusing. True, it will not be confusing once you give it a chance and get used to it but I felt like it was not worth my time to learn to get to know a new os after I have seen so many cons to it already.So, it's getting the 2nd star for the great look but nothing else. Keyboard is still awesome and the phone itself looks and feels great. I just don't see who would go to blackberry after using iPhone it just felt like I was using a phone that's about 3 years behind the rest of the smartphone market.Will be sorry to return this phone tomorrow, I wish it worked out!", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "bought but not used", "Author": "Lois A.

For those who did not listened to me you might as well trade your blackberry Z10 Q10 Q5 with iphone, Samsung or nokia Smartphone's while it still has some value left on it. You don't want to have a piece of junk  months from now cause THERE WILL BE LESS AND LESS APP'S AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMARTPHONE and expect more BUG'S because app's developers might become lazy in updating their existing app's running on BB10 knowing that this company may go under in the future. Besides blackberry employee are for sure very demoralize as they see their future dwindling and many maybe looking for other jobs. I was thinking talented employee's of blackberry many of them maybe leaving or looking for other job. So my friends and co-consumer BE WISE and save your hard earned monies. My belief is there will only be 3 major Smartphone OS in the future and they are Apple OS, ANDROID AND WINDOWS. So if you like your investment in technology and knowledge relevant in the future just concentrate on these 3 Smartphone OS and I am pretty sure your investment will not put to waste.6/27/2013 update: My fellow consumer think twice before spending too much on this phone, recently I did my Costco shopping and was surprise to see that they markdown the upfront cost for a two year contract for the Z10 (same as Q10 except for the keyboard). Since last week  you can now get the Z10 for $50 with contract used to be you have to pay $200 2 months ago, I say this product is not really selling well in our great country USA a huge markdown of 150 dollars in just a period of less than 3 months. In comparison to apple ios 5 and Samsung galaxy the price of their phone is not going down and still expensive even after 1 year I say a great investment. As you can see the price of this Q10 phone started here beyond expensive at close to $1200, now going down to close to $600. To be realistic blackberry says before the launch of Q10 that they will offer this at the range of between 650 to 750 but still a markdown of close to $600 is not a good sign. Just recently since the Q10 is not really selling well Blackberry immediately release a lower price version of it they now called Q5 price starting they say at $400. I still think Q5 is expensive.The bottom line,  I still think that blackberry devices under its new OS BB10 will be gone in the future just like palm (there will only be 3 major smartphone OS THAT WILL DOMINATE THE MARKET Apple IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID and Microsoft windows 8), but if you really like blackberry wait a little bit longer and you may get these new devices for FREE with a two year contract. But I reminded you that your Blackberry financial investment and technical knowledge will be wasted as I see no hope for this company in the future as a device manufacturer.My original posting:This is what i call a punishment for those who stick with vintage smartphone keyboard tech. basically you can buy a phone like this with keyboard for less than a hundred dollars. Blackberry is desperate for profit so they are milking monies out of their loyal hard core blackberry users. i am rating this 1 star same as i rated the z10 because the only diff between the two is the vintage keyboard. Pricewise this product is 1 star. if you are a business owner buying this phone for your business is not a wise decision because there are much cheaper phone same functionalities as this one for less than a hundred dollars.Honestly if you are a business owner you don't want your employee representing your company to carry a phone line this, because this is a turn-Off especially for young clients like 50 years old below. Maybe if you are ready to retire, don't care about what others may think of you as being too vintage THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR YOU, but still the price I think is too much. Sometimes I see guys carrying a phone like this with keyboard, and in the modern Smartphone world of app's and advance technologies, I can't help measuring a person's adept to modern technologies with the model of Smartphone he carries. I believe it is good for one person's advancement and good company reputation if they carry Smartphone impressive enough and in line with trend and future technological direction. Since this phone is good for texting, voice call, phone like this should only be sold for less than a 100 dollars. The screen not big enough, I don't see this phone good for app's, video and web browsing. Why pay too much for less functionality that you can use.If your really a hardcore blackberry user WAIT FOR THIS Q10 PHONE's price to go down to less than $200 just like other smartphone of this caliber, Take note you can save more monies if you wait a little bit longer cause you might get this for free with a two year contract, great possibility that this phones new OS will cease to exist or obsolete in a couple of years just like other smartphones new software and operating system.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.00", "Features": "Display: 720 x 720 pixels, 3.1 inches (~328 ppi pixel density)\nInternal Memory: 16 GB storage, 2 GB RAM\nCamera: 8 MP, 3264 x 2448 pixels, autofocus, LED flash\n3G: HSPA 1, 2, 5/6, 8 (850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 MHz)\n4G:LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800 / 2600 / 900 / 800 MHz)", "Name": "Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800 / 2600 / 900 / 800 MHz)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JF0j-5k1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C1DIGRI"}}
