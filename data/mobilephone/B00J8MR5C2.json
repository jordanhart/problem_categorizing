The phone is no good as far as I am concerned and I should have tested it before taking it to her in Jamaica when I went on my vacation. From the very first moment the phone battery did not last an hour after the first initial charging process. Then it stated to freeze. It would not accept the Digicel sim card that they use in Jamaica and we had to take it to the Digicel office to have them fix that. I remained hopeful and my daughter did not want to part with the phone although it will never remained charged for more than a couple minutes even after been placed on charge for hours. I left it down there with promises to get her a replacement when I returned to the USA. The phone started to overheat so badly on her that her mother refused to let her use it anymore in fear that it may hurt her. It was sent back to me recently and now I am stuck with it and have lost my money. No one wants to purchase it even for parts and now I am hoping to sell it on EBay. I am very disappointed in this product and would never recommend anyone to these phones or attempt to purchase another of this kind. This is my second most disappointed product experience with purchasing a product on amazon. This is very unfortunate to know that I lost my money in such a hard economy that we are presently living in. I didn't even want to give this product the one star rating to show how disappointed I am with this product. I hope that they (Amazon) takes this off their website as it only makes Amazon look bad although not liable for the quality of this product, it still reflects on the company and the products and services offered.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sucks", "Author": "ted", "ReviewID": "R291O7FD5UPH0V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought dis and it broke in a week...its super slow... cant download on it....dis product sucks i wouldn't recommend this.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like dealing with Amazon.com", "Author": "truman jano", "ReviewID": "R124W57JZMA7JC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks,  this item works awesome and looking forward for some more brand new electronics with low low prices.
