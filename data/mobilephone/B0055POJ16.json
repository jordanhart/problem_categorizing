The only problem I had is to have the \"Arabic\" alphabets on it as the display is completely wrong \"separated characters\". I had to install a new ROM to have the Arabic properly displaying... apart from that, a good piece of technology.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great cell phone", "Author": "Arash", "ReviewID": "RWGQ0EWPORJ39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and it's just great.The battery life is short. You will need to charge it everyday if you are a heavy user but you can almost find no other phone with the same screen size and performance using much less battery, so realistically it's a great phone.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good price, great phone, but", "Author": "J.
