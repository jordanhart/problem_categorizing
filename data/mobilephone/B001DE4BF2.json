Cole", "ReviewID": "R1RG28LIJJ4PAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I signed up for Boost Mobile, the i776 cell phone was the best offered. The phone has a great design. I love the velvety feel and sleek design. The style is small and compact. The buttons on the phone are easy to use.In researching the pay by the month plans currently available, I found Boost Mobile was the best deal. The coverage area is large. The plan I had previously on a two year contract with a major carrier, did not give me any signal inside my apartment. The payment each month with Boost Mobile is the same as what I was paying for a two year contract. I chose the unlimited plan costing $50 a month. This includes unlimited calls and unlimited internet use with my phone.The i776 has great features. The phone has a camera which offers two picture qualities-normal and fine. The size of the picture comes with four settings- wp 128x160, small 128x96, medium 160x120, large 320x240, and x-large 640x480. There is an airport setting as well. If this is activated, the phone will shut off whenever a person enters a place where cell phones are not allowed and turn back on when they leave the area. The phone is Bluetooth enabled and GPS.
