I like the functionality of keeping notes that upload to my company email note file on outlook, instantly. 3. keypad is nice and seems to be pretty durable even after two years of button mashing.4, voice quality is the best i have yet to run accross for a blackberry. I have used them since the beginning and this one outperforms the rest.Cons: takes forever to reset, limited apps, many websites and services are discontinuing apps for blackberry in favor of Droid platform or Iphone...Also has issues with youtube video formats, my carrier still has not been able to provide fixes for this, so if you youtube alot, dont expect to do it with the Blackberry.

The phone came very fast, it was brand new in the original blackberry box. It came with all the accessories brand new from the package. The phone was unlocked, I just inserted my sim card and it instantly connected to my local network. I will encourage everyone to purchase from OEM Planet as other sellers got bad reviews.
