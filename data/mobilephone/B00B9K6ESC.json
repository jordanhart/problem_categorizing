Despite this the phone does its job quite well.  I found through usage of the device when calling, texting, web browsing, or loading up different applications I never had any problem with the phone lagging or force closing due to lack of performance.  Of course this device lags when running graphically intensive games such as Temple Run 2.The Event has a 3.5\" screen which is the same size as the iPhone 4 and 4S.  This may seem small compared to larger mainstream phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 but I found that the screen was just fine for talking, texting and tapping away at various apps.  This device also comes with Swype if you prefer to use it.  In my experience Swype has never personally worked well for me.  That being said that depends on each individual what they think of the Swype keyboard.  You can always change to the default Android keyboard or another third-party keyboard from the Google Play Store.Battery life is great with this device.  With light usage I was able to squeeze 2 days out of the battery!  With heavier usage I was able to make it through the day without any problems.  The device also has a built-in Eco Mode to save power when you need to.This device also has a handy notification LED to let you know when you miss a call or receive a text message.The camera is terrible on this phone.  That's the only way to describe it.  They didn't add autofocus to this device which makes the quality of the 3.2MP camera mediocre at best.  Don't get this device if you heavily rely on your phones camera.Overall this is a great budget Android handset for Virgin Mobile and if it suits your needs it will be a good choice for a phone on Virgin Mobile.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a very nice phone", "Author": "stevie.the.tester", "ReviewID": "R8O2YX88DB5L2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To tell the truth i wasn't expecting a great phone, it has a cheap price point...so naturally i thought cheap.

I'm kinda a picky person when it comes to phones and i don't have one valid issue with this phone, other then no one has made a protective cover for it. But I'm sure in time it will happen.

Takes pretty good pictures not nothing amazing but still good for this phone.But what REALLY suprised me was how well and how fast netflix runs on this phone. Its super clear and runs smoothly no lag,no nothing. and the volume on this phone is LOUD. And great quality. The videos that this phone takes are also pretty good.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R3H2EAWKD2H7D2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned it for a few months now, installed various applications and even dropped it a few times.It's been durable, and it's been great.Pros:* Price* Hardware is decent, it's ran several 3d games with ease, and some with slight lag* Flash makes a great flashlight! And it works ok for the ok camera* Battery life is decent, playing Pandora continuously for about 5 hours and it's at 20%, with some use: light web browsing, phone calls, text messaging, email, it's lasted 30+ hours before getting to 20%Cons:* Wifi freezing issues, when enabling the wifi, the system locks for a few minutes or freezes entirely, removing the battery and reinserting it usually brings it back to speed with wifi enabled* Responsiveness, it lags slightly when going through menus or the launcher, it's not bad, but it's not smooth* Camera, in situations with a lot of light it looks great, low light, not so much.* Camera/camcorder sound effects, slightly annoying that they can't be turned off, they're not deafening though.* Music library ringtones are a bit difficult to get going, I couldn't get it configured for the life of me, it may be user error, granted; I installed the 'Music' app from fdroid which has an option of setting songs to ringtones, after which they show in the list of available ringtones.Tips:* Be weary of what you install, some applications can continually run causing slow downs.I have a task manager that clears the memory and kills the apps I'm allowed to end to help with it. (It's terrible that most phone don't have root out of the box..)If you do want to root this device, don't ran the update it want's right out of the box, there are several blog/forum posts about rooting the device and it's cousin the Kyocera Rise. Haven't tried just yet, but I've read that several people had issues rooting after installing the update.Not great at reviews, but I hope this helps some people.Update 1-20-2013:I was able to root the phone! Even after the update, I was mistaken.After rooting, my phone became increasingly slower, it was perplexing, so I reset the phone to factory settings, and tried again some weeks later. It's now been rooted for months without any slowness issues.* I still experience freezing issues when using the widget to turn on Wifi* Battery is still holding a decent charge, not much has changed since I've owned it* Phone has been dropped 5+ times, mostly due to accidentally knocking it off something or standing up with it slightly out of my pocket. No breaks or cracks, it's even landed on it's screen, I've seen Galaxys and iPhones that couldn't take the damage my phone has taken. It's tough.* Screen has several scratches, should have gotten a protector. But the display isn't affected much, I'm not distracted by the scratches and it doesn't make it hard to see.I plan to have this phone for a long time, and when I eventually switch over, I plan to use it as a server. Quite satisfied with my purchase.If anyone's interested in what I'm using:ServDroid: Not too feature rich, but it works as a simple server - Does not require rootLil' Debi: Able to run Debian on my phone, which means apache or lighttpd! - Requires root", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "absolutely pitiful", "Author": "Gabe", "ReviewID": "R1TC0UT281GH3N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I understand why the phone is cheap, it's Kyocera, I've never had much luck with them, I've had this one maybe a month, but this is also the third one, I've received two faulty phones, one lasted maybe 2-3 months, the other not even three weeks. It overheats at the drop of a hat, Pandora prime bogs this down to where it will reset in twenty minutes, I've had many connectivity issues with Wi-Fi, 3g, and the actual phone network, small apps run it hot, battery is weak, and chrome just crashed on me three times in the main screen...I plan on upgrading sooner than later, worst investment I've ever made.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone but unusable after 7 months.", "Author": "VaMomma \"VAMOMMA\"", "ReviewID": "R64IWROFX4YP8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this as a replacement for my teen sons out dated LG Optimus V and he is very happy he chose this one.Yes the battery life is horrible as about all smartphone are these days, if your expecting a phone with good battery life then a Droid Razr Maxx, Galaxy S3 or a Note is the way to go but not sure if these are on VM as those are about the only ones that I have used that can hold up to my heavy use.

Ramos \"Doc Taz\"", "ReviewID": "RNI35RJB5AVEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace a Kyocera Rise. I had that phone rooted, so I could tweak that one to reduce some of the rebooting and memory issues that I experienced about month into owning that phone. It was running fine, then one day in late Sep. 2013, I decided to try an app (AKA Pimp My ROM, LOL!) that would make some extensive tweaks possible. I went crazy... initially I meant to tweak the wifi part only. Then, I began to check a few more options... then some more... more... until I practically went through every damned option available. I saw a reset button somewhere, but didn't think of pressing it, though I should have.(Though now in hindsight, perhaps I'm glad I didn't. ;))Rebooted the phone, then... boot loop... boot loop... BOOT LOOP...After a few minutes of this, I tried to factory reset the poor thing. Didn't work. (That killed the option for me to debug the phone with a tool that works on PC's as I learned later.) At that moment, I 'bricked' it. Useless! GRRR!!!Enter the Event! Ha!After some research in several forums, including Android Forums (AKA Phandroid), I chose this one. I noticed the similarities with the Rise (same CPU and graphics processor). I don't mind the lack of a physical keyboard. Before the moment I bricked the Rise, I noticed myself using the keyboard less, and doing more typing on screen.The extra internal memory for app storage helps a little, and the OS on this phone lets users move some apps to the SD card. Interestingly, the available system RAM on this phone isn't much more than on the Rise (360 MB vs 357 MB!).Even with that issue, I've noticed that the Event is a snappier phone. I installed 30 apps on it. Among those apps, I installed two that kills unwanted apps in the background after a set period (every two hours), and another that controls wifi and 3g when the phone is idle.I noticed that the phone seems to warm a bit, mostly when watching long videos or playing 3d accelerated games for an extended period. Most smartphones exhibit this side effect anyway, so this is nothing new. Some users have complained of the phones being nearly too hot to handle. I'd say those phones are either defective, has a stubborn app that refuses to get out of memory (they're bad, delete 'em if you can), or lack an app killer. Even if an app killer is used (or not), swiping apps from the multitasker list can help reduce memory issues.As far as the appearance, it's nothing special. The phone is a featherweight device. All black, all the time, unless you buy one from Radio Shack that has the red parts, or buy a colorful protective case for it. There are even some Otterbox-like cases for this phone, including some that are sold here. I'm going for a metallic red rubberized case + screen protector that should be in my paws in a few days. Because this phone is so light, it can be quite easy to drop if you aren't careful.Out of the box, the phone should serve you well, if your needs are modest.If you want a little extra performance, you're going to have to root the phone. And yes, I've had it done to my Event.This page has a guide that will work as directed for the Event. It is aimed at Rise owners: [...]UPDATED November 10, 2013: I have had the phone for a month. So far, I have about 45 apps loaded onto it, and it's working smoothly.A few apps have failed to work for me, most notably the facebook app. I realize that the number of apps I have is affecting the performance of that app. facebook is a MEMORY AND CPU HOG, and is probably best left off lower end phones like this one, unless you only have a few apps installed (maybe 15 or less, rooted or not...). Not even a few of the largest games and apps I have installed have created serious memory issues as facebook has (even the free ones with banner ads)! To get around this problem, I have email updates activated for the social media sites I use, and then view them from the Gmail app. Uses less memory, and I get the updates I want frequently enough while I'm awake. I then created links to the sites as bookmarks on my home screen, so I view them from a browser. facebook has most of its functions on the mobile site anyway, so I don't miss the app much. Still not suffering from FOMO, haha!At least tc electronic's TonePrint app actually works with this phone. I use that with my BG250 bass amp to change effects between songs. :)update Nov. 18 (typed from Event): The phone is as solid as ever. In love with the spell check! I'm thinking of putting a full featured program that will let me hack code on it. Ah, the advantages of rooting + Link2SD! =) All on a phone that cost me $55 (including accessories).Update Dec. 3: I've had the phone for a full 2 months. Since I rooted it after 2 weeks of purchase, the phone has performed well and very rarely rebooted itself. I have applied one tweak, and that is to improve WiFi response. I use an app called Andromizer, and increased the WiFi Interval scan to 300 milliseconds (0.3 seconds). It's long enough to improve reception, but short enough to help keep battery use down when idle. The WiFi automatically cuts off and switches to 3g (or phone service only if you don't use 3g) after about 5-6 minutes if nothing is being downloaded in the background.There isn't much that can be done with this phone if you want to tweak it further without bricking it. It may be possible to get a faster launcher if you want, but that's about the only other thing I can recommend if you want to tweak.To sum it up, IMHO if you root you need:1. superuser app2. Link2SD app3. /system/lib/egl/egl.cfg tweak (leave adreno200 line uncommented, add # to other lines)4. increase wifi signal to 300 milliseconds (you can use longer values, Andromizer limits this to 300ms, which seems to work fine for me)5. change launcher to something more lightweight or one you likeOtherwise if you don't root, freeze the bloatware that can be frozen (or don't want to use), and limit the number of apps to around 20. If you choose to use twitter, facebook and other apps that need to run in the background, get a cache clearing app that can clear cache automatically at least twice a day to reduce the chance of random reboots.UPDATE DEC. 10, 2013:I am still using Andromizer for implementing some phone tweaks. In addition to the 300ms tweak for WiFi, I've also enabled the 3G/4G tweak at the highest setting to speed up 3G internet. As long as there's enough signal, it really works! Great for when you can't get a decent WiFi signal. Keep an eye on that 2.5 GB throttling limit with Minutes Checker. Also, I used the One Click optimization setting. I unchecked the remove debug logger, and kernel tweak settings. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KERNEL TWEAK (OR ANY OTHER KERNEL TWEAKS) STAYS UNCHECKED FOR THIS PHONE, if you use One Click optimization! If you leave that checked and then reboot, your phone is as good as dead. It will boot loop until the insects take over the Earth... ;)I have also added an app called Greenify. This activates the hibernate function of the Android OS that is only available to rooted phones. I wish I didn't have to root the phone for that, but worth it if you can. Greenify can be used to select apps that should hibernate when the phone is idle. The benefits come in handy when the phone is unplugged, and not charging. This will help save some battery, and reduce unwanted activity in the background. All of that helps reduce unexpected overheating, which seems to be a problem with many low end Android devices.With the tweaks I put on this phone, I've been able to reinstall a few social media apps I stayed away from, due to memory issues. I put back the official apps of facebook, twitter, Google+, and ELJay, an app for LiveJournal and other sites that use LJ's software.UPDATE 2/26/2014I've since dropped Greenify. I found that it bogs down the phone when used with some streaming music apps (Pandora, TuneIn, etc). I have also \"debloated\" my phone. Read more about this here: [...] BACKUP EVERYTHING FIRST before debloating. You may want to reuse some of the apps at a later date, or reinstall them before unrooting and reselling the phone.UPDATE 4/28/2014I've now relegated this phone to backup status, as I use a rooted LG Optimus F3 as my daily driver. Still, I've managed a few tweaks to this phone that still make it useful. If you're still in the market for a cheap phone for primary or backup use, this can still fit the bill if your expectations are modest. The updated version of Link2SD now allows data to be moved to the /data/sdext partition. Initially, I did try to move my data to the sdext partition, but it seemed to slow down some programs for me, so after two days, I moved data back to internal. If you don't mind it, moving data out of internal can further increase space for new programs. Just remember to back up your SD card, repartition it from a PC, then enlarge sdext (I recommend 2 GB, but you can go bigger than that).I also installed an app called GL2SD. It moves obb (opaque binary blobs) files to your SD card's main FAT32 partition. This is great for installing some large games that would otherwise be out of reach for a phone like this. As with all object linking apps for Android, the device must be rooted. I tried one game (so far) with this linker installed. It's a first person shooter game called Dead Trigger. Unrooted, one would have a hard time even putting a large game on a phone like this. But with Link2SD and GL2SD working together, it runs... and quite well for a 1 GHz single core CPU phone! The game does slow down a bit in high intensity scenes, but it's otherwise playable. :) So there ya go... if you're on a budget and willing to root, you can run some hefty programs on this phone!

People say I sound fine but the voices I'm hearing on my end sound digitized - like those pop singers that put effects on their voices.  I don't know if this is something that Virgin Mobile can adjust or if this aspect of this phone is defective.  The rest of it works great-  I only needed this phone for about a week while my regular VM phone was being replaced via warranty. If you're a heavy talker - I don't recommend this phone.  If you need something really inexpensive to keep in your pocket to check emails, the web, manage a calendar, send texts and only make a few short calls a day - this will work.original review:********************Stock Android is getting SO comprehensive: what this phone does for the teeny tiny price is amazing.  Its nice (okay amazing) to see Android 4.04 on a phone with a $19 (or $29 or $39 depending on when you buy this) price tag.  This phone is nice and light -fits well in the hand with a non-slip rubberized texture on the back - one nice feature: it allows you to move certain apps to sd card (ie I moved Netflix, Pandora, Hulu Plus, N7player, live wallpapers and some others to SD).  Also it charges to full capacity pretty quickly compared to some other Androids I've used.btw I bought one of these for a friend months ago when they were $40 - his iphone broke and he was tired of the monthly bills anyway- he says its great - had NO complaints for an entry level Android.  I don't mean to compare this to an iphone by any means-but the basic smartphone functions work well.  I picked one up for 19.99 here at amazon over black Friday this year for when my kids want to play with my phone (and I don't want to give it up). I'm using this one to hold me over until Virgin Mobile sends me a new Galaxy s2 phone--just barely still under 1 year warranty).  Folks - remember - Virgin Mobile stands by their products - even if 6 months from now this phone starts giving you grief- they WILL send you another one and the warranty starts all over again.so..this phone does 90% of what I need my Galaxy to do -no slick and glossy giant amoled display like the Galaxy does- it has a plainer-grainier look -but its plenty fast nonetheless and has a decent size screen.  Another reviewer made a good point - don't expect great pics!  I mean if you need to send \"info\" via cell or email  -like examples of this and that for practical reasons or for fun - it will work and it has a flash.  But don't expect quality photos.  And it has no front facing camera so you cannot Skype but come on its 30 bucks!Okay so here is an example of what I set it up to do right away and how much you can fit on the phone +WHAT IT CAN DO EASILY WITHOUT annoying GLITCHING:The calling, texting, emailing, google voice search, voice to text etc.  all worked as expected - no real difference between this $30 phone and the Galaxy I paid $300 for last year.  The call quality might be marginally better on a more expensive VM phone and btw all cell phones seem to glitch here and there in my honest opinion.Nice live wallpaper installed and running- it runs live wallpaper on the lock screen!  Nice!Easily installed and used: Netflix (works great) I've only tried wifiHulu Plus (works great) only tried wifi(note: even though it doesn't generate great pics and the screen is no \"HD\" screen - Netflix etc videos look pretty darn good -VERY watchable)Pandora works great (again wifi)Obviously Youtube (preinstalled)Swiftkey trial ap installedI have two separate Gmail accounts updating every 5 minutes on wifiI have another private email account updating every 5 minutes-this is a VERY busy accountI have soduko and three other basic aps installed that I use regularly and the phone is not complaining that the memory is low.N7player ap is installed and works greatinstalled Minecraft pocket edition free and I was able to walk around but my son says you can't actually play- the phone can't handle it.I switched off the wifi and hopped online via 3g and zipped around the net doing searches etc.  NO PROBLEM.Even with the slightly grainy screen -I easily went Amazon.com and reviewed my christmas orders - no problem reading text or signing in with \"desktop site\" using pinch-zoom.  Some entry level Androids are really hard to \"shop\" from but I have already used this phone via 3g to order a gift via Amazon while waiting -indoors-at the bank.I was VERY impressed with the battery life so far.  I cannot remember my Galaxy ever lasting all day without needing recharging even with wifi and mobile data OFF.  I don't know what the battery will be like in 6 months but my friend never had a battery issues with his Kyocera.I also installed an HD wallpaper picker and downloaded a few non-live wallpapers.  The images loaded REALLY fast - I was impressed.What I CANNOT do with this entry level Android:Well obviously I there is no front facing camera.  So no video chat.  Also I can't take HD pictures or video like I could with my Galaxy.  I cannot run certain 'creme de la creme' gaming aps - but I can run PLENTY to keep a kid happy.IE: it cannot run the newest \"Angry Birds Go\" fast moving kart game -  It appears to play all the other Angry Birds Games though.  I cannot fit tons of apps on this phone like I could on the Galaxy- but I can manage all the basics and move a large amount of them to the sd card.  The screen isn't large - 3.5\" is about as small as I would be willing to go to be able to comfortablywatch a video, e-mail and use apps like n7player or games etc. but I have average sized fingers.  I don't think I would want to read Kindle on a screen this small and basic either.  But there are tablets and laptops for that.This is just A LOT of phone that processes data pretty fast for a measly $20 to $40.  It seems like many budget prepaid Androids out there run on Gingerbread-really outdated versions of Android.  But this is ice cream sandwich so its going to be able to do a lot more than those other phones and run a lot of different, really convenient apps.  I know there has to be some lemons out there though - since this is not a high end phone.  But I think its a fantastic choice for someone who wants an Android on a budget - if you get a lemon just ask Virgin to send you a new one.

Eventually I plugged it in again, and it woke up right away. Battery wasn't dead, it just is a horrible phone. The freezing thing happens pretty frequently. And then it starts up, and it makes that shrill Virgin Mobile startup noise that you cannot disable. I tried downloading apps like Silent Boot. It doesn't work. So frequent restarts = frequent bootup noises. It will even force restart in the middle of phone calls. It's a horrible phone.After these problems, I thought I'd check for updates to the firmware, OS, etc. I'd upgraded the OS on my Android tablet so thought this would be fine. Updating the phone network data wiped everything. All my messages, all my photos (even on the SD card), all my apps. Horrible phone? Yep.Then yesterday, again this is about a month and a half after purchase, I got the screen of death. I had tried to use Chrome and it kept force-closing immediately, so I just gave up, put the phone back in my pocket. Next time I took it out, Android had a serious error. I said to restart.

Seems that nearly every time I turn my wifi on, the phone locks up.  And I mean LOCKS UP.  Cant turn it off, cant move the screen.  Pop the battery out and back in (no need to wait), turn it on and it is ready to go with wifi already on.  Weird, and a hassle... but not a huge deal.  I DO NOT have this problem when turning on my data connection, just wifi.  I have NOT put a memory card in the phone... so that COULD have something to do with it (though I dont know why that would matter).  If you're big on apps, you're definitely going to need that.  I thought I wasn't big on apps... but I'm finding out there are really a lot of useful apps out there!  So... probably time to get a memory card.  :)", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "fast,light,easy,GREAT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3DU5IU7W9GC53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone fells great in your hands and is super light i love this phone. the connection is super fast and has no lag at all i recommend this phone to any person who wants a cheap android 4.0 phone. this phone has 3.2 camera with flash GREAT PHONE", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Annoying at best.", "Author": "A.

The Kyocera Event was in the right price range with the right features using the same carrier we prefer. Our minimum required features were a phone that ran Android 4.0 that had a decent camera, 3G & WiFi and plenty of capacity.  The size and shape are comfortable. We've both used it without difficulty (large, big-boned hands and small, arthritic ones), the screen is nicely responsive, the picture is excellent.  It is very sturdy & looks as if it could take a few knocks. The downside is the sound is merely adequate, not excellent, which can be bad for calls where there is poor reception.  Also, it does seem to require rebooting more frequently than other phones we've owned, but aside from that, no complaints.

I bought it for 33 dollars when it was originally 80. I was using a cheap go phone for 7 months. After us cellular got bought by sprint. I lost the use of my lg splendor which is now used as my mp3 player. The Alcatel go phone was good but I didn't like at&ts; plan. I like to touch text. Keyboards are not as great for texting. So this was my main reason for this phone to be able to touch text like my lg splendor.For me after only using this phone for a little bit I can tell it will browse the net at slower 3g speeds. But it loads up so that's good for 33 dollars. This phone reminds me of my Samsung exhibit when I once had t mobile.If you are looking to play games on the event and browse like crazy it won't move fast like a dual core Its a single core processor. Pictures are kinda bad. So if that's a major deal for you. I'm sorry this won't be your phone. Get the s3 or s4. Otherwise if you are just looking for a smartphone that is reliable that fits in your pocket well this is your phone. I recomend a screen protector not gorrila glass. And a nice case for protection. Its a very light phone and might not hold up when dropped.WiFi works great. I have not experienced freezing yet like other reviews. I believe people try to push this phone like an s3 and its no where near it in hardware. Just take it easy on it and it won't freeze that muchFor 33 bucs....you get ice cream sandwich. A functional phone with a pretty good touch screen. Running with sprint who since buying us cellular have seriously upgraded there coverage. 35 dollar monthly plan. Unlimited text and data.

I hate this phone. I hope that my deep hatred for it will burst off the pages and forever be etched into your brain. I am truly being honest with you when I tell you that after switching to another provider and phone, I will definitely soak this phone in lighter fluid and send back to Hell. Like real talk.So a little background. I purchased this phone after an unfortunate mishap with my previous Virgin Mobile phone, my beloved HTC EVO 4G (which I actually loved and would recommend to anyone who insists on going the Virgin route). I bought this phone as a replacement for a few reasons; price, Android 4.0 ICS, VM's Beyond Talk Plan at $35 a month. Now this phone doesn't have the same specs but I wasn't expecting it to. This phone sounded good for someone with not a lot of money to throw around for an iPhones or Samsung Galaxy. Well, if you look at from the perspective of someone who just came from a basic phone to a smartphone, then yeah, it's a great deal. Maybe my experience with the HTC EVO 4G skewed my perception a bit, but I still feel I'm not being too harsh about it and am judging the phone based solely upon itself.1 - Why is the home button so close to the space button? It frequently closes when I'm typing and just irritates me because if it was just moved down a little it wouldn't be an issue. Guess what. It is an issue. The thing has a lot of real estate to move that button down but for whatever reason they decided to move it so high up they might have well as put it above the entire screen. Like honestly, that would have made more sense.2 - Why can't I erase anything from the Gallery? Now I know what you're thinking. I must be an idiot to not know how to erase pictures. No. Other people on the web have had this same issue. I've even gone into every single folder on the sd card to make sure I'm deleting all traces of a picture but it fails to work. I even started thinking maybe it's syncing online but no. I have no idea how to fix this issue except to not use an SD card, which isn't that bad of an idea because the camera sucks anyway.3 - Why do I not get reception in areas I used to with the same service provider on an older phone? I've had Virgin Mobile for 4 years and I always got excellent reception. I get voice mails all the time of people asking me why I never pick up my phone. Simple; it never rings. I know people call when I get their voice mails.4 - Why does the browser shake as I scroll down? It acts like I'm in an earthquake when I'm scrolling down Google results. Which ironically leads me to...5 - Why is the vibration so weak? There have been countless times that I have put this phone in my pocket on vibrate and I don't feel it when I get a text.6 - Why does the battery often drain at an incredibly faster pace on random days? Like on any random day it might drop to 0% mid morning for no apparent reason. I'm not using any apps that would be able to explain such a battery drain and if I did it would make sense it would be consistent. My theory is that on those days it is scrambling to try to find signal which would drain the battery.7 - Why is Virgin Mobile making me pay for phone insurance when I never asked for it? Straight up. I declined it but I still get the you owe $40 this month text. NO I DON'T BRO. Why would I get insurance for a $50 phone? I would just cut my losses and buy another one. In two years I would have spent enough insurance to buy the phone twice over.I am definitely switching from Virgin Mobile.

I myself had experience with Virgin Mobile (I've owned the HTC EVO V and the Samsung Galaxy S3 on Virgin Mobiles contracts), and figured that VM would be an excellent choice for her. Although I originally intended to buy her the HTC One V, I ended up buying her the Kyocera Event (as the One V and the similarly-priced LG Optimus Elite were both sold-out on VM and Amazon). I figured it would be a decent little entry-level phone.The Event, physically-speaking, is a decent little phone. Slightly smaller then your average phone, it features a decent-looking solid plastic body that fits comfortably in your hand. The plastic body is surprisingly solid, and the plastic screen is very responsive (despite the fact that it looks rather poor). The buttons are solid and don't seem to have an issues with sticking or jamming. As far as performance, the phone is slow compared to higher-tiered phones like the EVO, but thats not really a problem unless you want to game or surf the web on it. All in all, the Event is well built for a low-price smartphone.Software, however, is where the Event falls. Heck, it just plain fails. The Event runs a version of Android that has literally been perforated with Kyocera and third-party applications (you think Samsungs devices have a lot of bloatware? check this thing out. its practically \"ad-supported\"), and there are no way to get rid of them. The applications include a third-party \"music\" bar, an Eco mode, and some kind of program that tracks the processors performance. These applications are irritating and slow the phone down.The primary software issue with the Event comes in the phones start-up sequence; for some reason, at some point, the Event is prone to actually \"losing\" its own bootloader. The bootloader is the program that tells the phone how to start up. When the bootloader stops working, the phone gets stuck in a boot-loop, and will either endlessly restart itself over and over again, or will freeze on the red \"Virgin Mobile\" screen. This renders the phone entirely useless and nonresponsive, and the only way to turn the phone off when it freezes is to remove the battery pack. Upon replacing the battery, the phone will automatically restart and get stuck in the boot-loop once again. There is no fix for this error. It can be temporarily solved by doing a master reset of the phone, but after a full reset the phone will start boot-looping again at some point (usually within a few hours, I got my sisters to last a few days once).Unfortunately, Kyocera has not released any kind of fix for this bootloop problem, nor have they released an unlock for the bootloader to allow customers to attempt to fix the problem themselves. In addition, Virgin Mobile will NOT allow you to make use of the included product warranty that comes when you buy the phone; when you attempt to return the phone for repair or replacement, they will prompt you to pay for the next month of service on the phone (the $50 plan only) to \"insure\" that you plan to stay with them before they service the phone. This $50 is literally the price of just buying a new phone; in addition, the moment you pay the $50, your service plan begins ticking. Virgin will then ship you a box to return the phone (takes about a week). You can mail the phone back (another week), at which point it takes them 2-3 weeks to service the device. Thus, at this point, you will have spent and wasted $50 on a month of cell service you have not been able to use. In the event that the maintenance takes longer then a month to complete, Virgin Mobile will call you and inform you that you must renew your contract a second time for them to continue maintinance on your phone, otherwise they will not return your handset to you. So, you get stuck paying $50-$100 to have a $70 phone repaired/replaced, when it should have been entirely free. When I attempted to contract Virgin Mobile, I informed them that the warrenty included with the phone stated nothing about these service charges; they then told me that the warrenty was in violation of VMs terms of service. I asked why VM was in the habit of printing warranties that violated their own terms, and they hung up on me.So. Long story short, save yourself the money and buy a more expensive Virgin Mobile phone. The HTC One V and the HTC EVO V are both great phones (HTC phones are generally decent for the price, far better then dissapointing Kyocera handsets); Samsung models are also great options. Please don't take the risk and buy the Event hoping you won't get a boot-loop; of the 9 people I know who have owned the Event, 8 of their handsets have gotten stuck in a boot-loop, and all 8 have been unable to have the handsets fixed by Virgin Mobile due to the above problem. Avoid the Kyocera Rise and Echo as well; they run the same firmware as the Event, and are prone to the same problem.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "DID NOT WORK!

The Optimus Elite is a better buy by far.Get the Optimus Elite and not the Kyocera Event.  Here's why:First, all the pluses are on the Optimus Elite side, in case there's any confusion.The Kyocera Event has a \u00b5SD slot but it's under the battery.  I've been begging designers to put the \u00b5SD slot there for years...FINALLY!  The Optimus Elite \u00b5SD slot is under the back cover but not under the battery, fortunately the back cover is easy to take off.The 3.2 MP camera of the Kyocera Event takes very low quality pictures. I have another 3.2 MP camera that actually takes much better pictures.  The camera has an awkward \"slider button\" for a meager 2X zoom.  Compare this to a 5MP camera on the Optimus Elite with a 4X pinch to zoom that takes MUCH better pictures - the difference is NOT SUBTLE. The camera of the Optimus Elite has better controls generally.  The pictures of the Kyocera Event are just plain bad - it's a terrible camera.  The pictures of the Optimus Elite are good, which I would expect from a 5MP camera - for snapshots, not for landscape photography, good for the kids birthday party if not the wedding.On the Kyocera Event phone, the AMP app (for Awesome Music Player, downloaded from Google market) didn't work, giving me a \"player has stopped\" error message - but this app did work on the Optimus Elite.  My plan was to buy an android phone just for use of the AMP app!  This gave me a clear answer to the question of which phone to keep.  (This isn't an ad for the AMP app, I just don't want to make vague claims that \"apps don't work\".)The screen of the Kyocera Event was \"slightly\" sharper, which I noticed with tiny words in online pictures, but otherwise, when reading text at websites, the screens of both phones are \"not the highest res\" and slightly contrasty at websites (which means whites a little too white, and slightly short on the details in shadow areas, which isn't the case with my Galaxy player 5.0, just for another point of comparison).The Optimus Elite is also thinner, (0.38 inches) with same H and W as the Kyocera Event.  In fact, this may be the thinnest cell phone I've seen - ever - other than for some of the newest models.The Optimus Elite also has a built-in screen shot feature (pressing the vol+/- button in the middle), which also permits inserting typographic text or drawing letters/shapes with a fingertip and which is actually a very cool feature - again, it's built-in.The Optimus Elite also has Google Wallet.The Optimus Elite also has Gorilla Glass, a high-tech, \"scratch-proof glass\" from Corning, and easily wipes clean with a cloth (I just checked) - the Kyocera Event is more smudge prone and harder to wipe clean.But I have to admit I didn't get it for the phone features, so I didn't check them out on either of these two phones.So between these two phones, aside from the phone features, which I didn't examine, I strongly recommend the Optimus Elite, and strongly discourage purchasing the Kyocera Event for any reason.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a great buy :( ...updated to \"total junk!\"", "Author": "A.

I didn't need the fanciest newest thing on the market by any means. I wanted something affordable and pretty well-liked by users. This phone met that criteria, but I am frustrated with it daily, and I've only had it for a month.One annoyance: there is no way to distinguish the tone for notifications of email versus text message. I don't need to check my email urgently, whereas I want to check texts right away. I also cannot assign specific tones to texts from specific people. All are one. You can do this with ringtones for calls, but I get more texts than calls.Another problem is that the screen isn't very sensitive to touch. Probably ok for most first smartphone users, but you will be greatly disappointed if you have had interaction with someone's iPhone or high end droid phone.The pre-loaded apps and functions are unnecessary and irritating. Specifically \"mobile ID\". You can't uninstall it.I haven't decided if the price is worth the annoyances. I know I wouldn't have purchased this after trying it. Oh well.Updated September 25, 2013:I have owned this phone for five months now. I hate it. My husband hates it too. Our biggest problem with it is that you can't even  make calls with consistency. My phone will cut off at about the 7 minute mark. I can still hear the call, but the other person cannot hear me. Every time. Suuuuuuuuuper annoying. And when I hang up and try to call back, there is a window of about 2 minutes where I cannot connect to them. Even if the other person is not calling me back, just waiting, I cannot connect with them until our cut-off conversation has like cleared the system or something. Whatever. It sucks.The phone randomly restarts itself multiple times a day. I don't know why or what triggers it, but I will hear my start up music a few times a day. And the battery now gets totally drained before I get home from work. 8 hours battery life for stand by?!? Yup.

You can't enter contacts because this phone \"grabs\" information from the other contacts and puts it in there. You can't just look up a phone number because the phone actually CALLS the person. You have to go around your butt to get to your elbow in trying to find missed calls. Checking emails is a joke -  and not a funny one. It's harder than hell to simply set a ringtone - and the damn manual doesn't tell you HOW, either. That manual is as bad as the phone. And I discovered I hated a \"touch\" surface. I want a QWERTY phone now.I hate this phone so much, I want to hurl it at a wall and watch it explode. That's how mad it makes me. I gave it one star only because I had to choose a star to review it. But that was being generous.I've had this phone for three weeks, and I've hated it every day I've had it. Save yourself the hassle.

I only put $100 on the Samsung this past year and still have $28 left with a month to go so I don't make a lot of calls. Now I had assumed that Prepaid is the same as a Go Phone, and even called Virgin Mobile USA to confirm with a phone rep that I could put $90 to top-up and use it for a year and get calls and data deducted. I was excited. A touchscreen Android 4.0 phone for $50!Yesterday I received the phone and it was even better than I expected - no faults on the phone's quality at all. Went online to activate it and transfer the old number but was only given the option of Virgin's \"Beyond Talk - Unlimited Data & Messaging\" monthly plans. There was not even an option for their lesser Paylo monthly plans. So I called Virgin Mobile to activate and top the phone up. There I was told by the customer service rep that I could only get monthly plans. I said I had been told less than a week ago that I could get their pay as you go option. She said that was not available for android phones. After voicing my disatisfaction I told her I was going to return the phone.Immediately the phone was packed back up and ready for pickup for return to Amazon. I am thoroughly disgusted by Virgin Mobile's waste of my time and it will be a long time before I consider them as a viable phone service.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "Android? 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)\n3.5?
