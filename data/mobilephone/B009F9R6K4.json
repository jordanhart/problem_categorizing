I've lost 5 days of business, infected $25k of pro equipment, and have been in a never ending cycle of malware hell. Between hardware software and lost business, this iPhone has cost me a fortune!!! You'd think a company stripping and selling a high end iPhone, would attach it to a computer, strip it properly, check the logs in the basic settings, and at least the Bluetooth was off??? Though the phone looked lovely, the infected systems would devastate anyone owning any apple products. I highly recommend ensuring its clean prior to purchase.

There was no SIM card with this phone which I didn't think would be an issue because from what I understood, Sprint doesn't require a SIM Card. I was wrong, they do.  After making a million phone calls to local Sprint Stores, Sprint Customer Service and emailing the seller, I was finally able to purchase a SIM Card for $19.99 at a local Sprint Store.  There was 3 days that this seller emailed me back to help me figure out a way to get this phone activated.  He even took the liberty of contacting Sprint Customer Service himself to help me get the problem resolved.  In the end, he sold me a great phone at a great price, the delivery time was super quick and he went above and beyond to help me find a solution to a difficult cell phone provider.  I will tell everyone I know that if they want to purchase a cell phone or cell phone accessories, this is the seller they should go to 1st.

Unarguably the best crafted phone there is. Who wants to pay hundred of dollars for a plastic phone. The screen has a matte finish and its just gorgeous. Technically, it is on par with the latest and greatest on the market so do not  worry about technical specs this phone has it all.  The only technical complaints I have about this phone is that the width is too small. It could use .25 or .5 inch more on width for comfort of viewing. I don't need my thumb to be able to reach 97% of the screen. What for? I use my smart phone with 2 hands most of the time. One hand when i just wake up and am too lazy to move. Looking at the screen hurts my eyes because its so small, although gorgeous. I just wish watching netflix videos on it didn't make me squint and that when i flip my phone on it's side that there is actually room on the screen for the keyboard and to see what you are typing. Another complaint is the battery. I wake up at 8am and take the phone off the charger. By 2pm, I have made 20min in phone calls, checked email every half hour, and used apps for about 30minutes and am down to 20% battery. If I leave the phone on standby it seems like it could go 2 days without a charge, but when you are taking it off standby every 20min to check a message or an app, you won't go half a day on it... which doesn't make sense to me. The battery should be enough to get you through the day. Not to mention the battery has limited charges until it degrades, so when the battery is only holding an 80% charge you will really feel it then and be so sorry because Apple charges $80 for a new battery which is NOT covered by the phone's $200 extended warranty.  It is a great phone, probably the best on the market, but let's be real. The 2 facts stated above make the phone less than perfect, but iOS is it's tragic downfall. It is not just a matter of getting used to iOS, it is a matter of accepting Apple's ludicrous policies. Get ready to NOT experience technology as iOS blocks you from accessing more than half of it. Sitting with your best friend trying out ringtones? Want to share one with her because you both found it hilarious and want to set it for each others contacts? Well, just go kill yourself cause that will never happen. YOU CANNOT SEND AUDIO FILES THROUGH TEXT, or any other way from the iPhone whatsoever. I wanted to share a couple ringtones with my Mom and cousin who also has an iPhone. Nope. Not going to happen. Your friend and your mom and your cousin will just have to buy the $2 app and download the ringtone for themselves and then upload it to iTunes on your pc via USB, put it on a ringtone folder, sync it back to your phone because enabling the ringtone is a whole big complicated process. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY SELECT THE FILE AND SET AS RING TONE. Meanwhile you just duplicated your music library so both your computer and iPhone has maxed out their storage and now you need to spend hours on end cleaning it up because it was not intelligent enough to sync your material without duplicating it 5 times. You need a credit card for iTunes, or a prepaid card with unlimited funds because every time you download an application, whether it be free or already purchased, the App will send a $1 authorization charge to your credit card and if you don't have money on it then you are disabled from downloading any free apps or from accessing previously purchased apps. Basically you are locked out of the App market, which makes up for most of the smartphone experience so the fact that you potentially will not be able to access it is ludicrous. Wow, I really paid more for less? I am so angry at myself for buying into the hype and want to return it and get my Android back. Using the iPhone makes me feel like I am playing right into a Fortune 500 companies pocket rather than getting the experience I deserve to get after spending so much on a device. It is rather insulting, my intelligence and bank accounts are insulted by Apple. I will return it and go with Android which does not infuriate me like iOS does... it only annoys me at times by various minor instabilities, but at least THAT I can live with. One more important issue.  I have not been getting any 3g service on my phone at all. Sprint says their service is working perfectly. Apple confirms it is a perfectly good phone. After hours of technical support and exchanging the phone I seem to be the ONLY PERSON WITH THIS PROBLEM. Neither Apple, nor Sprint, claim to have had any other complaints about this. I seem to be the only one. I guess god just hates me huh? Or one of the companies are lieing. One last thought... with Apple's extended care, you pay $100 into it, and then $50 per replacement you get up to 2 replacements. So $200 for 2 phones. If you can sell them for more than $100, and you can even with a bad esn, then you have made a profit. Even used and old iPhones retain alot of value.
