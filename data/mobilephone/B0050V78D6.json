Its not built for the gadget head, but for someone who needs a phone thats going to work under any condition. Dont expect this to be a surf the web, play a game, slide gently into your suit pocket sort of phone its not. Its bulky, but light...its solid.The first thing I did after unboxing it and installing the battery was to forcibly throw it from the 5th story balcony straight out to the concrete roadway below. Then I called it from the house phone, it rang. I then left it in a tupperware filled with water in the freezer overnight, then called it from the house phone...it rang. I'm satisfied.Setup and config was easy, (AT&T;)6 star phone", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "sonim  xp3300  force", "Author": "hunter38", "ReviewID": "R125WPAVGON3WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "real nice phone easy to use works great every things been just like said  great job and sealer shiped it quickly thanks", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Would you like to make a call?", "Author": "K.

Ali", "ReviewID": "R1CM6FRB28IF9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for someone who works in construction. It falls on a daily bases and has not taken any damage to date. The writing on the screen is kinda small and cannot be adjusted. It is also impossible to remove the phone from the belt clip before it stops ringing. And you can't use it in the clip since the clip covers some of the buttons. The charger and the headset uses two different ports yet the connector is exactly the same. These ports are also located next to each other sometimes causing confusion, especially in the dark.UPDATE** After just 6 months the rubber case has begun peeling off. Other folks at work are complaining about the same issue and Sonim says its cosmetic damage and the warranty does not cover cosmetic damage although the peeled of parts means that the device is no longer water and dust proof.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Brennan B James", "ReviewID": "R14IXUZEOT9U0O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It doesn't get 3G or 4G service, so you don't get as great phone service everywhere (more areas without bars).  Also the way to text is insanely annoying.  Luckily I don't text often and there's good cell service in everywhere but the most remote areas.  The 5 year warranty and the durability of this phone make it a must for any engineer, welder, or other manual labor job where your phone can get dropped, drowned, burned, or electrocuted.  Also Customer Service is awesome.  You call them up, leave a message, and a developer calls you back to answer your questions.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "rugged to say the least", "Author": "An Engineer \"Happy Shopping!\"", "ReviewID": "R2G80RYAHZ5W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the term rugged doesn't do this phone justice.

After 1 year the battery can't last more than a day. I checked the website and it actually said accessories like battery won't last more than a year. I did send email to ask about it (to the provided support email) but no one replied. After that I had to call them, but there's no one answer. I tried to dig for more phone numbers (from other countries' support phone number) and finally got 1 number that worked. I talked to a guy and he said he'll send me a new battery, he wrote down my address and all other details, then of course nothing happened, no one sent me anything.I did try to call back but this time no numbers work.The phone itself is ok, but battery won't last, and you can't even contact them to do anything about that so just forget buying it.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "XP3300", "Author": "Squirt-Truck", "ReviewID": "RHP5D6MFYZEKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got my new XP3300.Wow what prompt shipping, and exactly what it was presented as.Now to find out if the phone is really as good as it looks and feels.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "COMPATIBLE WITH GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\nIP68, RUGGED PHONE, UNLOCKED", "Name": "NEW SONIM XP3300 FORCE BLACK RUGGED UNLOCKED PHONE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/312-CyR0UnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0050V78D6"}}
