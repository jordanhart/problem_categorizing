{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best prepaid bang for your buck", "Author": "C. Dunn", "ReviewID": "RBFGB3RR3DYW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hate cell phones. In my opinion, long distance communication is best done via a land line (Limited Mobility? Oh, the humanity!) or a computer through e-mail, IM, or social networking sites. So if you're like me, you want a cell phone that you won't be using that often (business, emergencies, maybe even time-to-time socially), that you won't cry over if it is broken or stolen, and, most of all, MUST BE CHEAP. This product is very reasonably priced (7/2011: 22 + ns on Amazon, slightly more at a retail store), the value of the minutes is among the best for a prepaid cell phone, and the cell phone itself is pretty sweet. Buy it, carry it around with you or leave it in your car, toss it around, buy one for your ten year old to teach them about conservation, whatever.Especially with Tracfone, double minutes are a necessity. Don't get a Tracfone without it. In fact, there's a version of this phone with triple minutes. It's something like 90 bucks extra but depending on how much you use your phone, you may want to look into it. Best value I figure is the 200 minutes purchase. After double minutes and a promo code (promo code book included with purchase, by the way), you'll get approximately 450 minutes. After taxes and everything, I calculated that each unit costs around 9 cents. Better than what Net10 offers. Higher minute packages may have better value, but if you have to make those kinds of purchases on a regular basis, you might as well look into a phone with a contract. Functionally, this item works pretty much in the same way you'd typically expect a prepaid phone to work: the number of units per minute (1:1) for a call is rounded up, whether you were talking for two seconds or 59.999 seconds; texts are .3 units, probably the best value you can find in a prepaid; the browser is lame and should be used only in emergencies, and is .5 units to start and .5 units for every minute in the browser.As for the phone itself, I like it. A lot. But first, the three things which bother me the most about this phone MUST have the most elaboration, to let you know what you're getting into.1. Text Previews: This is nothing new. Tracfone seems to utilize a tactic in which you cannot see from whom you are receiving a text. Is it from a colleague? Is it from a new number? Is it spam? You can't tell. All they provide you before you open it is the first few characters of the text which was sent. Can't blame them, really. Their texts are so cheap, they have to make certain that you at least open every single one you get.2. The Browser Button: This is the most common problem I've found in all of the reviews I've read. Not only is the browser button a big soft key which you also use as the \"Back\" key, but it's also placed right next to the \"Pwr/End\" key. Key lock MUST BE ACTIVATED ON THIS PHONE, or you'll wind up punching this button while slipping the phone into your pocket and wasting a LOT of units. Horrible. You'll be pressing this button a couple of times when you do not want to. Bam. Half a unit expended. If you hit the \"End\" key quick enough, you might avoid it. Invariably, though, you will be wasting money thanks to this little baby. This, too, is suspected to be a ploy to cheat you out of your hard-purchased units. Frankly, I think it was just a stupid human factors mistake made on someone's part. It's really the worst aspect of this phone and it could have all been avoided if only the phone had...3. Personalizability: I can change the background and ringtones, okay, fine. I CANNOT change what the soft key buttons do. If I could change the Browser Button to, say, a Camera Button, this would be the God of all Prepaid Phones. Unfortunately, we're stuck with a shortcut to a horrible, useless browser and guessing where the shortcut key to the half-decent camera is (tip: it's \"Left\" on the Navigation Key).That's all the bad stuff, though! Let's talk about the good stuff. Remember, this is a prepaid phone. I'm matching it up to other prepaid phones I've seen before.- Light- Great-looking- Great battery life- SD card slot- Good camera- Excellent keypad (see below)- Volume is on-par- Full of other useful functions (such as games, mp3 player, and calendar - with event planning!)The keys are small, yet are very easy to master (and they have a wonderful response), even if you have big fingers. I do not know the threshold between comfort and frustration; all I know is that if small keys have been an insane problem for you in the past, you may want to find a demo of this phone to check it out first.This phone is worth it. You can laugh at the poor souls who have sold themselves into $600+ a year contracts while you thriftily expend $15 - $20 a month for a phone with nearly the exact same features. The difference could help you pay for a netbook, which more than makes up for any deficiencies you may find in the cell phone (and which is also a great selling point when you're negotiating with your aforementioned ten year old).Just get it. The only time you'll regret it is when you hit that stupid Browser Button.Edit: 8/4/2011The phone charges with a micro USB cable. (There -is- a difference between micro USB and mini USB.) These cables are cheap from Amazon. You can have one shipped to you for about two bucks. I'd recommend getting a couple and a USB car charger, which, depending on the quality, should set you back around five to ten bucks. Being able to charge the phone from a computer is a great feature, but you may also be wondering what kind of data you can transfer between the phone and the computer. The answer is nothing -- if you don't have a micro SDHC card (4gb SanDisk w/ adapter is seven bucks). With the card installed, connecting the phone to the computer should both charge the phone and allow you to change the contents of the SDHC card. No special software should be required. The reason I'm bringing this up now is that lately I've been having issues with this feature. It started to work, but connecting the phone with the card installed to my computer now brings up a hardware failure notice. This is a minor issue, but an inconvenience nonetheless. I have to open up the back of the cell phone, take out the battery, remove the card, place the card into the adapter, and connect the card to my computer that way. That's the only issue I've had with this phone so far. I'd still have bought this phone if I knew it had this issue, however. I will update if I find a resolution to this issue.Some other information. I mentioned getting a car charger, but you may never need it. I'm on day five without charging my phone, and it's still got half battery life. And yes, I have been using it. This totally makes up for the connectivity issue, and then some. Also, as far as adding things to the phone, buying the SDHC card has been a good idea. There's plenty of tiny extras for the phone you can find online. Ringtones do not need to be in a special format, mp3 will work. If you do a search for games for this phone, they're everywhere. I download mine from Mobile Heart. (You can play Civilization! I love this game.)So, about a month in, I've found one setback and a couple of really big pluses. Rating still stands at five stars.Edit: 8/27/2011Still working great. The phone averages about four days on the battery without charge. (Compare this with maybe two days for a smart phone.) Also, I obtained a Bluetooth device (Rocketfish Rf-Mrbtad Micro Bluetooth Adapter, $11). File transfers are a lot easier, and it's nice not to have to worry about cords and stuff. A little bit slower, but it makes up for the problems with USB cable connectivity. Still the best prepaid phone I've ever owned. I think this will be the last edit until I stop using the phone. Rating still stands at five stars.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Phone for Texting and Calling", "Author": "L. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1RZ17W4ALVB9P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 6 weeks, and like it. I replaced an ATT contract and a Motorola Razor with this Tracfone. For my purposes (texting and phone calls) it's just fine, and the full QWERTY keyboard is certainly much better for texting than what I had with the Razor. The instruction manual which comes with the phone is minimal, but Tracfone has a very informative interactive tutorial for the phone at their website. The one feature which I miss that my Razor had and this phone doesn't is voice-activated dialing. My significant other travels overseas quite a bit, and I use this phone to text and chat with him on his ATT phone while he's abroad. The charges for these international calls are no more than they would be for any call made here in the states. The sound quality for these overseas calls is great (except for the random clicking on the calls to/from China..maybe someone is eavesdropping??)I've been tracking my usage, and recently bought one year, 1500 minutes (doubled to 3000 minutes, with a 100 minute bonus)from Tracfone. I estimate that with my usage, this phone will run me about $15/mo. Certainly a bargain when compared to the ATT contract which I had previously.I also bought and use a SDHC micro chip (4GB, the maximum capacity for the phone) for playing tunes. It works just fine on this phone.Update 7/30/2011I'm still very happy with this phone. Just a few points:1. Tutorial link: <...>2. Recently traveled to an area without GSM service (backwoods of Oregon). Somehow the phone got locked into a \"No Service\" mode, even when I went back into areas with service. The problem was solved by turning the phone off and then back on. Something to be aware of.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "Kathleen Warren", "ReviewID": "R2JASTC9SZZM1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read online reviews and looked at one in the store before I bought this phone.  It is actually the first Tracfone I have bought that I was excited about!  I have had a Tracfone for years, and it is now my \"back-up\" cell phone.  I really didn't feel that I needed a smartphone with this but I wanted to be able to text more easily and have the possibility of web access not that I use it much.  The phone was no surprise then after researching it, and I didn't expect a smartphone or even semi.  That's not what this phone is.But I like the more modern look and also that it is not branded Tracfone on the outside (I usually turn off the automatic screen display of minutes anyway).  It was easy to install the battery and get it charging.  Then I was pleasantly surprised that customer service had my number and service transferred so easily.  This was the best experience I have had with them on the phone!  My reception seems good, and testing works fine.  I have not put a microSD card in yet, but I will update if I have any problems with that.  The keyboard is small but is is nicely responsive for me and my smallish hands.  Accessing the menu to change wallpaper, settings, and enter contacts was simple and for me intuitive.  The keypad lock and unlock is different than what I am used to, but after a couple of times I like the way it works--you press a specific key to lock than you have to press first unlock than immediately press yes to unlock.  This seems like it will prevent accidental unlocking.So far, I have not found anything that I don't like about this phone.  Just be make sure you know what it is, not a smartphone nor a touchscreen, and that the keypad is small.  As with other Tracfones, the so-called user manual is scanty on details so you may need to look up additional information.  It takes my standard 3.5 headphones although the jack is sort of at an angle.  For the price, it is a great phone and I'm very glad I updated my Tracfone to this model.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just OK", "Author": "Dusty0458", "ReviewID": "RD6PS8IL107FG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really think I could like this phone, except for 2 things.The Power/End key does not work, so I cannot turn off the phone.  Ending calls is a pain having to go thru extra steps in the menu to disconnect.

Even though I know the Power/End key does not work, I still push it out of habit and a few times already, I have pushed the browser key by accident, which cost me minutes.I like the keyboard for easier texting, which is the reason I chose this phone.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Value, Great Reception", "Author": "Rich M.", "ReviewID": "R3MZ9HTJR203K9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the fourth Tracfone I've had - Nokia & Kyocera (both CDMA) and a Motorola (GSM).

I had considered replacing it with another of the same until I found this LG 500G and at a great price. I read several reviews and knew what to expect, which is a basic phone with a QWERTY keyboard, mp3 player, and micro sd slot. Not bad at all for under $25, and I received it in 3 days, also! This phone is lightweight, and the keys work for me, although it might be a tad small for someone with large fingers. So far I've had no problems with it at all. I would also like to add that I had to contact Tracfone's customer service to have my old # and minutes transferred to the new phone, and anticipated it being a nightmare after reading about how horrible their CS is. Fortunately, that was not the case for me at all. They were courteous, expedient, and helpful. I was off the phone in less than 10 minutes with my new phone activated, minutes and number transferred, and a few bonus minutes to boot. I'm so glad I thought to look up Tracfones on Amazon. It was yet another good deal!", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice, with a few minor points...", "Author": "squashpup \"squashpup\"", "ReviewID": "R1NMZ7AI7OTIVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife has a touch screen pay-as-you-go phone and she doesn't like it.  Let's face it...good touch screens are going to cost a little more.  I played it safe when I chose mine, and I'm glad I did. The LG500G is a very good bargain for what you pay.Audio quality is good, even through the speakerphone.  I put a 4GB microSD card in it, but as yet, have not tried to use it as an MP3 player.  EDIT:  Works great as an MP3 player, displaying all ID3 tags and album cover art, if it is included in the original file.  Shuffles and lets you create playlists.  Audio quality seems to be pretty good. Plug it into an FM transmitter, and you can use it through your car's audio system.  Best part:  it also works \"hands free\" like this, allowing you to hear your phone conversation through the car stereo.  Cool!Shoots 3GP video.  Quality is not great, but it is better than not having a video recorder.  Likewise with the camera.  You can take pictures with it, but don't expect miracles.  Utilitarian is the best word to describe it.  If you have the software to convert videos to 3GP, you can actually UPLOAD your own videos to the phone to watch later.  I found this one:  Mobile Media Converter from Miksoft.  Google it. Free, works on all platforms. Anything you can convert to 3GP with that program seems to work on this phone.  A 22 minute video is about 25 mb, so you can estimate your video size as \"1mb per minute\" and get pretty close.Don't plan on stopping, resuming, fast forwarding or rewinding, though. EDIT: Holding down the left and right directional pad will seek video.  The longer you hold, the faster it goes. It doesn't seek visually, rather, it freezes the last frame and shows the TIME at the bottom.  Better than nothing, though, and means you can at least fast forward to where you left off so you can resume videos.Get yourself a data cord to hook it to your computer, otherwise, you'll go insane taking the back off and pulling the battery out to get to the microSD card. Once you get a memory card, the phone acts much like a USB jump drive, although Ubuntu recognizes it as a mobile media player.Since I've started playing around with it, I've found that the Opera browser is compatible with this phone.  I tried several...1.X seems to be a bit primitive.  6.X is slick and polished, but will frequently crash due to out of memory errors. Opera Mini 4.3 seems to be a good compromise...it seems to work nicely all around.  It does eat minutes rather quickly, so make sure you SAVE your frequently visited sites as much as possible to avoid having to search for them and incur extra minutes charges. Google Maps also works on it, but if you use the satellite view, it's not long before you run out of memory and the app crashes.  Map view seems to work OK, though.Typing is much easier than what I thought it would be. I am a giant man with giant hands and I can type comfortably, if not speedily. One issue that I have, and perhaps someone can help me find an answer, is that when I try to type some double letters, I get symbols instead. For example, when I type double \"E's\", I get a Euro symbol. If anyone knows of a way to turn this off, I'd be grateful!  Otherwise, typing is not a difficult chore at all.  I love the positive clicks of the keypad SO much better than a touchscreen.After a well over a month, I'm still happy with the phone, which is something, considering I've NEVER been happy with a phone.  Now, to peddle the wife's phone on eBay and get a second LG500G for her.EDIT 6/21/12: After nine months with the phone, I'm still as happy with it as the day I bought it. Works reliably and has enough features that it can get you out of a jam...for example, I used the Mobile Web and a Google Maps app I installed to locate a destination on a street that was NOT listed on my car's GPS.  This got me close enough to find what I was looking for.Durability seems good.  Mine's been dropped several times, a couple of times on pavement.  The back popped off and the battery, back, and phone all went skidding across a parking lot in all directions.  Picked it up, put it back together, and it worked fine, even if it was a little scratched up after that.Can check my Gmail using the Opera browser, too.  That's handy.If you're the type who needs a phone primarily with occasional texting and web browsing, it's hard to beat Tracfone and the LG500G.  If you're the type who needs a mobile web browser/texting machine that also functions as a phone, I'd look elsewhere.Again, long term, I've been very happy with this phone.  Since the price has come down in the intervening months, I'm tempted to get another one and keep it on hand to replace this one when it finally quits working.EDIT 11/24/12 - I just ordered the LG500G's replacement.  The ol' 500 has worked almost flawlessly from day one, and it packs a lot of punch for the money.  But, pre-paid phone technology has progressed by leaps and bounds since I got this one a year and a half ago, so it's time to move on.  I don't even know if I'll offer it for sale, as this phone new is now selling for just over ten dollars on Amazon, and is ubiquitous enough to be found for cheap on dollar store shelves.  I'd still recommend this phone for anyone wanting a basic phone with a few nice features with a full keyboard and in a compact package.The best endorsement I can think of is that I am buying another LG.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "With Customer Service this bad, who needs this phone at any price?", "Author": "G.

I removed the battery, it appears fine, checked all the connections, and tried to charge the phone; nothing, no response at all.  The product manual suggests calling the TracFone customer service hotline, I did, and got a message stating that they were too busy to answer any more phone calls, and to get resolution to problems via the website.  Tried the website, and four days later they e-mailed me and told me that the only way to get resolution is to call their customer service center (sound like a closed loop to anybody out there?)

Miller", "ReviewID": "RMKI4GIXENAV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TRACFONETo begin with people tend to complain about tracfone and their general lack of feature-rich phones. I am by no means in love with tracfone. While their tech support is a pain, these days that can pretty much be avoided by the online interface which makes activating phones and purchasing minutes very simple and really is all you need to get started and maintain service. If you have the money and the need for a smartphone then by all means get one. I came back to tracfone after being on AT&T;, T-Mobile, and cellular south Cellular-South plans and I can honestly say that I really don't miss my iphone or android smartphone. Yes there are times where it would be useful, but realizing that I pay less than 250 a year for service is more than enough of an incentive. The main reason tracfone doesn't release larger more expensive phones is mostly because of it's core demographic of buyers, cheap bastards and old people. Therefore, the people who complain probably should have been looking for a more expensive option to begin with. If you think that having a smartphone is a good status symbol I promise having extra cash is better. All in all tracfone provides a great bang for the buck and those who complain really need to look at just how much they're saving each year.LG500GMy first cell phone was a tracfone. It cost twice as much as this phone and had less than half the features this one does. What do you get for $30? (less if you can snag on off ebay) Full qwerty, good MP3 player, decent camera, and other features I would have been very grateful for when I purchased my first phone at 16. Also considering double minutes are included this is an absolute no brainer. The phone is cheap, having said that the keyboard is excellent as is the mp3 player, and when I don't have my DSLR handy this is a very acceptable quick picture taker. I picked up a class 6 4GB card (4GB is the max supported memory size) and coming from the mp3 player interface on androind and iOS this is quite acceptable and very usable. I love not having to charge my phone. I alternate between huge ammounts of calling and texting to not making a single call in a week, that's just me. Therefore it makes sense that I may only have to throw my phone on the charger maybe once a week or two tops if I've been using it, also when it need juice it charges pretty quickly. I've had this phone now for about four months so plenty of time to get used to it. All in all I'm still thrilled to have such a good device for such a cheap price.  If you are shopping for a case I got a rubber case for an LG saber that fits pretty well just a little trim at the charging port. I know tracfone has lauched several \"smartphones\" but if you look at reviews and specs they really don't have much more functionality than this device and their usually around three times the price. Also recently released is the Samsung T404G which gives you triple minutes for life.

There were a few that caught my eye but I kept coming back to the LG500G for a couple of reasons.First, I liked the fact that it also housed an MP3 player and that it took a 4gb micro SD card. I also liked the fact that it had a 1.3 megapixel camera. Finally, I loved the look. I went to a local store to see it in person and found this to be the phone I wanted.I ordered the phone directly from the Tracfone website. They were advertising a special price of $29.99 for the phone and accessory kit with double minutes for life. You just can't beat that, so I ordered it.It was shipped within three days of ordering. I am not much on reading directions so I basically took the phone out of the box and began charging it. While it was charging which only took about two hours, I activated the phone online through the Tracfone website which took about 5 minutes. I was impressed.Once the phone was charged I went through the settings and customized the sounds and display on the phone. I then uploaded my mp3's to the micro SD card I purchased and then inserted the card in the phone and voila! I had an mp3 player as well as a phone. I then decided to test the camera. Went to my favorite gardens and got photos of flowers, landscape and murals. I was surprised at the quality of photos. I was also able to send them directly to my Facebook account through the phone.The phone has web capabilities with many applications that you can download. However for me, I don't use the browser that often but I like to know it's there in case I have problems with my computer and need to get online. That is also another reason I upgraded and bought this phone.I've always been slow when texting but with this Qwerty keyboard, I am gaining speed and love it. I can text photos to friends and family. There is also video capabilities of which I have not yet tried but will soon. Another good aspect is there is no charge to minutes when playing your mp3's which is great because I'm listening to them all the time.Another thing I really like about this phone is the fact that you can lock the keyboard. I like having the phone on during the day so it's handy to be able to lock it so the browser isn't activated when in your pocket or purse.There are also a couple of games on the phone though I don't use that. Another great thing about the phone is you can buy your minutes right over the phone when you sign up for that service through the Tracfone website. Oh, did I mention double minutes for life? If you buy for example 200 minutes, you automatically get 400. I signed up for their plan which will automatically get me 400 minutes each month.I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks and love it! I've been able to use my mp3 files as ringtones and customize the wallpaper with my own photos.This phone also has Bluetooth capabilites. I basically use my old headphones and they work great. You can set the volume for the phone and sounds for it as you see fit. You can also customize the setting to how long you want the screen and keyboard lit up or if you want to save power you can do that as well.I have been all over the city with it and the service is perfect.

I still really like hardware QWERTY keyboards, though, so the LG 500G seemed like the perfect fit. It works fine for the most part, but I get the feeling that it has little tricks built in to eat up as many minutes as possible. Perhaps that's just the nature of prepaid cell phones, but still, here are some examples I ran into:First, it deducts minutes even when a text message fails to send. This wouldn't be a big deal if I could just be sure to not send a message when there's no signal available. But often messages will fail to send even when I have 2 or 3 bars.When sending a MMS message, it deducts a minute before sending the message, then deducts another minute when the message is completely sent. The same thing happens when receiving a MMS message. It deducts a minute when I choose to download the content, then deducts another minute when I view it.The button to launch the browser is also the button used to exit out of most menus. So, if the phone is being sluggish for some reason while trying to go back to the home screen, you could end up launching the browser by accident and costing yourself some minutes. It's possible to close the browser quickly enough to avoid a charge, but there have been a few instances where I've been distracted and didn't realize the browser had opened. Partly my fault, but could nevertheless be easily avoided with a properly-designed UI.Overall, it's a nice little phone for someone used to hardware QWERTY keypads. I'm just not a fan of having my minutes stolen.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Price - Buyer Beware", "Author": "Vivacior", "ReviewID": "R1QC9JFU7KZ3TC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I'd like to say that I am not a huge cell-phone user.  I have an Ooma (bought here on Amazon) for my home service, which is great - haven't paid a land-line phone bill since 2010.  I do not spend that much time on the road - as I am not in a sales or on-site service profession.  With this, I've kept a low-cost, pay-as-you-go cell-phone for many years.  I use a cell-phone for emergencies, when the power/internet is out at home, and for when I am out of the house and am expecting to make or receive an important call.For the first several years, I used Virgin Wireless - which was great until last year when my kids lost the phone.  Starting a new plan with a new phone with Virgin became a much more expensive proposition - it felt a little like a \"bait-and-switch/the drugs are free for the first year\" scheme.  I guess the bean-counters working for Richard Branson decided that being a low-cost provider just wasn't profitable enough:  They got a jealous taste for all the \"sheeple\" who blindly sign up for the $60-$100/month plans that have transformed Verizon into a money-consuming Jabba-the-Hut.  (Honestly, how many people REALLY need $1000+/year phone service - what a bunch of lemmings...!)Ergo, I checked into my local Wally World (walmart) and found this awesomely cheap phone with a perfectly-priced plan for my needs.  So, here's the good, the bad, the ugly:The GoodPrice-price-price - 10 bucks up front, $23 every 3 months.  This gets you 100 minutes for that entire time, but I've never used up my minutes.  That said, if you were to use more minutes, you can get an even cheaper rate (cents/minute-wise) by buying your minutes in bulk.  Reception is nothing special, but it's not terrible either.The BadLet's face it - this is what is now known as a \"FEATURE PHONE\" (aka \"NOT a Smart Phone\", aka \"Old People's Phone\", aka \"Dork-Phone\").  Released in 2004, it screams \"I am so-behind-the-times/this is the same phone my parents use\" to anyone who knows gadgets.  If you're a \"too cool for school\" kind of person, this phone is not for you.  If you still have a tube-based, non-flat screen TV in your living room, then step right up!The UglyEven at this price, I am flabbergasted - you CANNOT LOCK this phone to deactivate the keys while you are traveling.  As such, if you want to receive calls while you have it in your pocket/purse/gym bag/etc, it has to be ACTIVE the entire time.  And with that, expect it to make unwanted phone-calls, web-browsing sessions, and text messages whenever the phone touches anything.  You will get charged for these erroneous \"butt dials\", but there is nothing you can do about it.  Except turn the phone off - and miss all incoming phone calls while you are on the move (which defeats 50% of the whole purpose for having a cell phone!).Conclusion - great price, old-school look and features, and a horrible-design FAIL on the ability to prevent \"butt-dialing\".  If you own this phone, you WILL accidentally call, text, or browse.Caveat Emptor \"Buyer Beware\"", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good upgrade for TracFone users", "Author": "Shannon Cole", "ReviewID": "R49M2SXHATCCX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having happily used a TracFone for 3 years with no regrets, I really wanted something where I could send text messages, check my email and surf the Internet to find local attractions when traveling (the older \"mobile\" text-based web was really slow and wouldn't work on a lot of websites).  After discovering that most of your minutes and your telephone number are transferable to any new TracFone, I began my search.  I first considered one of the touch screen phones TracFone was offering, but after hearing reports that you couldn't access the keypad during a call, I decided against it (I kept thinking about all of those automated menus these days at banks and companies, \"press one for this, two for that\").I have been very happy with this phone.  There are drawbacks: I've hit the browser button by accident a few times because it is right next to the Power Off/End Call button, so you get charged half a unit when that happens.  You can download the \"Opera Mini Browser\" off the internet for free, which doesn't use so many minutes, into your Apps folder.  The keypad is tiny, but manageable.  It's a little difficult when you're trying to enter a phone number, ironically (it is a phone, after all).  But if you go a little slower than normal while dialing, and don't have problems reading small print, you'll be ok.  Be sure to press the \"Lock\" key when done to avoid those \"pocket dials\" (it's easy to unlock, just follow the on-screen instructions to press the two soft keys in sequence).Yet, there are some great features on this phone.  Unlike older models, with a combination USB charger/data cable, you can charge your phone right at your computer, and if you like, transfer photos, music, videos, or apps back and forth to it!  You can add a Micro SD chip to add the capacity that you'll probably need if you're interested in storing much media on it, but these are really inexpensive.  Convert your video files to the 3GP format, and you can watch any video on the device (although if you want to fast forward to a scene, you'll have to hold down the key until it reaches the segment of the video you want to see).  The only problem I've had with the media files is if you start to get towards full capacity on your chip, they will freeze up or not play properly, so to fix this you'll need to erase some files that you don't use.  This definitely is not a replacement for an iPhone or any Android based phone.  However, if you only need a couple of bells and whistles and not the whole enchilada, this is a great choice.  I've even posted on Facebook and Twitter a couple of times, and checked the weather.  But I'm not a heavy user.  I don't plan to watch YouTube (this phone can't handle that) or Netflix on my phone or play lots of video games, so for such a cheap price, this is a perfect choice for me.  If you are dependent on your cell phone for heavy data/internet usage, then you probably don't need to consider TracFone: there are other companies with better deals for you.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have buyers' remorse", "Author": "Dr. Mabuse", "ReviewID": "R2U1PFF6IFYJI7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "No one buys a prepaid phone to use as their primary phone--it is for occasional calling.

Tech forums explain that the only way to avoid this is to keep the phone on some page other than its home page and to keep it in sleep mode all the time, which really changes the LG500G from a high tech device to a crappy kid's toy.The phone works okay--it makes calls, receives calls, all that you would expect it to do--but this slow constant leakage of my minutes seems intentionally hostile on Tracfone's part.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3UHCEULDLNNVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone and at a great price.

The very idea of a $12 camera phone is actually pretty amazing to someone who's been watching technology advance for the past 30 years or so.  I can even say that as someone who's been using an HTC EVO 4G for the last 2 years. Now, my contract for the EVO is about to expire and I'm tired of the huge cell phone bill every month so I'm looking at going back to basics.  I figured $20 for a phone and a double minutes card was a reasonable experiment.This phone is pretty impressive for a basic pre-paid phone. There's a little bit of a learning curve to the menu system, even for a software specialist like myself but the phone comes with a manual so that should help.  Once you dig around, you'll find that it has a nice list of tools available for a small phone:Alarm ClockCalendarTo-Do ListNotes (normal and secret notes)CalculatorStopwatchUnit ConversionsWorld TimeMP3 playerContacts ListeMailWeb BrowserGames1.3 MP cameraVideo cameraetc...None of these applications are earth shaking and you wouldn't expect them to be for this price but they are there. The camera and the video are adequate for taking basic images and have some surprising settings for image manipulation.Activation was simple and quick through the TracFone site and I saw where there is the option to move existing numbers to the phone, either from TracFone or other companies. Again, the menu system takes some learning and I'll look for awhile before going to the documentation so I had to search for a bit to find the voice mail number but I did find it, called in and the prompts to setup the mailbox were pretty easy to follow.At this point, I've had the camera for about a day, tested the reception at home between the TracFone and my EVO and found it to be good. I also bought a 120 minute card and added it to the phone. So far, I'm happy.  Having said that, I'll say this:BE SURE TO ORDER THE ACCESSORIES YOU NEED WITH THE PHONE.This phone comes with the activation card, a coupon book for bonus minutes, the battery and a charging cord that runs from the mini-USB port on the phone to an AC outlet.  It does NOT come with a few other things you'll probably need.  If you look at other phones, keep these things in mind:MICRO SD MEMORY CARD - The LG 500g uses a Micro SD storage card for storing pictures, MP3s and anything else that won't fit into the 170 KB or so of memory in the phone.  Be aware that the phone WILL NOT RECOGNIZE anything over a 4 GB card.  These 4 GB cards are becoming harder to find in the stores and, when you do find them, they are unreasonably expensive.  I went to five different stores and finally found them for anywhere from $17 to $29 a piece.  This is odd since the 8 GB cards go for as little as $6.  Amazon has the 4 GB cards for $5 each so it's best to order one with the phone.  Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC  Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging).  Another option would be to get another LG phone that holds the 8 GB cards and larger cards.PHONE TO PC CABLE - The charger for the phone plugs into the micro-USB port on the side of the phone and then into an AC outlet. This USB port is the same one used on a number of other phones and the Kindle. Those devices often include a charging cord that runs from the device to a PC so you might already have a phone to PC cord that you can use.  If not, you will need one if you want to transfer MP3s or other data between your computer and the Micro SD card in the phone.  These cables can be around $20 in the stores. It's about half the price here.  Amazon Kindle Micro USB Cable, White (Works with Kindle Fire, Touch, Keyboard, DX, and Kindle) - Updated DesignMINUTES - The phone comes with 20 minutes / 60 days of air time. You'll use up at least half of those minutes setting up your voice mail and trying it out.  The additional minutes cost the same no matter where you get them but it wouldn't hurt to order a  card with an extra 120 minutes or so to start out.  Tracfone 120-Minute Airtime CardI'm especially happy with the coupon book with all the bonus minutes and I'm hoping this turns out to be a good solution to cutting down my phone bill every month.

Tracfone has good coverage in my area, and the call quality is very good. It fits my hand well, and the smallish keys are pretty easy for me to use. The camera is a convenience, it takes adequate pictures in decent light but it's no substitute for a real camera. The bluetooth works well and is a nice surprise at this price (I paid $9.99 with double minutes for life). It's not a true smartphone, but it's 'smart enough', and for ten bucks you get more than you pay for, IMHO. People that expect it to be an iPhone are clueless dreamers.The issues with the browser button are well-documented and legitimate, but if you're careful you can avoid it for the most part. And it costs a half-minute per activation, not a half-dollar as someone said. HOWEVER, the music player was designed by a moron. It takes a 4Gb micro SDHC card, which is nice, but no matter what I do, this phone will not and cannot play an album through without interruption - it plays a song, then stops until you manually select the next song. Making a playlist with the phone has no effect. The only continuous play it has comes when you 'shuffle' a folder of songs. This is a spectacular failure and only an idiot would design software with this kind of an obvious flaw. I only hope the person responsible for this will someday feel suitably embarassed by his or her inadequacies - it's simply the WORST feature of this otherwise fine product.I should also mention that, while Tracfone's coverage may be good, their support forum is most definitely NOT. They only respond to issues in private message, meaning that anyone else experiencing similar problems cannot search for a solution that worked for others. What is up with that? What are they trying to hide, and why? They will also force you to post 5 times in said forum before you will even be ABLE to read a pm, which seems like needless jerking around, since that's the only way you can get any help. It's like they went out of their way to be ignorant. Another in a long line of 'Customer Support' departments that are little or no help. Very few companies are even adequate in this area, let alone good. Fortunately, they did manage to transfer my number, ex date and minutes from my old phone with no issues, and it was quick.Overall, I'm satisfied with the phone, it's nice to have some extra features, and it's hard to beat for the money.

This phone at this price was a great deal for me. $14 for the phone and $10 a month for service is saving me hundreds of dollars on the year. The phone is attractive, the service has great call reception and the phone has more bells and whistles than I'll ever use. Since the unused minutes roll over I have already begun to accumulate many more minutes, allowing me to use the phone a little more liberally than I normally would. I have reduced my costs by 2/3rds thanx fo Tracfone. What a relief to no longer be paying for services I don't need or want. Tweet this! Not. :-)Oh and the battery life on this phone for me is good for day's. One good charge a week and it is good to go.Update: I have now owned this phone for over a year. I bought a protective cover for it shortly after purchase and it looks and operates like the day I bought it. Have accumulated 1274 minutes. The charge actually lasts longer than days.

While I agree that the qwerty buttons are small, I find them easier than the touch screen on my husband's LG840G (which he loves). It's simply because I use my thumbnails & can type fast on the LG500's buttons, whereas I have to use just my right pinkie finger to type on the LG840. The LG500 is a sturdy phone & the gel case protects it well. If I need to upgrade for some reason, I'll most likely go with the triple-minute LG530G. The battery is still going strong; it typically last from 7 to 9 days between charges, but then again I hardly ever use it for browsing. Reception is great; we live in very rural Gadsden County FL near the capital, Tallahassee._______________________________________________________I've had this LG500G for almost 2 months; battery is long-lasting, I only have to charge it once a week & the way I deal with the browser button issue [not a big deal for me] to keep the keypad locked when the phone is in my purse [in a padded pouch] or in my pocket - you simply press & hold the small lock icon in the lower row of buttons. I have only pressed the browser button 1 time by mistake in 2 months & closed it quickly. While the keypad is locked you can still answer calls & it's easy to unlock by pressing Unlock & Yes.  This is not the only mobile phone with this \"issue\" & certainly not specific only to TracFone.I bought a deep blue silicon skin for it, along with the data cable & car charger, from Amazon, plus I already had a back-up battery from Bed Bath & Beyond [$4]. I agree the camera is not the best but it still takes OK photos - I never expect to use my mobile phone as my camera anyway. The video works fine & once I installed a Sandisk 4GB memory card, I was good to go.  And the browser actually works OK - I typically use it to get the weather & maybe a stock quote. Anything else I use my netbook. This is, after all, a mobile phone & I don't want it to be everything rolled into one.

Problem is, you will occasionally need to contact Tracfone.  If you value your life, you'll get a phone from another company.  A friend recommends T Mobile.When I first got the phone, I needed to call the company to activate it.  For 3 hours I had to enter codes into the phone because it wouldn't work.  Based on past experience, I began to suggest the  SIM card was faulty, but they wanted to be sure, so I had to continue to enter codes. I was exhausted by the time they realized or acknowledged a faulty SIM card.  (They accidentally sent me 2 new ones.)Today I accidentally locked the phone while trying to add a security code.  To unlock it, I have to call the company.  Their recording said wait time is approximately 30 minutes.  I've now been on hold for almost 2 and 1/2 hours.While on hold, I tried to register my complaint on their website (after typing a paper for a friend.  My, what one can accomplish while on hold with Tracfone!  There's no excuse for not writing the great American novel.)  They repeatedly blocked my registration for the following reasons:  they already have my email address; I then used another email address, which they also already claim to  have. Because I'm an existing customer, I'm therefore not allowed to enter a review or join their forum.  They also repeatedly said I had mistyped the security/cue word at the bottom of the page.  Maybe some of my attempts were inaccurate, as the letters one is supposed to copy are illegible, but clearly some of my attempts were correct. I gave up and came to Amazon to publicize my experience.A few years ago I called Tracfone for a busy friend whose phone would not function.  For over 5 hours I had to enter codes into the phone. Finally, after being routed to every possible department, some guy somewhere realized or acknowledged that the SIM card was defective.Adding up all the hours I have spent on my land line trying to solve problems with Tracfone, I come to a total so far of over 10 hours.  So far.  I will have to call again tomorrow and start all over again - waiting on hold and then who knows how long it will take to straighten the problem out?  And  what work will be required of me?For some reason, I thought Tracfone had improved their service.  I was wrong.  My body aches from holding the phone.

After my last (33-minute) conversation with a so-called customer service rep, I was told to CALL BACK (are you kidding me?) on another phone (that is, on a phone other than my Tracfone) so that they could run some kind of check. I think they're all working from a script that's designed to wear down the customer's resistance so they'll just give up. If I were shopping again for prepaid cellular service, I would NOT go with Tracfone - it's just not worth the aggravation you'll encounter if you have a problem with your service.-UPDATE: I've added a star to my review (from one to two stars) and added this note because I was ultimately able to resolve the problem I was having with Tracfone's customer service, and I did receive all the air time I had coming (actually, I ended up receiving a little more than expected). Dealing with Tracfone's customer service was a very frustrating experience, but other than that one isolated incident the phone and service have been pretty much as advertised.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A brick and a very good, little phone.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"artist, animal communicator\"", "ReviewID": "R3NHZ0LGH56MOY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just upgraded from this phone to the Samsung S390G because that one offers the triple minutes.

I like the big screen, and the Qwerty keypad, and especially the LONG battery life. This phone goes for 5 days without a recharge.  My previous Samsung T301g had to be recharged after 2 days.  My Motorola W376g had to be charged every 2 days, and sometimes everyday if I used it much.  What a pleasure not to have to plug this phone into the wall continuously!!!  It has strong signal strength in most areas, and I've never had a dropped call with the tracfone system.  I picked this phone up for a mere $13 on sale, and it seems to be a very sweet bargain.  Just to add an update on this phone.  The camera went goofy, and made the whole phone freeze up.  To solve the problem I had to take the back off and pull out the battery, and then restart the phone.  It must have been defective, and I got so tired of messing around with this that I deactivated this phone and threw it in a box in the basement.  I'll keep the battery and power cord to use with other LG phones if I need to.  Point to make here is, unless this was some kind of a weirdo defect, this phone is not as reliable as I once thought.

Westmoreland", "ReviewID": "R1JCOLEZMHWIW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot say enough good things about this phone.  It's inexpensive, light, compact, loud, clear and easily the best prepaid phone for your money.  I'm really glad Tracfone has released updated phones that are comparable to Smartphones.  Both the Tracfone LG 500 and 800G are great models to own for those who actually like having newer phones without an ungodly monthly contract to deal with.  The LG 800 I previously owned was a great deal with triple minutes for life at $49.99.  However, I thought it didn't have a loud enough volume, so I decided to try the LG 500G since Amazon has it for $20 with the phone, SD card and USB Data cable.  A very excellent deal too, b/c now I have close to a 1,000 songs on my phone and I didn't have to spend alot of money for a cool feature.  You certainly won't get a contract phone, a SD card and a USB Data cable for around $20 at any cell phone provider I'm aware of.  Needless to say, if you aren't a rich person like me, then you can't afford an expensive contract that has few positives over prepaid providers like Tracfone.  I don't watch TV on my phone or surf the web on it, so having a very dependable phone with an awesome MP3 player is precisely what I needed.The service a few weeks in is great for prepaid service.  I haven't encountered any dropped calls(which is sometimes typical for prepaid or contract providers)yet.  The calls are loud and clear, IMO as clear as any landline phone I've ever used.  Of course, one of the major reasons I've always chosen Tracfone over all other prepaid service is b/c you don't have to add a card every month.  I'm not an excessive talker, so Tracfone adding 90 days to your service days every time you add a card is tailor made for me.  Meaning, between activation and adding a 90 minute card, I have close to 150 service days and close to 200 minutes.  And since I don't talk alot, that would last me for a couple months or more before I have to add another card.  This feature is particularly appealing to me, b/c adding another card or two could easily give me a year's worth of service at a decent rate.  In all, I might spend maybe $200 vs. some contract providera charging that per month.  That alone to me makes this model phone and the service well worth the price tag.One concern I've seen on the reviews here I outright disagree with is the browser button being on the end button.  Apparently, most who've reviewed that as a negative haven't noticed the browser button is to the left of the end key.  I will acknowledge that the keys are small for those who prefer larger buttons, but it hasn't been an issue for me and I can't understand why it's such a problem for most.  Besides, you can go to your settings and use the phone lock feature which will not allow you to hit that particular key when the phone isn't in use.  Be warned though, if you want a phone with big buttons, then you need to buy a different model.  However, the buttons on this model aren't any smaller than your typical Blackberry(or Blackberry knockoff in this case).  So, if you are the texting type, then this shouldn't be of any concern to you.I'd definately recommend this to anyone who wants a nice phone without all the insane fees and monthly bills.  Simply put, I haven't found a better deal than this and is a great way of staying connected without emptying your wallet.

While my phone is adequate, experience convinces me it may be Tracphone has gone well out of its way to prove the title of this review factual.A recent purchase of additional air time (not minutes, those are a separate charge) failed to ever appear on my phone. I tolerated this because the phone did continue to work.  Unfortunately, this resulted in time running out without warning.  Problematic, at the best.Trying to buy time with a different card than the one Tracphone kept information on was an effort in futility.  First, changing profile information was only marginally better. For example, my old address nowhere shows up on my profile information, UNTIL I attempt to make a purchase.  All efforts to correct the erroneous address seem more purposed to frustrate than anything else.  Tracphone's means of resolving the problem is to send you off to forums, rather than provide an agent from which to purchase time or minutes - not marketing genius at its best, to be sure.I found changing the card information could, reasonably, give the impression Tracphone had no interest in making sales.  Attempting to use other than the ancient credit card stored on the Tracphone site sends one off on an endless loop.  In the end, I yet have a worthless phone with hundreds of dollars in minutes of talk time.  The problem may yet be solved, but I am wondering if I need to make a career of it, or go to school for a degree in Tracphone quirks.  I suspect I may be out of luck on the latter.Perhaps Tracphone hired incompetent programmers to build its web sites. Alternately, Tracphone may do this intentionally to coerce customers into abandoning their old phones [and, maybe, even minutes].  If the latter, that may also explain what Tracphone did with my credit card information and why I found unauthorized charge attempts.  Too, perhaps accessing the Tracphone site via another browser would have better results, however, my tolerance for companies attempting to control which programs I install on my computer are less than limited.Obviously, I can only speculate on the honesty of Tracphone, but, meanwhile, I can enjoy the fact I can warn others of some of the pitfalls of doing business with Tracphone.The \"pro\" side of Tracphone is, if and when you can get yours working, they provide \"on the road\" service for emergencies and so forth.

I spoke to Tracfone several times but they were unable to stop the spam, even after they placed me on the no-spam list. Apparently prior users of this phone number had signed up for many texts, and there was no way for me to unsubscribe except individually and by paying for the correspondence. I could not see if a text was personal or promotional until I opened it and paid for it.2. The phone interfered with other phone lines and caused static or loud beeps if kept around while on a landline. I had to keep it far away from any landline.3. It was hard to refill the phone card. I had to look up the Tracfone info on the internet; there was no convenient single button to refill it. This sounds minor, but it actually meant I was sometimes left without the prepaid service, and as I use this as an emergency contact phone, it was a big flaw. I could not use any service to look up the Tracfone info once the phone was out of minutes.4. It was very easy to mistakenly press the web button and be charged .50 minutes.

The camera is about useless. My old Samsung 301G has a 3.2 MP camera. The picture quality on it was pretty good. On this phone it's so grainy you can't make out any details. I was interested in the app capability. I downloaded the Facebook app. Wasted quite a few minutes on that. It loads, and the first screen is \"add friends\". The key to the right of the arrows is supposed to be the skip button. It doesn't work. That button works for everything else, including when I press the end button and get prompted if I want to quit Facebook. The same key is the \"no\" response. It works for that. So, I tried to find a friend, and it tells me I need to download an upgrade. I get charged 3 minutes when I hit ok, the it tells me I'm disconnected. I've tried several times, and I'm giving up on the app. When I browse to the Facebook site, I can type a status update, but I can't get the phone to scroll over to the \"post\" button. The only way I can update my status is by texting to my Facebook account's upload email address. This only costs me a third of a minute, which is cheaper than opening the browser anyway.The Mp3 player is a nice option, but occasionally I get an error right in the middle of a song and it stops playing. The sound quality isn't bad for a phone when it works. I do like that I can listen to music when I take a walk without carrying a seperate device.

There are just too many buttons to accidentally hit and fumble with. For my family, this is our back-up cell phone, which we needed when we were still T-Mobile customers, because their service was so unreliable, we needed a second cell phone on hand for emergencies. The battery stays charged for an extremely long time with the power turned off - I've powered up the phone after several months and found there was still an almost-full charge. So it's a good phone for a very low price.I also highly recommend purchasing an inexpensive USB data cable which you can use to charge your phone battery in an emergency by plugging it into your laptop USB port.

I like Tracfone -- have had an LG 420 for a couple of years & never had a problem. I just wanted to make texting easier. Great price -- even better, I got it for $1.36 by using Amazon points. The comments about the keyboard sold me -- that even with bigger fingers, it was easy to use. Figured if it worked for bigger hands, it would work for mine which are average. Have been playing with it all morning.It even seems to have better reception & transmission than the old model. The 420 often would not send texts or drop service & I'd have to move somewhere outside to get them sent. No problem so far the last four hours. There was nothing to setting it up. The switchover from my old phone took about two minutes. It would have been helpful if the switch had imported my contacts. Maybe there's some way to do it & one of the other reviews has that.One drawback that someone else has mentioned is that you can accidentally access the web browser which is next to the power/end key. Once I get used to the phone, I doubt it will happen but the older model I was using was set up so you could go back & forth on the main screen using that button.Have only used the browser to download a couple of ringtones & it was okay but don't know how it is accessing pages like Google or Facebook.

Was connected to an obvious overseas call center, with someone who spoke very poor English.  She kept telling me the phone could not be activated because it wasn't \"authorized.\"  She told me Amazon was not an authorized seller of Tracfones.  Okay, then why are there so many reviews by people who have purchased Tracfones from Amazon and activated them with no problem?  It was a horrible experience of trying to ask questions, and not receiving clear answers.  She finally offered to send me a free phone, and I would just have to send this one back in the prepaid shipping envelope.  The catch??  The free phone is a lesser model and won't be here until sometime late next week.  This is my first attempt at a Tracfone and will definitely be my last.  In hindsight, I should have simply returned the phone to Amazon and received a refund and figured out another way to get my mom a phone.

However, the reception was generally 2 bars less than the 501 and sometimes completely disappeared. I called Tracfone and after going through 3 levels of help, finally got a reason. I was told that phones with a SIM card can not use the same cell towers (Verizon) as those without a SIM card. The person recommended that I get a phone without a card. After some searching, she told me that the 501 was the only such phone that would work in my rural area. So I had my phone switched back to the 501 and enjoy very strong signals. I guess the only way I am going to get a video phone is to switch to a non-Tracfone system. I refuse to do this because of the considerable difference in cost. So I will put up with no video but a strong signal.

A great phone book, so I will say I love this phone you cannot beat this price for a phone with all this you get on it..why the heck do people use Verizon, tmobile, and all the others and pay hundreds of dollars on a phone that this phone does a lot of it and get tied down to a contract...STUPID!!!...this is all you need...save a lot of money and enjoy the phone. Stop paying so much for phone service and pay the high price of a phone. I get the Double minutes...which is great. But over all the phone is not cheap looking and feels good in your hand,it's sleek and glides right into you pocket. Has lots of ringtones too. People think you have to have the top of the line and break your wallet. Not so on this...phone. Take it Grab It and Enjoy it. You will have to fiddle around on the phone to learn all the features it has. I was kinda dumb founded on some parts of the phone until I learned my away around on it. There's so many ways to have this phone set up...no more Blackberry and the silly data plan they charge you just another way to make more money..... Many of the carrier just simply over charge you and they love that, they want you to get tied into a contract and then slam you with ridiculous month service price. I'm out of it never will I go to a Blackberry plan I was with Verizon..dumb move....

Does have some that are very good for the money.By that I mean, I have a Motorola W376G and it has a radio built in. Also has a flip cover which this does not. This has the ability to record voice, but does not have the ability to do so easily... or record a call in the middle of it... at least that I found.What it does have is the ability to transfer pictures from you phone without mailing them but for free using a USB cord (not included but cheap at many stores). But sadly it is only a 1.3 megapixel camera.Now it does have a huge amount of storage 4gb on a microSD card (also not included but cheap on amazon) so you can use it to carry important pictures, documents, sound files etc which you can put on through the USB cord from your computer.The instruction manual that comes with it is very poor.The right sellers have cheap minutes you can buy for the camera with some great deals every now and then.Last year Tracfone had some special that doubled my minutes (right around Christmas) and took my user active functioning date to the year 2072!The lack of being a flip phone is the part that bothers me the most. As is the lack of a radio. Also, having a stylus would be nice to work the small keys, but again you can buy them here on Amazon.On the good side is the ability to transfer pictures from the camera to your computer for free without sending them (at a minutes cost).This tracfone also does not have any smartphone features or the ones it does have are minimal.. at least not up to so many other phones on the market.But the price is so great it does make up for the features and functions it lacks. So overall not a terrible buy.Oh, but one major bad feature is Tracfone tech support. It is slow and terrible and very few of their techs speak good English so it is hard to get through even minor calls with any speed. My fone came in in Spanish and it took 3 Hours to get tech support (5 different techs) to understand what I wanted to do.... make it display in English. When I finally got a tech who understood what I needed to do it to about 2 minutes.Also watch out for the Internet button (on the front beside the other buttons and clicking it by accident (easy to accidentally do as it is also the ON/OFF button and depends what other buttons are already pushed) costs you at least 1.5 minutes!!!!.I have had other tracfones and got thru using them easily. This has been a chore so far.3 hours of my life to change the language(plus more time looking functions up online with my computer) have bothered me about this phone.My W376G is a blessing (yes I still have two of them).

This way, you won't be calling people randomly, and you won't be hitting the browser button and waste minutes.The full QWERTY keyboard makes you more fluent on a normal keyboard.Cons-Once you're inbox/outbox reached 200 messages, you won't be able to receive or send anything. Also, it doesn't tell you which one needs clean. It just says it's 90-100% full.There is no delete all button. That ticked me off the most. Unless you have an unread message, you have to delete all messages by hand. And in the outbox, you can't get an unread message, so if you're 200+ messages, you sit there for about 60 minutes cleaning out the outbox. Another 60 if you don't have an unread message.It is really slow. If you hit browser on accident, you are stuck there for a few minutes until it fully loads. Also, if anything else is loading, it takes FOREVER.The keys are a bit small, so if you have bigger fingers, they are really hard to click without hitting all the ones around it.You could only have so many pictures.
