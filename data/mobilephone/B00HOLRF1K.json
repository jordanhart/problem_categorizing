{"Reviews": [{"Title": "At last a Super Android 4.0 unlocked smartphone", "Author": "Regi Sylvain", "ReviewID": "R1XJ9S0QVYTVT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is easily one of the best Android phones in the market today for the following reasons:1.  It has a fairly efficient MTK6572 dual core  processor miles ahead of the Spreadtrum  processor being used in most 4.0  generic phones being sold in the market today by Chinese vendors.2.  The MTK dual core 6572 dual core processor makes the phone fast, and easy to browse.Browsing as well as surfing is a breeze.Easily one of the best processors in the android market.Look for it while buying any phone.3.  Set up couldn\u2019t have been easier. Just insert your unlocked simcard and within seconds it gets registered with the network.I used an AT&T;  unlocked simcard  and everything went smoothly.4.  Make sure to keep the cellular data connection on especially while using MMS which works well with the cellular data connection.5.  The appearance is fairly good and it is lightweight.6.  The  screen resolution is cool and the colors great.7.  The camera takes good pictures especially the back one.8.  Wifi works at super speed9.  Downloading apps is fairly easy no complications with the MTK 6572 dual core processor.10.  Most popular apps are already there.11.  Battery life is fairly good .Overall an excellent buy and highly recommended phone", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "chevy", "ReviewID": "R2QV79TMM0B9XS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "shipped fast before scheduled date great phone came with head phones 2 batteries  phone case screen protector and charger connects to wifi I have had no problems out of it great phone for a great price downloaded all my apps like facebook snapchat instagram and it came with a 4gb memory card and I connected my service with no problems just inserted my sim card and activated the phone!!", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "A 2G phone which performs better than my old 4GLTE", "Author": "saun", "ReviewID": "R3REVEJJQ0WIJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this phone as a gift from my mother a couple of weeks back.Yes it is adverstised as a 2G phone but beats my old 4glte in call qulaity and coverage.Inside my housr I was never able to get more than 2  bars with my iphone (4GLTE).This one getes full bars .So waht if its is edge.It is the signal strength that matters.The phone is good looking with a decent MTk which has a fairly good speed.Set up could not have been easier.Took me 15 seconds to connect to the nework after I inserted the AT&T; simMMS works fine.Wifi range is great >Connectivity no issue.The extra battery was a bonus.Overall a great phone for its price.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "A2G phone which works better than most 3g androids in the market", "Author": "desmond cruise", "ReviewID": "R27HXAWIEHICV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes I am not kidding.My son bought it from Amazon and I got angry with him as yo why he didn't ask me before buying as I wanted to get him a 3G.Boy I was wrong.This 2g phone makes the Chinese knockoff 3Gs look like a joke.Here are some of the greates features I have seen in an android.Awesome receptionGreat downloadsHuge 8 GIGS of RomDecent ramGreat call qualityNice appearanceSuper easy set upOveall super value for money", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "garbbage", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NOP3VEE1JBGG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i thought this would have being a good buy but it was a waste of money. batteries dead dead dead.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost made it.", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "RS16GTQB94GRQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's a cute phone, but  everytime you are on the phone it keeps dialing out or putting the person on hold.

I had to lay it a certain way just for it to charge anyway. The headphone connection was always bad, the sound was distorted only when headphones was put in the phone.  It's also very slow and freezes all the time.  It deleted one of my apps and wouldn't let me add it back.  It said that the phone didn't have that much memory left, but when I checked it the phone said it had a lot of memory left.  If your taking pictures outside, the camera is fine, but when your inside with flash, you have to be in a well lighted room.  The front camera sucks! The battery life is fine as long as its on standby, but of course if it's hooked on wifi and you're surfing on the internet the battery will run down faster.

Maybe some are defective? It looks great and has a great feel, so I was excited. Once I got the SIM card in and set up, I realized I wasn't going to get anything better than Edge network speeds :(I tried several APN settings, but all I got was Edge. I called Straight Talk and they said it was set up right, otherwise I wouldn't have any internet. The volume of the calls is horrible and has bad quality. Also, the screen wouldn't black out during calls, so pushing buttons with my face was also an issue. Speaker phone hardly worked. Ringtone is terribly quiet, even on the loudest setting.
