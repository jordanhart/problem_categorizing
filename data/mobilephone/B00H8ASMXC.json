I decided to purchase this phone after I lost my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy SII (that I'm still paying for, by the way) and I refused to purchase another $400 to $600 phone that I would be paying for in installments over the next two years!  The camera quality is not the greatest but other than that, there are no complaints I can think of.  I've had this phone for almost a month now, I love the fact that it came with a case, screen cover, and headphones in addition to a charger; many just come with a charger.  This phone has exceeded my expectations and I expect to stick with the BLU line of phones next time I need one and I will be recommending it to family and friends.  I wish I heard of BLU phones earlier, who needs a $600 Samsung or iPhone when this product can do what they do at a much affordable price?", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well worth it!", "Author": "Grammy Cindy", "ReviewID": "R285200RXDCAJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 62 and have not had a problem figuring this phone out for the most part.  It's much easier then the old touch phone that I bought a couple of years ago and has a much larger screen which is a big plus for me.  I'm still learning the features, some of which I probably won't use much, but for all my needs it's close to perfect.  I love not having a contract and the price I paid for this was a bonus.

It is a large and impressive looking phone its about the size of a galaxy note 2 but at a fraction of the cost. Sure, it is not perfect, the one annoying flaw I've encountered so far is that it closes candy crush on me but other than that its golden. It works just as well otherwise as my aunts galaxy s4. I love this phone also because of its beautiful vivid colors (mine is bright yellow) which makes it all the more special. The screen quality is nice and bright with crisp and clean colors, and it is very fast. BTW if your switching from a galaxy phone, keep in mind that at the top of the phone next to the signal bars, it won't say 4G instead it has an H+ which I'm guessing means 4G... No worries it is very fast just the same as a galaxy or the like.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "In Love!", "Author": "Glenda", "ReviewID": "R3W16ZDTLWZHUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my Blu Dash 5.0 phone today after just ordering it a day ago which is excellent shipping GO AMAZON!

I received the phone and I must say is huge but cute.

It shipped fast. The package came with no bubble wrap or any type of protection.Now about the phone, so far so good. This replaced my 11 month old generic android China phone I also ordered here in Amazon.Pros: - I'm not an App addict so with a 32GB microSD installed, the space/memory on this phone is good enough for my needs  - I installed a few games (not 3D) the phone can run them well and I'm able to move all the games & apps to the SD card  - It can play all my mp4 movies smoothly up to 960x540 resolution. Volume is good & loud  - No touch screen problems like freezing, going blank, rebooting etc like I read on other reviews on Blu cell phones.  - The screen is bright, responsive and as for angle viewing, I find no issues with it, as I don't look at the phone  sideways to often  - Battery life is excellent compared to my other phone. With light calls, chatting, gaming by the end of the day, it still has  67% left.  - The plastic case & screen protector are a nice bonus.  - The phone itself looks very good, nice & thin and it doesn't look cheap. Also the headphone 3.5mm jack works!Cons: - The phone I received was in a sealed box but the white paint was \"chipped\" at the upper corner. Must be a defect.  (I'll upload some pictures to show this) it's a small chip, but still frustrating to see on a brand new phone!  - No spare battery like my old generic android China phone.  - The screen protector was also defective. It looks like it was folded at the bottom corner  - Besides the provided case no other case fits BLU Dash 5.0 and that's a shame.  - The touch screen is very sensitive on the lower right side. Holding the phone on the sides keeps selecting the contact icon  - Playback lag on 720p & 1080p mp4All in all I like the phone. It functions just as it should. I am hoping that it will last longer than my 11 month old generic android phone before it gives me any problems. I'm using a prepaid service on a T-Mobile network. There are areas where I get 3g hspa speeds. The phone itself has lots of ringtones & wallpapers installed, some my find that as a good thing as for me I don't like any of the ringtones or the wallpaper, I'm using my own. I hope BLU will release an update for Android Kit-Kat 4.4 on this phone, that would be awesome!", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best value in mobile", "Author": "G. F.

All apps (no games tested) have been running great.It looks great, comes with a case, screen protector, and headphones.The one star deduction is for the camera. Really poor resolution; front camera more-so than the back camera.i.e. When I try to deposit checks via BoA app, the checks are refused because of  blurriness.I guess I forgot how bad 5.0MP/1.3MP cameras are.Regardless, if you're on a tight budget looking for a decent phone,or just need a phone to hold you over till the next upgrade (like me),then the Dash 5.0 is the way to go", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Received quickly, Impressed!!", "Author": "John Jacobs \"dello89\"", "ReviewID": "R3BDY0QXA2CUN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owned for about  2 months.

Only 4 GB ram, enough for me for the necessities, only about two GB is available for apps. I put a lot of my apps on sd card. It works as it should. The phone for calls works good, Clarity of calls , I would give it a 4 out of 5. Function of phone is very good. Nothing noteworthy that I am worried about with the phone. Blu Products backs phone for 1 year.  I am so happy to be able to purchase a decent cell phone without a contract, something I have been waiting for a while to be able to do!

A 5 inch screen seems very clear and acceptable quality for the average user, running Android jelly bean, seems to download all applications from Google Play without a problem, comes with the clear silicone case for protection.

Sleek design; vivid large color screen. Does everything I need it to do - works well with all android apps. Has no issues with T-Mobile. I added a 32gb memory card and it's perfect for videos, games, apps, etc. Clear sound and call quality. No technical quirks or restart issues. Comes with headset, charger, plastic case, and screen protector. Really happy with the purchase. Highly recommend. Only negative is the camera - camera quality is poor - the pictures aren't clear, doesn't focus well, resolution fair. Also GPS is a little funny, when I use navigation or google maps while driving the signal is a bit here and there - I get very random directions.

So far the phone has been great.  I did have to switch to T-Mobile (BLU rep suggested this) but I am very pleased with the phone and the service.  The phone does not look or work like an inexpensive phone and people with the more expensive ones are impressed with the phone as much as I am. As for the accessories: the Samsung S4 screen saver fits, but it did come with two. It came with a soft plastic back cover and I found a wallet type carrier on Amazon that works great when I carry the phone in by messenger bag. I would definitely recommend the BLU Dash 5.0 to new smartphone users who are looking for an inexpensive phone.
