I preferred the bigger screen and qwerty keyboard. Initially I had a problem with receiving calls, but I contacted the seller, (5 Star) and was advised to dial #228 to update phone to the newest Verizon towers. Voila! Now I receive all my calls. I found that I seldom use the qwerty board since there are so many easier keyboard apps available for android. It's solid and sturdy, call quality is good and I don't have a problem with battery life. I wanted this Froyo system phone so I could one touch root it with Z4Root. I froze all the apps that turn on by themselves with Titanium Pro; that saves a lot of battery life. Since I don't use the qwerty I was admiring the Moto Droid X with no physical keyboard and a bigger screen.

It could never connect to VZW 3G Network and now I cannot even make calls or receive them. *228 activation brings Metro PCS options and not Verizon. Took it up to a local VZW store for a second time and they said the phone is completely malfunctioned and there's nothing they can do about it. Complete and utter bust.------Bought this after I lost my Droid4 (VZW). I haven't been able to connect to VZW's 3G network since purchasing. I've taken it to a VZW store, tried multiple things on my own, and been on with VZW support multiple times. No 3G whatsoever. Regardless of whether its the phone's fault or VZW's, the customer is screwed at the end of the day.There's a little blue triangle in the notification bar which according to VZW support signifies the phone is in roaming mode. For me, the little blue triangle never goes away. Altering roaming settings has no effect.Going into the phone's mobile network settings [Settings >> Wireless & network >> Mobile networks] there is no other option except \"System select\". The carriers mobile network (3G) should show up there; it does not. So something is seriously wrong with this phones ability to connect to Verizon's Network.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because its perfect functional over Wi-Fi, which is acceptable while I decided which new phone to purchase.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rip-off", "Author": "JAZZ world \"Blue\"", "ReviewID": "R37AUS6DCI6AOY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was happy for a few months.

BUY.", "Author": "Bird That Flew", "ReviewID": "RO00IRRF6U6Y6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To summarize: I bought this phone in 2013 when it was already \"old\" because I don't have a lot of money and all I really wanted was something to make phone calls with/text/occasional photo/occasional Google search.  I thought buying this model would save me money, but I was wrong.  It lasted 2.5 months total and problems began 1 month after I bought it.First problem:  there's a huge lag while I'm texting. I use(d) the touch screen to text, not the keypad, as the keypad is genuinely so awkward to use that it is barely functional.  Anyway, in the middle of typing a text, the cursor will lag, I won't be able to see the last 2-4 letters I typed, and the autocorrect will kick in, replacing my intended word with all sorts of weird things that don't make sense.  Also while texting, the touch screen keyboard will frequently disappear.  It's beyond frustrating and it takes a good 60 seconds to type a 1-2 sentence text.  This lag is evidently common and it's suggested you install ADW Launcher to fix it.  I did, and the problem was exactly the same.Second problem:  While on a phone call, the display screen will often disappear and nothing I do will bring it back.  This is problematic if, for example, I'm calling my bank's automated service and need to hit \"2\" to get a person.  I can't get the touch screen keyboard up, and the slide out keyboard doesn't work.  It's also a problem if I'm trying to hang up at the end of a phone call.  Usually I have to wait for the other person to hang up, as I'm unable to do it myself.UPDATE:  Three months after the above happened, the entire left side of the touch screen stopped working.  Apparently this is a common problem and is due to some kind of programming/software issue.I can't wait to never have to use this frustrating piece of junk again.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy!", "Author": "Teresa H. \"N W Florida\"", "ReviewID": "R1ERN0SMFVZPKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for my teenage son and he is very happy with it.

Keep the wifi and gps location turned off unless you're using Navigator or can connect to wifi and that helps with battery life. Great phone for the price! I love the google play store.

First of all, the camera is a disappointment, and the wifi stopped working the first month of ownership of the Droid 2. I finally got it to connect to a specific network, but the service was nit significant enough to have any use. This was a small issue for me, then the internet took an unexcusable amount of time it takes to download applications, songs and connect to an internet page. The battery life is well below average, and few universal chargers correspond with it. In addition, the power button has recently became unresponsive,and has made it impossible to put it on sleep mode and turn it off, i downloaded several things to attempt to access a way to turn off the phone but all the play store had to offer was screen locks, today it refused to turn on and respond to the charger. I got it to turn on twice after it died with the charger lighting up here and there but it would only shut back down. The keyboard function is choppy physically and technically. As soon as you have a reasonable number of apps the phone scrolls raggedly, and sometimes the screen is unresponsive. It takes a few lifetimes to turn on, and since the power button has shut down the phone options are hysterical and show up frequently, The phone restarts an average times of seven times a day.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "Penny", "ReviewID": "R3M827K63LSLB8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a decent smartphone without paying alot and this seems to be a good phone so far.
