What this means is that many applications will not run, and much functionality is limited.  If you're thinking of shelling out for a smart phone, there are many other phones out there running up-to-date software.  I really can't think of any reason to purchase this one, especially at the current price of $150 or more.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "You should know that....", "Author": "Putterer \"Tablet Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3EI8JVOQX0BU9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yoi should know that tMobile and Motorola have defaulted on their promise to upgrade this phone to Android 2.1 and useability with Google navigation.

Medina", "ReviewID": "R2SJCTABCNHQ8Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is known for dialing out on its own, shutting down and rebooting on its own and with its MotoBlur features meant to update your status on social networks, it dials out to people that post also. Ok, to explain the last statement. The phone shows what others post on social networks and because the phone blends your current phone contacts with your Facebook contacts...it is possible for the phone to dial out to the posting ''friend'' phone number. The Wi-Fi isn't up to par with other phones and this is a problem for those that like the speed of Wi-fi when its available. Also like alot of other phones the touchscreen isn't able to work with a stylus or pen to type which is a problem because the screen isn't acuarate always and closer to hardly ever. Don't buy this phone! Don't waste your upgrade and it has a low rating also on the Tmobile Website!", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "JUNK!", "Author": "A. D.

Now for the review...Although I paid for \"express shipping\" it still took a week for the phone to be delivered. The description of the phone was fairly accurate but only as far as the appearance went. It said the technology worked perfectly but it doesn't. The speaker barely works so I have to speak loudly or else I sound muffled to the other person and even with the call volume at 10 I can barely hear the other person unless I'm in a quiet place. The touchscreen doesn't always work, for example when I listen to a voicemail the screen doesn't respond to touch or pressing any buttons. I have to either take out the battery or wait for the voicemail line to disconnect itself in order to hang up. Very annoying. In retrospect, I should have spent a little more money and purchased a new phone because I have a feeling that I'll end up having to buy another phone before the year is over.In summary, here are my two cents -Seller: Please test your products more extensively in order to provide a more accurate descriptionBuyer: Be wary of purchasing used phones", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cliq XT", "Author": "ab", "ReviewID": "R3FBQT14M8HSVW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is lousy but it is a temporary replacement until my Cliq Titanium is repaired.

I am happy with their response and when I receive the fixed or new phone and have time to use it will post a final review.They have had my phone for 3 weeks and I have talked with them numerous times and each time they did not have a clue what I was talking about. I am on hold now to talk with them again, the last time being a week ago when I was told I would have my phone by the end of the week.

It's got almost all the features that i would like to have and what's more it's an android smart phone. I like MOTOBLUR on it as it nicely groups my social networks at one place though the home screen looks little too crowded. This one runs android 1.5 and Motorola officially announced that they are not going to upgrade this anymore. But still there are thousands of apps that supports this version of android in the market. Also this phone weighs less and looks sleek, comfortably sits in my jeans pocket. Camera takes nice pictures and Music is so cool if you download Mixzing Basic.Apart from that, the phone is little sluggish at times and the calibrate compass is unresponsive at times. Battery lasts a day at the minimum (I play music and browse a lot) and need to see if this continues for days to come. Also, the 2GB SD Card was removed from the phone when it was shipped to me may be they removed it while unlocking the phone.Bottom Line: I would recommend this phone for those who need a basic smart phone with good music/camera quality and couldn't afford many $.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good smartphone for the price", "Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "R3VUI5UKVCZW72", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Edit: Do not buy this phoneThis phone with CM7 is effected by the random battery drain bug outlined here:[...]You should only buy this phone if your aim is to get a good deal on first-gen hardware. By hardware I literally mean just the phone, software not included. The extras that came in the box are obviously used (battery, useless quickstart guide, wall usb adapter), but the phone itself seems brand new as advertised.Hardware:This is what you should be interested in, and it's great!-it's thin-can overclock CPU to about 700 MHz-great battery life (I can go 3 days without charging with standard dumbphone-type usage)-extremely bright \"torch\" (camera LED)-256MB of RAM of which I'm usually able to keep about 40% free-decent amount of internal storage for apps (never had a problem)-the D-pad is awesome for selecting tiny links in browser-5MP camera-can't really get a higher screen resolution on a 1st gen phone-wifi works well (I don't have 3G)-GPS receiver works pretty well, and you don't even need data if you start the trip from a wifi hotspot and let it cache everything.-standard headphone jack on topSoftware:The included software is Android 1.x and Motorola will not support an upgrade even to 2.1, however, I bought this phone specifically because Cyanogenmod supports it. Rooting and upgrading the ROM is pretty quick and easy, and after you do it will run the equivalent of Android 2.3 almost flawlessly. The animations stutter here and there, but I didn't expect much better on a 1st gen CPU without any GPU.Music:This phone will work pretty well as an ipod replacement if you give it a huge microSD card. My experience with a class 4 SD card and overclocked CPU is that you still have to use the PowerAmp app because all other music-playing software will skip here and there. PowerAmp uses a more advanced decoder and has thread priority and buffer options to eliminate the skipping.A few random things:Skype didn't work for me over wifi (sound is choppy). The screen is kind of tacky such that your finger doesn't slide over it as well as it does on more expensive phones. I'm planning on getting a screen protector to solve that. Also, the battery on this phone is spec'd at 1420 mAh, it's advertised here at 1400 and what you actually get is 1390. It's still a lot though.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "B.

The sound quality is fantastic and the external speaker is loud enough to use while driving. The buttons are well placed and the menu is very easy to navigate. I wanted the Defy because of the faster processor, yet the slower processor in the Cliq XT is just as capable. Many will find the Android OS 1.5 to be limited and Motorola has stopped working to create a new OS to be compatible with the CLIQ XT so some of those cool aps will not work on the phone.
