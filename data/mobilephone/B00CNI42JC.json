Branson, Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1M1FWOE9PNVHD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, I really wanted to like this phone.  I was looking for a rugged basic phone that could take some abuse and keep on 'ticking.'  I loved that it was an unlocked quad phone and would allow me to use any GSM network in the United States and overseas.  The phone is only a 2G phone but this didn't bother me as I was only looking for phone basics: talk and text.  Being able use it out of the country and add an overseas network SIM card, for example,  was most appealing.  Having 2 wells for separate SIM cards and the ability to toggle back and forth between them without opening up the back of the phone and swapping out a SIM card was a plus.  The set up was actually very simple and intuitive.  I felt the screen was adequate and easy to read.  The sound quality of the speaker was good.Where the phone fell down, however, was the microphone.  I could here phone conversations perfectly well but those that I called couldn't understand anything that I said.  It was described to me that It sounded like I was speaking through a scarf or underwater.  When I placed the phone on speaker phone, there was a terrible unintelligible reverberation. This was the deal breaker:  It didn't meet minimum criteria for any phone: the ability to communicate.  My phone was branded as a 'MANN, Zug-1' phone.  Phone sent back.  If they can correct the microphone defect, than it might be worth revisiting this phone,  Until then, stay away from this product.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Confusing set up", "Author": "Gonahena", "ReviewID": "RHD315SO0WE1C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The accessory photo shows a European wall jack adapter for charging, has no 2nd SIM card needed to connect with the network and no memory card.The instruction book requires magnification to read it and does not walk you through the set-up properly.If I could get this phone set up properly, I might enjoy using it.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.00", "Features": "All-Environment Rugged Mobile Phone\nWaterproof, Dustproof, Shockproof\nQuad-Band GSM\nDual SIM\n2MP Camera", "Name": "Rugged Design Mobile Phone \"Fortis\" - Dustproof, Shockproof, Waterproof, Quad Band GSM, Dual SIM, 2MP Camera (Green)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lZu3vvisL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CNI42JC"}}
