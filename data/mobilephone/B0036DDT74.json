Feature-wise, the two phones are almost the same, but the performance of the X6 is vastly improved. Sure it's not hard to beat an old phone, but this one leaves me wanting for nothing.Like all top-end Nokia phones, it has great built-in features: GPS, camera/video, music player, FM radio, wifi, 3g.Apps load very fast, and the native browser loads really quick too. Wifi reception is great, and the GPS locks on within seconds.The glass touchscreen is very accurate and easy to use; the display is beautiful. The haptic feedback is a little inconsistent or delayed, but it doesn't distract.Menu layout is improved too, and once you figure it out, everything is within a tap or two. The Contacts layout on the home screen is hugely useful.My one complaint is headphone volume is too loud or soft; the controls are not fine enough. That was true on the N95 too.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "a good unlocked phone", "Author": "Hong", "ReviewID": "R1DGUKTU3PU5G3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ya we know the symbain system is old, the hardware is outdated.

Fernandez", "ReviewID": "R54ZD2UI3M07D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm gonna start my review telling you I bought this phone 2 months ago, so I have experienced most of the features the phone has on it, and also have unfortunately had the consequences of a couple of 1mt downfalls and other common issues of a 2 month phone. I'm going directly with the Pros and the Cons:PROS: - The capacitive touchscreen is simply fantastic. The response to any little contact is stunning, but at the same time, by being capacitive it prevents the virtual buttons to be accidentally activated. (Try using your nails, a pen or something different than a finger and you won't get any result) - The camera is pretty good, 5MP, Carl Zeiss lens and double led flash allows you to take very good pictures even at night! - The accelerometer, though it's too sensitive for me some times, works great and allows you for example to switch quickly between alphanumeric keyboard with predictive text to qwerty keyboard when sending sms or writing something on the internet (One of my favorite features by the way) - Very good and free GPS from Nokia (Ok it's not Garmin but works very well) - Internet browsing is nice, can open the webpages in full mode and not mobile modes. You can also set it to ask you what connection you wanna use (Wifi or your service provider), which is good for me cause I'm always looking for free conecctions to save some money! - Great sound, even listening to the radio. - Almost all features work in portrait and landscape mode (one exception is the phone call screen) - Tons of apps can be downloaded, you can find almost everything you want. - So much other Pros...good bluetooth, adequate size and shape, 16GB of internal memory, etc., etc., etc.CONS - The material of the case is plastic, looks a very nice opaque black, but it feels too fragile in the hands (and it effectivly is, a 30cm downfall and it left a huge scratch in one of the corners) - The Symbian operating system works good, but sometimes is a little slow and it shows some limitations when using few programs at the same time (but I have to point that is sooooo much better than any blackberry device or even the Iphone, it just doesn't make it as good as the Nokia N900) - The lock screen button is located in one side of the phone, is some kind of switch that you have to move down to lock or unlock. It makes you use a different finger than your thumb to move it, which can be bothering when you're typing (though after 2 months you get used to it). I'd prefer a slide unlock as in the iPhone (you can download an app to do that). - The contact bar (where you can put the pictures of your favorite contacts in the homescreen) doesn't respond to the touching as good as the rest of the screen. It lasts a lot to load and makes the start up longer, which can be very bothering. Fortunately you can deactivate it. - For some actions you only have to press the buttons once, but other options need you to press the buttons twice. There's no logical sequence to learn when to press once or twice, you simply have to remember it (you also get used to it after two months)That's what I remember now...but in general, it's a great phone, high usability, it's a stunning experience, I highly recommend itHope this helps", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "FrankyS", "ReviewID": "RTPFFF9OC8EG5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Nokia x6 would have been my third Nokia phone over the past several years. I say \"would have\" because I ended up returning the phone after about a week of use.At first, the X6 seemed like a winner. 5MP camera with Carl Zeiss name (which indicates good quality), capacitive touch screen, tried-and-true Symbian UI, a decent video recorder (30fps), and a tremendous amount of storage space (16gb) built in. And really, the spec sheet is very good, but in reality the phone comes up short.First, the camera was absolutely terrible. This was one of the primary reasons that I returned the phone. The phone that I used before ordering the X6 was the Sony Ericsson W995a which had an 8.1MP camera. It was very good. The phone before that one was a Nokia N82 which had a spectacular camera (5MP) that was even better than the W995a (it's not all about mega pixels I guess). My thought was that since this had the same MP rating as the N82, and that they were both \"Carl Zeiss\" lenses, and both were Nokias, that they would perform at least similar to one another. I was very wrong. I know that the N82 has a xenon flash, but I'm not even talking about night shots. The X6's pictures were grainy during the day, un-focused, and had lots of noise. This was the first thing that made me reconsider.Second, and perhaps the worst thing about the X6, is that the phone is really, really slow. Transitioning between landscape and portrait takes a second or two. Opening a program can take as little as 2 seconds to as much as 5 (like when you're opening your music folder). This doesn't seem like a long time, but believe me it is. Perhaps this is because I had 10GB of music on the phone, but isn't this a music phone? That comes with 16GB storage?? But it wasn't just the music folder that took time to open. Any program that you clicked on simply took too long to just open and work. I don't remember the N82 being this slow...Third, the build quality was quite poor. The plastic battery cover is pried off. It doesn't have a latch. You literally pull it up with a finger nail and keep pulling until it comes off. The quality of the plastic used (and the whole phone is plastic) is really bad. There is room between the screen and the edges of the phone. It was accumulating dust after just a day after being in my pocket. The buttons at the bottom are in reality just one big button, and you press on either side if you want to end a call, take a call, or in the middle if you want to go back to the main menu--the button drooped on the left side.That being said, the phone wasn't all bad. First, the music player was excellent. The sound, with the 3.5mm jack, was truly very good. Even the headphones that came with it were excellent. The software to put your music (and pictures and videos) on the phone is excellent and very user friendly. The capacitive screen was responsive, and the call quality was excellent. It has a proximity sensor that locks the phone when its near your cheek so you don't inadvertently end a call. Also, the screen was bright and really nice, it came with a few fun games, and it wasn't too heavy or too light. Just perfect in terms of weight and form factor.So, to sum it upTHE GOOD1. Excellent call quality2. Excellent music quality3. Bright and beautiful screen; capacitive tech is very responsive.4. Software bundled with the phone is user friendly.THE BAD1. The camera is awful.2. The build quality is worse.3. The UI is very slow. The phone drags when you do just about anything.Sadly, a very slow phone with a very bad camera is not what I was looking for. I wanted a great camera, a fast phone, and an excellent mp3 player. I only got the excellent mp3 player!! I returned this phone and ended up going with a Sony Ericsson Aino. The difference is really unbelievable (but it costs much more too).

Symbian S60 5th Edition shows some upgrades in terms of practicality and functionality however the roots of it, remain the same: Solid, reliable multitasking platform.In terms of hardware, we have here one key factor of Nokia high end devices in the future, which took way to long to arrive. First Nokia Capacitive screen. For those who are not familiar with this concept, it is the same type of touch screen present in the world best seller iPhone. It makes the touch screen smooth and soft as silk where traditional resistive screens can turn tedious as you actually have to press it to obtain the response. The screen to me was in fact the main reason to purchase the X6-00 Instead of Nokia's flagship device; N97. A faster processor and more RAM would not hurt at all the device speed. The 1320 mAh battery could use an upgrade as well.When in your hand it feels solid and well built overall, a little loose over the edges though.The 3G connectivity is flawless, WiFi connectivity is very good, 5 MP camera is very good quality as well. My biggest disappointment is the Music Player sound. The settings are poor and not enough to obtain the sound quality I would expect from a device aimed for music lovers. Headsets are really comfy and sound as good as they can with the music software. (They are white, not black as shown on Amazon pictures)I am just waiting for the successor of the Nokia N900, with capacitive screen, Maemo 6, no moving parts and no bugs.

Some menu selections need one touch, others need two.  Menu system isn't the greatest, but workable.Battery life is very good with all the sensors turned off.  With them on, I can keep a charge for a little over a day.  Ovi maps are nice (GPS is still a cool toy).Bought for the standard headphone and USB connectors.  Computer sees the 16 Gig. as a flash drive.  Plays a heavily compressed movie fairly well.  It pixelates for about 5 seconds if I change the scene.  Screen doesn't show up too well in the sun (I live in S.C.).  Can change ringtones and background without using the internet or phone company (unlike my old Samsung).  Battery is easily accessible and cheap to replace.  Keypad took a little getting used to (touchscreen) and switching to other characters.  Wi-fi is great.  I can log on at the mall, bar, stores or at home.  You will need the headphones plugged in to recieve radio stations.  Headphones suck, but not as bad as Apple's.  USB cap doesn't fit very well.  At least the lint blows out.  Screen layout has limited changes.Camera is o.k. (it's a cell) and so is the video.  Didn't realize it had a small camera sensor on the other side, so you can see yourself on the display.I'd liked to have gotten a Droid or i-Phone, but this was within my price range.  No contract either.  Put my old SIM in and connected to AT&T;'s network.  No drops / good reception.  UNLOCKED!!!Aside from the GUI (1 vs. 2 taps) I really like this phone.

Its very simple and get the job done and it make writing proper letter's as written on a pc with less time.I love Radio so I was a little disappointed that I always have to put in the head set jack to receive signals and the fact that colour is white. I saw many argue about construction whether from China or not, it is well put together and yes the space between the plastic and the screen is a little bit open for dust, but yet the phone is small and doesn't look bulky when putting it in your pants to lime with the ladies or look like a video game. The built is a little classy. I think any one that is looking a for a phone for music taking photo's and always on the go then this phone is great. The battery life is long when only using it to talk mostly but playing games or using the GPS drains the battery quickly.

It takes time to accustom to the change in UI and to find where is connectivity, email and so on. I have been SE fan for 2 years. C905 screen has failed (turn off itself) after 1 year of usage and wireless is not working. No more Sony Ericsson and Sony proprietary media and charger and headphone connector.This phone, X6, has all the bells and whistles of a 5800, and N79, N95.I am with AT&T; and running on 3.5G. Web browsing is fast using both Wifi and 3.5G. Email, skype, and eBuddy are working flawlessly and very good on both wifi and 3.5G. The capacitive touchscreen is very accurate. The Contacts layout on the home screen is hugely useful and makes calling easier than ever. The 5MP camera with Carl Zeiss lens takes pictures as good as the 8MP C905. Able to switch to landscape mode easily and very fast after the firmware update within 1 sec.Make sure you download/update Ovi Map. I use it as an alternative when you are lost, traveling when without my Garmin GPS. It is pretty accurate. You could use the Lonely Planet features to find restaurant, entertainment and so on.Nokia's phone is made in China, not in Finland or Hungary.Cons: No xenon flash. Cannot use LED Flash as a flashlight -- can be useful during camping or blackout. It does not come with Bluetooth headset like the 32GB version. No expandable card storage. Please add SDHC on the phone for additional storage. The USB data comes with the phone is short -- 3 inches long.

The audio quality is very clear with the included earbud headphones (white colored stereo headset with mic), and the phone's call quality is as clear as any other Nokia I've owned so far.  It's simple to load music via drag-and-drop or via the Ovi Suite software on the PC. The capacitive touch screen is sensitive to light fingertip taps, but the processor seems a bit hesitant at times to respond, but nonetheless keeps things moving along adequately.  The X6 will not replace my Zune HD in terms of video playback and overall multimedia prowess, but it's good enough for times when I want to carry one device with me.  The autofocus 5 megapixel camera offers decent detail and nice colors for photos as long as you have a steady hand and allow the camera to focus properly before fully depressing the shutter button.  After unboxing the phone, I immediately downloaded the latest Ovi maps and was pleasantly surprised to find that it includes text-to-speech capabilities for the nav feature (not just general 'turn at the next right' commands, for example.)  I hope to try it out soon in a real-world navigation scenario soon.This is my first Nokia S60-Touch based device, and coming from the Nokia E51 and E71, I became comfortable with the OS menu structure fairly quickly.  For newcomers to S60, it might be a bit of a learning curve to find all the options and settings densely nested below the layers of menus. I was able to move all my contacts, calendar, notes, etc. from my E71 to the X6 all without using a PC by using the onboard Switch application, which automatically migrated all my user data via the Bluetooth connection.  It was an amazingly painless experience and a highly commendable feature. Compared to the E51 and E71, the X6's plastic, metal, and glass construction offers a solid, hefty feel in your hand, but the overall build quality is arguably lesser than an E-Series device.  Overall, the X6 is a fun, feature-rich S60 device with an interesting mix of capabilities; I hope to get as much mileage out of it as my previous Nokias.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very good unlocked and contract-free phone at a great price", "Author": "Animal", "ReviewID": "RJYWU4MKRDD5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nokia X6 is a very good phone all around. The call quality is superb, so it accomplishes its primary goal very well. feature-wise it has almost anything you would want from a phone (music, video, radio, GPS,...) all accessible from an excelent capacitive touch screen. It comes with a 3.5mm jack, meaning you can use your own headphones even though the included headphones are not bad and have imbeded controls. Definitely one of the best Nokia phones this side of the E series (E71/72).THE GOOD:========= - The 5MP camera takes good quality pictures for a phone (yes,this is not a dedicated 5MP digital camera). - The capacitive touch screen is very accurate and has the right sensitivity to provide an adequate resonse (although sometimes a bit delayed). - Great at organizing and playing both music and radio. - 16GB of provided storage. No expandable card storage but 16GB is enouh for my purposes. - Unlike other phones (Nokia included), comes with many languages pre-installed out of the box(Portuguese included).THE NO SO GOOD:=============== - Having to single-tap to select items in some menus and having to double-tap for the same purpose in others is annoying at first. With time however you do get used to it. - Plastic build materials make it so the X6 does not feel as as sturdy and durable as other phones. I keep all my phones inside a silicone protective case all the time so this is not an issue. - Switching between portrait and landscape modes takes time in some occasions, but I have not experienced extreme slowness as reported by some other reviewers. - Cannot open pdf files (out of the box at least).

The discounted sale price made me willing to buy.  I have had the phone for about a week.  I have a SonyEricsson W760 Walkman phone whose FM radio stopped working and whose charger contacts are becoming finicky.  This phone has an FM radio that works beautifully.  Yes, you must use a headphone since the wire then becomes the antenna; but you can use any standard headphone unlike with my Sony phone.I loaded some music on it and I am very happy not to have to carry an iPod.  I think the music sounds great on this phone after I played with the equalizer and other settings it has.  I just connected the phone to my PC via USB and used the mass storage option to connect and just dragged the music files into the phone since I only really listen to a couple hundred songs.  You must then refresh the library in the phone to see the songs (its in the manual).  I have had to play and tweak the phone; this thing is more like a computer than a basic phone.  I also downloaded the user's manual from the nokiausa website because the printed manual that comes with the phone is abbreviated.  You are going to have to play with the phone and I went onto the discussion boards on the Nokia website to learn more and see what problems people are having.I use the phone for personal use.  I don't want to pay for a data plan.  In fact, I disabled the AT&T; internet on my plan since I kept accidently hitting the internet button on my Sony phone so now I cannot accidently get online.  I only send a handful of text messages a month at most. But now I have a QWERTY keyboard on my phone for the occasional message I send on a phone that I didn't have to buy from AT&T; with a data plan.  I am happy with the capacitive (like the iPhone) touch screen which does not require a stylus.  Yes, the operating system sometimes requires two taps to open choices.I downloaded the Ovi Suite software (I did not use the included disc so I could get the latest software) onto my PC so that I could update the maps; must then connect the phone using the PC suite option in its USB menu.  Use the Ovi Suite software and NOT Nokia's older PC suite software.  That took some time and trial since I had to reboot the phone and download the US map twice before it worked right (I got a corrupted map message) and the updated mapping software.  I also had to try more than once to get the latest version of software onto the phone.  However, by setting up the phone to use ONLY its integrated GPS (disable A-GPS, disable Network based) and by downloading the maps onto my PC, I have a device with a functional GPS that I carry with me that costs me nothing to use.  It does take a while to acquire the satellite signal, but it does work.  So there you have it.  The approximately 1.5GB US map has points of interest and you can also download voice guidance, all for free when you use your PC and the Ovi Suite software.  Since the phone had 16GB of memory built in, you don't have to buy memory.  Note that there is no way to increase the memory storage capacity from the included 16GB.If you want the best smartphone, this is not it. If you want a simple phone, this is not it.

Good value, at a price of $240 from Amazon.Saw some reviews saying the X6 is slow.  Didn't have this problem.  I didn't use the disc that came in the box.  Make sure you use ovi suite to get the latest software update instead.  I struggled with this purchase against an android or iphone, but so far very happy with this choice.  Yes Sambian is old and this is not the latest and greatest smartphone.  But then you can't get free map updates worldwide wherever you go, and integrated GPS navigation on an android or iphone.  The GPS on android and iphones require network service, so you'll be out of luck if you're at a place without cell signal - probably when you most desparately need GPS guidance.  On the Nokia X6, you can use the GPS guidance in offline mode, and you won't be paying a fat data bill if you use it for a long road trip.  I have a Nuvi which we like, but this saves me from buying another Nuvi just to get fresh maps.  That being said, I haven't tried the GPS extensively, so it'll be interesting to see how this stacks up on our next road trip.Wifi works well and is fast, though it took a bit of fiddling to stop the phone from using 3G even after my home wifi connection is saved.

The graphic resolution is great, sound is crystal clear and the camera has an off the chart resolution, and touch screen is very sensitive; it can take some time to get used to. A detail to keep in mind when taking pictures is that the flash is really bright, so if there's a reflective surface like a metal, the camera will capture a white dot, this is a minor annoyance. The biggest drawback I noticed is that even without using a Bluetooth headset, the battery drains too fast, so you have to keep it charging more than with older models.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Iphone twist", "Author": "D.

I work with different smartphones everyday and i decided to get the X6 for several reasons, but mainly cause the convenient price/features.Let me tell you the most relevant after a month of use:The good side:The cost is around $300 10/2010(except some promos).Nokia Maps is perfect for me. Fast, accurate, with voice navigation and free worldwide.The capacitive screen works great.A decent 5MP cam with flash.16GB internal.The box accessories (car holder,etc.)The bad side:Symbian. This software is old and not cause my version (i have the last available) the soft design and conception is like 2 years old if we compare with another players (android,iOS..). I found SPB Shell in the Ovi Store that make really better my relation with this phone. Without it, i would be hating it.Another oldie, is the music player. It's awful and not friendly.And you won't have an udpate to a new Symbian 3 version (like the N8 got) It's not the Nokia style.But like i said, you'll have a nice feature phone with an old software (SPB thanks for the help!). Nice size (not big as a 4\" screen), good battery life (of course 3g/wifi/music can kill it in a day) and a lot of internal space.I had in my hands the N8 too, with Symbian 3. Forget it, nothing relevant. Of course it's better than this X6 but i'wont pay $550 (10/2010) for it even crazy. If you have that money for a smartphone, check Android/iOS devices.

The music player is loud and clear, the capacitive touch screen is very responsive, gps is phenomenal it's works as well as the one I have in my car.

After six months of usage it had a problem with lock-slider may be because it fell on the floor a bunch of times - vibration on a call or alarm is so powerful that it just slides off the table if I did not pick it up. I brought it to a Nokia repair center in NYC and they fixed it in one day. So the Nokia warranty worked alright for me. It has been working OK ever since. I said OK, because the operating system reboots occasionally although it did not cause much trouble for me.I bought this phone specifically because I spend a third of a year outside of the US so I needed an unlocked phone without a contract. At the time I bought it other alternatives like Android phones cost much more, and it also came with offline maps which was a great advantage. Also its battery lasts for four-five days which is an advantage if you travel.The disadvantages of this phone now are that it has an outdated interface and it is not supported by many applications, for example, Amazon audible does not support it. So if I were buying a new phone I would've looked into Android or Win 7 phones (wouldn't get Nokia phones because they are not really supported by many services in the US)", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone for the money", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3IJU5GLFTRL46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using a Nokia E71 and decided to upgrade to a touch screen with full multi-media capabilites. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.UNBOXING: My phone came with Nokia's Car Kit which was a nice surprise. The phone bracket can be placed on the dash for using the GPS when flying down the highway. A car charger AND home charger are included along with some fancy headphones. The only accessory I needed to add was a case. Otter Box makes a great case for the X6.SET-UP: Wonderfully easy to set-up. I inserted my SIM card and plugged in the charger then off to the races. Initial set-up is quick, easy, and intuitive. Within minutes my contacts, email, 3G, and internet were running fluidly.TOUCH SCREEN: It takes a bit to get used to the screen, especially coming from a tactile keyboard on my old E71. Some actions require a double-tap while others are single taps. There is a slight color change on the buttons letting you know that a second tap is needed. If your impatient and keep hitting the buttons the X6 will lock-up. Patience, young grasshopper, patience.CALLS: No dropped calls so far with good sound clarity. The screen automatically disables itself so your cheek won't activate anything. Voice dialing is a breeze to set-up.INTERNET: Initally the X6 was somewhat slow using the built in web browser, but then I downloaded the Opera browser. Whoa Nelly! The Opera browser flies along with proper 3G speeds. Web pages can be zoomed in/out if that site is not mobile ready.MUSIC/VIDEO: The X6 has 16gb memory on board. More than enough for my music and videos. The sound is somewhat \"tinny\" when played through the speakers but the included headset makes up for it. Videos play without any chop and the screen resolution is wonderful.A-GPS: You will need a data plan to use the GPS. The GPS only took one minute for initial set-up and locking. The OVI Maps are okay, but installing Google Maps allows you to sync with Google and keep all your starred favorites. The Ovi Maps didn't show my street, but Google did.BLUETOOTH: My Plantronics Voyager Pro paired to the X6 within seconds. No connection issues.WIFI: Again, the Wifi worked immediately. I tested the Wifi at Borders, Starbucks, McDonalds, and the local park. No issues with scanning.CAMERA: 5mp is decent for a cellphone and the X6 doesn't slouch one bit. The Carl Zeiss lens helps, but you'll still need decent lighting. The video is adequate but nowhere near HD quality.IMPRESSION: Excellent value for the money, especially since the X6 is unlocked. No issues surfing the web, listening to music, taking pictures or watching videos.

It is not as big or nice as the iPhone, and the screen looks below average when compared to the latest Evo.The worst thing about this phone is the OS, it uses the dated Symbian OS. It is slow, and has a very ugly interface. Also, there are not as many applications available as there are in Android or in the App Store.On the plus side, the phone has very good reception. I usually have better signal than my peers, even if we are on the same network and we are next to each other.Another bright point on the cell phone is the GPS Navigation App, I wouldn't say it is better than others, but it is free and it does not consume any data from you carrier. It is a very good GPS for your car and you do not need to pay any extras for it.So basically, if you have the money for an iPhone, get it, it is a much better cell phone. If you can get a good Android phone at the same price, I would prefer the Android phone, you have access to more apps and the interface is better and more responsive.

I realize apple os and droid are the latest and most advanced and everyone's gotta have it but I didnt want to spend a small fortune on a high end, battery draining, data intensive phone when i dont have a data plan.I mostly use my phone as a phone, making calls, texting, and listening to a bunch of music. I have used pretty much every feature the phone has to offer as well and can def say it has its shortcomings. For calls, its awesome and sound quality is great the proximity sensor however does not always do a great job keeping the touch screen disabled when you have it up to your ear. This caused the onscreen speakerphone button to be accidentally pressed sometimes when your on a call which is not always good.Texting overall is okay but requires too many steps with all the tapping to get into the text entry field and then the separate window that it goes into where you actually create the message is pretty lame. The box they give you is just too small to see anything you have typed beyond a few words! The music player is fairly basic and takes a few seconds to start up. It does the job tho and the scrolling of hundreds of tracks is no problem. There is even an equalizer to adjust custom sound profiles which is nice. The two loudspeakers actually put out pretty good sound and are fairly loud playing music over them. Battery life is good (except for issue i experienced mentioned below) and will normally last two days between charges with average use.So far the 5.0 mega pixal camera is the best I have personally used on a phone so far so no complaints here. The auto focus & dual LED flash is def helpful for indoor and low light shots a overall picture quality is pretty good. Videos are only alright but nothing special. You can also do minor editing to pics and use the LED as a flashlight with the correct app.I used the GPS a few times and it seems to do the job fine and never had an issue getting directions and picked up my location quickly. The Ovi store is nothing that great at all compared to apple and droids and only has a handful of useful apps so i wont go there. The standard internet browser is quite crappy and freezes up sometimes plus it will straight shut down on you without warning if a page gets to complex to render. The phone lacks memory Its sad:(Opera mini is def better for this phone for sure! the phone's wifi reception while out of the house is not very good however and you have to be fairly close to the access point for a signal good enough to go online. (although it does work better when im at home using my own router)Now for some stuff that is just downright BAD about this phone: Mostly build quality>Battery cover- Its absolutely horrible and cheap! poor fit and requires lots of pushing inward to get the tiny clips to click into place and makes noises where it fastens in with the phone body. I hate it.-When you grip the phone with a relative firm grip it creaks all over and feels cheap (metal accent on one side of the screen is not even flush against it)- Phone lock slider on the side is a small, cheap plastic switch that actually rattles when you slightly shake the phone- UI is sluggish at times and double tapping to select stuff does get annoying, Occasional freezing- accelerometer screen rotation sensor sucks and cant ever decide which screen mode it wants to be in and glitches out sometimes. I got tired of it and just turned it off.- In the few months i have owned it the phone has somehow died at night when not in use. The battery was not even below half full, it was sitting off the charger and the next day the phone is off and wont turn on. I plug it in an apparently the battery was stone dead! Nothing had even been running on it (apps, wifi, gps, music) it just straight died. This happened twice on two separate occasions.So i guess if your looking into just a simple, unlocked touchscreen phone for calls and texting with music playback, limited web browsing (mostly mobile sights) GPS and staying organized than this phone is decent and should meet your needs. If you dont mind the above issues and are able to deal with that sort of thing. I myself may have to move on to something else later but can manage for now with what i got.

The maps are crisp and the voice direction is with street names.  This totally blows away traditional GPS as you can look up online content in the maps application to get the most recent.  Free maps for life with traffic!4) Customization - you can set mailboxes, when they sync and what should phone allow to go online versus not.  You can set very specific connectivity settings, if you want to minimize data.  You can also pretty much customize the home screen a couple of different ways, though short cuts are limited to four.  There are also nice themes available to cosmetically enhance the looks of the phone.5) Browser - the native nokia browser is OK.  Loads up quick and displays pages quite nicely.6) Ability to see open apps and shut them down from the menu screen. The battery definitely lasts much longer if you know what you are running.  The ability to multitask and switch between applications is really great, except you bump up against the phone's hardware limits with little warning (memory full message, application shut downs).  However I haven't found that to be too much trouble.The negatives;1) Weird plastic construction.  Its hard to pop the battery cover in place properly, usually requiring a lot of squeezing and manuvering.  The usb port cover does not set in flush with the top and seems raised.  if you were to hold the phone tightly, you can hear the phone body squeeze against itself, like you were holding two cheap pieces of plastic together.2) Accelerometer - the phone cant make up its mind as to which orientation it should be in?  very annoying if you are trying to just browser the net while slouching on a couch or just have the phone lay flat on the table.  You can turn it off, but thats just means you are stuck with the T9 keyboard, plus having to hold it.3) No angry birds.  Seems like S60 5th edition is a dead or dying platform.  Not confident that it will get much attention from the good folks at nokia beta labs either.4) Annoying to tap to see it go nowhere even when the item you tapped is highlighted.  what were they thinking?  User interface in general does not appear to be well thought.  Also, what is with all the tapping needed to get to a keyboard?  You have to tap the page, then the text box for data entry.  Its very annoying.5) It claims to have a 3.2 inch screen.  While it may be technically true, its nowhere as big as the old iphone 3G because its much thinner.  You will feel disappointed if you thought you were getting the same size as an iphone.Overall - Good practical phone and GPS.
