After a while the phone cleared up the issue and I was able to get it activated. The phone itself was in very good condition, and worked amazingly, I even got 4G in my home which is normally a dead spot.  Overall very satisfied.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "these are hit or miss phones", "Author": "itmypc", "ReviewID": "RGWT7JIO2SVXB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have bought 2 of these phones.  One was replaced through motorola for an unresponsive screen.  They fixed it sent it back and the screen was defective on the LCD.  Sent it back again.  They lost it the second time and sent a new device. The phone is the balls when it works great features.  If you over use it (had is connected to a 50' TV for about 2 hours) it fried the board and it wouldn't turn on. Motorola will honor the replacement of the device.  But they are slow and stupid. Again it is a great phone when it works. But I have had several of them fail on me. I am a heavy user(computer tech). Good luck with it.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A few minor hardware and network issues worth noting...otherwise a good phone.", "Author": "Emile Mulder", "ReviewID": "R2XUGXGGLA1023", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone came as promised, when promised.  It was in new condition (still had plastic on it, still in box and everything, no scratches anywhere).  Regarding this phone specifically, I like it for the physical keyboard, and if that's important to you and you're on Sprint, then there's really no choice.  The physical keyboard itself is comfortable and the phone is fast enough for my needs.I have two minor complaints with my experience:1 - the physical keyboard has a tendency to type double letters.  You press the letter once, then two letters are entered.  I found that pressing down all the letters hard resolved this somewhat, but it still happens occasionally, and it's annoying.  I think this is an issue with the phone model, as I had an identical phone, and this was an issue with it as well.  My other phone also had no vibrate feature (the hardware that makes it vibrate was broken from day 1).  I've read online that this can be an issue with these phones.  This particular phone didn't have that issue, but it's worth being aware of.2 - there were a few headaches with activation - this is a Sprint issue.  Once you activate, you may find that you can now place calls, but can't receive any calls or text.  This also happened with my other phone.  You'll have to call Sprint tech support so they can resolve their network issues.  It's a quick call, so no huge deal, just worth knowing about.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "this items is okay!", "Author": "THW", "ReviewID": "R1NDHGC7OLJW6Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "so far my daughter love this purchase, I tried to give her my IPhone and she refuse :-0 so yes this was a great buy!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "not a good phone", "Author": "Mark Twain \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R3BXBCA2BG0RNH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not a good phone.This phone is not a good phone.I would not buy this phone.
