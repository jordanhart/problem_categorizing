It is by far the best Blackberry yet! A lot of phone memory to download all the music i want, plus it is compatible with the 16GB memory card i got so i can download music videos and pictures and all the apps my heart desires. I am able to use the internet as if i was on a computer because you have tabs. For example, i can be shopping on amazon, looking at pictures of cute puppies, checking for a words definition, looking up people on wikipedia & updating my facebook all at the exact same time. It is also a very good size. I thought it was going to be bulky but it was excellent. I love having the option of touch screen & buttons. Also, the camara and video camara are amazing quality! I've havent seen better pictures on a camara. I love it, i love it, i love it. My first Torch had an unfortunate accident at the beach (fully submerged) and i immediately purchased another! :) *They told me that if it had been fresh water, they could have fixed it..*", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Increible!", "Author": "alejandro simonds \"asimonds\"", "ReviewID": "R1PW5ILMR73ZYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Estoy muuy contento de haber adquirido este equipo, fue recibido en el tiempo exacto con sus caja y accesorios completos, muy responsables los recomiendo al maximo", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "exelent product!! arrived on time!!!", "Author": "lu23", "ReviewID": "R1FMQ1U2YDE7H0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love my new cellphone it is exelent it also arrived on time... even earlier!! it is beautiful and it came perfect no 1 scratch and with a car accessory and a screen protector!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "its okay...only okay!", "Author": "Lester Kelsick", "ReviewID": "R3M1OGD5KY2WMX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the touch screen keypad only appears sometimes...paint started to chip after 6mths...good memory ..easy to use ...the case i got was to small so watch out", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Gustavo", "ReviewID": "ROVGDXGE4ODMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a very funtional phone, easy to use, came new without any problems or defects (very important) and with his 4GB memory card, very good!!!", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "Blackberry 9800 Torch", "Name": "Blackberry Torch 9800 Unlocked 3G / 5MP/ 4GB Card / WIFI / GPS Smartphone AT&T Unlocked US Version (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vi8yjnOHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004UBOEXO"}}
