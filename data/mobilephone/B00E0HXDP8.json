It was solid in the way that Apple hardware is solid and no one else is. But the screen was just a bit big for me and I couldn't reach all the way cross the screen. I traded in the larger one for this one. I lost some cash but got a phone that I really love the size.Everything about this phone is perfect except it's not the screamer that the full sized One is. Expect a bog down here or there on heavy processes-- that being said, it's a great phone once configured and updated and I'm happier with this than almost all other android options today.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty and Powerful!!", "Author": "sunnyoye", "ReviewID": "R3MVK742ZIMTKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HTC One Mini (M4) is a great phone esp if you want a sleek and premium feel to your phone. I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I have an HTC One M7, which is amazing as well but this phone is the best that I could find with a smaller screen (which was one of the most important criteria for my wife). Its easy to handle, less bulky, and still has all the goodness of HTC One M7.The seller (HeavyDuty Electronics) was awesome to ship the phone on priority when I contacted for a quick delivery. All in all, a great experience!", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "An incredible device", "Author": "An\u00edbal Oyola", "ReviewID": "RCTKE7CZLWXBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great cell phone, amazing graphics and operativity, i used Iphone but totally i prefer the HTC one mini and the Android system", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "The \"Mini\" is a little larger than an iphone.", "Author": "Skylark65", "ReviewID": "R18UKAS6Z0KSR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little phone.

There is no way to describe it besides THE BEST. The only thing that I don't like about it is the battery. The battery is not very good for all day heavy use, but it will get you through the day as long as you don't use it ALL day and use the power saver option. It is smaller than the original HTC One, but not by much. I don't really see it as \"mini.\" Many people complain about the camera, which is not a concern for me because it's actually very good and it has a lot of fun effects. If you want a GREAT camera, then buy an actual camera. It's great to quickly capture those important moments. A thing that I love on this phone is Google Now. Totally check it out, it's such a treat to have. The graphics on this phone absolutely blow me away and so do the speakers. All of my friends and family are really jealous of my Mini, even when they have awesome phones.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid phone", "Author": "William Colucci", "ReviewID": "R2PWUKM3DM2BV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fit in hand better then anything else.

This phone turned out to be good replacement. It has been three weeks so far.Pros:1. The phone can fit in your hand.2. The phone has \"Beats\" sound. The voice quality is much better than other phones.3. There is slow mode in camera.4. Android is not bad compare to iOS6 in terms user friendliness. One has to learn to customize.5. The power supply is standard mini USB.6. It is $100+ cheaper than iPhone 5S.Cons:1. The phone looks average. I could not find black color.2. Some area on glass is wasted for \"Home\",\"Previous\" button.3. The phone is little bigger than iPhone 5.4. In very bright sunlight, it is hard to see screen.5. Customizing Android is initially little tricky.6. The camera is around 4 MP which HTC calls it UltraPixels versus latest iPhone has 8+ MP.7.
