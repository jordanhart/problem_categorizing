Anyway, I think the touch sensitivity of it is hard, I feel  I have to press prettty hard to get it to scroll or to \"click\" on something, but it may just be me since ive never had a touch phone before. Also, the keyboard is also harder to type the keys when ur texting then my old phone. Other than that, I like it for my first touch, and I got it for  a pretty good value.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone screen blank (not working)", "Author": "babdu", "ReviewID": "RH4VUUEAYBZSW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The screen went blank after working well for about a month.

I will write it with bullet points so you don't feel as if you're reading a book, but secretly you will indeed get a short book.-Since a lot of the menus and buttons to use this phone are on the touch screen the whole touch screen goes bananas if I spill one tiny droplet of water on it. I mean, sink spray, rain, pocket sweat, you name it. You now can no longer unlock the phone from the screen, hitting any button has no response or it does a different function completely (ex: sliding the screen)-If the text message inbox fills up then this phone tells me this - as in it wants me to delete some a.s.a.p. - before I continue doing anything. So it pops up an alert letting me know. If I ignore it then it pops up again and again every minute. So when I'm trying to delete said messages it reminds me again in the middle of choosing which messages to keep or delete, interrupting me and not only making me check a box next to a message I wanted to keep, but also clearing my checked boxes up to that point.-The touch screen is the most unreliable part of this touch screen phone. It doesn't respond like an iPhone, or barely responds correctly at all. *Unlock *Unlock, \"Oh! That's right! I gotta get the right angle and hold it!\" *Unlock. \"Oops! I lost it!\" *Unlock *Unlock *Unlock *Open. Finally.-When I want to hit the button to check my text messages the \"web\" button gets in the way. Which is annoying not only to people without an internet plan, but people who WANT TO CHECK THEIR MESSAGES!-This phone doesn't have a very good camera, it's only 2 megapixels and it can't even zoom in if I'm on the \"best\" quality.-Deleting pictures is annoying as ever if I try to delete one by one. I hit the picture itself to get the options bar, and for some reason it goes away. Hit for the bar, goes away, bar, *stays* scroll to the delete option and again it goes away. I repeat this process over and over and finally I kill myself- I mean I get lucky enough that it is locked on screen because of the \"sure you want to delete?\" notification popping up.-The creators made the photos slide on their own for some reason - on their own. As in, \"Oh this is a nice photo!\" then it slides over five photos showing possibly private or bad pics. So it's like really? Who put that feature in and why? Why did they make it so I can't turn it off?  It's annoying, even trying to send or delete one and it slides away and goes and goes until I'm 100 pics away and have to back all the way out restarting at the menu.-In the pictures' menu option there is a button called \"Send to My Album\" which gets in the way all the time, since some designer put it at the top. This then sends a photo I didn't intend to be sent to some online album that I never signed up for or am ever going to use.-The rubber case I can buy to \"protect\" this phone comes in two pieces but I only use the back part instead of both sides. Mostly because with the top half on, the top row of keys are covered so I can't text. Grrrrreat design -phone and cover. Also said top part doesn't even have a screen cover (scratches) making the whole thing just for drop damage I guess.-Also another bad thing on the rubber case is that the little tabs that keep it snapped to your phone wear out letting in dirt, making it fall off all the time.-The menus aren't big enough to be able to control; the \"floating\" buttons/apps on screen don't stay where I want them and are hard to place and move them anyways.-After powering it up and finally showing the regular home screen I shouldn't have to then wait even longer to look at MY messages. They're already on my phone, I've seen them before. It shouldn't have to connect to the service to show me things that should be there right then.- Another annoyance, as usual, it forbids me to delete the pre-stored ringtones, wallpapers, and games/apps that have either are dumb that will never be used, or are just trials that want to pay for them. It would save a lot of space getting rid of this garbage.-Speaking of hitting things many times before getting a good response, I have to use the exact pressure, have the exact angle and hit the screen at the exact place 100 times before the alert \"picture delivered\" goes away. This by far is one of the most annoying problems.-In the calls menu when I choose to delete all phone calls but one (an important one or two) it always deletes just that one and leaves the rest. This is usually the point where I punt my phone off of a highway overpass.-When trying to send a message to ten people (the max amount) it forgets its own count, and stops check marking before I reach 10 recipients and telling me that it cannot add anymore. Then back and the ready to send menu it gets confused and has some of the names I chose twice and some not even there.Now in its old age, either 2 or 3 years old, it wasn't turning off after locking - wasting battery.  Then recently it locks and unlocks repeatedly, making me have to rip out the battery to reset it to even use it. It doesn't help that the unlock button no longer works, as well as a number of letter keys. It also likes to jump to random places in a text message and continue my message typing into other words and sentences. And with space, and backspace being among the keys that don't work, it begs me to end its life by sledgehammer.If you like frosted flakes, noticed the Anchorman reference, hate this phone, are looking to buy a new phone, liked that I compiled this information over years to then post it to many sites about an old phone that no one cares about anyway, then thumb this up to help others.Thank you very much-PatbackP.S.
