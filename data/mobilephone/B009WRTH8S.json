The keys are easy to use and the screen is a decent size. If you are a frequent texter, this phone may be ideal.But if texting isn't really your thing, you may not be super fond of this phone because most of the other things about it are sub-par. For example, the screen on the front to see who is calling, or to scan through the address book is very difficult to read. The buttons on the front have zero texture, and the phone goes to sleep frequently so you have to keep pressing the flat front where the buttons light up hoping that it will sense it and not go to sleep while you are trying to press them. If it does go to sleep, the front stops lighting up and you will need to press the 'hold' button on the side. Hanging up a call is also difficult because the phone wants to lock/go to sleep before you can hit the 'end call button'. Many times I have had to open the phone just to hang up, when it had been closed for the entire call. Better hurry if you are trying to hang up before an answering machine kicks on!", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "myranda", "ReviewID": "R31R0JGFSU4C6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my husband absolutely loves it. the battery life is amazing and he couldn't be more satisfied. wouldnt trade it for anything else", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "An \"OK\" Phone But Not Exceptional", "Author": "Nostalgicdad", "ReviewID": "R2Z1X5NMV25HIP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is an ok phone for what I need it to do. I am old school. I need a phone for talking and texting and that's pretty much it. It does both and I have no major problems with that. But I do have a problem with a couple of things.The battery does not hold a charge long enough, and it is supposed to be a brand new phone and battery.I never turn my phone off and it will only hold a charge for maybe a week,tops.The phone's shape and design, does not allow a case to stay on properly.The top part of the case has one corner that will not go down and snap on at all. The case does stay on, but the one corner that won't snap on,causes the phone case to pop off sometimes. Poor design. The keypad is flat and it is nearly impossible to type a message without hitting other letters that you don't want to hit. I have to hit my back/delete button all the time to correct the spelling because of the flat \"Qwerty\" keypad.Plus, there are too many steps that you have to go through to pull up a name in the contacts just to call them or send them a text. That procedure could have been shortened. I do not take pictures with any phone, so I cannot comment on the quality of any pics. I may use it for pics but for now I don't. I use a digital camera for that.One good thing for me is, I do surveys and build up points that redeem for gift card codes here on Amazon, and I didn't have to pay not one red cent for this phone. Gift card codes paid for it from the surveys I do. All in all, is this a good phone? Yes, it is and is it worth what I paid for it? Yes, I think so. Would I buy this same phone again if I needed another phone? Probably so, but only through gift card codes so that I would not pay any cash for it. It's a good phone, but battery life isn't as good as it should be and the design is flawed in the keypad and the shape which isn't good for a protector case. If you need just a basic phone that allows calls and texting, and other features that you may or may not use, this one will do that. Oh and one last thing; this phone does not have a USB port to allow it to be connected to computer to download better ringtones.On my previous phone I was able to download ringtones through a USB port into the limited memory. I had some Disney World ringtones which was cool. This phone has to take a micro memory card, which is a flaw in itself, because that requires a purchase of a micro card. Phone does not come with micro card.The ringtones are quite cheesy and I am stuck with them until I get a memory card.The battery charger will only plug into an electrical outlet. My previous phone had the option of using electrical outlet or removing adapter and plugging it into computer. This phone has no charging options. Another flaw in its design.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "Chet Baker", "ReviewID": "RZFXEWVQQI8P9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice little phone!

It is tiny, has a very attractive design with fully functional keyboard inside and responsive bright LED-lit dial pad on the outer side. The outer panel has good sunlight visibility.It's a smart phone with 3G capability, GPS, camera, music player, bluetooth and other bells and whistles. All of that is probably working smoothly for AT&T;, but for T-mobile, one needs to jump through some hoops to make it to recognize the network (however, calls go through just fine). Quick online search easily reveals the necessary settings for T-mobile. So overall, this is a good, well designed, functional device, very pleasant to hold in hand, with responsive controls and beautiful displays.Cons:The manual is printed in such tiny letters that one needs a magnifying glass to read it. The pdf file for the manual can be downloaded from the web from Pantech site. Also, manual states that the phone is powered by holding \"HOLD\" button - which is not true. It is powered on and off by holding \"Hang up\" button, either on the outer dialing pad, or inside.The rear cover, however, is a different story. It's a tiny piece of flimsy plastic, and does not fit. I spent enough time trying to align it so it snaps into place, but it never does - tiny tabs are misaligned so only one side snaps, and the other is not. I guess that's why there are so many complains about rear cover falling off. Seems like a manufacturing defect. What a bummer - to design a nice, functional phone and provide it with a poorly fitted back cover.
