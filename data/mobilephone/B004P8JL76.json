{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome, cost effective phone", "Author": "Robert A.", "ReviewID": "RKMW024S71W19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I have had this phone for about 4 months now and figure I would write my first ever Amazon review about it. I bought it mainly because I am currently studying abroad in Australia and needed a sim card phone since I'm usually on Verizon when I am in the states. Anyways, here goes my review:Talking:Does everything you need it to do. Speakers are crisp and clean and I haven't had trouble hearing who I'm talking to. Neither has the person I'm talking to had trouble hearing what I've been saying as long as I have service. Clear call quality, and I guess that's all you can really say about it.Texting/Keyboard:Great QWERTY keyboard, but I figure that for people with big hands the buttons may be too small. They're perfectly fine for me but took like a week or so to get used to since I had a bigger QWERTY keyboard before, but for the small thin size of the phone, the QWERTY keyboard is definitely effective. The buttons are very tactile and reactive and I haven't had much trouble with it after a week of getting used to it. It can separate texts into conversations between people, rather than listing out the received/sent texts in the order they were received/sent. Usually its rare to find a feature like that in cheap phones and its definitely a plus. There is a dedicated text button on the front that makes getting to your inbox really simple. Overall, a great texting phone.Internet:It has a decent browser considering it isn't a typical smartphone. If you expect/want to browse and browse like on an iPhone or Android phone, this phone is not for you. I usually quickly use it to google locations or find quick answers to questions and its perfect for that.Apps:It has a small Nokia app store included and there are some good apps. Don't expect a large variety but there are simple apps like Facebook and Whatsapp that are definitely useful. With my plan I get unlimited social network usage, so Facebook doesn't eat up my data and it's perfect for being here in Australia because its like I can text friends back home using facebook messages. The facebook app does pretty most of anything you can do on the website and its simple to use. There are a few other apps like facebook chat, games etc. but I haven't used those quite extensively.Battery Life:This phone has the best battery life I've ever seen. The battery lasts for at least a week for me, and I'm texting quite a bit, going on facebook, listening to music, etc. No doubt better than most phones in terms of life length.Music Player:The phone has a built in micro SD card slot allowing you to upload photos/music to your phone. I haven't tried photos but I've filled a 16 gb micro SD card with music and I use this phone as my everyday music player. While the interface for the music player is somewhat slow, it plays music great. Unfortunately it doesn't have quick scrolling so when I want to find, for example, an artist that starts with \"R\" I have to scroll all the way down to R rather than being able to quick scroll, so with large music libraries that is my biggest complaint. The music playback seems better than my iPod though and the player is capable of displaying album artwork and the typical things like artist, album, song name and song length. You can also create playlists on the go. While not the best interface, its definitely usable and I've gotten used to it.Menus/Operating System:Nokia has created a simple menu system. The phone isn't the fastest so it takes a bit longer to get through menus compared to a higher end more expensive phone but I guess that is expected. Otherwise, everything is laid out sensibly and I haven't had much trouble navigating the settings, apps, texts and everything else.Email:Another great thing about this phone is that you can link multiple email accounts to it and get instant notification when you receive a new email. I was able to link 3 different email accounts to it within a matter of minutes.Camera:The camera is just a simplistic 0.3 Megapixel camera so you shouldn't expect great quality out of it. I don't take many pictures with it anyway, but if you're looking for a phone to replace your point and shoot camera, this phone is not for you. I'm not going to complain much about the camera anyways because for what I'm using it for I don't need a great camera.Final thoughts:For the $75 I paid for this phone, it definitely was worth it. Unfortunately one downside is that it does not include Wifi access but if you aren't a huge data user like me, its something you can live without. Its has great call quality, an effective QWERTY keyboard for texting, and if you are looking for a \"simple\" non-smart phone that borrows smart-phone features for a fraction of the cost its definitely a good choice. It would be perfect for just calling and texting, but has added features if you want a bit more.Overall, its a great phone and I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone for Those w/o a Data Plan", "Author": "Kinetix50 \"---kinetix50\"", "ReviewID": "R1990O28381Q1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great for people who want an awesome, full-featured phone but don't have a 3G plan. I don't have one, and I just wanted a phone that would be good for texting people and playing music. The screen is nice and bright, and provides excellent visibility in sunlight. Since this phone is part of Nokia's \"X\" series, it has a lot of emphasis on the music playing aspect of mobile phone use. I must say, the media player is stellar. The sound quality is great, it supports many codecs, and there's even a 5 band custom equalizer (which, when tuned just right, can make this phone sound amazing). The phone only comes with 55 mb of onboard storage, the this is easily and cheaply expandable because it sports a MicroSD card slot. I picked up an 8GB micro sdhc card for twelve bucks on Amazon.com (Kingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4/8GB). This phone is unlocked so once you put your SIM card in, you're ready to go. I've had no problems with connections or anything, and the call quality seems great. The only two problems I have with it is that there's no Wi-Fi (however, most phones with wi-fi are smartphones, which most carriers require a data plan for), and that the buttons are kind of loud when they're pressed down. But overall, this phone totally deserves 5 stars, and it's comes with the classic Nokia quality that you'd expect. I would also recommend getting a case for it (Amzer AMZ90723 Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia X2-01 - Black - Frustration-Free Packaging).", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Pedro Gil A", "ReviewID": "RXIQ9ZEY18TKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the phone to seller \"Amazon \" and had no problem with the shipment.It is an excellent option because the features it offers, the price-quality-properties is very good, for a person who requires a good phone backed by one of the best companies like Nokia it is best that you can find at this point. I love the QWERTY keyboard and the fact that it is a relatively new product launched in 2010.The phone is fully unlocked, just inserted my SIM card and start using it without problems.The only downside is it does not include the data cable (mini USB) for connection to PC, cable however is a very economical and surely we all have at home or work.I am very satisfied with the product.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone for Price, MMS Working on AT&T;", "Author": "SteveBaugh", "ReviewID": "R28HXH2Y3EV5HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the cheapest unlocked phones I could find on Amazon, and it's worth much more than $90.  I'm currently using this phone on the AT&T; in the US, and to be honest, the service is slightly better than my old Samsung phone.MULTIMEDIA MESSAGING WORKS ON AT&T.;  It took some setting up, and the people at the AT&T; store were absolutely unhelpful, but just google how to set it up on this phone, and once you find the recommended settings, it just takes some looking around through various menus in the phone in both the phone/connectivity settings and the messaging settings to find where to enter the right info.  There's no one menu for all the multimedia messaging settings you need, but keep looking and fiddling around, and you'll figure it out.The phone itself is pretty fast and I don't have any complaints about the software. The conversations feature with messaging is also incredibly useful.Overall, for the price, this is one of the better phones I've seen that doesn't require a smartphone plan, and it looks great too.

I just wanted 3 things: a good quality reliable PHONE that I could make and receive calls on - I know, right?  a qwerty keyboard for texting and quality mp3/music function.  That's IT - And this phone delivers all 3 beautifully.  I received it on time, in excellent condition, and pretty much just stuck my sim card and memory card in and was off and running. Even the I-phone freaks in my family are fans! What more can I say? I would absolutely recommend this product.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does all the basics well w/workarounds (downloaded apps)", "Author": ".", "ReviewID": "RY4WBXZV1RQZG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are tons of phone options today but aside from blackberry, there seem to be fewer and fewer with qwerty keyboards and not many available in the under $100 range. If you are like me, then you don't want to invest in a $400 phone which may not last, may break, may get lost or stolen - which is what happened to my previous two phones (bought within the last year).If you are looking for a basic blackberry kind of phone that has a qwerty keyboard for text and email w/ a decent calendar/appt/note taking software. This is your phone. In the under $100 range this is probably the best thing going on. The software is good. The speaker is solid. The keyboard works well and is easy to get used to. The keys are the right size. Its just a good all around basic phone. Much better quality than the samsung phones in the range like the gravity phones which are slower (processor wise), cannot run any independent apps, have annoying keyboards and mediocre calendars. I know because I had a couple of them. I had the gravity-t for a while. It was much slower and limited your number of saved texts, took a while to load email messages, had an annoying browser, mediocre speaker and was just mediocre on several other counts.The only major flaw with this phone is the email which though claims to work with gmail, kept taking a long time to log into the account and then would not let you view the new messages. Also, the browser did not work. Those are big flaws but I found a great workaround. There is an independent gmail for mobile app available for download which can be used on this phone and is SUPERFAST. And I am using the Edge network. Not 3G or 4G bec T-mobile and I assume all other carriers don't allow unlocked phones to use their 3G/4G networks. The biggest issue with speed as far as phones go, it seems to me, is well written software which doesn't require tons of bits or processing power to carry out. Also, the opera mobile version which is also superfast and excellent as a phone browser, downloaded, installed and was running in mins. The fact that this phone can run these apps so smoothly puts it in the smartphone category and makes it a great buy at $80.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works in the States (have not tried abroad yet) UPDATE Kenya and Nepal too!", "Author": "iaeinekind \"iaeinekind\"", "ReviewID": "R1YDOJPIL55RV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it has a qwerty keyboard, fast 2G internet capability, and is quad-band for use abroad.

It's a good phone.", "Author": "Lionel Williams", "ReviewID": "R2RLCFVJXWBODZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I messed up my android recently, and I started using an old flip-phone with the painfully ancient T9 function. After about 2 months of agony, I ran to Wal-Mart to look for a decent \"pay as you go phone\". What's nice about T-Mobile's \"pay as you go's\", I can simply place my sim card in it and use it regularly. All I was really looking for was a qwerty board. I can take T9 anymore. I saw the Nokia X2. It didn't seem to feature much, but it had a qwerty. I bought it with really low expectations. Boy, was I wrong about this phone. The battery life is amazing. I literally charged the phone on Monday and didn't recharge again until 6 days later!!! After adding the data plan to my phone, I am now able to access my work e-mails! For some reason my \"almighty\" android phone couldn't do that. It doesn't have 3G, but honestly I really don't miss it. The web browser and graphics are somewhat basic, which allow for faster web surfing.If you don't buy the phone expecting it to be an I-Phone or Droid, you will be pleased. One thing that would have made this perfect, would be a basic GPS function.

Excellent reception, call quality and battery life. It's a steal at this price. It has good looks even though it may not look so good in the picture.This phone is a quadband phone which means you can use it across the globe. The fact it doesn't have 3g is not a problem for calling or receiving. The call clarity or reception don't decrease because of that. The keyboard is awesome. We have a Nokia E5, but when compared to that, this phone's keyboard is far better and the phone itself is very sturdy and gives a good feeling when holding to your ears (you might have noticed that some phones really don't feel well near the ears).We have an Android touchphone too. Touching, sliding and tapping to receive calls or dial call is a pain. It's a shame that this whole world is bent on features forgetting the basic functionality of the phone which is calling and receiving calls. It's so disappointing there are not many non-smart phones with good reception and call quality. And there are fewer flip phone with those qualities.Added in June 2012:This phone is going steady. We have two phones and one is being used by my teenage son. He has dropped it at least twenty times in front of me (imagine how many times he would have dropped when I was not there!), but it continues to work without any issues. He has a hard cover for the phone but most of the times when he dropped it, the cover, battery cover and battery will fall apart. But it will always work after putting them together. Once he lost it while walking on the footpath when it was snowing and got it only after a couple of hours. I immediately switched it off, removed the battery and let it dry for a day. And it worked again!

I had to send the quickfire back because it wasn't working but anyway. I received this phone very quickly in the mail and instantaneously I fell in love with this phone. It's very lightweight it's pretty and the sound clarity is ridiculous. Unfortunately since I have prepaid service on att it wouldn't let me send or receive multimedia messages or go online. Regular att service is compatible with the phone but there's something about the 50 dollar plan that inhibits compatibility with smartphones. I noticed that initially this was a tmobile phone so I went and visited tmobile. I am switching to their service because they have a 50 dollar plan as well and it's 4g service too. So when this month is up I'm changing my plan because I absolutely love this phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone. Just make sure you're not on the att prepaid plan because if so there's nothing that att, nokia, or amazon can do about it. Trust me I have spoken to all of those people within the last 24 hours of me having this phone. Also it doesn't come with a usb connector but you can easily buy one.

It was a cheap touchscreen, since I didn't have a contract, I had to buy a phone separately. I have Family Mobile, from Wal-mart. This phone was cheaper than the LG Cookie, and it works a million times better. It has the feel of a blackberry, and texting on it is fantastic. It organizes the the text by contact, instead of just a list of recent texts. Great customizable home screen, where you can put favorite contacts, missed alerts, and other things on it. Talking is also great. Good reception, and it's easy for me to hear people, even though I'm slightly...hearing deficient. I do NOT have web access for my plan, so I can't rate that really well. It can hold quite a bit of text messages, unlike the LG Cookie, which can only hold 500 altogether.The only thing that I don't really like is the camera. It's very low quality, but that doesn't diminish the product any, because it's an overall, fantastic product.Update!I've had this phone since the beginning of August 2011, and I have to admit, this phone has well surpassed my expectations.

The camera is not as nice as a professional camera or an iPhone, but for a regular cellphone camera it is very nice and takes great pictures. Sound quality is good, and the radio is very cool as well (it gets more stations than the radio in my stereo). I also appreciate that there is a slot for a memory card, and that the games it comes with are pretty fun, as well. I would suggest a case, though.

The Nokia X2-01 has been an amazing phone for me. The battery lasts about a week and a half with frequent texting and occasional glimpses at Facebook. I have it on Simple Mobile ($40 unlimited talk, text, and web) but it only works on their Edge Network, which makes me wish that this phone could access WiFi. I love the Bluetooth connectivity and the conversational texting layout (like on an iPhone, rather than needing to open each text individually).This phone can also take a serious beating.

However, given all the negative reviews about this very inexpensive phone, I am inclined to write a positive review that I may edit later.What I like about this phone:- SLICK: it's thin, light, and visually attractive- INTUITIVE: clicking on commands is easy if you are familiar with the Nokia interface.- EASY-TO-USE: making phone calls and sending text messages is easy.- EASY SET-UP: the set-up is quick and easy.  I also own a Nokia 5800, so I am familiar with the interface. Choosing ring tones, setting up the alarm, etc. was really easy.What I could not figure out:- KEYBOARD LANGUAGES: you can select among English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.  I selected Spanish to send some text messages in Spanish but even though Spanish was the keyboard language, I could not figure out how to use Spanish-specific characters such as \u00f1 or \u00e1, \u00e9, etc. (the accent mark on vowels). The keyboard was still operating in English.What I have not used yet:- CAMERA: I took a couple of pictures, but I do not plan to use the phone as a camera, so that is a moot point for me.- VIDEO: again, this to me is a primarily an inexpensive PHONE so I care not how good or grainy the video comes out.- INTERNET: I do not have a data plan on this phone (T-Mobile pre-paid calls and text only), so that does not matter.  I use my Nokia 5800 for Internet access where I have a pre-paid data plan.Overall, for $90.00, I am impressed with this phone.

The internet browser is decent, I usually use it to look things up on Google.The only problem I had was that I had to call them and they had to work some magic so I could send and receive picture messages.  It took a while, but they eventually got it.The picture quality of the phone is really nice and clear.  The speakers are loud and clear also.  I love the speakerphone, as my last phone I could barely hear anything when I used it, and I use it a lot.  This I can hear fine.As for the camera, it's not that great.  I would have liked a better one, and I am disappointed that they didn't include a better one on this model.  It definitely has the capability.I enjoy the text logs, although it's glitchy sometimes.  It's not a huge issue, but if I look at a conversation it says that I sent texts to someone I know I sent to another person.  If I look at my sent messages to make sure, it shows the right text sent to the right person.  It's just a glitch I got used to as it doesn't affect the performance of the phone.I have never used this as a music player, so I am not sure how good it is with that.  It DOES have the mini-SD card slot, which is awesome.

I have it in the red color. I love having the keyboard instead of a touchscreen. I also use the multiple alarms which can be set throughout the day.One gripe is that I have missed several days of work because if I set the notification alarm for an earlier time, it preempts the main alarm so that I can't hear it. When I look at the screen, the alarm will be flashing on, but there is no sound coming out. So that is why I say that the alarms are unreliable if you are using the notification alarms along with the main alarm.Also there is no ability to get Android software. When I got this phone I had no use for Android software and its apps, but now I do.The size of the phone in my hand is just right. It doesn't overwhelm my hand like other phones do.The internet search function works well, but I found that it gets annoying to keep pressing the button to scroll down the page, or scroll to the right to read. Some web pages are rendered too difficult to navigate, for example, when needing to click to the next page-since you must hover the arrow directly on the page number to click it- it takes some patience to maneuver the arrow.This phone still works for people who occasionally look things up online. It only becomes frustrating if you like to use the internet a lot.My battery life is excellent, even after 2 years. Ive never owned a phone with as good a battery life. I actually bought this phone because of 2 things: the keyboard and the battery life. Because I hate having to recharge my phone.If you are like me and often drop your phone, this phone is good because it doesn't feel 'delicate'- like it would break. Ive dropped it probably over 50 times, and all that happens is the back cover pops off, and sometimes the battery pops out. This is without any case or rubber/plastic shell.I do have to say, since this is a critique, that after 1 year on this phone I wished it had some more interesting bell/call tones. I only used 3 different tones to receive my calls in the 2 years I had it. There are more, but I didn't like them.Another problem I've had with this phone is it saves all messages, all drafts, and all sent and received messages. So, in effect, it is storing everything. This only became a problem for me after 2 years of (extremely light usage). I did not have any extra storage space. At the end of 2 years I had no space available to keep photos.Also, I would recommend to you to get this phone for a cheaper price than what is offered here.

I wasn't sure I'd be able to enjoy this one, because I have very impaired vision, but I was so happy to find that all fonts can be enlarged, making it so easy to view messages, contacts, EVERYTHING.  It's a very lightweight phone with a nice, comfortable feel. The screen is generous and gives a nice bright display.  The keyboard, though at first it looked daunting, is actually easy to use after a few days.  The buttons develop sort of a \"puffy\" feel to the touch, and press easily and accurately.  Many reviewers complained about the camera, but I am finding it quite adequate for a cell phone.  Though not the BEST one I've had, it is fine, and the phone has several \"editing\" tools to improve your photos, and they actually turn out quite good with a bit of editing.  Lots of interesting and \"easy listening\" ringtones and alerts.  A bit short on themes and wallpaper, but with the Nokia Ovi Store, you can download tons of free themes, wallpapers, and ringtones (the ringtone selection is somewhat poor, but after all, it's FREE.)  There are also alot of free and available for purchase apps on the Store's site, some of them quite interesting.  My only disappointment is this:  it does NOT work with T-Mobile's gallery of displays and ringtones. Additionally, it will not accept your old ringtones or photos from your former phone, although it WILL accept your contact list.  T Mobile explained that it is incompatible because it was Nokia's first attempt at a Smartphone with a quasi Windows system.  Truthfully, this is over my head, so I grin and bear it.  The battery life is incredibly LONG, both talk time and standby.  If you buy it, be prepared to \"play\" with it for awhile because some of the usual features are in different places than expected, such as call logs, \"in call\" volume control, and phone storage info.  I am having a bit of trouble receiving picture messages, but I believe there is a setting I have not yet mastered.  If you're into Facebook, it's very simple to upload photos from the camera, or from your Photo Gallery stored on the phone.  I'm not into using my phone for the Internet, so I can't comment on that component.
