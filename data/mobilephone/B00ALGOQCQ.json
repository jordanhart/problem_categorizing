I love this phone.  I live in the U.S. and i have consumer cellular as my phone provider.  I bought this phone, stuck my sim card in it, and had no trouble at all setting it up.  All i had to do was go through initial set up steps like language settings (it was in English (ireland) and i changed it to english (united states)).  Connected to our WIFI and the WIFI at my work without any problems...this phone amazes me with what it can do in a phone that's not overly bulky.

I even paid a fee for fast delivery.  However, the seller, SurgeTelecom, sent the same model number but with an \"L\" at the end of the model number.  The \"L\" means the telephone is configured for Latin America and it is NOT the telephone I ordered.  I tried to use the phone in the U.S. but its speed never went over EDGE or H because the phone is not configured for the U.S.Even though the phone I received has the same model number as this phone EXCEPT FOR THE \"L\" AT THE END, the \"L\" model phone is quite different.  As I wrote, it is configured for Latin America.  The box the telephone came in showed that the phone was manufactured in Vietnam and most of the writing on the box is in Spanish.  Worse, however, is the fact that the phone with the \"L\" requires a mini SIM card while this model requires a standard SIM. That makes a huge difference.I will be ordering again and hopefully, a different seller will not substitute my order with a phone that is configured for a totally different geographic area.A friend has this phone (the one I ordered, but not the wrong one I received from the seller, SurgeTelecom.  The phone is great and is perfect for my needs.UPDATE -I returned the wrong phone that I received (discussed above).  I then ordered a replacement phone and, INCREDIBLY, I received another phone with the \"L\" after the model number and the wrong size SIM card.  This makes two separate times I received the wrong phone within one month.  Be careful when ordering.  Even though the model number you receive is correct, if the model number has an \"L\" after it, the phone will not work properly in the U.S.Doesn't anyone bother to check items before they are shipped?", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect!!", "Author": "hector gutierrez", "ReviewID": "R1Z3Z2Y6R0RN4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "el envio llego a tiempo el producto en perfecto estado , nuevo!!!... es totalmente desbloqueado , sirve perfectamente para movistar en venezuela", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small and neat..", "Author": "DH", "ReviewID": "R3RFK8CKLVFVGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung did it again great product.

Also worked in the Philippines and I will test this winter in Thailand.  No issues starting up, inserting new SIM was easy and had incredibly awesome reception (ironically better than in the states).  I traveled with an old unlocked T-Mobile GSM phone for over 15 years but now with smartphones and SIM cards having included data plans I made the jump to a smart phone for traveling.  I'm truly satisfied with this purchase and highly recommended this model phone.  Minor differences with the standard Samsung iii but I don't mind (tap phones to transmit data isn't on this model etc...).  The price is unbeatable as I attempted to purchase this one week prior on a trip to France and it was literally double the amount!  Battery life excellent and size is a lot more comfortable to hold/carry than my standard S3.  I personally prefer the size of the mini over the new trend of brick size phones.

At this time, I'm enjoying big time the perfect size of this phone (S3 and S4 are just too big for me), it is not heavy, good speed, very elegant design and a lot of apps to enjoy.First time, when I turned it on, the language was set in French (there was a note from the seller inside the box giving instructions about how to change the language from French to the one you need). It was pretty easy to change the language and a big list of languages, including English and Spanish.Also, there was a note in the box saying that \"this phone DOES NOT work with SPRINT or VERIZON\". On the other hand, I'm from Venezuela and it works fine with MOVISTAR. The signal shows \"H\" which I think is better than 3G (I'm not too good with this terms). My phone does not have any AT&T; or other logos, just the Samsung Logo like it should be.The first 3 days, I was worried because sometimes it shutted down by itself (it started shutting down once or twice a day until at least 5 times a day at the end). Then, I searched on the web about this issue and turns out that I was not the only one. In some cases, people said that the phone shutted down and never start again... they called it \"sudden death\" and said that Samsung was already aware and working on this issue... AT THAT TIME I WAS SCARED!! I found an app that tells you if your phone is between  those related to the sudden death issue but thank God i was not in the list.Trying to fix this issue, I found out some people saying that they fixed it using the factory data reset and updating to the latest official Android Version 4.1.2. With this info and knowing that may be some of the apps I downloaded could also be the reason of the failure, I decided to make the factory data reset. Even I wrote to the seller asking for help and he quickly answered me suggesting exactly the same solution.At this time, the phone is not shutting down by itself anymore (not even once!) and I'm very happy with my new smartphone.I'm not rating with 5 star because battery does not last one day (and I don't use it the entire day). I may suggest you to buy the car charger, the quick start guide is in French and also camera should be improved ( I don't like when pictures look blur even when you are doing an effort to avoid any movement).", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Box came open.

I was worried about some of the descriptions describing 3g speed, but have not noticed it being any slower than the mytouch \"4g\"  on internet related things.The only con is S-voice.  It's a barely ok voice dialing system.  It's based on google search, and gives you the same useless prompts.  If you aren't looking at the phone, you won't know whether you're supposed to be waiting, talking or trying again.I finally disabled S-voice and am now using Utter.  Although it's not perfect as of this writing, it's way better than S-Voice.  Genius on the mytouch 4g was a vastly superior voice dialer to both products.Unfortunately, the mytouch appears abandoned at Android 2.2  All the cool stuff come in at Android 4.1 so I had to upgrade.Other than S-Voice, the Samsung S3 mini is a wonderful phone with an excellent battery life and many capabilities.  I also like it's form factor.  It's small enough that people won't mistake it for a small chopping board or serving tray.Also note that Android 4.1 and above doesn't support flash, so there are many websites and videos that aren't accessible without going through major trouble.

Now, this device is truly amazing!  Completely new and unlocked, and the UI is incredible.  Running on JB, users might not need any customization, however, I did install Next Launcher 3D just to check the smoothness and all I can say is...WOW! Pebble blue color is pretty much the same as its bigger brother, S3.  The wifi is great and fast, network reception is too awesome, camera, I must say pretty impressive.  Now for gaming, this device with dual core can take some pretty heavy graphics.  I installed Shadowgun deadzone and this device delivered!  People crying about this device being laggy, totally not true, and the battery is decent, but I am always using it, either with games, music, or the camera/video. The battery will last you about 2 days with normal use. Durability is great! Already dropped it a couple of times, of course with the Dual Armor Case equipped, and not a single scratch.  TRUST me when I say that this device is worth buying, you'll come to find that for a mid-range phone, the little brother of the S3 can INDEED deliver heavy kicks!!
