All I got to say is that I'm amazed with the amount of feature and build quality that this phone has; which has got me jealous and I just order one.I'm just gonna touch on a few key features. Specs can be founded online.3\" HVGA capacitive touchscreen - highly responsive and clear pictures showing vivid colors. Granted the screen is small but everything comes out in great detail. Best of all, the screen is glass. That's right; it's not plastic but the 3\" screen is glass.Sliding Keyboard - slide open and closed smoothly and firmly. No flimsy construction here. The keys are space out nicely for your thumbs to type away.Battery life - This point is kinda useless since everyone has different usage. My friend who makes a lot of calls and text a lot of people with very light use of the internet manage to get a little over a day. I'm guessing if you use the phone a lot for music, videos, web and so on, you might need to bring a charger with you.5MP camera - This phone has a front facing camera and well as the rear. Both produces sharp, clean image. Not that great in low light, even with flash. Flash only on the back of phone.Construction - The build quality is great. This phone is a little heavy (a little heavier than lets say an iPhone)but it has a nice solid feel. The heaviness is expected from a sliding keyboard phone. The body is made out of plastic but the screen is glass. The Mini Pro is small so it may be easy to lose.The interface is nice. You have four corners to throw your stuff in along with the desktop to throw more apps on. This is Sony's own interface. All of it is running on Android 2.3.3. No lag at all thanks to 512MB Ram it has on board and the snappy 1 GHz processor. It has enough storage space for all your apps, 400MB to be precise, but less than that due to the other apps and system files on the phone.One last note, the battery cover is hard to take off. I had to use a little force to get it off. I'm not held responsible if you damage your phone.Update 6/7/2012I just updated the OS on this phone to ICS 4.0.4 and I have to say, this new OS brings new life to this phone. It's faster and more responsive. If you haven't updated, you should do so now.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "ekkimeira", "ReviewID": "RAAD39AWXID7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Sony cell phone for years and have been very happy with it, but lately it started losing power and just not working well.  i travel a lot and often switch SIM cards so i wanted an unlocked phone.  i looked at gazillion different options but finally settled on this one (xperia mini pro SK17A) and it is wonderful.  i was instantly able to insert my SIM and hook into the service provider (tmobile in the US) i didn't have to sign up for a 2 year(slavery)plan and no need for the expensive data plan as it works just fine on WIFI. It is easy to use and small enough to fit nicely in one hand, an issue for me as i found most phones to be too big and clunky.  i also like to have the option of a full keyboard as touch screen texting can be very annoying, but both work really well on this phone.  the only very minor drawback is that the battery drains quickly and it has to be charged every day, but that is generally how all smart phones are, i.e. mini computers so they use more power.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good things in a small package", "Author": "JFC", "ReviewID": "RTG281A7NEQ52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone, the black model, direct from Amazon for about $270 and have been getting used to it the past several weeks. It's my first Android smart phone, so I'm having to learn both the new handset and a new OS, after having used E-Series Nokia phones for many years.One of the things that drew me to this model was its hardware keyboard (in addition to the on-screen ones it offers in both portrait and landscape modes). With the Nokia E-Series Symbian models being discontinued, there aren't a great number of quality, high performing smartphone choices with hardware keyboards. But after doing a lot of research, I settled on this one, and thus far am glad I did.I'm a tall guy with large hands and long fingers, but the keyboard on the MiniPro works fine for me. The keys have a firm click-type (non-audible) touch and are nicely spaced and tactile. The slide out mechanism as others have noted is solid and firm, no jiggering or bending when the keyboard is extended.I too found the build quality to be quite good, notwithstanding the plastic case materials. Despite reading the comments in prior reviews here, I had no trouble snapping off the back of the phone to access the battery and SD card and SIM card slots. On my model at least, the back snaps on and off securely, but easily. I was never worried I was going to break anything trying.When closed, the size of the phone is surprisingly small in terms of height and width, but it is a bit chubbier than non-hardware-keyboard phones as you'd expect. But it feels good in the hand, is easy to hold and handle and doesn't feel slippery. That said, it easily fits inside a man's shirt or pants pocket.Even though it's not a dual core processor, the response of the phone is swift and smooth, no lagging or stuttering. The screen image quality is quite good, though at about 3 inches, you wouldn't want it any smaller. But I have ready access to desktop and laptop PCs most of the time, so I wasn't looking to carry around a large screen in my pocket.I do have a couple of gripes about the phone, though.--One is the design of the small plastic cover of the micro USB slot that's used for data connections and charging the phone. It's a small plastic piece that you have to pry open with your fingernail and pivot out from its resting place. Then once open, the little plastic piece just hangs loosely and dangling there attached by a very tiny connector. A sliding cover or some other approach would have been much better for an otherwise elegant phone. The way the little cover hangs there annoyingly, I almost want to cut it off and just leave the micro USB port uncovered.--Another is when I set up the phone, I followed the very minimal paperwork included in the box, and used common sense based on my familiarity with computers and smartphones. But when I tried to use the main camera on the phone, the images were all blurry, even after I cleaned the exterior lens surface with a soft camera lens cleaning cloth. So I ended up taking the phone into a Sony shop to have them take a look at that problem. And to my surprise, they said there had been a small (I assume protective) plastic film sheet covering the main camera lens. I swear, I never saw it, and didn't see any info about it on the phone's setup info. But once removed, the camera takes very nice photos for a 5 mp snapper with auto focus.Other misc things, the sound quality and loudness on calls and playing music etc. I found quite good. I liked the feature in the camera whereby you can focus and take a phone just by tapping anywhere on the view screen (apart from also having a physical camera shutter key). Also the accelerometer that automatically shifts the phone's display between portrait and landscape works smoothly and quickly.Add in full access to the Android Market, good video recording, FM radio included, a 2 GB memory card included, the included Flash video playing capability, WiFi N, and stereo Bluetooth, and Sony has packed a lot of powerful capabilities into this small package.It's not the slimmest or most elegant or highest specced Android smartphone on the market, but it's a great phone at a great price, especially if you're buying it out of your own pocket and not on a carrier contract discount, that pretty much can do anything you want to do for business/work or for personal entertainment.PS - Just as a quick follow-up, now Jan. 2013 and this phone is still going strong and performing well. Just last month got the Ice Cream Sandwich OS via download, and it seems to work OK with that, at least for me. Everything I said above in my original review I still hold to.One thing I managed to solve was the dangling micro-USB slot cover issue. Following another user's suggestion I read on one of the Sony forums, I took an Xacto knife and cut/shaved off a tiny portion of the interior part of the cover (the part that fits into the micro USB slot cover). I DIDN'T cut off the dangling cover itself. But after trimming the inside tab a bit, the cover now can be inserted and removed with my fingernail much easier, and no longer drives me crazy as it did when I first got the phone. Sony, unfortunately, just made the original cover fit a bit too snugly. But that's something any user can easily remedy.Lastly, having used the phone for more than a year now, I want to comment also on what a good camera it has for just a 5 MP model. As anyone familiar with such things knows, it's not automatically the case that a higher number of megapixels is going to mean better quality images. There are lots of mobile phones out there with 8+ MP camera, but read the reviews, and you'll see many, many produce noisy, artifacted, oddly shaded photos. After having had a year to compare my mobile phone's photos with those of friends and family members using other smart phones, I'd certainly say the MiniPro's photos are among the best quality that I've seen.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely Versatile Traveling World Phone", "Author": "vincent hirai", "ReviewID": "R143WOAVAHDIB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been saved from making a bad purchase by many honest reviewers on Amazon.com So I decided to give back by taking time out of my day to help other buyers like myself make an informed decision when purchasing an item.Here is my humble opinion from a on the go traveler as to why this is the phone for you.(note I own both an Iphone 4s, an Ipad 2, a Asus Transformer Prime and a Sony Ericsson X10 Min pro, motorola atrix and the motorola flipout).1. It's A Quad Band Unlocked GSM Smartphone.  Apple has a larger selection of apps and generally better quality apps, Apple apps are generally more intuitive and easy to use, apple apps even look better BUT with this android phone You don't have to risk 600 USD to jail-break this phone when you travel overseas. With the Sony Ericsson X10 mini pro all you do is pop in the sim and Viola...you are ready to use your phone in Asia, Europe, South America etc.. This is one factor that makes it a great travel phone.  But not all android phones are created equal!  Motorola Atrix and flip out both require you to log into MOTOBLUR when you install a new sim and when you turn your phone on.  This added step to use my phone was so annoying.  But with sony ericsson mini pro you just turn the phone on and your good to go.2.  A long lasting battery with a Quick Recharge time!  compared to atrix, iphone 4s, and flip out.  Im not a tech guru and this is just my observation of this phone with the same amount of apps with the same usage for all 4 phones.  The atrix and flip out are horrible had to recharge 2-3 times per day kinda defeated the purpose of having a cell phone.  The iphone 4s was better 1-sometimes 2 times per day.  Sony Ericsson Mini pro 1 time every 2 days. The charge time is very quick too!3. Can Transform into an Ultra Space Saving Workstation, Gaming/Media Center. Most Hotels that I stay at in third world countries have video in and out but no HDMI connection.  If you buy a SonyEricsson IM700 TV-Out AV Cable you can turn any hotel tv into a monitor next you will need a Sony Ericsson DK10 LiveDock Multimedia Station for Xperia active, Xperia arc, Xperia arc S, Xperia neo, Xperia ray and Other Smartphones  - Retail Packaging - White then all you have to do is hook up your keyboard and mouse and you have a mobile computer.Total cost: $12 RCA Cable + $45 livedock = $57  and everyone should have a keyboard and mouse so that is no extra cost.4. Physical Keyboard (This is just personal preference) I hate using the fake keyboard on the touchscreen I do not swipe and hand written notes on a phone is even worse for me.  I need the tactile feeling of the keys that I use along with the light up keyboard to type and text with.  In this case old school is better for me.5. Very Durable I am clumsy and I drop my phone often(thus the long list of phones that I have tested)  I have dropped my sony ericsson several times with no case from 3 feet and it still works like a charm.  But when I accidentally dropped my  Iphone 4s from 1 foot the screen shattered.  I have since bought a lifeproof case to protect my already expensive iphone so really the basic cost of an iphone is 660-700 dollars for just the hardware, which brings me to my next point.6.  Anti-theft deterrent phone (well kinda).. Thieves target and steal expensive and popular electrons to make money it makes sense because in my travels I have seen many stolen iphones on the black market.  At 660 dollars!  Getting your Iphone stolen is not only a. more likely to happen but b. will really hurt your wallet. With the sony ericsson xperia mimi pro at 200ish your phone will be less of a target by thieves and if it does get stolen or misplaced you will not feel the sting as much as you would if you lost a jailbroken iphone at 660.7. Propriety Software. Timescape is the bomb!  It is a one stop app that list all of your calls, facebook, twitter, text, messages all in a stupid simple interface that is easy to use.CONS:  Reasons not to buy this phone !1. Don't buy this phone if you have poor eyesight! Small Screen Size but Small phone. The phone is pretty small easy to carry and when you travel space is important.  But the drawback is the small screen it is not bad enough to make the phone unusable but it is bad enough to make it annoying especially when you just switch from an iphone 4s and atrix to this small screen.  But once you get use to it it is not bad.2. Not Fashionable. If your goal is to rock out at the club and look good while making a phone call get the iphone or another phone but this is not the phone for you!  This phone is fugly it looks like it was stuck in the 90's but then again I cared more for function not fashion to each their own.3. Want The Best Apps.  If you want the highest quality apps that look good then go with apple hands down! Android apps aren't bad but they are not the best but they do seem to have more variety of apps just of lesser quality when compared to apple.4. Want the Easiest smartphone to use.  Apple apps are easier to use but android seems to have a lot more customization options.  But if we are talking about strictly ease of use apple wins hands down. Even buying apps for android is a pain at times.  You have apps on google play, amazon, sony play and more...as a buyer or developer who wants to go to search through 3 different store to buy an app? But I guess you pay for variety!5. Will lose in a pissing match.  If you want to brag about the processor or the best screen resolution etc..etc.. this phone will lose as all phones will in 6 months since new phones are always coming out! This phone does not have the very very best camera or the very best screen resolution.. If the very best of the best is important to you this is not the phone for you.In the end I choose this phone to travel and save money.  I dont have to buy 2 phones one for home and one for my travels abroad.  I dont have to buy the phone twice because it is very durable.  And when it gets outdated I can get more milage out of it by repackaging the phone as a mini computer or web tv device or just give it away to a person who needs it in a third world country. I hope that after reading my review you can make a informed decision if the sony ericsson xperia mini pro phone is ment for you as it was for me.

It gets the job done, however, as more of a utility/text/information lookup device than a multimedia device.The device runs a pretty standard Android 2.3 OS with the addition of four multi-widget slots in the corners of the screen. If you're used to Android devices, you'll immediately be familiar with the basic application-with-desktop-widgets model.With the keyboard stowed, the device feels thick, maybe 1.5x thicker than an iPhone 4. The bottom edges are rounded and smooth and with its thickness, the phone can feel like a slippery bar of soap. With the tray stowed, the device can easily be navigated one handed using the thumb because of the small size of the screen.The keyboard pulls out with a satisfying but smooth slide and the device powers up from standby with a short, but bearable delay. The device feels solid, even with the keyboard out. The device is much easier to hold with the keyboard out as it feels much thinner. The keys are separated enough and responsive enough to make even, say, writing an essay on the device pleasurable. I found that I could type almost at the speed of thought with almost no errors. The backlit keyboard seems a little bit flaky though with the lights blinking on and off seemingly at random making the keys a little hard to read in the wrong light conditions.The screen is clear and bright, though the touch screen capabilities are a little lacking. Even pulling out the Android's top status bar is a chore because it's much too easy to mis-press. You'll often find your device doing random things, because of an errant touch screen press, though the Android's back button makes it easy to get back to where you were. I found myself navigating a lot using the arrow keys as it simply seemed less error prone.Call quality is OK and the ergonomics of the device as a phone are lacking (because of the width the height ratio and the thickness.) The ergonomics of the USB charging cover are horrendous as there's no good way to pry the thing open -- the slot for your fingernail isn't deep enough and doesn't provide any purchase, so you're left scratching at it until you get lucky. The power on button is a little bit small and requires a good push to activate -- luckily, you can just slide the keyboard try out to turn it on.Overall, not a bad little, with emphasis on little, device. It seems best suited for text based activities such as taking notes, texting, e-reading or reading graphic light web pages. I wouldn't recommend it for heavy game players or media consumers, but would recommend it for someone looking for something small and different.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Little Android Device -- Just be sure you're familiar with its 3G Flavor", "Author": "Harris", "ReviewID": "R2A7EZVJJ4G4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST, NOTE TO T-MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS:  Just know that this device's 3G connectivity (UMTS/HSPA Bands 1/2/5) IS NOT compatible with T-Mobile's 3G network (UMTS/HSPA Band 4).  You WILL ONLY be able to use the phone as a GSM phone with a very much slower GPRS/EDGE data connection.That said, this is an amazing little wonder, the like of which the market hasn't seen for quite a while.  It is purposely designed to be tiny, so any point about its tiny screen is moot.  Coupled with a WiFi connection (or perhaps AT&T; data connection -- please check first!) the phone is so fast it is practically a miniature computer!THere was never a lag in opening and executing multiple apps, and I must say the screen resolution is beautiful for a screen that size.  The slide-out keyboard, small as it is, is extremely usable, making texting effortless.  If you want the smallest, yet highly usable, Android phone with a real keyboard, I'd be surprised to find anything else quite like it in the market today.While I wouldn't call them stunning, most of the pictures produced by the phone camera are of decent 5-MP quality, with outdoor setting more preferable.Anyway, here come the pros and cons:  Pros:  - Highly portable,  - super fast processor,  - Android 2.3.3,  - wonderful screen and keyboard  Cons:  - Back cover is so badly designed -- It is nearly impossible to open it without  feeling you're going to break it or without hurting your fingertip after using  your nail to open it.

Tried solving the sliding keyboard issue with a new flex cable. Didn't work. Moved on to another phone, will probably euthanize this one. Too bad, I really liked it's size and features, just not built for the long haul.Update as of 6/2012. More sliding keyboard issues. This time, the screen goes blank any time I open the slider to use the keyboard. From researching, this could be a ribbon cable malfunction between the phone keyboard and the screen. Phone is still usable, but my main motivation for picking this phone over other designs is the small form factor combined with the qwerty keyboard. Since Sony took almost a month to do a repair under warranty, I'm reluctant to use them for a solution...Now that this phone is two years old, you likely have better options. Purchased phone for ~300, you can probably buy now on ebay for ~170. At that price, it may be interesting if you want the pocket size, the features and the qwerty keyboard. Just be aware that durability may not be good.I suppose it's possible that slider keyboards are problematic on other phones. Something to research before buying.****This is an update of a previous review where I gave the phone five stars. I've had this phone for six months.If you want a small package, decent features, qwerty keyboard, and newer android operating system, this looks like a great choice...however...For me, the qwerty keyboard was very important. Given its small size, typing on the screen is difficult. Obviously, the qwerty keyboard is a distinguishing feature, given all the phones out there without it, and for a phone this size, solves the text input issue.After six months, my qwerty keyboard failed. Backspace key would stick and either not work or erase an entire line of text (unintended).Opened a case with Xperia service. Phone's under warranty but I have to pay shipping and they want it for up to two business weeks. I offer to accept a new phone in order to expedite the process, but Xperia service will not consider it. They keep it for the entire two weeks; when I call in, they have no details on what they are doing. Going forward, I don't have much faith in this process or the reliability of the keyboard given its recent failure.Now, this IS a nice phone out of the box...but if you rely on your phone and buy new, I think you deserve something better than my experience...hopefully you will have a trouble free phone.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great small phone", "Author": "C.

Compact, with a real keyboard.", "Author": "Forest", "ReviewID": "R2MG3PHOZ7SA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I love this phone.  I waited years for someone to build a small, reasonably-powered smart phone with a real keyboard, and I'm very happy that Sony-Ericsson finally came through.  I hope they keep this series in production.Still, some things could be better.  I hope readers of this review will use my comments to set their expectations realistically, buy the phone, and be happy with it. Then tell Sony about the improvements you would like to see in their next revision.CRITICISM---------Hardware--------The keyboard keys are a little too stiff, making it a bit of a chore to type.The space bar action is much shallower than the other keys, especially at the left and right sides of the bar, making it difficult to feel whether a keypress has registered.The top row of keys are around 2mm too close to the wall created by the front half of the phone, preventing even my small fingers from easily landing on them.The keys are arranged in a grid, rather than in slightly offset rows like a real qwerty keyboard.  This causes qwerty touch typists like me to continually hit the wrong keys.The dedicated text input settings key (the one with the wireframe sphere icon) is a waste of hardware keyboard space. A long-press on some other key would be sufficient to access such a rarely-used menu. I would rather use that key for a frequently-used purpose, like perhaps a second shift key.The keyboard slider mechanism has a little too much free play when closed, allowing the two halves of the phone to rock against each other.The front home button often gets wedged into an angled position instead of lying flat. This makes it sit recessed below the lower frame edge so it becomes difficult to press, and makes it look like it might pop off.The front home button requires too much force to press; so much that I have to move my whole hand, placing fingers on the back of the phone and my thumb on the button, so I can pinch to activate it.  Such a frequently-used operation like returning to the home screen should be easy, even when holding the phone with one hand.The power button is too small and too spongy, making it difficult to find in the dark, reliably press, or feel whether a press is registered.The micro usb plug is a bit difficult to insert or remove.  It resists unless I find the perfect angle, and always makes me wonder how long it will be before the solder joints holding it in place begin to break.The micro usb port cover is a hassle to open, and feels like a fiddly bit of dangly junk that seems likely to tear off.  Plugging the phone in for a charge should not be so irritating.The upper left side of the back cover (the long side with no buttons) moves inward and makes a creaking / clicking sound when I squeeze the phone's sides to adjust the volume.  It seems to need better internal support.The camera flash produces a green tint in photos.The ambient light sensor seems to be very unstable, often causing the screen backlight to flicker.The phone adds a distinct popping sound to audio recordings, which makes it a very poor choice for video and music capture.  This is a big disappointment coming from a media-focused company like Sony.There is no 1700 MHz UMTS support, which excludes the phone from 3G access on T-Mobile USA.  (Except in rare areas where tmobile has re-farmed some of their 1900 MHz sectors from 2G to 3G.)The phone is a little too heavy, about the same weight as an iPhone.It seems impossible to find a single-earbud wired headset that works with this phone.  It comes with a double-earbud set, but that one is too easily tangled and falls out of my ear when I only use one of the earbuds.  Two earbuds is too much for casual phone calls.  Since the 3.5mm jack uses an unusual pinout, very few (if any) aftermarket headsets work in it, and Sony doesn't seem to sell a single-earbud headset for it.  (Note: I am talking about headsets with integrated microphones.)If left connected to my computer's USB port while the computer shuts down, the phone spends the night discharging instead of charging, even though the usb jack continues to supply power.  I have to remember to unplug the USB cord and then plug it back in after my computer has shut down in order to get the phone's charging circuits to work properly.  (My computer has an ASUS P5K-EPU motherboard, and my older HTC Android phone doesn't have this problem.)The white LEDs behind the Menu and Back buttons remain at full brightness even when the screen backlight is dimmed.  They are too bright in a dark room.On the phone's front, the Home button and the earpiece feel too similar to one another.  This makes it difficult to distinguish them in the dark, and I often end up pressing on the earpiece thinking it is the Home button, and then pressing harder when the phone doesn't light up, before finally realizing that it isn't the Home button.User Interface--------------When at the home screen, opening the keyboard and starting to type sends my text to a search box.  I want a setting that makes my keystrokes start a new text message instead.  The Type & Send widget seems to enable almost this, if I happen to be viewing the home screen page where it has been placed, but it loses my first keystroke and consumes four precious home screen spaces with a useless and irritatingly large \"Search or share\" banner.When typing text, holding down the backspace key deletes characters far too quickly, so I always end up deleting more of a message than I wanted to.The built-in keyboard's word suggestions are often very bad, and the alternative word list is often missing the word I intended.  Because of this, gesture input is almost useless, and I have to be very careful when tapping at the software keyboard.When using the hardware keyboard while a third-party software keyboard is set as the default, the phone's status bar no longer shows an icon when the Shift or Mode keys are used.Touch screen scrolling is not as responsive as it should be.  In the web browser, the page seems to lag about a centimeter or more behind my finger as I scroll.  The same problem exists in the main settings menu, although the lag is less than a centimeter there.  Also, the home screen pages resist being swiped left or right.  Unless I carefully drag my finger across more than half the screen, the home screen starts to move and then defiantly snaps back to where it was.  I don't like having to fight with my phone's UI.  (The iPhone does not have these problems; it feels much more responsive, and I don't think it's a hardware issue.)When I move an application or widget into the the home screen trash, the trash icon animation takes too long, preventing me from tapping the applications icon until it completes.  This problem exists even when Settings -> Display -> Animation is set to \"No animations\".The telephone icon (a 3x3 grid of blocks) does not look like a telephone, especially when shrunk to fit one of the home screen's corner containers.  I think an icon resembling a classic telephone handset would be more intuitive.  It really should be easy to see how to make a phone call.Location Services-----------------The GPS functionality refuses to work unless I agree to data collection.  This is totally unacceptable, even if the data is supposedly made \"anonymous\".  I bought this phone, and I should be able to use all of its hardware features without letting Google or anyone else use my phone as a data collection device.  (Sadly, this problem seems to exist in Android's default configuration, so Sony would have to do a little customization work to correct it.)Calendar--------On month view, the colored event bars representing events after 6pm are compressed down to just a few pixels.  This is true whether the event is six minutes or six hours long.  The vast majority of the vertical space is dedicated to the first part of the day, while most of my events (which usually take place in the evening) are barely visible at all.Messaging---------When composing a message, a huge amount of vertical screen space is wasted by a needlessly tall, mostly empty text entry box.  Even worse, its height doubles after a single character is typed.  This almost entirely hides the previous message in the conversation, which makes it rather difficult to refer to what was already said.To make the matter worse, a panel keeps sliding down from the top of the screen to show the recipient's name and phone number, covering whatever sliver of the previous message might otherwise be visible.The text message vibration feature is an always-on or always-off setting.  There seems to be no way to make the phone vibrate for incoming messages only when I have the ringer volume turned off.  Therefore, I have to remember to open the messaging app's settings and check the \"Notification vibration\" box every time I turn off my ringer, and remember to undo that setting every time I turn the ringer back on.  This is silly and annoying.Browser-------The unicode U+266B character ' (beamed eigth notes) is missing from the web browser's built-in font; it displays as an empty rectangle, while other musical note characters display properly.Third Party Applications------------------------There are too many built-in applications that I do not want and cannot uninstall.  They clutter up my applications menu and waste storage space.  I should be allowed to remove them, and re-install them from Google Play if I ever want them back in the future.  A few examples of applications I wish I could remove: Facebook, ANT Radio Service, OfficeSuite, Games by PopCap.PRAISE------I love the phone's width and height!  Finally, a modern Android phone that I actually want to carry with me!It has a real keyboard!  Yay!The touch-sensitive Menu and Back buttons are well-placed and very easy to use.I love the consistent use of black backgrounds in applications, menus, and even the status bar.  This is much better than the blinding white background color used on other phones.  It is especially nice when playing videos, viewing photos, and using my phone in the dark.The home screen's expanding corner containers are implemented very nicely for the most part.  (I do wish they would hide themselves when I want to place an application launcher icon in the corner of a home screen, as they do for a widget.  Placing the launcher inside the container is functionally equivalent, but doesn't look as good in some home screen arrangements.)The CPU is fast enough to keep interactive stuff responsive most of the time.  (I wish it was all of the time.)The weather widget looks very nice, even though the AccuWeather forecasts are often wrong in my area.  (I just wish I could choose alternative weather data sources.)", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a great price", "Author": "Quique Rivera", "ReviewID": "R1390KN1GD4XC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As expected from a Sony product and an Android phone.Pros:- Great 5MP camera with led flash.- Easy access keyboard.- Very sensitive ans responsive touch screen.- Great performance under multitasking operation.- Comes with a protective film for the screen.Cons:- It could use a stylus.

It makes use of the space that it is provided and it does this well.  It has four corners on the main screen that you can put up to four apps in each for a total of 16.  Definitely handy especially for those more commonly used apps.

It needed to have a physical keyboard (after having used an on-screen keyboard for 2 years versus a physical keyboard phone I had use even prior, I missed the added tactility that a physical keyboard provides), a fast processor, decent memory, attractive aesthetics, a simple but robust user interface, the Android Gingerbread OS (at the least), a front facing camera, 4G connectivity, good user reviews, affordability, SIM card, and most importantly, it needed to have the now-novel concept of being small and compact (similar to the old ubiquitous Nokia bar phones from the late 90s).  Thinking that I would have to settle for a phone with most but not all of my requests, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Sony Ericsson Experia Mini Pro SK17A met all of my expectations with the exception of 4G connectivity (a feature very low on my list in the first place).After having used my white Mini Pro for over a month now, I appreciate the utter uniqueness, capability, and quality that this phone offers even more so than the first day I used it.  With it, I experience no phone envy when I browse through the various selections available; it simply stands out among the many giant screen clones.  It has been a most delectable tool that I still find myself looking forward to use each day.  If I had needed the use of a large screen, of course I would be disappointed with the 3\" screen size, but since I knew I wanted to revert back to small and compact, the Mini Pro leaves me quite satisfied.

The keyboard has indeed been a lot more comfortable to use than on screen keyboards, and for those of us who write in multiple languages it's very easy to change among them to get accents and special characters. Data consumption when using only whatsapp and other instant messaging services is very low, I regularly use only 2.5% of my plan's monthly data.The only niggles are the light sensor which gets confused easily; from time to time it's a little sluggish (then again I always want technology to be right now fast); the camera is useless, but then again that's why I got a \"real\" camera; there is an update to a newer Android version but apparently it hasn't been released by my phone carrier; that update would let me uninstall the myriad applications which I never use, like Facebook. That lack of support from carriers could be a big negative for Android phones.Original review:Why you'd want to get this phone:- Real keyboard, no more futzing around with virtual keyboards.- Small size, for those of us who don't want bricks in our trouser pockets; this means a compromise for the keyboard, but it still works. The phone isn't as slender as others but it's very comfortable to hold in your hand.- For specific needs, like surfing, mail, maps, instant messaging, even Skype, it works great. You can get some work done with Google docs or other \"office\" apps. With Google+ I could even link to Picasa and quickly show some vacation pics using the entire screen - nice.- Be online without a data plan, or a limited data plan: easy to turn off data and use WiFi only.- Easy to use interface; you can put shortcuts to your most used apps in all four corners, which is handy; there's a notification area which can be \"pulled down\".There are few other options with physical keyboards; there are many with much bigger screens and dazzling design; the Nokia N9 in particular looked really interesting but some apps may not be available for that platform (no Whatsapp for starters), and Nokia's stance towards it doesn't inspire confidence (they finally make an appealing phone only to kill it, way to go Nokia!). Sony Ericsson also has a few slender variants with different screen sizes. The xperia Ray looks cute and is smaller, if you don't want a real keyboard; the arc looks fantastic but I couldn't see myself lugging around a phone that big.No cons so far, a few niggles:- The audio quality for calls is fine; for music it's so-so; my old Sony Walkman a818 still seems to sound better.- The battery doesn't last for long if you're on wifi and with the screen turned on all the time... Which is normal. Without wifi and turning the screen off you'll probably get two or three days; it can be charged via USB with a common micro USB adapter.- For the control freaks, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to remove the apps you'll never use, in my case Facebook and a few games that came preinstalled. You can root the phone but I don't want to spend time tinkering with it. I'm left with the impression that it's not really \"my\" phone.- Updating the OS can only be done through a program... In Windows!! Bizarre. Even a program for Linux would be more useful for those of use trying to leave the bad old ways behind...- There are tons of apps... Mostly time wasters.- If you slide out the keyboard the screen goes to landscape mode... But if you then slide it in, it goes to portrait mode, even if you are still holding the phone horizontally... The Home and Apps screens also show up only in portrait mode, even if apps and settings change to however you are holding it...

These 2 are of the rare phones where slapping on any case, no matter how stylish, would be a grave injustice.The form factor is excellent. It's very short, yet thick and hefty, so it fits well into your palm even if you have big hands. The plastic backing on the white version is rather slippery though, so you do have to be careful(the black version has a more rubbery, matte finish).Sony Ericcson's user interface is superb. It was recently updated to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, but even if you stick to the stock Gingerbread 2.3.5, you will not be disappointed. It's stylish and slick, much better than HTC's Sense and Samsung's TouchWiz shells (although HTC's weather home screen is by far the best for a weather widget). Even though it's a single core phone, everything moves with grace, style, and zip, even on the more RAM-intensive Ice Cream Sandwich. Although touch-input responsiveness and accuracy will never be as good as the iPhone's, overall, as far as the UI goes, it's the best - the best of the Androids, and better than Nokia's Maemo and Apple's iOS.Web-browsing and video-watching on this 3-inch screen will never be as good as the other phone's bigger screens, and its 480x320 resolution is inferior. However, on that small 3-inch screen you won't be able to really tell, and the Bravia Engine and Reality Display do shine - it's simply a bright, gorgeous screen.Typing on this phone is a dream come true, since it has a dedicated sliding QWERTY keyboard like the Nokia N900. I still love the SWYPE-style input the best, and that is not something you can currently do with an iPhone or the older Nokias. On that end, this phone reigns supreme giving you the best of both worlds.I think Apple's ecosystem is still superior to Android's, but if you want a good second phone, I feel this is the best Android phone for that purpose.Highly recommended!", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unboxing, contents, first impressions of Xperia Mini Pro SK17a", "Author": "Kyle Y", "ReviewID": "R338HTBHOVULMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: I upgraded my phone to Android 4.0 using SE's Update Service and this seems to have solved my problems with fingerswipe navigation so up bumping the rating back to 4-stars and update the review.TLDR; This is an attractive phone for people who want a stylish *compact* Android smartphone with a physical slideout keyboard.

The SK17a also comes with even more free SE installed bloatware that you can't uninstalled (without rooting), can't kill, and will reduce battery life and memory, although battery life is still expected to be much better than the X10.I just received my SK17a, new, unopened from Wireless Experts fulfilled by Amazon.comIn my review, I've list the contents and give my first impressions, and do a brief compare of the \"Xperia Mini Pro\" SK17a and its predecessor the \"Xperia X10 Mini Pro\".BOX CONTENTS------------------------------------------------------------(1) Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro White (SK17a) phone(1) Screen protector (pre-installed on to the phone)(1) Extra screen protector, cleaner, and applicator,(1) 2 Gb microSD card (pre-installed inside phone)(1) **BLACK** Handsfree in-ear stereo headset/microphone 3.5mm(1) Battery, (1) AC to USB wall charger, (1) USB to mini USB adapter cableThere is no user manual and it only contains 4 pamphlets: US Safety Guidelines; SAR/FCC Statement; Important Information (English); Informacion Importante (Spanish)Some relevant information on stickers affixed to the box\"GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 UTMS/HSPA Bands 1/2/5\"\"Packaged in China from US and imported components...US Warranty White New\"Note: UTMS/HSPA 1/2/5 correspond to bands 2100/1900/850)UNBOXING AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS------------------------------------------------------------CHEAP(ER) HEADPHONES WRONG COLOR - This phone came with cheaper headphones than those included with the previous generation X10 Mini Pro and the wrong color.  They are not the color or style shown in the picture.  They are like cheap black earphones from the 90s.  The older generation X10 mini came with noise reducing earbud headphones with silicon cover that fit snug in the ear canal. I'll be writing SE on this.NICE COMPACT DESIGN - The phone fits comfortably in the hand and the QWERTY keyboard slides out smoothly with one hand and little effort.  The sliding action is better than previous generation X10 Mini Pro (black) and *much* better than the new \"txt pro\" (white) (both of which I also own).  The back of the phone is smooth hard plastic unlike the grippy surface on the X10 Black or slippery surface on the \"txt pro\" white.TWO SCREEN PROTECTORS INCLUDED - SE shouldn't have bothered to include the extra screen protector.  Only when I tried to apply it to the phone did I realize it already had one on *facepalm*.  The screen protector on the phone is almost flawlessly applied and covers the entire face of the phone edge-to-edge (again unlike the X10 which came with a protector that only covered the display).  It's not one of those used only to protect it for shipping and should last for months just like the extra protector would have had I not ruined it. *g*NO USER MANUAL - There's no user manual or detailed features/specifications. I guess SE assumes anyone purchasing the phone will do so through a retailer or will look up the information on the SE website. They should have provided a basic user manual.  Instead, SE prints 5 illustrations on the flaps of the box that show how to install the battery and sim, and power up...that's it.SETUP AND DAY OF USE------------------------------------------------------------BLOATWARE - This is software/apps that SE has preinstalled and that you can't uninstall.  These apps launch and run in the background ALL THE TIME and can't be killed using a task killer because the relaunch again. This uses up memory and reduces battery life. A customer should not have to root their phone in order to uninstall software apps.POOR BACKLIGHTING ON NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS - Numbers and symbols on the keyboard are blue, and the backlighting is barely visible/non-existent (worse even than the poor backlight on the x10 and \"txt pro\"). This makes the keyboard unusable in low light situations.COMPARING THE Mini Pro SK17a TO PREVIOUS GENERATION X10 Mini Pro------------------------------------------------------------In short, unless you need the faster processor and newer version of Android to run newer apps, then keep your X10 Mini Pro.  I'll probably keep using my X10 as my primary phone.- Worse QWERTY keyboard layout and poor backlighting on numbers/symbols- The phone is only slightly larger than the X10 (to accommodate the larger display and new features) but still fits comfortably in one hand or pocket.- Larger, higher resolution display- Power button is now slightly raised (as opposed to flush on the X10 which was inconvenient)- Added front facing camera- Added cover over the USB port- A single physical home button plus two touch sensitive \"buttons\" replaces the three physical buttons on the X10.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its Ok, but i think the product it's not NEW", "Author": "Alberto F.", "ReviewID": "R2DB00RHN4T28D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its Ok, but i think the product it's not NEW.

I bought this after doing research for 3 months to find the perfect phone. I thought that most of the phones available at the time were just too big - I had the EVO and wasn't very happy. This phone was perfect. It's just the right size to fit in my hand and my pocket. The slide out keyboard is great, but I don't use it all that often because I have a swiping screen keyboard. It is a good option if I'm wearing gloves or something. The keys are small so I wouldn't want to use the external keyboard all the time, but it works. The UI is great and the phone is eye-pleasing and easy to use. I don't miss 4g and since this takes GSM SIM cards, I've been able to try out a few different prepaid providers to see who offers me the best service. Cheap and easy, no contract with a cheap monthly payment. LOVE IT! I love that it has a place to attach cell phone jewelry because it makes my phone stand out next to all the iphones my friends have. I don't miss the screen space and can still read websites, write emails, and play games with this phone. I love that it has a physical home button as well as a 'back' and a 'settings' touch button.I bought a cheap plastic case from ebay for the phone, but realized that it made it look ugly and wasn't really necessary. I've dropped it a few times on the sidewalk and apart from a few cosmetic scratches, there was no damage done.

A friend of mine had a Sony phone that she had of many years, so I thought I should check out Sony. Plus this phone was featured in the new Spiderman movie (that didn't add any value, I just thought it was cool). Anyway, when comparing reviews of the phones available through AT&T;/Verizon/T-mobile this phone the Sony had the best reviews. It packed a lot of punch for a small phone (smallness was a selling point for me, I was tired of having a giant rectangle in my pocket). I used my phone as my primary camera so this fit the bill with its 5mp camera with flash. It takes great pictures! It was very user friendly up until the point when I wanted to set up the 3G. First, even though its an unlocked phone the only provider you can get full campacity from the 3G from is At&t.; Second, to actually get it to recieve the 3G takes a set up process which is not identified in the instructions that come with the phone. You need to google how to do it and I still ended up calling At&t.; They told me they don't usually assist with the set up of unlocked phones, but the guy helped me anyway. Third, the 3G connection is not reliable but when its strong its lightening fast. It clogs at times, but not often. I'm not sure that has anything to do with the phone. Might just be At&t.; All the positives: excellent sound quality and volume levels (I can actually hear the navigation assistant even when I have music on unlike the iphone and speaker phone is much better too), does almost everything the iphone does (I'm still exploring), highly responsive screen, qwerty key board is wonderful and I love the option to use the smart keyboard as well, voice activated searches/calls/texting without using an ap, you can connect it to any computer and just add music and other content without any special setup of software (so refreshing), love the set up of the home screen...I could go on.

I've looked at lower-end smartphones such as the HTC Explorer and the Samsung Galaxy Y as entry-level smartphones, but after looking at the specifications and negative reviews for those phones, I figured that I might as well invest in a phone that I will be using for a couple of years.So far, the phone has worked out great for me for the 4 weeks that I have had it so far. The GPS, using NavFree USA, has been super fast and reliable. I haven't had to worry about running out of room on this phone (I use a 16 GB card, maxing it out to 32 GB soon). It does all the basic functions (call, text, web) easily and reliably (and this is with a T-Mobile prepaid SIM card in the phone). The camera quality is great.The widgets on the home screens are removable if you want to change it up (unfortunately, there are some non-removable bloatware apps, like EA Games). The on board web browser and music player have much to be desired, however, but those can be replaced with Opera and Winamp for free from Google Play. The ability to upgrade from Gingerbread to ICS is also a good option, too (you end up having Facebook Inside Xperia and Norton Security disabled, but those were two bloatware apps, anyways).Overall, this has been a great replacement for my Nokia.

Solution?? remove the cover totally :)otherwise the phone still performs beautifully, even after adding quite a few apps to the mix. FB inside Xperia feature is great for syncing all my FB content to my contacts real time.~~~~~final review: been using the phone well over a year and i think its my best buy ever. drop it twice so far from about 2 feet each time, first landed flat on screen, second hit a corner and bounced around a bit ... no issues. I have turned off the 4G data to conserve battery so instead of half a day i can go 2 days on a charge now. also doesnt have tonnes of internal memory so move your nonessential apps over to the SD card to free up some space.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Xavi", "ReviewID": "R37HGPPIHTW81H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great phone its size, functions, applications and more.

I decided to go with the Sk17 due to the screen size and portability. Both are supposed to receive ICS so that was a plus for both.On to my review of the Sk17a.The device does not look cheap. Although its glossy white plastic. It feels strong and solid. I end up pressing more than i need to the keys in the keyboard but i guess thats because ive had a nokia n900 before. Not sure if i miss ICS on this device as it comes with 2.3.2 or .3 and now the device received 2.3.4 and via the pc companion software is supposed to receive ICS which i haven been able to install because the steps to do so are wrong. But i guess ill figure it out eventually. The device feels fast even with a Live Wallpaper (i use a matrix like one named\"digital wall free\"). Have already loaded whatsapp (which works pretty good) and viber (havent tested this one out) will load later on today Tango, Skype, Lync and others.Have tested PowerAmp (pro version) and works pretty good. Sound coming from the 3.5\" stereo jack is pretty good. Although i never use the earphones any cellphone comes with. I am actually using a pair of iGrado's, Bose Over The Ear and some Big Red Sony ones which i dont remember the model right now (purchased at costco) and the device seems to have pretty good output. No complains there. i user poweramp due to a lot of Flacs and Alacs i like to listen on a regular basis. I have loaded a 32gb Sandisk class 4 micro sd card which i swapped from a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" tablet. No problems when doing the swap.Unsure if the device was supposed to come the way it came. There was no foam or carton on the box. Still dont know if this device is new or refurbished with new covers. The contents of the box just were lose. The phone itself is not damaged or scratched.Really like the screen though its a 3\" one it seems enough (for now, probly i will order the xperia pro once i test this one on ics or a droid 3 unlocked).Will do an ics review once i get to install it on this thing.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson SK17A-WH Xperia Mini Pro SK17a", "Author": "jv", "ReviewID": "R2A0MVVAYI6V1O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this phone to use with T-Mobile network.Pros: 1.

Presson", "ReviewID": "R1M53AGWT2SNJP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a fairly dedicated sony fan I have to say I am very disappointed in this phone.  I bought it because of the raving reviews here on amazon and because I prefer android smartphones with keyboards.My previous phone was the HTC dream (aka G1), the first android smart phone (on the market in 2008), and I much preferred the HTC dream to this sony phone!  In fact, I had 2 of the HTC dreams and was hesitant to switch models but the HTC dream is no longer being made (and the refurbished versions haven't lasted long for me).Like folks have said, the screen on this sony phone is a bit small.  What this means is that when the phone is closed (ie keyboard not open) in portrait mode, the touchscreen keyboard that is offered to you is much like a traditional non-smartphone keyboard (ie, not qwerty). This is not too big of a deal, since you can always switch to landscape or open the keyboard.  But, it's still annoying.The battery life isn't as good as my HTC dream.  Ok, admittedly I hacked the HTC dream so that I was able to upgrade it to a v2 Android OS, which greatly improved battery life (possibly worked 2x longer than it did on the original Android OS that it came with). Still, I thought that since this phone was a good 2-3 years newer, the battery life would be better.  Bummer...Another problem with this phone is that it came with a bunch of bloatware (including several facebook apps that I can't delete, at least not without hacking the phone), and the applications available on the android market app were far fewer than those available on my HTC dream.  I am not sure why this is? Certainly one possibility would be to hack this phone as well (assuming you can still root androids) and that would take care of the bloatware.  I was just about getting to that point when the touchscreen stopped working properly.Which leads me to my final complaint, the touchscreen isn't working!!  Ok, it will work sometimes, when it feels like it, but not consistently.  I ofcourse tried turning it on/off a few times and removing the battery, but nothing has worked.Argh.  Rather than tinkering more, I will probably just buy a new (non-sony) phone.#####################Update 6/4/12:The touchscreen has fortunately resumed working.Two more complaints though: 1) the keyboard is not full qwerty, so you have to press a blue button prior to each # pressed on the keyboard (this makes twice as many buttons to press for entering phone numbers,etc); 2) I have had trouble charging this phone with more than one of the chargers we have at home.  Sometimes it is plugged in overnight and then dead in the morning. Even if it is initially off/dead, plugging it in to charge can cause it to turn on partway and then turn off again.  It endlessly repeats this cycle and fails to charge.  The latter problem could be a problem with our chargers, as these chargers were not oem. But, our other phones have not had such charging issues with non-oem chargers.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "boot", "ReviewID": "RFFNI3HN6PNGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro is perfect for me.

After almost 6 months of use, I am absolutely in love with this phone. The dimensions may still be a little unusual, but the performance is flawless. I LOVE the features, the quality. Have dropped it a few times on the concrete and no marks! It looks cool, radio and camera work well, messages are easy to type with the keyboard. The display is bright and crisp, and very responsive. Oh, and no need for the screen protector - the screen is scratch resistant. So, a 5-star product.This phone functions as described and technically I have no complaints. However, I am a bit disappointed by its dimensions. The screen is too small for comfortably surfing the web. Of course I know this is a phone and not a laptop, but the screen is too small nonetheless.Also, while talking, it feels too thick for its shortness. My concern is not the thickness itself (I expected a thicker phone), but rather the shortness of the phone. One would expect a longer phone to compliment this thickness. I think I would have liked a full sized Xperia better. Should have gone for that instead of hunting for a smaller phone.The battery life is average, I think it lasted almost 3 days on the full charge. I have talked very little but WiFi was constantly on. Now I have turned it off and seems like that would gain me another day of battery life (mind you I literally talk maybe 20 minutes total on the charge).Overall, a nice device technically.

To complete my inspection, the phone tags themselves show that the phone is the International version.  Very very misleading indeed...and one can conclude misleading selling practices. What a major disappointment.  Slight changes in the phone model from International (EUROPEAN) vs. United States version can be a difference with a phone functioning to its full capacity or NOT, due to differences in cell carrier frequencies.
