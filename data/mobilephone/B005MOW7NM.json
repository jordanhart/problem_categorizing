I can use it as I please - any operator, any country, no contract. This is great for money, time and environment.2. it is not too expensive for unlocked, no contract phone with so much functionality3. it is phone by form factor - easily pocket-able and light not a huge screen brick/pad4. it is phone by battery life - lasts days, not hours like other smart phones. There are days when I do not use it at all. So what would be the point of charging it for the sake of it5. it can be charged over standard USB cable - great for travel/work/anywhere - no need to worry about where to get charger or your \"special\" cable.6. can sync with Outlook properly and without the need for network or on-line service. USB cable is ideal - simple and safe. Does calendar, notes, tasks. Perfectly replaces aging but excellent Palm pilots. There is no way many people can share calendar and tasks ... with anybody, even if they wanted to7. works just fine without persistent internet connection - and you can disable data usage in one place to control your bill. In this respect it is better than most smartphones - you disable network services and it stops communicating - no exceptions8. does maps and navigation off-line - This is absolutely brilliant about Nokia - just download the maps you need and it works and does not need any data. This is low point of Android .. in my opinion9. No nonsense, logical User interface (UI) - well done to Nokia for fixing the bloat. It was pretty frustrating on older phones. This UI honestly works better than anything I've seen, including ICS10. talks to any bluetooth headset/headphones and GPS receiver - no other phone I know of can just do this ... especially external GPS - which saves power and you can place the receiver better than phone.11. can talk to wifi network when needed, and reliably ... connects to any network. Even those bizarre hotel setups where other not full computer devices fail.12. runs Skype reliably when needed while travelingAnything else is just great bonus: uSD card, PDF, fantastic screen, document reader, calculator, convertor for imperial measures, .... app shop is basic, but has more stuff than I'd put on a phoneCamera is not that great ... got way better quality + auto-focus on relatively old 3Mp cheaper feature phone. Not a major problem ... it is phone, not cameraI can recommend it to anybody looking for nice and light phone ... not a monster ...

It's clearly a Nokia design - bar form factor but with a touchscreen, very very thin, no huge screen or plastic construction. The chassis feels very sturdy. I have been put off with the \"bigger is better\" trend in current smartphones - this phone is perfect for me.The display is gorgeous. Comparable to my roommate's Galaxy S2, but not as bright. Battery life is okay, but the phone will die within a day and a half of heavy 3G/gaming.Speaker is loud and clear, louder than my iPod Touch. The \"lip\" design worried me but is much more subtle in person. Phone came with a 4GB microSD card plugged in for some reason, which was a nice bonus; the support of 32GB microSD cards was a big selling point for me.Symbian Belle is great. It's definitely not Android, but I like it more than iOS - it's polished and very customizable. There is a severe lack of Apps in the Ovi store, so if you're the kind of person that likes 5 different Fart apps, this phone isn't for you. Nokia tries to integrate some things with their Ovi \"suite\" but the implementation seems half-assed. Probably because they've given up on Symbian and switched to Windows Phone, which I think is a huge mistake after using this phone. Symbian has just started coming into it's own. Browser is much improved over previous Symbian versions, but from what I can tell, still slow compared to other mobile browsers.In the end, it's a nice mid-range smartphone with great functionality; it's not superduper quadcore with a discrete GPU, but it's got a solid smartphone feature set and great design. The price is maybe a bit high, but the phone is quite new to the market.I found these specs and review helpful when deciding to buy:[...][...]", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent price-quality ratio cell", "Author": "Nicola", "ReviewID": "R2Q6D5I9Q0WVBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great phone, very easy and intuitive to use thanks to the operating system that brings Nokia, it is also faster because it has 512MB of RAM, has all the necessary applications for what you need in a cell, is a good buy if looking for a decent phone that is commensurate to the mobile world of today", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good phone indeed. Is it the right one for you?", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R12ROA2XPED0KB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my phone the first week of June. I needed an unlocked, contract-free phone and I wanted it to have manufacturer warranty, valid in the US. I discarded the \"latest and greatest\", either for their price, size or lack of US warranty, and started looking for a so called mid-range smartphone. My search was over when I found this one at Amazon for $204.I admit price was its top selling point. But I can tell you today without hesitation that I end up with much more than I bargained for because this is indeed a very good phone. In my humble opinion, it has excellent build quality, excellent call quality, comprehensive and easy to use software (not as fancy as an iphone but easy to use nevertheless), a full year Nokia warranty valid in the US, and the right price, size and weight. And it is a fast phone with an impressive display.Please keep in mind my opinion is determined by my specific needs, so when I say \"comprehensive\" is because I'm thinking about contacts, calendar, instant messaging, Skype, e-mail, MS office documents, web browsing, maps, 3G, Wi-Fi, voice commands and so on and so forth. I don't pay too much attention to other stuff like camera, video, games, music and the whole \"social\" thing (with the exception of Twitter, which I use as an alternative source of news), and even at this point I can say it is very easy to take and share pictures and video, and their quality is good, especially the video. And when I say \"the right size and weight\" is even more subjective: ladies wouldn't mind much about some extra inches and grams in their already overloaded purses, but when we, old-school (definitively no purse) gentlemen have to slip our phones in our pockets, then they do matter.Of course, it is not perfect. Some might find the screen to be too little for their sight or their hands. Other might find its battery life to be short.I have found myself wishing for bigger fonts in some applications, such as WhatsApp (it is my current understanding that only its iphone version allows selecting a bigger font). As for writing, is not really hard. The phone comes with a very good prediction and correction software that practically fixes every mistake and works in English, Spanish and French. Even so, it took me a couple of weeks to get used to the landscape full QWERTY keyboard. In portrait mode I discarded the QWERTY keyboard (way too little) and I'm using the traditional alphanumeric keypad, which allows me to write single handed, once again thanks to software. The phone automatically switches from alphanumeric keypad to landscape full keyboard depending on the way you hold it.As for battery life, so far I've always got home with some charge left in it, even in my busiest days, with lots of calls, messages and e-mails coming and going, but no YouTube, Facebook or Angry Birds. And for those of you who like to have their phone \"up to date\", a word of advice regarding the Belle Feature Pack 1 (FP1) software update: remember the old southern saying \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". Some people are complaining about reduced battery life and some other problems after upgrading their phone to Belle FP1. I think the phone is fast enough as it is and there is no need to sacrifice battery life to get a faster phone, which seems to be the most appealing feature of this pack.So, briefly stated this is the right phone, for me. I hope this information help you decide if it is also right for you.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": ">>>Nokia 700 is certainly a tiny smartphone<<<", "Author": "Clovis Rondon", "ReviewID": "R34BT60YYNLWC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After have a C3-01 this was my best upgrade cell phone, Purchased 3 Month ago,  i`m very glad with the impressive quality of the plataform Symbian Belle. After update my cell to FP2 Belle is definitely the best Symbian version by far. thanks to the decent 1.3GHz processor, the gorgeous ClearBlack screen, the colours pop beautifully. The contrast is sharp and, as you might expect, blacks are deep. It's truly a delicious screen, despite the small size.VerdictBelle Feature Pack 2 is likely to be the very last major update to Symbian OS and it's a bit of a 'curate's egg' if I'm honest. I'm glad it's out, there are plenty of splendid features, but there are weak points to the whole OS that remain weak and there are silly bits missing (e.g. auto-correct in the keyboard) that really need patching via Sw_update sooner rather than later.Does Belle FP2 take Symbian to the same level as iOS, Android and Windows Phone in terms of user interface speed and fluidity? Sometimes. Is Symbian's UI a showstopper,  Absolutely not. The OS shows its age occasionally, but Belle FP2 is largely a smooth and pleasant experience, especially if you know what you're doing and you fill in some of the weak points with third party applications: Opera Mobile, Gravity and so on.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Call Quality and Functionality", "Author": "GAZ RIVERA", "ReviewID": "R2QIBD5CJJ8MXZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I use the phone with ATT service in TEXAS and have used it in other countries were an 850/GSM network is available.I have been using nokia cellphones for the past 7 years without any major complaint.

The size of the phone is exactly the same as Sony Xperia.If you want a BIGGER phone, then go ahead and purchase the Nokia LUMIA Line or the N9 (Or go extreme with Samsung sII or SIII). I wouldve given anything to have a better battery-life spec. It seems that every time you use the phone, you have to be checking if the battery is at least 40% full. If you leave it overnight at 40% you wont have any battery life for the next day. Guaranteed. I never had this issue with other phones.I have not tested it on All-day Data Plans (GPRS/EDGE/3G networks) due to my SIM restrictions (locally and internationally). You would, probably, have battery-life issues with this type of connectivity.

For what I use it, I have all the apps I could possibly need.The big pluses for this phone are:+ light and small+ very well built+ the Nokia implementation of haptic response is superb (the phone surface vibrates underneath your finger)+ good reception and really good voice quality+ excellent phone book, calendar, connectivity (will do 3G with T-Mobile), WiFi is great+ free voice navigation and maps for practically all the world without the need for data plan for the lifetime of the device with no strings attached.The notable negatives (nitpicking)- the screen is tight for frequent typing (get Swipe, works great!)- the camera is just OK, but still it is a phone- not many NFC enabled peripherals available- the updates for the operating system take long time to be distributed.Overall, an excellent phone if you are looking for a small phone with great organization capability.

Worked perfectly fine with my plan, and AT&T;'s HSPA network. Web browser is quite decent, and so is the included E-mail client (I have 2 mailboxes set up to pull from an Exchance ActiveSync account, and a Gmail IMAP4 account, and they both work quite well). The maps application is okay... voice  guidance is definitely a nice perk to have, especially for free.The onboard SIP support integrated into the phone app is a MAJOR perk... in fact, it is the reason I switched to a T-mobile plan, with only 100 included minutes but unlimited texting and 5 GB of data. Using an SIP provider, I can place cheap / sometimes free calls over either WiFi or 3G (which is actually VERY decent on T-mobile's HSPA+ network over here... stable and low latency, and enough bandwidth for a G.729 IP call).The Bad:- Occasional random restarts -> I do NOT background much if anything myself, with the exception of maybe the mail daemon that has to run to pull my email. Nonetheless, I have occasionally had the phone just quit and reboot of its own free will, with no explanation as to why...- Network connectivity -> This is a MAJOR problem, and is plaguing Nokia 700 (and I think other Symbian Belle users) on T-mobile USA. I have gone through a Mobile Broadband SIM card, and a regular Monthly4G voice SIM card on my phone (both prepaid), but both have a peculiar issue where the 3G connection simply hangs / crashes (the entire 3G modem firmware basically completely crashes, leaving a seemingly good signal strength indication, but calls, texts, and data calls all fail to go through. I have tried deleting/re-configuring APN's, changing network mode, but the problem persists... the ONLY bulletproof solution is to reboot the phone completely. And yes, I DO check for software updates, which brings us to.... *drumroll*:- Software updates -> It seems that this phone, being an UNLOCKED and DE-BRANDED device DIRECT from Nokia still isn't worthy of the Feature Pack 1 upgrade, when da*n near half the Nokia 700/701/630's out there have gotten the update over-the-air / through Ovi Suite already. No such luck for me... both Nokia Ovi Suite and the on-board updates app repeatedly lie to me, saying that my software is in the latest version. Nokia seems as oblivious to this issue as to the one regarding the network connectivity issue...- Battery Life -> I have 2 push e-mail accounts, but beyond that, my usage is quite light (maybe 2 - 3 short calls/day, and a few texts, all done in NYC... a VERY strong signal area for the most part). I rarely if ever use the camera / video features, and about the only apps I use are the mail and web browser apps... nonetheless, the battery seems to have a tendency to run down completely in about 15 - 20 hours at the MOST (mind you, this with NO backgrounding of apps). Additionally, Nokia, I would sincerely ask you to FIRE the developer who thought it would be a smart idea to remove any numerical indication of battery life remaining (percentage? time? hello...?) About the only gauge I have to measure / estimate battery capacity is the HORRID graphical battery charge indicator on the top panel, and it is bloody inaccurate (I have tried calibration...). The Nokia Battery app from the Ovi store is marginally better, but pretty much ALL the battery apps disagree regarding the percentage of charge remaining... wonderful, isn't it?Nokia, if you're listening, PLEASE either push out an OTA software update to fix the network connection issues... the LEAST I expect when paying for an unlocked phone is that it can make, well, PHONE calls, and remain RELIABLY connected to the cellular network, without crashing something like 3 - 5 times per day for no good reason. If you cannot do this, the least your company can do is offer refunds and/or exchanges for other models (I for example an PERFECTLY willing to pay the extra cash for an upgrade to the N9, as from what I've read so far, at least its cellular radio firmware stack is not ridden with holes like swiss cheese...", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "small but fast and cool", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "R1JRDU040IYSYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little guy is amazing and great, new Nokia Belle is smooth with many features like any top smartphone, behaves better than its former versions, great construction love display colors, definitely a good gift or a second phone.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really decent phone for the price", "Author": "FranzCTL", "ReviewID": "RYWEJBVIO9R8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product a while ago, and im still enjoing it.Really decent phone for the price, sometimes it freezes for a while and you have to reboot it, but overall im really satisfied with the product.Some important details, if you dont mind to have a little screen compared to todays  phones, its not heavy at all and perfect size to take everywhere and styleish so you dont feel like a low gama phone.Overall A great phone.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Jesus Octavio Rodriguez Olvera", "ReviewID": "R10JL8TRBCYIHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Slim and fast, the cell looks so great and feels like you will break it hahahahaha. sometimes the cellphon turn off becuse i put it on my pocket, but now i bought a case so hopefully it will not turn off again.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Liked it, but the phone was just too small for me.", "Author": "Book efficianado", "ReviewID": "R2UAJ2FSOVYT4A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I tried using this phone for about a month, and I found that the size was the major issue for me.

I can use maps and text/voice navigation without turning on my data connection and paying for the data usage. Works much faster than Google Maps on Android, though you do need to download what you need ahead of time.-- Good power and data-saving features-- Easy to turn data and wifi on/off.-- Data tracker lets me set a limit on data usage, in case I forget to turn the data off.-- Easy to use software for PC sync (Nokia Suite)-- Easily slips into a pocket - I often forget it's there.-- UI is easy to use and customizable, very similar to Android-- Battery life is better than any of the Android phones I've had.-- I've had clear reception for voice calls, but I think that depends a lot on the carrier and your location.Cons:-- Small screen-size (obviously). This thing is tiny, but I like not having that extra bulk to tote around.-- Not a lot of available apps compared to Android or iOS-- Background processes can eat data quickly if you're not careful - not a problem if you're on an unlimited plan, but dangerous if you're paying for usage. Be sure to set up those usage limits, and to reset the limit before you turn the data back on.-- The OS seems to freeze at times. It usually resolves itself, but I've had to reboot occasionally-- Social apps are only so-so.To sum up, I'm very pleased with this phone, especially given what I paid for it.

The fiddley S60 interface of the mid-2000's is gone. The new Symbian Belle (Feature Pack 2) looks more like Android than anything else, and it is built from the ground up for touch.This little baby slips in a shirt pocket and you'll completely forget that it's there. You have all the power of a top tier smart phone - apps, web browsing, total integration of e-mail/calendar/contacts whether you are on Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, or corporate MS Exchange. All in a package that's about the size of two matchbooks stood end-to-end.For US customers - this phone will work on the fast 3G+ networks on both T-Mobile and AT&T; - so take your pick. (These are the networks which the carriers commonly call their \"4G\" networks. Not to be confused with LTE - which this phone doesn't have.) I regularly get 2 to 4 gbps speeds on T-Mobile, just to give you an indication of what is possible.Another plus is that the reception on this phone is way above average. Places where an HTC phone can barely hold on to a signal, will be rock solid with three bars on the Nokia.Yes the screen is small (that's the point of the phone), so don't buy this as your primary means to browse the internet. Instead, download the Jokiu hot spot application and use this to provide a wifi signal to your laptop and do your browsing there.For me, this is the perfect second phone.

The notifications feature in Symbian Belle is very nice, and also provides convenient access to settings for your data connection, wifi, bluetooth, and profile (normal, silent, etc...).Front-facing speaker is nice for watching videos without headphones, and the support for a variety of media formats is very nice... for example, I have a number of Xvid videos that work fine. I'm not generally a fan of the 640x360 resolution on Symbian^3 phones, but the smaller physical screen on this device results in a higher dpi than other models with physically larger screens.Support for ActiveSync makes this a nice work cell phone, if you happen to be using MS Exchange for calendaring, email, etc...Games performance is great... Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja are very responsive and look great on this screen.One other essential app is 'JoikuSpot' for using your data connection to provide a wifi hotspot for other devices in a pinch, and of course 'Swype' is great for texting on touchscreen-only phones.Wifi support also seems to be improved, vs previous Symbian^3 releases... I had an N8 and E7, before Symbian Anna was released in the US, and those phone seemed to have a problem with saving hidden wifi, and reconnecting automatically... but the Nokia 700 doesn't seem to have any issues with connecting/reconnecting to my hidden dd-wrt wifi, using WPA2-PSK, AES encryption, etc... and I'll see how it does with WPA2-Enterprise when I take this phone to work.The speed-dialing implementation is also nice, if you haven't seen it before on Symbian phones. You can basically just start punching in numbers/letters on the 0-9 phone keypad, and get possible completions of phone numbers and/or alphanumeric contact names, rather than bothering with browsing through the contacts app.Symbian Belle has some very nice improvements over previous Symbian^3 releases, and the people who love Symbian and unlocked phones will appreciate how much you can customize and tweak all kinds of settings to suit your own tastes.Finally, this is a pentaband GSM smartphone, compact, and streamlined, excellent design, the usual Nokia hardware quality, and aesthetics.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "R1AN0O0YO94FFS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used Symbian devices in the past and wanted to try out the new Symbian Belle OS.

At one point I was in the Southern United States with friends, looking for a meeting-point, and the phone told me my location was Antarctica. No kidding, that's what it showed on the display. Routes would be abandoned halfway to driving somewhere; apps using the GPS would crash.The phone started seizing up frequently and needed restarting to get it working... this process would take at least 10 minutes. Imagine if you needed to place an urgent call! Text messages would fail to get through, calls would be dropped, just about every error imaginable. The mail program would cause the device to hang and the browser became all but unusable. People would try to call me and complain that my phone was always off when it was in fact on at the time and appeared to be in working order.I heard today in the news that Nokia's cellphone business has been bought out.

After many months of use, I finally got the hang of it. I don't think I'll be so lucky with the 700. Everything I've learned about using a symbian OS is out the window. Symbian Belle is a nightmare.
