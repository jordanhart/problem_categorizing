It arrived in a box and appeared to be new. Imagine her disappointment on Christmas day when she activated the phone and it would not work. I had charged the battery fully, and was very familiar with how to work this phone. When you tried to make or receive a call it would simply power down. We called Verizon repeatedly and they checked settings etc. I was told that it was a faulty device and to try to return it if possible. Not only was I shocked, but felt I was completely lied to when Verizon also told me the phone was not new and provided me with the previous account/phone holders phone # and dates of activation. I was promptly credited for the phone return, but will NEVER buy electronics through Amazon again.

The outside (touch screen still works) but why have a phone that only half works.  Tried for couple days to email Amazon and their website was down. Want to exchange the phone  but after getting through by email, all they did was sent me a return label, to return the phone.

I probably will order from you again if you handle other carriers. Verizon's customer service via their collections department called me every day for three weeks on someone elses account- which they know legally I can not respond to or be asked to do. This was pure harrassment on a long term existing customer with good credit- very bad choice. Due to the lies they told me while I was trying to get these irritating calls to me stopped and this resolved I do not need their service or this phone for their services. Good buy but I can not use it.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad phone", "Author": "Scott C.", "ReviewID": "R2Y6PIETSSARA9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got first one in the mail did not work got the second one did not work so will not purchase this customer again.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "lg vx10000 voyager", "Author": "scray", "ReviewID": "RC4XPL7JK3VL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i would not recomend this phone or this web site to anyone!
