Lets start with when an incomming call comes in,  phone refuses to answer the call,  I have to wait until it goes to voice mail then call the caller back.  Screen randomly goes blank when trying to dial or make calls.  There is apparently some sort of sensor that makes it think I have it up to my ear when I don't so the screen goes blank until I hold the phone at the right angle in the light.  Randomly changes settings on it's own,  for example one day it just started loudly anouncing every call that was comming in even when the volume was turned completely down to vibrate.  It randomly calls people on my contact list when it  is not even in a pocket,  or a purse.  It will be sitting on my bedroom dresser and decide to call my aunt at  2 am unless I have it completely turned off.  Imagine getting frantic calls from relatives because they think you are having an emergency in the middle of the night,  and having the police show up to check on you because someone called 911 on your behalf thinking you were having an emergency because who calls at  2 a.m. unless  it is an emergency.

There is nothing good about it. Approximately 7 months later I wish I would've spent my money elsewhere. This phone is very slow and lags constantly. The GPS has hardware problems and rarely works. Lots of people have complained about it on the tmobile support forums. Another bug is when pushing the unlock button it sometimes takes a screenshot. After the stock O.S. crashed on me, I tried out cyanogen mod. This made the phone faster but it still sucks really bad. It's not like LG missed the boat on this one. It's more like LG caught the boat, set it on fire, and let it sink before it even left the harbor.

I was so excited, and due to this I didn't really pay attention to its shortcomings when I first bought it. I bought it when I was on break from college, and when I went back is when I realized this phone I thought was amazing was actually horrible.CONS-constantly freezes-constantly force closes-constantly shuts off-screen goes black during phone calls-phone is laggy-tad bulky-touch screen is both sensitive and non-responsive at times-resolution is not the worst but could be better-delivers messages at random sometimesThe Only reason it has two stars is because i am satisfied when the phone does work properly, which is only about 25% of the time (and that is a generous amount). And it only works properly when i'm listening to music or recording something. With that being said, It's a nice phone if you don't do a lot with it. If you're like me, and you text, call, email, facebook, tweet, play games, and use other apps,like gps and things in which you need quick service,  this is not a good investment.

In the beginning it was exciting but eventually I found out how annoying it was to use on a daily basis. Using this for more than a year now and I have to say that it really gives a negative impact on the whole Android thing.PROS- It has a QWERTY keyboard, which is always useful when you don't feel like handling the touchscreen.- Has the Android Swype feature (which you can turn off if you wish).- My phone came with all the necessary accessories: wall charger, USB charging cord.- If you're not looking for a large phone, this might be for you. It's pretty much as large as the iPhone 4 (and under).- The phone supports animated wallpapers.- It can capture screenshots (power button+home button). Took me a while to figure this out, but I did it on accident once and I have been excited since.- Picture quality is decent, it was better than my previous phone (Blackberry Curve 8520 had no flash, myTouch Q does).- Video quality is decent as well and it picked up my voice and projected it loudly even though I wasn't talking too loud while recording.- I've dropped the phone a few times and it hasn't cracked or broken. I've forgotten it's been in my back pocket a couple times and sat down, and it hasn't cracked or anything. Overall I think this is a sturdy phone.CONS- With time, this phone becomes more and more laggy. It takes a good 5 seconds for the phone to react to your touch (for example if you were to open an application). 5 seconds doesn't seem too severe, but just count to 5 and you'll see how annoying that would be if everything you did on the phone takes that long.- For some reason my phone's gallery always have issues loading. Nowadays, I rarely ever take pictures on this phone unless I'm sending it right away (with the share button or attaching files through text). When I try to open my gallery it just keeps trying to load and never does. And before you say that I was being impatient, I've waited for it to load for at least 10 minutes once so it wasn't for the lack of trying. I've tried restarting my phone, terminating the gallery app through the task killer app...but to no avail.- When my friend sends me text messages that contain photos, I have to download the file and then open it. This I do not have much of an issue with. What I do have issues with is that once downloaded and I press to enlarge the picture, it becomes some sort of video that lasts from 10-15 seconds (meaning it's pretty much the picture, but it lasts 15 seconds complete with backwards, forwards, and pause buttons). I don't know why it does this and I have no idea how to make it stop doing this. And even that's not what I have an issue with. The biggest issue with this is that the photo turns out to not enlarge to the whole screen, but is barely larger than before I pressed to enlarge it (and there is no way to zoom). The picture is even smaller if the photo/text message had a photo and text in the same message. The only method of getting around this is saving the photo onto the phone/SD card and looking at it from the gallery but...refer to the con before this one.- Turning on and off the phone takes a very long time, at least a few minutes. Some of the times it got frozen at the Android logo for at least 10-15 minutes and I would have to try and restart the phone again. Once I turned it off, but I realized the next day that it was still on but the screen was black, but there were small indications where I could tell that it was still on. Not only that, but the battery was hot, as if it was working the phone overtime just to keep the screen black.- Although this goes for many smartphones all around, this phone is a battery eater. I didn't even last a full school day (at the time I was going to school around 8:30-3:45, give a take an hour or two before and after for the drive, etc)without it dying on me before I got to my last class. I had to download an app to extend the battery life, which is ideal for any Android but I feel like this phone just didn't last nearly as long as any other one.- The color quality on this phone doesn't nearly compare to anything else I have. From my iTouch to my Kindle and my laptops and desktops...this phone just isn't up to par with any of them. I compared the same app (at the time Draw My Thing was all the craze) between this phone and my iTouch 4th gen and my iTouch had better quality picture and color than the myTouch Q. Now that I have the Kindle Fire HD (which is also an Android...to show that I am not Apple biased by any means), the Kindle's picture and color quality dominates this phone.- The 911 emergency call button is so easy to push on accident. I must have accidentally almost called them hundreds of times (meaning I pressed the emergency button but I didn't press the call button), and I did accidentally call them at least a few times (which I proceeded to smash the end call button like my life depended on it).- If you hold home screen for too long (say if you were trying to open an app on your home screen) it activates the editing tool to move your apps around. This doesn't sound annoying but with a laggy phone, sometimes it registers your touch for too long and then it activates it. Also, my wallpaper responds to touch so sometimes I like to play around with it and the editing stuff activates.- It is a little on the heavy side. It weighs at least 1/2-3/4 my Kindle and my Kindle is much much larger. But it can be a good thing...feels sturdy unlike many other phones out there that feel like they're about to break in two seconds.Although there are many cons to this phone, it does do what a phone should do...like call and text, etc. If you're not too picky with the small qualms then get the phone. I am just listing off things that have been bothering me for the longest time. Some of these things don't seem important but they just keep coming up time and time again, which gets me agitated (after about the 500th time it happens). I think the largest setback for me is how much lag I experience with this phone and the gallery problem. I really can't enjoy the phone when everything takes so long to open or load...and what's the point of having a nice camera when the gallery doesn't open!?The battery life was annoying at first, till I downloaded the app that extended the life from less than 1 day to at most 3 days till I have to recharge.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Past its prime", "Author": "Allison R", "ReviewID": "R2PY4506CHWR02", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone will get you by, but don't expect greatness from it. When I first got this phone it was pretty stellar but after about a year and a half, I've noticed the quirks (read: issues) piling up. I guess most people would have traded in for a newer, faster, better model as soon as they were eligible for an upgrade but my motto's always been if it isn't broken then don't fix it. Unfortunately it's gotta be replaced soon because it's almost becoming more of a bother than it's worth.First, there's the 911 button. So your phone will lock itself up (as all do these days) but the screen for unlocking it will have a handy 911 button towards the bottom. All it takes is a bump on the power button to light the screen up and a nudge on that big green button to call 911. Butt-dialing emergency services, which I have had the misfortune to experience many times, is one of the most embarrassing things ever.Second, there's spontaneous freezing. I guess the system can only handle loading a webpage or the photo gallery every once in a blue moon, and the longer you own the phone, the worse it gets. Sometimes hitting the home button will cause it to pause a few seconds and then close out whatever it's struggling with, but sometimes you just gotta take the battery out of the back because that sucker will stay frozen interminably. Tried to get coupons on it while checking out at Target once, the little POS made me pay full price because it had to freeze up and stop cooperating.Third, the camera. I'll take a picture of something with my phone and then my friend will take the same picture, in the same lighting, with an iPhone 4s - guess which one looks crappier? The flash on this phone is blueish-colored and that makes photos kind of alien-looking. If you don't have the flash on, expect a lot of blurriness. It simply struggles to focus. Compared to older phone cameras it's really nice, but it just can't keep up with what's out now. Nice for scary Halloween photos, though. My dog, dressed as a fairy princess this year, looked absolutely demonic in the pictures I took because of that blue flash.Those were just a few examples of the mediocrity my phone has become. My friend's iPhone 4s (which he has had for the same length of time I've had my LG C800) has remained as functional and useful as it was the day he got it, but mine has been on its deathbed for the past 8 months. It wants to slip away and let it all end, the miserable ins and outs of texting and calling and web surfing, but I won't let it, damn me. Soon, though. Soon.Pros:+Awesome keyboard (for out-texting your yuppie friend's iPhone while he mashes the touchscreen with his sausage fingers)+It calls people (though sometimes people you didn't actually dial, like 911)+It texts people (though sometimes the swype function likes to make things awkward for you - \"plate in the oven\" became \"slave in the oven\" once... not cool, phone! I just use the keyboard now)+It goes on the Internet (for intimidating your tech-illiterate relatives who still carry flip phones around)+It's got great GPS (Google Maps is useful and it won't drive you onto airport runways like iPhone's navigation will)Cons:+It's moody (freezes, closes things out, refuses to send texts, spontaneously ends calls)+It's never updated (paleontologists have discovered its OS in dirt where dinosaur bones were found... so damn old)+Crappy camera (often terrifying blue and/or blurry photos)+Genius button (the most ironic name they could have given it... it's worse than useless)+That egg-sucking, damnable 911 button (what were they thinking?!)", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
