{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inexpensive Phone", "Author": "dgreen", "ReviewID": "R7DX6W52V8XQA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Service from company was excellent.  Product arrived prior to estimated delivery date and was as ordered.  The phone itself works fine, but it is an inexpensive phone and you get what you pay for.  Major issue I have with this phone is that the numbers on the key pad are difficult to see because they are stamped in a green color that is not very visible, especially if there is not a lot of light in the room.  Sound quality is adequate and ease of use is just fine.  Digital screen does not have great resolution but it is sufficient to make out the information.  I did have to play with the background in order to pick a background that did not  distort images on the screen.  For this type of product I have no complaints and the product met my expectations.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Silly", "Author": "Stephan Davis", "ReviewID": "R3P607CBL0G1YR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for about $30, so what can I expect? My initial review was fully negative, but I like it as a backup cell and alarm clock now. But still, the manual is written by someone who does not speak English and does not have a logical mind -- you know, cannot follow a simple sequence like \"press button X in order to Y, then press button Z in order to ...\". I still cannot figure out how to lock/unlock the keyboard to avoid butt-dialing because there is no explanation in the manual and the onscreen instructions are nonsensical. The menus are non-intuitive or circular. Should it not be simple to tell if there is an unread text message, and then simple to read? Using the speaker phone should be one step so that it is simple to answer the phone on speaker, but no such luck.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00699Z7FE"}}
