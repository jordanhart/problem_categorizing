{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Helpful Tips for this phone!", "Author": "Victoria MacKenzie-Richert", "ReviewID": "R24XVDL4RNKEA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are some issues that many of you are having with your phones. I figured out ways to cirumvent most of these problems.1. Poor battery life: When the phone first gets activated/boots up, a diolouge pops up, informing you about the Connections Optimizer Service. You really have no option but to accept it. However, What you need to do after you accept it is: 1) Click on the far right button on the navigation panel. 2) Hit \"Settings\". 3) Under Wireless and Networks, hit \"More\". 4) Click \"Mobile Networks\". 5) Click \"Connections Optimizer\". 6) Uncheck the box.2) Issues with the actual battery: It doesn't seem that Kyocera ships with the faulty battery stickers anymore. I thoroughly checked my battery, and the only thing was the \"PULL\" tab on the battery itself. This is also handy for pulling the battery out after random shutdowns.3) Overloaded RAM. It seems that many random shutdowns are caused by overloaded RAM or processor chips. All you have to do to solve this is click on the icon with the two boxes, and swipe away any apps you're not using, or need. This will clear out some RAM. (For instance, on my phone, Maps always starts when I boot the device. I dunno why...)4) A few other reviews have said that the keyboard is a bit hard to operate. After using different methods, I've discovered that it's best to use the physical keyboard as if you were using an on-screen one, that is, with the pads of your thumbs instead of your thumbnails. Old popular slider phones like, say, the LG Rumour, or (from personal experience) the TracFone LG T-401-G, required use of your fingernails to operate the tiny keys. The keys on this phone, however, are larger, and therefore do better with a more flat, even-pressured approach.Generally, my tip would be \"Be patient with this phone. It's a sort of low-end phone, which means that the Nexus, and even some of the other Virgin phones can leave this one in the dust\".There are also some apps I'd like to suggest:1) Start using custom launchers. I'm using Atom, but you could also use Nova, Apex, Go, ADW, or Zeam launcher. Some launchers have special add-on apps that let you control your phone. Go Launcher is the biggest example of this, with roughly 10 add-on apps to choose from.2) An app I've found useful is Onavo. It helps squeeze more data out of your connection so your 2.5GB 3G speeds last longer through the month! In two days it has saved 3 MB. Also, using WiFi will help for when you're at home.3) Custom Browser App. There are dozens to choose from. Dolphin, Maxthon, Chrome, Firefox, Opera ect. Choose one that will make you happy. Unless you use IE, there is a corresponding Android app for your browser, which usually means you can sync your settings, bookmarks, and other goodies between your computer and cellphone. Also, it may result in faster browser speeds.In conclusion, I encourage you to buy this phone and really play around with it. I have not rooted it yet, and likely won't, but I seem to be getting along with it just fine. Android is great because if you break it, you can Factory Reset it. Assuming you didn't do anything drastic to it (which if you didn't root it, would be highly unlikely) you should be fine.Embrace Android.

Kane - living through history\"", "ReviewID": "R3H7ME560RCV8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this phone for a few days, but it seems to me that this phone is a solid, if not fantastic, value.Background (skip this section if you want - I'm big on context)First, I am new to smart phones - which is the customer profile that this phone targets. But not entirely. I lived overseas for several years for a few months at a time, constantly going back and forth - four months there, two months here, -those kinds of increments - until a couple of years ago.  So I owned an Ipod Touch (4g) which I tethered to a Mi-Fi card when in the United States.  In addition, I had a tiny tiny cell phone over seas which functioned on a month to month basis. So, here in the United States I also had a cheap cheap cheap cell phone using various prepaid services, the last being Tracfone, that I used for when I landed in the United States. The Ipod Touch gave me Iphone type of experience - and provided me a smart device as I was on the go, but technically speaking it is not a smart phone.The old saying is: the poor man always pays twice (once for junk and a second time when the junk breaks). True to the saying, I've probably bought a half dozen phones over the last few years - in ten, twenty or even 40 dollar increments. Maybe one of those phones worked for an entire year, but not many. I'm sure I've spent over $100, but not much over that, on cheap phones. The last one, the LG 800 touch became increasingly inoperable and I found it difficult to do simple functions, like making phone calls.Anyway - I now appear to be in the U.S., more or less on a permanent basis. So I could think about moving up market and into a smart phone. For over a decade I've dreamed of owning a device that provided what I call \"total digital convergence\": all functionality in one device: phone, audio, video, reader, surf the internet, office applications, etc... all in one device.  I think that device probably now exist in the Samsung Note (and no, the size doesn't bother me, it attracts me - you need a screen over 5 inches to have satisfying reader and video experience) but that's a big investment and its in the Android eco system - since I am familiar with the Apple eco system experience, I wanted to try a cheap but solid android smart phone that would hopefully work for an entire year or more. Maybe in another year apple will offer a device with a five inch screen and I'll have a choice there too. I am cheap, especially with regard to recurring cost, so I prefer shelling a few bucks and buying the phone out right first and then prepaying at the minimum possible as I go along. I'd like to pay $20 or less a month, but that's not possible, but Virgin mobile provides an opportunity to pay very little and I can shut down in a months notice again if I end up going back overseas.On the market for this product:The choice of android versus apple is a huge one because you are choosing between eco systems. I knew the Apple ecosystem through my Ipod Touch, so I was looking for an inexpensive android phone that would give me some experience in that eco system to help prepare me for choosing a premium phone down the line. But I also wanted other experiences. I am unsatisfied with the way you type text into an Iphone. So, I wanted to try using a device that provided a hard qwerty keyboard and android swipe to see if I preferred that experience.Overall I am very satisfied with this product so far.  It is only $100 dollars. Let me repeat that: it's only $100. The closest device offered in this area of the market is the LG Optimus Slider.  Target and Best Buy is still selling this device for $180, Radio Shack for $140. I actually bought one of these from Walmart for $129, but after tax, I was up to $142. I took it home a played with it a bit. The next day I saw news that this phone was coming out, so I immediately returned the Optimus Slider to Walmart. Straight Talk, Net Ten and Virgin Mobile, and others, all sell the Slider,usually for $180. Other comparable devices are sold for less, but without the hard qwerty key board - the Optimus Slider appears to be the best of the breed for low cost Androids, but with slower CPUs, smaller screens, and older versions for Android than the Kyocera Rise.That makes the Kyocera Rise a game changer for the market. Compared to these other bottom end Android devices, it seems like twice the product at half the price. It looks, feels and operates like it should cost double these other devices, but it doesn't, it cost less, and after taxes, almost half as much as the slider.I should note: Boost also offers an Android smart phone for significantly less (maybe $70 or $80 or so), with slide out qwerty keyboard - this is a good option, but the screen is only around 3 inches, the cpu is slower and the android version is older and you will have to pay $50 a month, though Boost will reduce cost if you pay consistently on time. For bottom feeders like me, but who prefer a small phone, this is an interesting option, but not for me (if I go back overseas, I will have to quit paying and I don't want the smaller screen).The Product:The Rise is a poor man's Iphone (keep in mind the new Iphone 5 will be announced next week). It has a 3.5 inch screen, Android 4.0 - which is much better than 2.3 in feel and operation. The screen is a bit grainier than Apple's retina, but reasonable to cope with. Other than the graininess of the screen you will hardly feel like you are using a much cheaper device than the Iphone (or in my case, the ipod). The qwerty key board is good, and much better than the Optimus Slider, though not as good as the Motorola Photon which I tried using in the store while shopping for this (the Photon is a much more expensive device and not offered as a prepaid phone). The keys are spaced out apart and have a bubble shape and some clicking motion and travel which makes it easier to use.  The device is thicker and heavier than most but that doesn't bother me.  It looks good and looks and feels of quality. The audio sounds fine to me. I have yet to use the camera, but it does come with a flash and a 3.2 megapixel.  (A photography expert once told me, that for most people, 3.3 megapixels is all you need for pictures as big as 8.5\"x11 - and so you should shop for other performance measures when looking for a low end camera - so from my perspective 3.2 megapixels is as good as you need in any camera for a smart phone, the other features being more important).Compared to other devices in its price segment the Rise has: a Faster CPU, Bigger Screen, Better Keyboard, A Flash for the 3.2 mega pixel Camera (which other devices don't have).What it lacks is a second camera facing you for video calling - something that still isn't used that much, and I only used once or twice on my ipod just to prove that it worked - so I don't miss that on this device.I've used the navigation tool and it works amazingly well. I don't know what Garmin charges for their devices these days, but, you don't need one if you have a Rise - its free.The overall look and feel is one of amazing quality, despite the graininess of the screen (compared to my Ipod Touch). I don't feel much of any want for more functionality from this device.It seems to me, that you can't get a much better android phone in the pre-paid market (though Virgin will sell you an Iphone) at any price, and certainly a better value, but you can pay a lot more for less if you are not careful - but the worst thing is to come up short and find your self back in the market all over again, in \"the poor man pays twice\" mode.I've read the reviews on this device. Most of the \"cons\" are - the device is too thick, too heavy and too slow. These criticism are the result of comparing the Rise to more expensive phones &/or ones that lack a keyboard.  The real comparison is with the LG Optimus Slider - which is the top of the low end market - and the Rise is 'head-over-heels' better in nearly every way for nearly half the price over that device, to say nothing of the other devices. Virgin does sell a smart phone for $20 less, but this phone is a much better value if you can come up with the extra $20.An alternative approach would be to buy an old unlocked used Iphone. I do have friends that have bought these for around $200 dollars - they then buy sims from H20 or Tmobile with 1000 minutes of time for around $100. You can reduce your phone minutes used by using Google Voice/Talkatone over WiFi.  Incidentally, I will eventually attempt to do something similar with Talkatone/Google Voice on this phone - and that could allow me to reside on Virgin's $35 dollar plan longer - because that plan provides unlimited internet minutes and so Voip calls shouldn't go against my calling minutes. So for $100 (well $107 with tax) and $35 a month, I could have complete smart phone functionality (also note, that you can buy Virgin's top up cards from Target using a red card, providing 5% discount, and sometimes they have these on sale and some times you can get an extra 5% off - such as when I buy five prescriptions - so we are getting very close to $30 a month, and I can buy multiple cards when I get to that price point.)At current standing, I am totally satisfied, and pleasantly surprised at the look, feel and functionality of this device. It is an uber-bargain.  Now, you can have a great, smart looking, smart phone for under $100!The question is: will the poor man still have to pay twice for having bought this phone?The only part of this question left, for me, is how well it will hold up over time. That, I cannot not tell.  At this price point, I hope to get at least a year of solid service out of this phone. Two or more would be a bonus. If I have problems with it, I will post updates.Best regards.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PHONE", "Author": "Wondergirl517", "ReviewID": "R3WODC0K8JQ6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay... first of all. I came from the EVO from Sprint which I hated most of the time because the battery life was awful. I also got tired of paying $130 a month for two lines. So I made a drastic move and switched to Virgin mobile. For $35 a month for me and $45 for the hubby, it was well worth it. My first VM phone was LG Optimus V which in its own right a good phone. I decided to upgrade to this phone because I like my husband's LG slider phone. I opted for this one 1. PRICE 2. the rave reviews :) 3. the slider and android 4.0 upgraded ice cream sandwich version. I have everything nice to say about this phone.. Best bang for the buck and would you believe it ... it even has a camera flash! So if you are not so big on the latest and greatest technology but want a functional android phone without breaking your wallet, get this phone and you won't regret it.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big improvment over my LG Optimus V", "Author": "J.

I received it less than 48 hours after I submitted my order. This is my 6th cell since 2005 and only my 2nd smart phone, always with Virgin Mobile. The $35/month plan fits me perfectly. 3G is just fine for what I do, Twitter, email, Box, a few internet and GPS apps, some games. I am 71 and most of my \"contemporaries\" don't quite get what I'm doing with my phone and other stuff like STEAM on my new gaming laptop. UPS delivered the RISE and I immediately started moving my number from the Optimus V. The Optimus was so short of memory that I could not even delete phone book entries. Just like the last time it took about 8 tries to get Virgin to complete the task. While diddling with that I noticed VM had a sale on the rise for $20 off to $79. Imagine my chagrin! I started a return with Amazon. The lightbulb came on and sure enough, Amazon had the same deal!! I got on a chat with customer service and complained about the rotten luck. He reminded me that Amazon has no reduced price guarantee but he offered to make an exception in my case and I will get a $20 credit. AMAZON IS THE BEST. I've been using Amazon since 1998. That says it all. I moved my SD files to the RISE and VM did their activation. I have loaded up most of my apps. I am going to find a better email client than stock so I can do more filtering.I even reloaded up Easy Tether Pro($9.99), the only tethering app that works with the cheap phones that I bought. The only catch is the necessary use of a USB cable. It is not a hotspot. I use it where there is no or very slow WiFi with my laptop. The places where I stayed in Vegas and Laughlin had really terrible WiFi but really good 3G.  I found it was a lot better to get it from the Amazon App Store because if I had to re-install it I didn't have to jump through a lot of hoops like with Google Play Store. I really like the Android Ice cream Sandwich OS compared to the 2.2 on the Optimus. Physically, it is a tad thicker and a lot heavier.

Doing this I've managed to keep battery discharge to about 2.5% per hour, less when near a Wi-Fi.  This was with little Internet usage.

Rayne \"the hater\"", "ReviewID": "R2TV4RF6VOINWF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Coming from an Optimus V, and later an Optimus Slider, I can say that this phone smokes 'em both.  Honestly, the internals aren't anything fantastic compared to the Slider--and, in fact, aside from capacitive buttons and a camera flash, there really isn't much to distinguish it from its close kin, aside from a (slightly) larger screen.  Heck, the buttons and ports are all in the exact same place as the Slider.  The real bonus is ICS, which runs beautifully and with minimal lag or stutter.  Also, the physical keyboard is worlds better than the Slider, which to me felt very cramped.  After using this phone for almost a month, I can say that the battery life is comparable to the Slider, which isn't exactly great news, but it could be worse.  I started using JuiceDefender to maximize my battery life, but now I've switched to Tasker for most of the same functionality.  Out of the box I had a strange problem with the Wifi toggle causing the phone to freeze and then reboot maybe one out of every five tries or so; and two days ago my phone decided to completely die on its own, freezing before it could finish booting.  If you're wondering, you can hold Vol- and Power when turning it on to get to recovery, and from there you can wipe data.  I wiped it (three times, to be sure) and now it's running flawlessly, and I haven't seen the Wifi bug since.If you're wondering, the phone can be rooted; if you search, there is at least one guide posted, and it worked for me (protip: use the \"v3\" tool; at least, that's the one that worked for me.  Google \"kyocera rise root\" and poke around until you see what I'm talking about).  Titanium Backup, SetCPU, some advanced Tasker functions with the Secure Settings plugin, and AdFree all work great.Overall, sticking to a more-or-less stock Android experience with minimal fuss and an eye-popping price point make this an excellent choice for either someone's first smartphone or an upgrade for the budget-conscious.  At the very least, no one should even consider the Optimus Slider until they've cut the price below this phone.  The Evo and One V might have a bit more panache, but the Rise will get the job done any day of the week.UPDATE: My phone's still having the Wifi bug.  However, I can't seem to find anyone else online who is having the same problem, so it could just be my unit.  Still, I'm going to see if I might be able to get any support from Kyocera.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a Value...", "Author": "theunartist", "ReviewID": "R1WJHH4TZSP9D5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks and I'm new to Virgin Mobile as well.The Kyocera Rise and Virgin Mobile has not let me down.

It has been able to pick up WIFI flawlessly, 3G when needed and voice quality, according to friends, is normal. I would not hesitate recommending this phone!One quirk I have stumbled across, the phone did lock up on me twice.

I always prefer prepaid plans and I think Virgin Mobile is one of the companies that pioneered the prepaid market into the industry.this phone seems to be good. I am a very basic user, I just want my internet radio app to work, clear youtube videos, good sound for my mp3, good web surfacing, facebook( must have facebook) and most importantly of all, it must be compatible with my GOOGLE VOICE! app. that is my number and I can only have phones that use google voice. in all those functions, this phone preforms very well.I wanted this phone particularly because of the slide out keyboard. the keyboard is spacey and comfortable, rubber not solid buttons. the CON is that i use my hands to hold the phone by its sides while I use my thumbs to type. the power button is on the side, of the portion of the phone with the keyboard. so I have a couple of times hit the power button while typing and having the phone slide out. this minor inconvenience is actually very upsetting, as I must remember and learn to hold the phone as to where my left hand does not press the power button while typing :-(another big thing for me is the clarity and size of the screen. the apps and pictures are clear and comfortable to see. youtube videos and pictures from the web are clear and have crisp detail. this is a 3.5 screen although visually, it appears larger than my sidekick 4 3.5 screen, in part because the screen on the virgin mobile phone is almost edged to the sides. if you have good eyesight for seeing things up-close, the pixels are visible although it does not interfere with the screens clarity.I brought this phone for the reliability factor! I trust the phone and network to not drop calls. the battery life is 8 hours of talk times and the apps are clear and function well. so basically, when I am downtown and lost, the google maps app will show me where I am and clearly how to get somewhere. the phone will work well for calling my friend to say im lost downtown and will be late. and the smooth streaming internet radio will work fine for listening to music as I walk around finding my way using the app.i took the phone out of the box last night and it seems promising. I believe it is a good replacement for the sidekick 4. I wont notice the difference in function and ability, mostly just the price!I held back on a star because of the brand! Virgin Mobile (this is just my experience) tends to make phones that appear promising at the display in the store, but when you take it home and open the box - it all falls to pieces. I have had a phone come out of the box jank'd, replaced it with the same phone and the replacement had a screen that would turn to static. their phones are like toys, they are made of plastic, give basic performance and the brand is popular among teenagers, as they can buy these phones themselves and pay for the minute cards with their own allowance. in fact, my first phone in high school was a $20.00 virgin mobile phone. so in truth, im waiting it out to see if the cheapness of the phone will show. but I have faith in this one.is this phone a money saver? yes! but if it keeps up with my first impression, it is a very good and functioning android phone, giving me both my practical needs (txt, call, web, google voice and google maps) and my tech savvy needs (youtube, facebook, games, web surfing, apps, etc.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kyocera Rise: Promising Phone Suffers High Rate of Bugs & Defects", "Author": "NewsView", "ReviewID": "RAIXJKV07RMNR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Seemingly, Amazon has caught on to ubiquity of failures of this product, the Kyocera Rise. Amazon has suspended sales as of this date, stating:ITEM UNDER REVIEW\"While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible.\"Well, Amazon, let me make it simple for you (and those of you reading today): This phone is very promising ---- and also particularly fault-prone. Specifically, it is prone to power-on failures, freezes, app crashing and random reboots.Don't like the sound of that? Neither did I. Except it took owning the phone more than four weeks -- the duration of a typical return period -- to appreciate its utter lack of reliability.Thinking it a smart move, I spent the first 2.5 weeks running the phone, unactivated, over WI-FI, after which I opted to activate it because I had experienced no problem thus far. Shortly after activiation, however, all sorts of \"issues\" began to surface. Yet after attempting just ONE exchange within the 30-day return period -- for what turned out to be an equally buggy replacement -- the retailer refused to help. (Not to smear any of the sellers here, mind you. If you must know, Radio Shack.)The GOOD about this phone:Runs Ice Cream Sandwich, which is newer than the Gingerbread OS I was on with my previous VM phone, an LG Optimus Slider.Noticeably faster than the 800mhz processor in the LG Optimus Slider.Slide-out keyboard. I type with two hands and can do so much faster on this and similar keyboard-equipped phones than I can peck away on-screen. (Sorry, Swype!)Greater internal memory. With the Optimus Slider, which is otherwise a very solid and reliable phone, I was constantly hampered by a scant 181MB of internal memory. And because not every app can be offloaded to a microSD card, the internal memory \"bottleneck\" meant that I was constantly forced to delete or rotate apps. Not so, the Kyocera Rise.Solid voice recognition and Blue Tooth capacity. The purchase of this Kyocera Rise was actually spurred on by the fact that I could get no other VM handset I tried, whether HTC or LG, to run with my Kenwood Bluetooth car stereo, which I received as a holiday gift. A chief aim was to be street legal (hands free) on my cell phone while driving, and this Kycocera Rise was the only compatible phone I found in terms of working reliably with my Kenwood.Good volume range. This phone outputs a louder volume than the LG Optimus Slider. (You may wish to download something like Android Tools to obtain additional volume controls.)Auto-adjusting Screen Brightness. The LG phone I came from didn't offer this feature.After some initial trouble, established reliable WI-FI connectivity, with a fast and responsive feel. (Performance over the SPRINT data network, like most phones, is dependent on local coverage. In my case, performance of the Kyocera Rise is comparable to the LG Optimus Slider.)Battery Life: Using the app \"Juice Defender Plus\", I find it necessary to run the battery saver mode on \"Aggressive\" vs. the \"Balanced\" setting that yielded similar battery life using the LG Optimus Slider. All in all, I cannot complain about battery life -- it seems fairly average to me. (I do suggest turning off GPS, Bluetooth and other apps when not in use. The exception, however, is in being unable to force off the \"Connections Optimizer\" because it constantly re-enables itself on my non-rooted phone.)The BAD about this phone:Backside Camera with Flash. While I wasn't buying this phone for the camera, it isn't great even by 3.2MP standards. The problem is a lack of auto focus (the LG Optimus Slider offers auto focus, and thus takes better pictures with the same number of MPs). The worst thing, however, is that the lack of auto focus means that you can't use bar code scanning apps to do price comparisons in stores, to run cooking/grocery apps, etc.Audio. Call quality is not as natural as the LG Optimus Slider. Callers sound a bit distorted at higher volumes. It's not terrible but it is somewhat tinny.Screen. The display is not spectacular, probably among the weaker I've seen on any smartphone. Still, my \"first impression\" improved considerably once I removed the screen protector. (By contrast, on the LG I left the plastic overlay that shipped with the phone on to serve as a screen guard for several months. You can't get away with that on the Kyocera Rise because the overlay is gray and makes the screen look like blurry newsprint.) In terms of specs, the LG Optimus Slider has what would appear to be identical resolution, yet even when powered off one will notice on the LG and other brands a visibly blacker screen, which lends itself to crisper text and better saturation and contrast while in use.Keyboard. The Kyocera Rise's keyboard, while better than no keyboard at all, has a strange feel to it -- as if to suggest that one must toggle the key to the right or left as opposed to hitting it straight on. After using the LG Optimus Slider, featuring a compact slide-out keyboard with solid tactile \"feedback\", I get the sense on the Kyocera Rise that I am making far more mistakes in my typing than I actually am. The worst offender, by far, is the space bar. I have a sense that the spaces between words aren't there, even if it did, in fact, \"take\". Some of this, in any event, is to be expected when going from one phone to another -- each keyboard has its own feel and to some extent it is a matter of simply adjusting to something new. Still, I'm typing considerably slower on this keyboard than I was on the previous one. On the whole, though, it still beats going at it \"one fingered\" on a virtual keyboard.Power Button. While the on/off switch has yet to pose a problem for me, it is positioned such that it might be easier than some would like to shut off the screen (or the entire phone) by accident while texting using the slide-out keyboard. (Incidentally, for first-time Android owners who are having trouble with the screen dimming and locking too quickly, there is a setting you can adjust to keep the screen powered on longer -- that's one problem that does have an easy fix.)So what's the beef, the reason Amazon has suspended the sale of the Kyocera Rise at this time? If I had to venture a guess, it would be this:What is at first so utterly refreshing about the Kyocera Rise is its lack of bloatware -- not even Facebook comes pre-installed! What is bad is that immediately after activation VM pushes down an ID pack that will, at first blush, over-write anything one loaded previously (potentially a problem if, like me, you configure your phone mostly on WI-FI prior to activation). In the ID app, it is possible to switch back to the previous configuration (stock profile) but the sad fact of the matter is, the VM ID pack, including apps and wallpapers, is still lodged in there taking up memory -- where it perpetually runs in the background. (Of course, it won't show you that any of those other apps are installed until you back out of one profile to load the other.) Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the phone occasionally \"forgets\" my ID preferences, inexplicably loading the VM profile such that it looks as if my phone has \"lost\" my apps/settings. Worse still, once the VM bloatware installed -- although it may be coincidental, not causal -- the many operational glitches with this phone appeared in tandem. These bugs, which I alluded to earlier, could just as easily imply a high rate of out-and-out defect: daily freezes and reboots, seemingly at random, sometimes to the point of being difficult to power the phone back on! And therein lies the worst possible conclusion one can have about any phone:YOU CANNOT DEPEND ON THIS PHONE IN AN EMERGENCY.The Bottom LineVirgin Mobile, Sprint, Radio Shack and others who sell this model need to follow Amazon's lead: They would do well, for the sake of customer relations, to back the full duration of the manufacturer's warranty because problems apparently occur with this model at a higher-than-average rates. (And no, I would not agree that this is a case of \"getting what you pay for\" -- if only because no brand on the market wishes to commit corporate suicide by issuing overwhelmingly faulty products, which consumers come to distrust.)For all its flaws, I am still inclined to like the Kyocera Rise. It is refreshing, after all, to (still) enjoy a physical keyboard; it is compatible with my Kenwood BT car stereo; and it has far fewer limits on the number of apps I can install than the LG Optimus Slider. Because of the problems described here and elsewhere on the web, however, Kyocera and its retailers need to prepare to stand behind the Rise because there are a lot of faulty ones in circulation, many more than the positive reviews initially imply.It seems, in closing, that the number of glowing vs. negative reviews can be attributed to what one might call \"new toy syndrome\". It's all too tempting to make haste to post reviews on a new and novel item before one has owned said product long enough to vouch for its reliability. I suspect reports of problems with the Kyocera Rise would be that much greater if new owners waited as little as two weeks longer before leaving write-ups on Amazon and elsewhere. After all, only a tiny minority of reviewers bother to post updates if and when product flaws surface. In this instance, the opposite applies, too: I'll be back to update this review if and when there is a SOLUTION to the reliability problems the Kyocera Rise exhibits.I'm crossing my fingers in the hope that a software or firmware update will do the trick.###March 2013 update: Kyocera recently updated the firmware. I have experienced only one random reboot since updating the firmware. The good news, is it seems the phone is more stable now. Only time will tell how it holds up but it's a promising sign that Kyocera is staying on top of the \"issues\".", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the phone, but..... see update below", "Author": "Dana C. Spencer \"newscarver\"", "ReviewID": "R2M8PFISCT8GMX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my wife for Christmas to take advantage of the $50 price. I thought it was unlikely I would find a comparable phone as inexpensive and as good as this one anytime soon. I believe I was right. I really wanted to get it for myself also, but I did not have the budget for it. Fortunately for me, my daughter did and surprised me with the same model phone I surprised my wife with. Anyway, my phone replaces an LG Optimus V, which is a decent phone but antiquated by Android standards; it is under powered, slow and I was always bumping into the limit for installing apps to the phone memory. The Rise does not have these problems. It is very fast, and has room for all of the apps I installed on it. In fact, I was moving apps to the SD card and ran out of space on the SD card before internal memory. I got a bigger SD card, so I am going to start moving some of those apps back to the card.There are two problems that bother me with my phone (my daughter purchased it at Best Buy, not Amazon). 1. It occasionally freezes when accessing wi-fi. At least that seems to be the common reason. It may be I overloaded it with apps, so I will see what happens after I move some of them to the card. 2. As has been mentioned by others, the camera stinks. Its not just that the quality is bad, it just does not focus, so I cannot use it to scan bar codes. I would not normally use it as a camera anyway, but I do like to scan products when I see something I like and I want to wish list it or look for a better price. So with this phone I have to manually enter the product ID.I could live without the keyboard feature; Swype actually works quite well with this version of Android, and for me is faster than the keyboard. I have used it for reading Kindle books though, as the horizontal orientation is closer to a tablet view and I can use the arrows to navigate.Sorry folks, this is the kind of review I hate to read; too wordy and not to the point. The bottom line is I like 99% of the phone and would give it 5 stars if not for the crappy camera and I may even forgive it the freezing. I may have a lemon, because my wife's doesn't freeze. But about all she has installed is Facebook and Skype. Oh, I forgot to mention battery life. Yes it is not great, but from what I have seen so far, no worse than the Optimus V. And I use Juice Defender, which helps alot.For $50, which is what we paid for these phones before Christmas, this is a great phone. In fact even if the price goes back up to $100 I'd still say it is worth it, but I would be trying to find it at a lower price. Actually I am going to look for another phone with a better camera in the $100 range. I'll find one.Update to this review:I did ditch the Rise when my daughter got me an iPhone as part of a Sprint family plan. I am not happy with the plan cost, but the iPhone is a huge improvement over the Rise (of course it costs 10x as much). If I had it to do over again, I would save for the iPhone 5 on Virgin. But when the contract is up, I will go back to Virgin. I just hope the $35 per month deal is still around then. My wife still has the Rise, and she uses it everyday. It still crashes at least 2 or 3 times per day. Sadly, I would no longer recommend the Rise.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone glitchy - Virgin Mobile Customer Service Terrible", "Author": "Patrick M.

By the first week of October I emailed them to say the phone was faulty and did not work correctly. They sent a replacement that would not even turn on. I sent the replacement back. They were supposed to send a second replacement. On Nov. 20 I called to inform them I never received it. They told me it was on back order, which I suppose they expected me to know telepathically, as no one with the company actually notified me of this. Meanwhile, I am using a phone that turns itself off in the middle of texting someone and can only be turned on when I find an outlet and plug it in. I asked for a refund instead, rather than wait for a replacement to be available, particularly because Virgin Mobile customer service folks had no idea when I could expect one and also because the glitches on the phone were continuing to worsen to the point that it rarely ever turned on. I was informed a refund was no longer possible because 30 days had passed since I ordered it, despite having an email trail that shows I was trying to work with them for a replacement ever since I ordered it. All they offered in lieu of the bad service was to wait for a replacement (with no date when it would be available), accept a replacement phone of lesser value (a Venture currently on sale for $20) or accept a $35 to $45 credit in lieu of the $100 phone plus $20 in shipping costs. I have been with this provider since 2009, and once recommended them, but not after this. In essence, Virgin Mobile penalized me for trying to work with them for a usable product replacement. I will not use them again, nor will I recommend them. To top it off, it is very hard to understand what their customer service reps are saying on the phone, not because they have an accent, but because the connection is always bad.

I knew the screen resolution and camera were the weak points according to reviews but I really don't feel that they are that bad. I don't take many pics or plan on watching netflix on the whopping 3.5 inch screen anyway so I am good with it. Besides better equals bucks and since I wasn't sure of the coverage in my area I didn't want to chance spending much more on a maybe. Glad to say though coverage is fine, much better than AT&T;, so unlike a contract phone I can upgrade whenever I want. Problem is I like this phone, keyboard works great, system is snappy and quick (no games), wifi connected seamlessly, and I actually like the heft of it. It is not some paper thin peice of plastic that I have to worry about cracking when I sit on or drop it. The only quirks I have come across is that wifi keeps turning itself on which uses battery more, the power button is in a bad place for texters, the owners manual is worthless, the touch screen is a bit to sensitive for my taste (getting used to it), and the google search bar needs to be someplace else as I keep activating it when i try to get my emails. Other than that I have nothing but good things to say.A couple of notes: Those that say the screen goes off or the phone turns off while using the keyboard watch your left hand placement. It is very easy to hit the power button because of its position on the lower left corner of the phone(when turned sidways) which just happens to be where most folks grab the phone.Also, for those that say phone powers on and off randomly.

I bought the HTC Wildfire S as it was on sale for $64.99. I thought it would be cool to be able to use it for mobile check deposits, making my banking so easy by just snapping a picture of my check and sending it through. My HTC was perfect for that reason...however, I soon outgrew the HTC because of its low memory issue, and android 2.3. I was running only two apps, and barely had anything saved to the phone.I was sick of having to clear out the cache several times a day, and the HTC always restarted or froze up on me. After many hours of reading reviews online, I decided to upgrade to the KYOCERA RISE. I found it on Amazon for the great price of $59.99...a $20 savings over VM's Valentine's sale price.I AM SO HAPPY I CHOSE THE RISE. I wish this had been my purchase 6 months ago instead of the Wildfire S.I have now had the Kyocera Rise for over two weeks...and I use the heck out of it. The first two days I really punished it with heavy use, just to see what it could handle, and if I would encounter any of the issues I had read about. The only issue I had was ONE time when it froze up, and I had to do a battery pull. I think it was my fault for watching so many YouTube videos...and using the phone all day.This phone can be a bit confusing to figure out at first, like where certain apps are located, etc...but play with it or go online and find tutorials. Some people have also said the phone doesn't turn on unless connected to the charger. At first, I thought it was true, but I found I have to hold the power button down for a bit for the phone to power on.So far, I have loaded 5 or 6 apps on the phone, about a dozen songs for ringtones, and a few pictures. The memory is so much better on this phone, and Android 4.0 is a huge improvement over 2.3. There is still plenty of memory left.With that said, I don't think someone who is looking for an iPhone experience or has their heart set on the newest phone out there would be loving this phone like I do. You have to be realistic with what you are getting for well under $100. If you want a phone that handles tons of gaming, and other media then spend the dough on the newest phone capable of delivering what you want.If you want a phone that will easily handle Facebook, YouTube, a bit of music, and a few games, then this phone is AWESOME. I also have a good 3g signal most of the time, which is helpful when my WiFi goes out at the house due to power outages. I live in a rural area where this occurs frequently, and I like being able to use my phone to check emails, Facebook, and pay a few bills when this happens.Battery Life is ok...but I use the phone a lot. I expect that it won't last too long due to my heavy use of the phone.The only reason I gave the RISE 4 stars is because I have not done mobile check deposit yet...I will update the review after I deposit my paycheck and let you know if it works. If Kyocera had put in a 5MP camera, instead of the 3.2 MP, and added auto-focus, then I would have given it 5 stars.Bottom Line: If you don't have iPhone expectations, and use a modest amount of apps then I think this phone is rather suitable for you. I text often as well, using the slide out keyboard and Swype, and sometimes the voice texting feature which is great if you speak slowly and clearly. Call quality is good...clear and loud enough for me. I also use it a lot for Slacker Radio, and the external speaker is pretty loud. My alarms are loud too, which I like because I sleep very soundly.Would also like to add that it is possible some people bought this phone, and experienced problems because they had a \"lemon\". I was very afraid I would receive one from a defective build, and am very happy my phone is functioning properly. The only other problem you may encounter is with Virgin Mobile service, which is not up to par for many people at the moment. I had reservations about buying the Rise for that reason, but VM fixed their service in my area at least. I'm sure issues on that end of things will subside after Sprint finishes their build out/upgrades to towers.Thanks for reading this long-winded review...I hope it helps.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "ABSOLUTELY!

I have never owned an Android touch phone. I've always been pretty cheap when it comes to cell phones. Just to give you an idea: My last cell phone carrier was Cricket and I had a Huawei Pillar phone. So a Kyocera Rise on the Virgin Mobil network was a HUGE step up. I saw the Kyocera Rise on Amazon.com and would check periodically for several days as the price went down. I finally bought it at $65.00 and I'm so glad I bought it.The good things I like about the phone:The size- It fits right in my pocket. I was afraid I'd break it but it's not a concern now.The screen size- It's not too big but is perfect for me. I've seen other phones with huge screens and I wouldn't like that.Easy access to apps.It's very easy to set up and you can even transfer your old number to Virgin Mobile. Be sure when you go to their website: virginmobileusa.com to pick the one that says you want to transfer your number. I picked the one that said I was a new customer and wanted a new number.I was still able to transfer my old number but it was a hassle as I had to speak to a Live Agent at VM but it worked out.This phone responds very well to your finger and adding or deleting apps is a breeze. What I do is delete the apps I don't use and if I download an app then get bored of it, I just delete it. That way there will always be memory on my phone.I've owned this phone for about five days and the only thing that has gone wrong is I turned on WI-FI and was doing several other things on the phone and it froze. I took out the battery and put it back in and it's been great since.I recommend using WI-Fi when downloading apps as it seems faster than 3G but that's just my opinion.I also recommend downloading the Trend Micro Longevity app to help save your battery life. It turns off  everything except texting, answering/receiving calls and you can turn it all back on easily with this app should you want to get back to your apps again.Hope this review helps those who want this phone but are a little skeptical like I was at first.

Just pay 'em and get your new phone number (or have your old one ported). Since this is my first cellphone I am just embarking on the learning curve and will have much more to report, but wanted to let anyone who wonders know that the hardshell case that I bought, Hard Cover Case For Kyocera Rise C5155 Red by HR, fits like a glove, snaps right into place. I did do a review of it. And since I still wanted a little fabric case, I went searching at Walmart, Kmart, Staples and Radio Shack, and found a nice little five-buck one at Walmart, label '\"ONN\" carrying case' in the camera case section. Nothing at the other stores, though, but I'm in a rural area where our versions of those retailers are sort of shrunken. Thought I'd save ya some steps there.I will say right off the bat that this phone is physically a quality product with good screen size and a slide-out keyboard. It certainly is larger than some, which is what I wanted. It feels great in the hand and the keyboard slides smoothly like a well-oiled machine.Already I have noted some confusion due to the printed material supplied with the unit. First, a 2G microSD card is listed separately as being included but is not separately packaged. When I (carefully!) pried off the back cover in order to install the battery, I saw that the microSD card is already installed inside. Nowhere is this fact noted except by implication as a diagram shows its internal location. Even upon visual inspection of the inside, its presence was not super obvious. So of course I initially thought the item was missing. Second, the instructions did not give clear directions on how to install the battery. Now although this is my first cellphone, I am an amateur radio operator, so I quickly discerned proper installation in spite of limitations of my aging eyes - I recognized the contact points. But this is not necessarily obvious to a novice. Third, the battery is wrapped in paper with a tab that says \"Pull\". This suggests one should pull. The directions do not state whether to remove the paper covering. Many people would immediately do so. I thought about it briefly and left the paper intact although similar batteries I've dealt with in the past had no paper covering. I still don't know which was intended. Fourth, it is not easily seen how to insert the USB cord into the unit. Again, one needs perfect eyesight as the connection is small. I have it figured out now - there is an indicator symbol for \"up\" but it is small and black on black. It's in a slightly indented space so I marked that with Wite-Out.I could go on all day but won't. Simply said, the manual gives very little practical information. On to operation, functionality and usability. First, here's a joke on me: the unit showed very little signal and I think that's why I'm not getting satisfactory response. Then I realized that my computer workspace is below ground with a laid-up stone wall. Ha ha. Take it a little higher in the house, dummy! Too bad that's not where I want to work, cold up there.

C. Carlson", "ReviewID": "R19DJ7VLZK9OWF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: revising my review cause of so many negative reviews. A key to the phone working well is utilizing the 'Battery' app that comes on the phone. If you get the phone and open the app it will bring up all the apps that are open. Close down the ones you don't need at the time, like Calendar, Maps, etc by clicking on it then hitting force shut down. Even if you just used Firefox and don't need it anymore, it will still be open, you can shut it down in the 'battery' app. This will solve a lot of problems in the phone, from RAM to battery life. And I'm convinced the phone resetting problems I've read relate to too many apps being open at once.Bought from Inna's Goods. Came very fast and brand new in the box (have read other reviews of refurbs advertised as new, but Inna's came brand new).Bought phone for a web browser, app computer, and note taker. Phone is great for these things. Haven't activated phone.The battery:: I browsed the internet over wifi for well over six hours yesterday, and still had quite a bit of battery life left. Another day watched four hours of video and still had a lot of battery left. A key is using the 'battery' app. Certain apps always reopen on start-up and I just shut them down. And hitting the 'recent apps' double box button, and swiping away the app, doesn't close the app like the top review said. You have to shut it down through the battery app.A second tip for battery life, if you're not using it as a phone for calls, hold down the power button and put it in 'Airplane' mode.The keyboard:: The keys do light up. Didn't read that anywhere. I rate the keyboard as ok. I prefer physical keyboards and this one falls in the middle of the pack. I have an older Samsung that's top notch and the buttons here are just a little unnatural. Still works  fine though.RAM:: Have had the phone for three weeks, and only one problem with the phone locking up, that was when browsing the internet, and after I'd been browsing for many hours, flipping back and forth, just giving the phone a good work out. It's a $35 phone, I wouldn't expect it to be my multi-thousand dollar Macbook.SD Card:: Gotta open the back case to insert/remove micro SD card. And the back case is flimsy, could see it breaking, but at least it's not behind the battery like on my windows phone.Camera:: have taken one photo, resolution is not good at 3.2 MP, but read review that said it couldn't focus on a QR code. So I downloaded a QR reader app, held the phone up to a McDonald's ad, and it read it right away. QR codes do work.Speaker:: very loud. Headphone volume is more than ample.USB Connection: phone comes with charger only, no USB connection, but if you have one, hook it up to your Mac, and it gives you the option to have it read as an external drive. No software to install.Overall very happy. A $35 tiny computer, are you kidding me?

Battery life decent on phone calls, but not on regular texting and web!  Phone will turn off and on by itself frequently and also will lock up constantly.  Virgin mobile does not like to loose customers as you will have to get their account number to switch providers and they may give you the run around when you ask your own account number which is not your phone number, even though their website says so.

But, 1st let me give you all the ''Pros''... then, the ''Con''..So, I got this phone because my other phone I had had for over 2 years started to not work properly. I was going out of state  and needed something cheap and shipped fast (ordered through virginmobileusa.com). I get it in the mail 2 days later. Get it all set up and all good to go. It's a ''just the right size'' texter style phone. There is a screen pad, but I rarely use that unless using it for checking my VM. I really love the keyboard slide-out feature. It makes texting go by pretty fast and smooth. It keeps decent battery life. The memory storage even though not real big, does hold all what I need it for (mainly games, some music). The touch screen is pretty nice. Now, I have to say that this phone is a little on the heavy side. But, I love that. I can always feel it there in my back pocket (knowing it's there). It's made pretty solidly well, I think. And, I am very, VERY happy with this phone!! Oh, and the camera on it takes real nice pictures, too. And, I love how I can get on FB at anytime. I feel like I'm carrying around a mini-computer; I have soo much fun with my Rise!!However........... here's the one and only ''Con'' that I have (or, 'had'; as it's no longer an issue for me).. The battery/ phone shutting off and not powering back up.****Now, when I first got this phone.. 4 days straight everything seemed to work just fine. No issues whatsoever. So, then when I had to go out of town (which was the whole purpose of me even getting this phone) starting with the being at the airport, until end of day, my phone shut off 5 times. No matter what I tried, it would not come back on. Only fix was to plug it to the charger. Then it would kick on and be fine. Until it went in sleep mode... to happen all over again. Then for 2 days after that was still doing it. So, I was having to carry around my charger with me just to be able to use my phone. Frustrating!! So that's when I decided to turn to Google. And, found the answer to the problem...........................loose battery connection. And, the way to fix that?? Take a matchbook cover. cut/tear it in half and then fold it over a time or 2 and place it in-between the battery end (NON-connector side) and the wall of the battery placement. It will stick out some, but when you put the cover back over the back, unnoticeable. No problems since. On, off.. on, off.. on, off........ like a charm!!Saves from having to send it back, take it back, get another (same) phone to still probably have that same problem..or, even a different phone. Obviously, at least half the people that get /have this phone have this problem.. if not right away.. eventually. Virgin Mobile really needs to look into this, as so many of this style phone gets returned for an easy-fixed problem that either, or, do not know about. And, that's sad; cause it's such a nice, lovely phone.

This was my only option with Virgin Mobile that I saw because I like a QWERTY keyboard.This item was purchased in a box store and I was glad that I did. I had to return the phone several times before I got it to work now (I think). My phone would work initially but after a short while on my first phone the sound stopped working. I could only make phone calls on the speaker mode and the music would not play. The store manager suggested that I get a new phone.The second one had a similar problem. This was very strange. Customer service in Manila was useless. Everyone I spoke to said are you sure the volume is on (which it was). I am not that ignorant. I finally got someone in Virgin Mobile who indicated that if I obtained some info from the box store they would send me a new phone (not a refurbished one) because the item was less than a month old. Everyone said that it was a hardware problem and not software incompatability.Instead, I went to another  box store with same company and they set up the phone. After one day it happened again so I took out the battery and reset the phone to the factory initial settings. After each addition or change in the phone, such as adding programs, moving programs to the sd card etc. demonstrated that the phone appears to be working well.After much soul searching I think that the problem was that the case was not closed completely and somehow this caused an interruption in service.No one in customer service or the store was able to help but when I mentioned this to the store mgr. he said that this was a possible cause of the errors that I was getting.I understand that this is a midrange product and should expect it behaves as such. Now the phone seems to be working well (3 days).I like this Android system as it is better than the 2.3 version that I was using in the past. Some general comments about this phone:The camera is weak in terms of color balance and the video could be clearer but they work adequately.I put in a 16GB card and for my uses this is fine.The volume is now working well.As others have mentioned the top level of the keyboard is too close to the screen.I do not like the fact that the fn functions needs to be activated each time that a number needs to be added.I do not like the fact that the Essentials program needs to be added. I would much rather have choices as to what programs to add.

Not So Much", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3FOQ4B4JX6NRD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, let me say that for an 80 to 100 smartphone, this is a great value.  After reading several \"professional\" reviews, I was a little leery of my purchase that I made.  All the pundits gave it lukewarm reviews at best.  I guess they are used to working with their complimentary evaluation I-Phones and Galaxy S3's.You will never mistake this phone for one of the ones mentioned above.  But then again, this phone will cost you 1/6 to 1/8 the price.  And for me, I don't care how cool the flagship Apple or Samsung phones are, you can't convince me they have 6 to 8 times the functionality of this phone.As others have mentioned, one of the big selling points of this phone is the Android 4.0 ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) operating system.  It's the same one that launched on the Samsung Galaxy S3.  So you get a top of the line OS which is very snappy and has very little lag.The camera as others mentioned is not great, but it will work in a pinch.  Auto Focus would have been nice for UPC scanning, but hey.....It's a Phone.It has built in GPS with Google Maps which is far superior to what is being offered on the I-phone 5.  It has a built in 2GB Micro SD card included which can be easily expanded to 32GB.Android's ICS allows most apps available to be moved to the SD card to save on internal storage (1GB).The battery life on this phone is adequate but only just.  This phone requires nightly charging and it would be nice if you have a car charger or USB cord on your computer at work.  The Phone does recharge really quick though.  My Daughter's phone was completely discharged when she woke up (she forgot to plug it in), and we plugged it into the car charger while I drove her to school.  40 minutes on the road and the phone was up to 65% charge.  Not bad.  If you want to really extend battery light, there are several free or low cost battery savers available on Google Play (formally Android Market).  My favorite is Juice Defender, The free version is not great, but the \"Plus\" version is really inexpensive and has quite a bit of optimizations available, able to control when you turn on the WiFi, and data access on an app by app basis.The QWERTY keyboard is really nice and the phone has an over all quality feel.For 80 dollars, I really was expecting a pretty cheap phone but I must admit, I am pleasantly surprised.Now, if only Virgin Mobile/Sprint could get their act together and upgrade their network.  For $35/Month I get 300 minutes of talk time, Unlimited Web and Data.  For a mere 10 dollars more, I can increase the talk time to 1200 minutes.  It's a great deal....On the surface.  However a little investigation shows a bit of a problem.  Sprint is fine for call quality.  My phone has yet to drop a call and I have no complaints of voice coverage.Data Coverage is a far different story.  While Sprint and Virgin Mobile consistently tout their \"3G speeds\" the reality is much more depressing.  The small print in my Terms of Service states that if I go over 2.5 GB of data in a month, I get throttled to 256KPS download speeds.Right now I'd be thrilled with consistent 256kps downloads.  In Fort Lauderdale area, I rearly get above 300kps and if I'm really lucky I can get 500kps.  In my office, which does not have wireless available for personal cell phones, I routinely get double digits.  When I leave the office, it baloons to a whopping 150 to 200kps.This is nowhere near 3G even though my phone indicates 3G.  At first I thought it was just a maintenance issue in my area.  However a quick look at the web shows that Sprint lags behind Verizon AT&T; and T-Mobile in all areas.  And guess what, the average nationwide 3G speed for Sprint is 590kps.  So this is not limited to South Florida.On the upside, I guess at those speeds, I have little chance of going over my limit, and if I do, I won't notice much of a downgrade.The phone does have a built in WiFi receiver, so as long as you go from hotspot to hotspot, you'll be good.  But currently this is not the phone to watch Netflix at the beach or listen to Pandora in your car.  The network is just not up to it.I hear the Sprint is upgrading their 3G network as we speak, but with low cost no contract leases to Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile it's unlikely the upgrades will keep up with future demand.  So slow data rates won't likely go away anytime soon.On the upside, I am able to provide unlimited (albeit slow) data and texts to my entire family with no contract for a LOT less than any other provider.The phone is GREAT while the service, Not So Much. But then I'm not paying a whole bunch either.  And since it is a no contract plan, I can always untether my phone from Virgin Mobile and pay more for higher speeds should the slow data rates really frost me in the future.I thought you all should just all be aware so you don't blame the phone, if Pandora keeps cutting out.....Your mileage may vary...", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving it!!

I'm looking for a new phone already. I have had it for less than 1 month.I would recommend purchasing this model if you do not want to do too much with it. It works great for texting. The keyboard keys are a little sticky, especially the space bar, but maybe they will wear down. The call quality is good. If you have a good wifi connection, the phone runs great on the internet, but the Virgin 3g connection is awful. I get a maximum of 1 bar no matter where I am, and I live in an area that, according to their coverage map, is fully covered. I am not planning on paying for another month of service at the moment. I will try the free text/call apps on my home wifi network.My main gripe right now, and the reason that I decided to write this review, is that the phone turns itself to silent on its own. I have no idea why, or how to fix it. I can go to settings, and everything is fine - silent and airplane modes are OFF, ringtone and notification tones are set, volume is as loud as it will go, vibrate is ON...yet when someone calls, texts, or I get any other notification, the phone does not make a sound or vibrate. This is VERY frustrating. It stays like this for hours, or days. This is a deal breaker. I NEED to hear my phone.My next gripe is that there are a lot of apps that I had planned on using with this phone that are not compatible with this model. I wanted to try Shopkick and Ibotta, they will not work. Jingit just barely works...the camera is not auto-focus and the picture quality is horrible, so I cannot do my check ins. The flash makes everything a funny color as well.Also, with the apps, the phone freezes A LOT. I cannot tell you how frustrating this is when you are in the middle of an EPIC Ruzzle match. All you can do is shut the phone off and restart it. Boo!!!I know this is not the fault of the phone, but Adobe flash is not supported, so I cannot watch some videos/movies on the phone.I DO like the size, shape, and weight of the phone. I am not a fan of the super skinny or tiny phones, and I HATE touch screen keyboards, so the QWERTY slider out keyboard is perfect for me.

If you are a average/power user which uses Youtube, social apps through out the day. The chances are you will have to recharge the battery 2-3 times per day like me.The usable internal storage on the Kyocera Rise is just under 1 GB worth for install apps. But the Kyocera Rise does have a micro SD slot which supports upto 32 GB micro SD cards. Some apps can be moved from the internal storage to the micro SD card so the low internal storage is not a big problem.The Kyocera Rise comes with a 3.2 MP camera with LED flash and can record video upto 480p. The camera on the Kyocera Rise can't focus which your photo's and video will turn out on the poor side. But being able to take photo's and video's might not be a deal breaker for some people.My Kyocera Rise will reboot it self without reason 1-2 times per week. Besides the default apps that comes with the phone I only have handful of apps installed which are very common apps. Some apps I did try on the Kyocera Rise took around 1-3 mins for them to load on the phone. In my honest opinion I find this due to the 1 GHz single core processor and limited RAM the phone has.The Kyocera Rise has 3G for mobile data and lacks 4G LTE which some of the newer phones offers for little extra money.MY Final Verdict:Due to poor battery life and phone spec's. There is some better options available if you spend a little extra money. If you are willing to spend extra $40 dollars you can get a phone with 4G LTE and dual core processor like the LG Optimus F3 which has nice battery life as well. Plus some extra nice stuff but you can research the LG Optimus F3 on your own for more info.As of posting this review I'm now using the LG Optimus F3 and will post a review on it after couple months of owning it.

I've really enjoyed the service and value, but Virgin just doesn't have any other phones available with enough usefulness for a good price on this mid-range plan.Bad:1. KEYBOARD. I got this phone because I wanted to explore the world of smart phones, and I wanted to be sure I got one with physical buttons for fast and facilitated texting. It's -ok- ... but I've had a Samsung and an LG before this and they were much better. The worst thing about this keypad is that the SPACE bar, even though it is wide, must be pressed In The Middle .. or it doesn't register the entry!! There are other sloppy things about sliding the keyboard out that are bothersome too, like it will think I typed something when I am just sliding it into position!! My LG was very good about not messing that up, but I had to leave the LG behind when I moved to Virgin from MetroPCS (which was a fairly good service too, for the price)2. NOTIFICATIONS. Another great thing about the LG was that it would gently beep an alert every 15 minutes to let me know I'd received a voice mail or text (if had missed it by being in a loud place). THIS phone is made more for the person who takes their phone out and looks at it every 5 minutes or so, because it's main notification is just a flashing LED .. ;P ... and IF you want an audio alert, the only setting is to have it screech every minute... and boy does it screech! It's like some kind of awful Smoke Alarm sound!... and it warns you before you turn it on that it will greatly drain the battery.. well, No Wonder! ;P3. CAMERA. The camera takes consistently BAD photos. I had 2 megapixel cameras that took better pictures than this 3.2 one.4. RESTARTS. geeeeeeez, maybe the Worst Thing is all the Random Restarts this thing does! ... sometimes 3 or 4 times a day!!

First thing I noticed when looking for Android phones was that many of the available phones had old OS versions. This one is at least had 4.0 Ice Cream.A Very convincing feature is the IPS LCD touch screen which gives it awesome viewing angles. I noticed it had an IPS screen when looking at the specs on the Kyocera main site.I gave this phone 5 stars not for being the best phone on the market, but at it's price, combined with all its features, and what I'm using it for, ya it's a 5 star phone. My area only has 3G so 4G wasn't an issue.I loaded it with a 8GB class 10 micro SD card and loaded a bunch of apps like ebay, PayPal, Torque, Firefox, BroView, Scan, Newegg, Adult Swim, all work great. I used Bluetooth to transfer all contacts from our old phones.Note that it has a 320p resolution (480x320) so you can't watch HD videos. Just pay attention to the resolution of video content you want to watch on it. It was easy to put a nice music collection on it. Voice assisted navigation works great. I use speech to text to send texts.I like having the full keyboard option but find that I usually just use the touchscreen, I use a small stylus cause I have big fingers. I do have to hold down the power button to reboot it around once every 2 weeks, or anytime I feel it's slowing down. It freezes up on me maybe once a month, reboot and it's cool. I noticed it helps to click on the recent apps tab and close em all, also clear old notifications when it slows down a bit.If you just need a basic android phone, or are just now upgrading from non android, and don't need HD content, then this phone will do just fine. MANY of the other phones offered have weaker processors, older android versions, and don't have IPS screens but cost more than this one (for some reason,) so even after using this phone for about 4 months now, I still feel it's the best overall deal.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone to Replace Your Computer when Travelling", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Author / Researcher / Book R...", "ReviewID": "R27O422Z3XPUK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly, I think this phone is fantastic.  Although it's the first smartphone I've had, I have had the iPod Touch for years and thought I would never be able to live without it.  But since I got this phone, I passed on my iPod Touch to my kids.The biggest attraction for me was the keyboard.  I love having an external keyboard that I can type emails and such on.  That part is fantastic.But let me elaborate a bit.Earlier this year, I went to South Korea with this phone and my computer.  Apparently, I didn't bring the right plug for my computer and ended up only having this phone for communication.  While it can NOT access the international telecommunication networks, I still brought it for camera, games and reading purposes.  When I called Virgin to ask if I would be able to access Wi-Fi in another country, they told me no... but that turned out to be false.  I don't know if Virgin just doesn't know it, but this phone DOES connect to ANY Wi-Fi regardless of what country you're in.  Since I'm a writer and need a real keyboard for my work, I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with this phone, and they worked together fantastically.  With just an Office app and a Bluetooth keyboard, I was able to do my usual writing and I could access my files through Dropbox.I was not able to use Skype with this (because the camera is on the backside and not the front), but I was able to take pictures and videos.  I was also able to get my Kindle books and do research in another country.  I could access Facebook and my email, and without this phone, I think I might have gone crazy in another country.  (I was by myself and my Korean is only so-so.)  On top of that, I was able to download a subway app that let me get around both Seoul and Busan with just my phone.All in all, I would definitely buy this phone again.

Thus, inadvertently, the user can turn down the volume of the ringer without even noticing. In fact that is what happened to me non-stop when I got the phone. My previous phone had been an LG Rumor Slider. On that phone as user has to actually press the button vs simply touching, and only then the volume of the ringer would change.

To learn it, you know? Okay, I'm done now. If I sound redundant, it's because I can't believe the phone finds new ways, daily, to let me down.Lessee, I'll try to be positive. Um, it ALWAYS boots up. And....it is very reliable when I want to solve a Sudoku puzzle. Oh, yeah! The texting is effective (using WIFI, not data). These three things are why it gets two stars instead of one.And that's all I have on the positive side.On the other hand:Try to make a call? You're so funny. IF the call connects, it will be dumped within minutes, if not seconds.Try to answer a call? Well...you know, if you don't mind if the ringtone continues to play while you're trying to talk to your caller. Seriously.Oh, and then there's the whole \"the app isn't responding, would you like to close it\" thing...which is PARTICULARLY noticable when the \"app\" is the calling (phone) app. Yep.Um...more fun....How about this: You look up Android app after Android app to find out they won't run on this device. Ooorrr...Google Play lets you download them...and they still don't run.Big name apps, like Yahoo Mail, GMail, Facebook, Facebook Page Manager...time out.Another cute thing this phone does: It recognizes data service...until I launch an (any) app. Then, the service evaporates. I suspect the poor little phone can't think about the data service AND running an app at the same time.But, I have never, EVER had any problems while playing the Sudoku app. So if you just want to send and receive texts, and solve Sudoku puzzles, this is the phone for you. If you were actually looking for a PHONE to TALK on, you are better off with a prepay flip phone from Wal-Mart (which is what I've gone back to).

It is probably a fine phone, but not for the challenged (that's me) - and they are all frustrating - the screen is smaller than I like and trying to read or see anything is very difficult, no - impossible - for me.

It does what most every other smartphone does, just for less money.  The pros about this phone are everything you'd expect from it's sales pitch says so I'll just limit my description mainly to the cons, which there are really only two of.I can't attest for the speed of the phone with games and such but I haven't had any real problems with load times for basic apps.  There are short waiting times to load apps (between 1 and 4 seconds in my experience) but they are completely acceptable for this price of a phone.The camera is terrible.  It is unusable for bar codes or anything with detail no matter the lighting or phone stability.  It is pretty fuzzy (great for if you ever see Big Foot in the distance).  Though the light on it is exceptional.  With an app, it can easily be used as an emergency flashlight as it is very bright.My biggest beef with this phone (and it did concerned me before I even purchased it) is the battery life.  With very minimal use (light texting and checking the time here and there) and a battery saving app, I can get it to last 3 days.  With my normal use (still pretty lightweight) I have to charge it every other night.  If I do anything halfway productive on it, it'll last a day.  I knew this problem when I decided to convert to a smartphone (used to charging every other week), but even for smartphones, this battery is rated on the lower end.I'm a low maintenance person and besides these two things (camera and battery life), I love the phone.  I especially love the sliding keyboard.  This was my first time using one and picked it up naturally.

After upgrading from my LG Optimus Elite, the phone has by far has more features and a better battery life than any other phone I had from Virgin Mobile. The phone itself is silver on the back, which is much nicer looking than black. But to be honest, if you're hands sweat a lot, than the phone will be very slippery. Android 4.0 is way better than 2.3 and its performance is good with a 1 GH processor. The camera on the back doesn't take the greatest pictures in the world, but are ok, just not in the dark. The screen is a 3.5\" TFT 320x480 capacitive. To be honest on this one, the screen is kinda crappy. The pixels are noticeable when on a web page, not so much reading a text. The battery life can last me about 14 hours on medium use with ECO MODE on after 50% of battery consumption. Kyocera adds a very nice feature for the battery that try's to limit the consuption of your battery life called ECO MODE. My final say of the phone is that its a great phone to multitask and internet browsing. The build of the phone is somewhat poor because the screen is not Gorilla Glass, so it get scratches on it easily, the back of the phone is slippery and that also gets scratches on it easily too.

That's a tough combination to find, and on Virgin this was the only choice. Unfortunately, I've been miserable with this phone from the moment the \"ooh, new phone!\" feeling wore off.The good:* SOFTWARE: It's an Android 4.0 phone for dirt cheap, so you have access to even the most recent apps in the Play Store.* KEYBOARD: The slide-out keyboard works rather well, even with my gigantic hands. It does take some adjusting for you to find just the right way to press the keys. Also, the space bar is way too stiff and never really \"breaks in.\" Once you get over those hurdles, it's a good enough keyboard for texting and short e-mails.The bad:* CAMERA: The 3.2MP camera in this phone takes much worse quality pictures than the 3.2MP camera in my old phone (LG Optimus V). The megapixels may be the same, but the quality of this camera is extremely disappointing, with washed out colors in even the best circumstances.* PERFORMANCE: The Rise's hardware is extremely under-powered for Android 4.0. With a couple apps running in the background, it can get a bit jerky and slow switching back to the home screen or opening another app. The phone becomes almost unusable with Google Chrome open, and Chrome itself runs extremely sluggish.* SCREEN: Again, compared to my much older LG Optimus V, this phone is supposed to have the same resolution. Putting the two side-by-side, though, the Kyocera Rise is a lot more fuzzy and washed out.The absolutely INFURIATING:* BATTERY: The battery life on this phone is abysmal. Just sitting idle, with the phone freshly booted and no apps open, the phone will chew up about 10% battery per hour. That's 10 hours of battery life if you're NOT using the phone. From my searching around online, I cannot find a first- or third-party battery upgrade for this phone.* SIGNAL: Whatever CDMA antenna is in this phone, it is junk. My wife also uses Virgin Mobile (with a different phone), and she consistently has a stronger signal than I do with the Kyocera Rise. Many times, I will lose signal completely, and she will have 4 bars or more. The junk antenna adds to the battery woes -- having a weak or constantly dropping signal chews up the battery, and the battery life is already dreadful to begin with.* WI-FI: I cannot figure out what causes this, and it drives me nuts. When I turn on the phone's wi-fi, the phone will either: switch to wi-fi with no problem (about 30% of the time), turn on wi-fi and freeze the phone for about 3 to 4 minutes (about 50% of the time), or freeze the phone for 10 minutes and then finally crash/reboot (20%). A phone that freezes and/or crashes 7 times out of 10 when you turn on the wireless -- that is just completely unacceptable.To give you an idea just how much I loathe this phone: for the last month, I have been giving serious thought to switching back to my LG Optimus V. That phone, which is at least 2 years older than the Rise, has an upgraded battery with phenomenal battery life, a camera that takes reasonably crisp photos, an antenna that maintains stronger signal, and a screen that's easier on the eyes. I can use the Optimus for weeks or months without it crashing or rebooting. I'm almost willing to give up the newer Android OS and the physical keyboard that I get with the Rise because its worthless battery, unreliable signal, and crashy software infuriate me on a daily basis.Do not buy this phone.

I would say less than average use. However, I had to switch to another phone after about 6 months due to the issues I ran into.Here is why I rated it the way I did.Star 1: Affordable. It's very inexpensive if this is your first smart phone. If your primary use is as a phone, with very occasional smart phone usage, it's an OK phone.Star 2: Physical aspects of the phone were good. Keyboard works really well. Sound quality was respectable. I also liked the layout of the buttons on the screen itself, especially when using the keyboard. Camera was just OK (no auto focus), but that didn't bother me enough.No Star 3: Slow response. Standard things like dialing had a longer delay than I was expecting. Occasional hanging for minutes at a time. This got more frustrating over time.No Star 4:  Buggy. Would always completely freeze when switching from mobile to WIFI if data was in use. Random restarts in the day (and that damn annoying start up sound). I would find my phone had froze and I didn't know for how long and if I missed any calls.No Start 5: Battery was inconsistent. Most days, battery would last about 12 hours (until I got home from work). However, the battery would often only last about 6-8 hours, requiring powering at work. I have a very routine schedule, so I can't really attribute it to apps or poor reception.It's not for everyone. It serves a specific demographic (first time smart phone users).

A big plus is that you can remove the battery and charge it separately with an inexpensive charger. This way, you don't have to tie up the phone to charge the battery plus the act of removing the battery \"resets\" the phone and clears up the memory. We have six batteries we rotate.

It's horrible. The 1GHz Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM is simply not enough for even basic web browsing. This phone can't have more than 1 or 2 simple applications running at once without the OS severely lagging. About 1/3 of the time, when I go to open an application I can tap the icon a good 30 or so time and hear the \"clicking\" sound the phone makes when you go to an app because it takes so long for it to do anything.

I keep reminding myself that it does this because, afterall, it IS basically a handheld computer. This phone does not take the best pics at night, and under lowlightconditions, but I would not say it's that bad. What irritates me is the speaker feature-no matter when I use it,the person on the other end will say that they cannot understand me unless I take it off speaker mode. It also shutsitself off at random (when not in use) and restart itself. Perhaps this is just what some smartphones do as a way toautomatically update firmware? Many of the games I have downloaded will freeze also, like Uno friends and Dots, butthis may be a problem with the games themselves, and not the phone. I have also found that the Rise sometimes has considerablelag when moving from one feature to the next. Overall, a descent phone for first time smart phone users.

The phone has a substantial and solid feel, and the camera is pretty good.  At first, I thought I had found a bona fide awesome bargain.Very soon I learned that the battery is not sufficient to use the phone's features for much time.  The only way for me to make it ten hours with the battery is to follow Kyocera's instructions by dimming the screen all the way down and turning off all apps and radios (like bluetooth, GPS, and wifi).  I've learned that if you need any of these features, you can use them, once.  You then will have a nearly dead battery.  If I attempt to make a bluetooth phone call or play a game or navigate, I can only do so once per charge.This essentially has crippled the phone.  It performs most of its functions well, but it can't really perform them autonomously.  I've learned to nervously watch the battery life.Ever since I got the phone, it's been automatically attempting to update the firmware.  There doesn't seem to be a way to stop this from happening.  Every few days the phone will let me know it failed in its firmware update attempt (and of course the battery will be at 25%... surprise!).  The firmware currently on the phone is 1.00.  I suspect this firmware would improve some of the power management of the device, but I have no way of knowing.  My efforts to get the firmware and manually update the phone haven't been successful, either.Finally, the phone intermittently crashes and reboots when the processor is taxed.  The main time this happens is when my GPS is recalculating because of a detour on the interstate or a major traffic jam.  So... basically the worst moments for the phone to falter.I've had no problems with the Virgin Mobile network, and I recognize that to get a phone with this level of Android I would normally pay about $30 more.

Coleman \"Geek Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R4GDI0DO5NSJ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall the phone is not too bad. There are several pros and cons to getting this phone and for me the cons were enough for me to return the phone to Amazon. I really wanted to love the phone but it didn't work out for me. One of the major issues I had with the Kyocera Rise was that I got horrible reception. I don't know if the city that I'm just doesn't have enough towers or what, but I have experienced so many dropped calls with this phone. There were many occasions that my family and friends couldn't hear me at all during a call because of the poor reception. The Qwerty slide out keyboard buttons sometimes didn't respond right way and the touchscreen keyboard was too sensitive most the time.One of the other reasons why I returned this phone was because the Bluetooth didn't work well with my car. I have a 2012 Chrysler Town and Country with the uConnect System and this phone never could keep a good connection. It was so poor. I was able to receive calls through uConnect but never could make any calls through the system.  It would always tell me that I had a bad connection or it will dial a telephone number and then say that the call was complete but then disconnect immediately. I really wanted the Kyocera Rise to work properly with uConnect so I wouldn't have to worry about using a Bluetooth headset.I'm not sure if the unit that I received was merely a dud, but I didn't want to take the chance of getting a replacement and going through this all over again so I just returned it. The phone does have some positives which earned it three stars. The positive features are the following:1. Ice Cream Sandwich Firmware2. Pretty fast at switching applications3. A good amount of internal storage and plenty of space on the SD Card that's provided4. Very sturdy and small enough to fit in your pocket5. It doesn't have too much bloat ware6.

Although on a lesser level than the Intercept, this phone still suffers from issues plaguing most inexpensive smartphones. It's certainly tolerable, but disappointing nonetheless.

No way! So, I researched \"pre-paid\" lines and found Virgin Mobile. Found the plans to be reasonable, so I checked out what they had for phones. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a second phone, but I also didn't want to sacrifice some functionality that I have with the iPhone. In comes the Kyocera Rise.I really, really like this phone! It has what I need (except, of course, the camera could be better) and more that I can't get with an iPhone. The camera isn't the best, but it still takes pretty good pictures (plus: flash!) The stock ringtones are plentiful and loud, the keyboard is a bonus for those that fat-finger texts frequently, and although you can't customize the color, the LCD notification light works bright and just right. Once in a while the system \"stutters\" - lags a little bit, but the OCD organizer that I am, I moved some things to the SD card (App Manager III from Google Play store) and that helped tremendously.Overall, I'd recommend this to someone that might be in my same situation, to parents looking for a decent alternative to contract plans for their kids, or for anyone that just needs a phone to be a phone but needs a keyboard for texting.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome First Smartphone", "Author": "J.

In order to avoid a giant mobile phone bill every month, I was using an el cheapo Gophone from ATT. Last year I bought my wife an iPhone 4S on Virgin Mobile after I realized how cheap their monthly service plans were for smartphones. After drooling over her iPhone for several months I decided to buy the Kyocera Rise for myself and make the jump to an Android phone.I can definitely say that this phone is a steal at the price point it is at. As long as you are not trying to play some intensive games, it was always fairly responsive and left a great impression of Android on me. I have used it on 3G as well as with my homes wireless router. I did however notice some lag when switching between apps and some apps take a little bit of time to start, like Pandora. Wifi works great on it, as long as you are moderately close. I could not get a wifi signal at about 200 feet from the router when some of my friends with Galaxy SII's and iPhones could, but hey this is a sub $100 phone. The battery life does leave you a little bit wanting at about 4 hours of heavy to moderate use, and just about a work days worth of juice if you don't use it much. The GPS is fairly accurate as I would use it on morning runs because of it's smaller size.All in all I would highly recommend this phone as somebody's first smartphone, especially for children.

It moves up to \"ok\" in well lit areas, but kind of stinks otherwise.The $100 retail price is a bit steep considering the two cons, but if you can get it for the $50-$60 that seems to be the norm here, it really is a steal.

The handbook isn't sufficient. You will need to go online to read the actual manual for most questions apart from \"idiot\" level info like what is a screen, where is the battery, this is the camera...etc.Tended to run hot when used continually an hour or two, as with a game, or continuous use of the navigator app. The plastic customizing case made it worse. It is seemingly fragile where it slides - I suppose those are hinges of a sort, I don't know the exact name. Anyhow, be careful taking off an added case, or removing the battery cover, so you don't damage the phone with too much pressure on the weak spots! Ladies, expect to break a nail removing either sort of case, if you hold the phone so as not to break IT instead.Phone has annoying habit of switching wi-fi to \"on\" by itself. Makes you wonder if Google or someone needs it to spy on you! It saves battery life to only use wifi when needed.The Virgin navigation app worked very well - I feel better having it, as a supplement to AAA maps and human given directions. I'd never ever want to depend on GPS entirely, as it doesn't know local conditions (construction, one way, detour)and its idea of \"direct\" may not be yours. You can spend too much time plotting courses with the trip planner option, and still not know what the GPS is steering you into, like terrain, how much toll roads are, traffic volume, etc. Still, handy if you miss a turn off or end up in a neighborhood where kids like to steal road signs!Phone IS heavy, more so then my billfold. (wish it were the reverse! lol) I definitely notice if it's in my coat pocket or purse. The contours are not hand-friendly. Ergonomically, it's just fair. Holding it to text hurts my hands after a short while - 15 minutes, say. Because the weight is more to the part of the phone above the keyboard, and puts a constant pull on your finger grip. As others have noted, the top row of keys is too close to the edge of the slid-away phone piece, making it awkward. Especially if you like to let your nails grow or- heaven forbid - get long acrylics. In that case use Swype instead.But then, if you don't need a keyboard - and like Swype - you don't need a slider phone, and can pick a lighter one.Most apps worked fine. Games were often too tiny to be playable, though Baby Dragons and Bubbleworld work ok. Action games definitely do not. Maybe for adolescent males with lots of Pepsi and testosterone, and young eyes...After less than a month of use, the replacement phone started having trouble freezing up in the middle of an app it previously ran okay, like AAA Trip Advisor, or the game Baby Dragons. Sometimes it locked the screen as I turned it (tilt sensor) and the screen was cockeyed and unresponsive, so I had to power it off if waiting didn't let it do what it needed to do. I am wondering if these were refurbs sold as new ... my first Rize had little scratches on the screen, and shut itself off sometimes. (but was mailed in unprotected yellow envelope)This one was boxed properly for shipping.Pictures were excellent. Exchanging pics with Bluetooth was not. Never did convince it to cooperate with my LG800 tracphone, or my other Rize. It would send but then - nothing. Or, data was too large and it just wouldn't send. Maybe a more savvy user could have made it work.Overall a good, affordable, smartphone with a few bugs - I think the Ice Cream Sandwich o/s may have some limits that just were not disclosed.

Correa \"siriusbro\"", "ReviewID": "R17V8JX5ZRXY1W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do alot on my phone; browsing, emails, apps, texting. I needed a phone that could do this efficiently and reliably (and have a mp3 player, but it's pretty standard these days).In the first month, it had been not-so-great in it's performance. I live in a black hole of coverage area but the call clarity everywhere else has been satisfactory. I had a problem with it turning on unless I had it plugged in.  A big problem.  The phone seems to lag a little(I was a little upset bc it was ICS-an upgrade) but nothing unusually slow.  The speaker and camera quality are excellent.  Entering month six, there's some issues that I've decided warranted this review.Games like Angry Birds, etc. will lag like 50% of the time and force close on occasion.  I think this is because like I said above, I live in a black hole for cell signal, ..buy why do I need any signal if the game is downloaded to my phone? I don't know if this is just my ignorance, but every time I remove the memory card (which I use as music storage) and then replace it, all my playlists are gone. Like others have wrote, the phone seems to reboot ALOT when it feels like it which is a distraction sometimes.  People have complained about the battery but I feel some desire to say I haven't felt handicapped by it, but that might be because my life has me near a charger 10 hrs a day.  But I've played with apps while listening to music in the back for 30-45 minutes at times and it hasn't drained the battery to low levels.Let my summarize this by saying that I'm the most fical person with phones I know.  Taking a look, it was the perfect size for me, it was android, and I even liked the name. Awesome. However, the problem with the rebooting has become exponentially annoying.  And the phone's \"par or worse\" performance with gaming seems like a cheat because this design is less than a year old.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R1HWH5UI4UAYZK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, the first phone they sent me was a bust.  Quite literally, it is now coming apart (busted), and I've only had it for about a week and a half.Of course, Amazon product replacement is amazing, so the new one will be here today, hopefully without the manufacturing defects of my current phone.If it weren't for this problem, I would have given the phone 4 stars.  If the problems persist, I will adjust my rating accordingly.So far, great things about the phone:-Android 4.0. I came from an Optimus Slider, and while the OS was fine on that one (2.0), it's nothing compared to 4.0.  HUGE improvement for me.-Nice keyboard.  I like the size of the keyboard, the keys are spaced well, and it feels great to type on.  A little nicer than my Optimus Slider-Relatively fast processor.  It's certainly not the creme de la creme (far from it), but in comparison to my Optimus Slider, this thing pretty much flies.  It slows down occasionally, but overall is just a much more fluid experience.-Decent battery life.  Without using any battery saving apps, I get a full day out of the phone.  My Optimus Slider had trouble lasting half the day (I'm not joking).  It's not Iphone battery life, but for my purposes (medium duty use; lots of email and texting, very little web) it gets the job done.-Price.  I paid $60.  Enough said.Things not to get excited over:-Build quality.  Obviously the first unit I received could have been a fluke, and I will update if that's the case.  But again, I paid $60.  I'm not expecting Iphone build quality.  However, it also shouldn't fall apart in the first week and a half.-Screen.  I'm not one of those people that need the best smartphone experience.  That should be obvious by my purchase of this phone.  So when I say the screen isn't great, it's still just fine for me and my purposes.  But it is lower DPI than even my Optimus Slider, and the screen on that phone wasn't great either.  Photos don't look great.  Everything else is fine; reading books on it is fine.  AND, the screen is quite responsive for a cheap phone.I will definitely update this review with my further thoughts as time goes on.  As for now, I'd recommend the phone for the budget-minded consumer (and if you're with Virgin, I'm pretty sure you're budget-minded), with the caution that you get what you pay for and may have to go through a couple copies of the phone.  We'll see how my second one holds up!***UPDATE Feb. 2, 2013***I have now been using my second copy of the phone for a while.  Thankfully, it has had none of the build problem of the first phone which, after closer inspection before sending back, simply had some screws loose (don't we all).  The new phone has been quite good, though not without its caveats.  One is that the 'Mobile ID' app is ridiculous.  This is perhaps not a fault of the phone itself, but whoever decided this app was a good idea should be... well... I'll leave that to speculation.  The app downloads without asking you, you can't stop it, you can't uninstall it, and once it FINALLY downloads (after multiple failed attempts), it changes everything on your phone that you have spent a lot of time and energy getting right.  It's very frustrating.  Sure, after a while of fidgeting, I figured out you can go back to your original profile, but why would I want an app to change all my settings and home screens and apps AFTER I have the phone completely set up??  Why in the WORLD would I want that?  It's ridiculous, super annoying, and simply should not exist.Other issues are minor bugs that seem to pop up now and then, possibly related to installed apps, but they are bugs I've never experienced before in a phone, such as random music that starts to play with the screen is off (music that I don't have in my library, to be clear).  It's very odd.That all said, I'm UPPING my rating from 3 stars to 4.  Why?  Simply because I got the phone for $59.  That's the reason, plain and simple.  The build quality on the first phone sucked to be sure, but the second one is holding up quite well, and for the most part, works quickly and accurately with no freezes and decent battery life.  Who cares if it dies in a year?  I could buy one of these per year and it would take me more than 8 years to spend the money I would have had I bought an IPhone.  And how long would that IPhone have lasted?  2 years at best?  In a world that is increasingly becoming a throw-away society, this is the ultimate throw-away item.  Extremely cheap, and works well enough to get the job done.4 stars(Update April 25, 2013)Okay, so I'm now done with this phone.  I just ordered a Samsung Galaxy Victory.  I hate, hate, hate losing the physical keyboard, but this thing is becoming unusable.  First thing is, almost 2 months ago (right about after my last update), the phone offered a firmware update.  Awesome!  Well it took 4-5 tries to download the update, and after it finally worked, I started receiving TWO texts for every one that was sent to me: the text and then a copy of that text.  That's been going on for over a month.  Drives me batty because I use this phone for work too, and the sheer number of texts I receive now is astronomical.  Ridiculous.  But that's not the worst.  Over time, and especially in the last week (the reason I broke down and ordered a different phone), it has started to act... oddly.  The touch screen will stop responding at weird times, forcing me to restart.  The 3g will work... sometimes.  Then it won't work, then it will, then... what the hell is it doing???  Switching from wifi to 3g is like going through some nightmare of data unavailability that can take up to 15 minutes to work itself out (unless I, you guessed it, restart the phone).  I LOVE the keyboard.  LOVE IT.  This is the only reason I hate getting rid of this phone.  It makes me sad more phones aren't made with physical keyboards.  They are essential for the working person who uses their phone for emails and the like.  *sigh* I will simply have to get used to it.  Somehow.  Bye bye Kyocera.

The samsung is priced at twice the amount of this phone and I much prefer this phone, it even has better specs. The processor in this phone is great, it supports flash software for games etc, the screen is a decent size and the camera has flash. It looks and feels a little cheap and this fact as well as the kyocera brand not being as well known is probably why this phone is priced so affordably. The screen isn't as crisp and bright as some phones but it's not bad either. The biggest perk to this phone vs. other smart phones is the battery life. Other androids I have owned have drained battery every 6-10 hours (depending on the phone) with moderate use... this baby can quite easily go 24 hours between charges, and it charges  quickly! And I'm just using the default battery, not even an extended one! In the past I have always charged my phone overnight (bad for the battery, I know) and usually additionally throughout the day but I don't even have to bother with this phone, I just charge it as needed, which isn't inconvenient given the quick charge time. I don't know what this phone does differently but other smartphone companies need to take a hint! It might not be the sleekest phone I have owned but it's my favorite and I can't get over the price. This phone is pretty durable too: it has been dropped, thrown (accidentally), with no damage to the  screen or phone hardware. The slider qwerty is a little on the stiff side when sliding but I think this trait probably makes for a more durable phone.

To conserve battery power, go into the eco mode settings and activate each \"leaf\", except for the 15sec sleep and the auto-rotate option. You should have 4 out of 6 \"leaf\" ratings. The battery should last normal now, unless you constantly play games or videos all day. Three major drawbacks: no memopad, no \"to-do\" list, and videos can stutter or stall (not sure if it's the phone or Virgin's network). Got it on sale for $30 so I'm not really complaining.

I don't think it's that bad, at least you know where the top of the phone is.CONS:There are not alot of options for assigning notifications to the Virgin apps they give you. The phone consistently tends to get stuck on the internet and playing videos. I though buying a 32gb microSD would give it a little more RAM to work with but this did not help at all. AND (like all android phones) power goes pretty fast when WIFI, Bluetooth, Synching, Live wallpapers, Widgets and GPS are turned on. Virgins apps do not help as they tend to keep wanting you to connect to SOMETHING. So somewhere you gotta sacrifice.SO as long as you're cool with not going on the internet very often or using youtube to show someone that funny cat video, then this phone is great.

What it lacks in autofocus it does not make up in relatively poor sensor quality.  Cannot use barcode scanning, remote document scanning, or bank scanning apps with the camera - if you get close enough for the resolution you need, the fixed focus is fuzzy.  Ok for casual pictures.Touch buttons at the bottom of the screen are over-sensitive: I can activate all of them by accident while holding the phone in my hand.Overall, not a big fan.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cant beat it!!!", "Author": "Kerri", "ReviewID": "R1DI35T3V2YJ4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was a steal for me, it is one of the best phones I've bought and I only paid like $16 for it.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its okay.", "Author": "BizzleMan", "ReviewID": "R1JWZXV7DEMR7D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Only get this phone if you want a keyboard phone really bad.

Had the same problems, and this time, the phone would randomly power off, even when it still had 89% battery. I would try using the power button to power it back on, and it would not turn on. The only way to get it back on was to remove the battery, put it back in, plug the phone into the wall charger, and then hold down the power button.

When I picked up a fully charged phone (the light turned green) and immediately checked the battery power %, it was only showing 97% instead of 100% power!  WTH!  The battery drains very quickly with this phone.  I constantly have to check the phone and turn things off.  In addition, when I am done talking on the phone, the screen goes blank!  I have to hit the power button in order to turn things on so I can hang up the call.  Moreover, if I want to check my voicemail, I need to get outside of the phone menu and use a voicemail button.  The unlimited 3G speed is such a joke. In some areas, I was getting 0.01 MB upload speed! Forget about watching YouTube and VEVO with this phone.  Besides that, I frequently push the camera button by accident.  As a matter of fact, I once pushed the camera button accidentally while I was using the Google Navigation App (not very good) in my car.  When the camera was capturing the outside world on the screen, I thought Google had incorporated Street View in its Navigation app!I will be cancelling my $35/month service with VM and I will be using this phone strictly as a backup portable MP3 and Google Play device (Wi-Fi).  The $35 unlimited Data/Text message plan is only great if you have a 4G phone and when you are in a 4G coverage area.Based on my personal testing during the past five days covering San Francisco to Lake Tahoe, AT&T;'s LTE offers the fastest speed for upload and download.  It is faster than Verizon.  However, Verizon's system seems to have less drop calls in certain areas (using iPhone 5's).  If VM drops the purchase price of a 4G phone to less than $50, I will do a report on my findings on VM's 4G speed and coverage.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI have so many cell phones but I didn't own an Android phone.  When I saw the ad last weekend, I bought this phone at Radio Shack for only $49.99 on sale.  After playing with this phone for three hours, there are so great things about this phone but there are also some terrible things with this phone.1.  Great ringtones!  I love them!2.  I love the live background.3.  It has built-in Wi-Fi.4.  It handles 32 GB SD card with ease.5.  Its UI is awful.  iOS is far more superior.6.  Its camera is garbage grade.7.  Its music player (Google Play) is very good.  Currently, Google allows you to upload 20,000 songs in the cloud for free.  Furthermore, it downloaded album cover for most of the albums.8.  The OS would freeze for no reason.9.  Battery life is only OK.10. It is bulky.11. It is also heavy.12. It does not have a front facing camera.13. The back cover for the battery feels fragile.14. The OS can be customized.15. The speaker is fairly loud.16. I like the long pull out keyboard.17. Call sound quality is average.Overall, it is the cheapest Android phone I have found so far.

The battery lasted for about 3 minutes before dying. I sent it back and got a replacement. Same problem! I'm giving you an official warning: DON'T BUY THIS PHONE FROM AMAZON! DON'T DO IT! Do yourself a favor and save yourself the aggravation.that was my previous review when I kept getting sent phones with faulty batteries. I finally got one from VirginMobile's website and its worked almost perfectly ever since. I'm trying to send this news around... if you have this phone and are having trouble with it turning off randomly... do yourself a favor and don't send it back! and easy fix to try is to pull the back cover off and insert a piece of cardboard like the back of a matchbook underneath the battery. Replace the cover, start up the phone and presto! no more problems! I had this problem and stumbled across and obscure forum where this guy mentioned doing this. Honestly, from experience, this easy fix works!All in all i love this phone. I've never had a smart phone before so I don't really have any need for heavy gaming on it or being on facebook youtube or vine constantly. I basically use it for e-mail, getting on facebook and pinterest occasionally throughout the day, text messaging and calling people. If the phone gets light to medium use during the day (use defined as: the screen is light and doing something with the phone)the phone does last all day without charges in-between. If you are going on vacation DEFINITELY pack a charging cable! A good idea i just thought of with this phone is to carry and extra phone battery with you... in case u are walking and using battery heavy apps like GPS.The RAM on the phone is ok... could be a little faster but it gets the job done. The phone has frozen on me half a dozen times since I've had it, back that usually occurs when apps are updating and I'm using apps that require more memory like surfing the internet, youtube, etc.The phone is also a little bit heavy, especially with a phone case that goes on it... which is an absolute must! I recommend getting the EMPIRE phone case and screen protectors for this phone... they have saved my phones ass a couple of times! I've even dropped the phone once from 4 feet off the ground and nothing happened! By the way... I don't recommend dropping ur phone from 3-4 feet or anytime... there is always the possibility, even with a phone case on that ur phone could get messed up so please don't do it on purpose!WiFi is relatively fast and download speeds can range from 500kbps to 2 or 3mbps... really depends upon the speed of the network... could be even faster. The screen brightness is good with the auto-brightness option working surprisingly well, though it sometimes has a hard time in dark situations dimming the darkness all of the way down to save battery... The phones speaker is pretty good... not the best but very respectable... and loud!The phones camera located on the back is ok at 3 megapixels. shots can get pretty grainy depending upon the lighting situation and the darker you get the grainier the image... indoor shooting without a lot of light is horrendous... u can pretty much forget about taking good pictures with this phone without good lighting. I don't really use my phones camera that much and the occasional times that I've used it the pictures turned out ok... not great but reasonableRemember, this phone is only $70! An absolutely incredible budget phone! If ur the kind of person who will mostly use the phone as a phone, text throughout the day, maybe check e-mail and surf the internet lightly, then this is just the phone for you! The slide out querty keyboard is great for texting... the big buttons are easy to push... the top row is a little too close to the phone but its not bad... all in all a great budget smart phone: couldn't be happier!
