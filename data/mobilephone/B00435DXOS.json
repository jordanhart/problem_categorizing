It's made of plastic water bottles, has solar panels, and offers some other cool \"green\" features.  As far as the phone itself goes it's very average.  The solar panels do work but i've left it in the sun for an hour and barely gotten any kind of a charge from it.  Everything else is really just par for the course for what a phone is supposed to do.  It's a fine phone but way over priced.  If you appreciate it for its \"green\" efforts than maybe it's worth it to you, that's why i bought it and am fine with the price.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "SW", "Author": "SW", "ReviewID": "R6ZB1KC94QLTU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone for the EMF ratings the bestkeyboard is the issue stinks its like an old phone ..but this phone has way to many good things going for itworks great great phone..", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but unlocked had no internet on AT&T;", "Author": "Philip J.
