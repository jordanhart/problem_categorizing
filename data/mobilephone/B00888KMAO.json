First one I gave it to my son works great. But with this order I placed with BREED  the phone says no SIM card. Tried different sims but no luck.  I was advised by BREED that it need sim with data plan to startup the phone, tried that too, still says no SIM card. It's just a rip off, I am very unhappy with them, will be talking to amazon to verify their sub standard products maybe the phone  was refurbished.I hope rest of u guys be careful  when u order stuff with BREED.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "the best htc phone", "Author": "simplycq", "ReviewID": "R1PE3Q8DYRGLU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my phone.
