{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice set of features for an all around good phone", "Author": "j&b;", "ReviewID": "R2FVDGHMQRK99W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was coming form a Motorola MB632 with Android 2.3 (looks like no more above low end android portrait qwerty phones coming soon from any manufacturer, so I am jumping to a medium screen with a virtual keyboard)I was planning on getting a Samsung Galaxy SIII mini which I had set up for some relatives.but I went for The Blu Tank 4.5.  Here are some phone details-The screen is 540x960 pixels, compared to 480 x 800 of the Samsung Galaxy SIII mini-Using double SIM cards (you should check if your operators are compatible with the phone gsm/hspa bands) one SIM is only GSM, and the other is GSM, HSPA.  You can set up both cards to be on in standby mode and set default/always ask for voice calls / video calls / Messaging and Data Connection, also associate Contacts to a particular SIM-When connected by USB, the Phone Storage and the SD card are shown as mass storage devices, and not as a Media Device as some Samsung phones-Memory available for applications is 500 Mb, Phone Storage is 2 Gb.  With about 40 installed apps (Facebook the biggest one), and moving all enabled apps to the Phone Storage I Have about 120 Mb free app memory-The FM radio player allows sending the sound to speakers-The phone has a back cover with a waterproof ring for the battery, SIM and memory card area, as well as flaps to cover the micro usb port and the headphone jack. I have not made water inmersion tests.-Battery life with 3 days testing is mixed, with moderate use, one day the phone lasted the whole day, two days it barely made it.-This phone comes with a 1Amp AC USB charger, but it charges as well with other wall or car chargers which output 550mAh, some samsung phones wont charge with those lower capacity chargers.-Phone Camera gives good pictures with good light, it has a small flash ledOverall I am satisfied with this phone, good features and flexibility for the price.UPDATE JUNE 2013The phone keeps working fine, only two issues-There is a strange sound problem, when the phone is paired with a bluetooth car radio for phone audio (no media) and using Waze for car navigation, after a phone call is made or received, in some cases the phone sound stops working, there is a strange low frequency \"moan\" coming from the speaker.  Phone needs to be reset.-Available memory has become an issue, even after moving all possible apps to the sd card, using AppMgr III (app2sd), it is difficult to keep certain apps, just naming a few  (facebook, firefox, google+, flipboard, dropbox, chrome, hangouts) easily eat half the memory with the app, updates, data and cache, the new vine app uses 50 Mb just by itself.  below 50 Mb (10%?) a low storage warning appears and some services such as email stop working.  It has become difficult to keep the free memory and even test new apps.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good enought and more", "Author": "Brent", "ReviewID": "R2ER0I73CXZ5PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is good enough to do your everyday mobile activities and more. If you want extreme multitasking don't buy, instead pay $600 US and up for a smartphone. For $200 US you get the best bang for your buck on the market (new that is). I never exceed five programs opened simultaneously , games run smooth, apps work fine, volume is loud, it's dual sim and works like a charm. At first when I unintentionally pushed it to the extreme by opening programs after programs and it really freezed up but when I realized that it's 512 ram and dual core, then it hit me there is only so much multitasking you can do just like a computer with same specs. Not saying you can't multitask just not to the extreme because I multitask. Actually I bought two, one for my wife and one for me. The phone is not too large, battery is decent, takes good pictures, connection is great etc. I have not tested the water proof and dust proof yet but trust me it will be test because I don't baby up (treat delicate) my phones and it fell accidentally already, not a scratch. This is just my humble opinion as a user. Therefore if you're looking for extreme processing power go for a higher end smartphone but if you more simpler and just want to be able to take pictures, video record, play games, download apps, spend one third or even a quarter the the price of the best smartphones out there and you get an added bonus of dual sim unlock, go for this phone.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super failure of a Phone.", "Author": "Geospart \"I Drank What? - The Last Words of S...", "ReviewID": "R1NXHICYTGSGNU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "2 Stars because it does work as a phone.I returned this within a week or so.Pro's:Super ThinDid have the android market.Had JellybeanWater Resistant (maybe never tested)Dual sim for the International traveler.Multi TouchCons:MP3 audio sounds really bad.

In the end though, a stronger processor would have really made a difference. Putting in a 1.5 GHz dual-core is surely more expensive but I would have been willing to pay for that extra performance. Every app I have tried so far works smoothly but you do notice a difference in how fast apps are opened or, respectively, start. Launching the PONS dictionary app, for example, requires around 2+ seconds. On my old phone with a 1.2 GHz quad-core, the app was ready in under a second. But this is just a nice to have thing and of course comparing the performance for such a low priced phone with a quad-core operating one is not fair. So four stars for getting exactly what was promised. What also keeps it from getting five stars, is the fact that holding your finger on the toch screen actually results in a quivering of the running programme. For instance, the information bar you can drag down from the top is espically quavery while some apps scroll imprecisely. Furthermore, the wifi loses internet connection from time to time. The phone itself is still connected to the router, but no data from or to the internet is coming through. I could not figure out why or what to do against it. The only thing which helps is turning wifi off and on again.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Meh", "Author": "Zachary Harland", "ReviewID": "R3VIF6SDU3QEEY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's ok. Nothing special. About the same processing and RAM as a Galaxy S. However, it does have its quirks. You have to maintain a close eye on the internal storage vs. the phone storage and the SD card. Apparently the internal storage (500MB) is for app data and the app caches and will fill quickly giving an error for space requirements, despite having a phone storage capacity of 2 GB. All in all, while the product seems to work ok, I'll go for a Samsung next time.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice product", "Author": "D.Sweat", "ReviewID": "R13JA9O6D4FQ7L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is a great buy for those new to the smart phone genre.

This phone will not get 3G high speed data service (internet) in the US (only in Europe). Both T-Mobile and AT&T; are widely on the 1900mhz band and this phone is 2100, which is mostly used in Europe. Blu has two separate models for the Tank 4.5 that work on the two different bands: W110i (this one) and W110a (the American version).I've had complaints about people having a hard time hearing me unless I keep the phone flat on my cheek. I am not sure if it is just my unit or they are all like this. Speaker phone is out of the question, no one can hear a thing I say.The Good:The phone works great, other than the voice problem above! It's interface and functionality are very smooth and useful. I have not tried it's water proof-ness, but it is nice to know there is protection from bad weather. GPS navigation and battery life have been great. I like the phone and the fact it can take two sim cards, but I just cannot work with 2G internet connection, and that is why I will be returning it.BOTTOM LINE:If you will be using the phone for simple tasks like navigation, talk, text, and occasional web, and you do not need the high speed access, then this is perfect!", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost great.", "Author": "Adam H  Bleech", "ReviewID": "R27XAVNGVYGY7G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ignored other reviewers making this point and I regret it. This phone does not have enough internal storage. Also, if you don't need dual sim functionality it actually is quite annoying as it always asks you what sim you want to use even though you only have one. I mean, every time you send a text, it either won't send or will ask what service you want to use to send it.

There is currently no Amazon listing for w110a, only difference being the operating frequencies will allow 3g in USA.)For the price, this phone is awesome.  It actually responds better than my Moto Droid 3. As other reviewers mentioned, on-device memory can run low... Be sure to download an app to automatically move programs from phone to sd card memory.  I have a ton of apps loaded - all on the SD card.  This is first android phone I've used where tethering worked properly and easily.  I attribute to the new Android Jelly Bean software is awesome - really fast and responsive compared to 2.3.  It seems really durable, and yes, it is pretty water proof, I did try it out by dropping in glass of water.This phone also comes with a nice plastic case, earphones, and screen protector.
