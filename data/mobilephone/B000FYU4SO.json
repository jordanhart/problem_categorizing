{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Smartphone - Scratch that....bad  Smartphone", "Author": "Dennis \"bozhed\"", "ReviewID": "R2ALVE723XII69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read a lot of the reviews and spoken to a number of current owners of the Motorola Q. I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo's, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about \u00bd up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and \"Kill All\" tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update: 6/12/06After a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn't even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.  I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon's rating system they cannot be changed.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Compact and useful mobile tool", "Author": "B. Lim", "ReviewID": "R3I9R4POB9WAOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MotoQ is a very good tool.  The designers have optimized the features for people who need to be connected via voice, email, and web without carrying a briefcase full of stuff everywhere.It's not a PC, so you will be disappointed if you intend to work extensively with a spreadsheet or other work applications.  This device is also not for power PDA users that service data centers from their huge PDA's.However, if you are on the road and want to be able to review an email, word, excel, power point, acrobat document, or quickly find information on a website from just about anywhere, this is an awesome tool.  I decided to keep my MotoQ when I had to review a 4MB pdf file for work during a family outing.  I was able to download the file and review it on the MotoQ.  A 5 minute time out was so much better than any other options.Something I found very delightful is the fact that I have constant access to the internet.  Waiting in lines has become just a little bit more tolerable since I could surf the net instead of reading 6 month old magazines.I was very concerned about a lack of touch screen, but within a day, the scroll & navigation keys won me over.  It is very nice to be able to use only one hand.So, why did I select the MotoQ over BlackBerry?  The MotoQ is actually a very good phone with superior call quality.  The bluetooth and speakerphone are the best I've used.  I was quite disappointed by calls on the BlackBerry, a deal breaker for me.  Please note that sending and receiving emails seem to be a bit faster on the BlackBerry, but downloading information from the web seems to take the same amount of time.  For me, functionality favored the MotoQ's phone call advantage, and the aesthetics made it easy to go with the MotoQ.**********Update: 6/17/2006As with previous reviewers, the honeymoon is already over.  I am finding that none of my prior PocketPC applications will install on this phone.  If you are migrating, you should seriously consider this.  Fortunately, there is only one application I really use frequently, and there are other less convenient ways to compensate for my application.Also, if you use the bluetooth headphone a lot, you really need the big battery or charge it frequently.  I was surprised to get a low battery warning on the MotoQ mid-day when my Razr would last the full day with similar usage.  The large capacity battery makes the phone look much less attractive, and it will no longer fit well in the nice fitted case.On the other hand, I've received several compliments on the sound quality of the phone on the handset, bluetooth headset, and speaker phone.  I don't remember getting so many positive comments on other cell phones I've used.I've got a few more days before the full refund expires if I opt for an annulment.  So, I'll keep it for now and post how I decide.**********Update: 6/22/2006OK.  I am keeping the MotoQ.  Let me go through my decision process in case it is of some use to you.First, more problems I encountered:(Please note that I am not tech support, and I am limiting my time on solving MotoQ problems.  So, there might be better solutions.  If you have them, I hope you will post.)(1)  If you get an attachment in the email, you cannot save it to the storage card.  This is lame.  There is a work around:  you can save the message into your Draft folder and view it later so that it doesn't disappear from your Inbox post-PC_download-send/receive.  If you have a lot of documents, your memory will fill up fast since the Draft folder is part of your internal storage.(2) You cannot edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint).  You can only view them.  Perhaps there might be 3rd party software that can do this.  For me, only real bummer is that the spreadsheets could be useful sometimes for simple math such as adding a bunch of numbers.(3) Windows Mobile OS almost survived a week without crashing, but crash it did.  Minor inconvenience, it just needed to be power cycled.  (Update: Windows Mobile OS has been crashing about once per month, not bad for MS)(4) For security code, you can only enter numbers.  And, because you have to press the activate-numbers-key, you cannot unlock the phone one handed.  This is really lame.  (Update: you can press the \"ALT\" key twice to lock it in the number key mode, so you can do this with one hand.)(5) I've been able to find all the PDA programs I used on my Dell Axim with comparable replacements for the MotoQ.  However, I've had to purchase all of them, and I have now spent a big chunk of the MotoQ discount on replacement software.Something obvious in retrospect:The MotoQ is a \"smartphone\", not a PocketPC PDA with a phone.  This was not a distinction that was clear to me with the fuzzy marketing; also smart since I probably would not have tried the MotoQ if this was obvious.  So, migrating from my Dell Axim to MotoQ was easy; nothing could be saved... buyer beware!Why I am keeping the MotoQ:I've identified more cons than pros so far, but there is a very positive and significant thing about the MotoQ: I use it all the time.  My wife noticed that the only other devices I've used as much were my Palm V & Sony Clie; may they both rest in peace.In spite of all the problems, the MotoQ is very convenient, so I use it.  I feel a little bit more organized and connected; more in control over my schedule.  I have some similar flashbacks of the switching pains from the big Flanklin planner to the Palm V.It is nice to quickly and easily see my calendar to check for schedule conflicts, instead of asking people to wait until I return to my office.  I like being able to spell a name to make a quick phone call from my contact list, instead of waiting to return to my office to find the number.  And, I really like being able to check my email to see if an important message arrived during a flight and being able to search for information w/o looking for a hotspot.  Yes, it is another leash, but one that helps me achieve higher efficiency and save time that I can later spend with my family.What was interesting is that when my Sony Clie died from old age & high mileage, I replaced it with a much more powerful Dell Axim.  But, I did not use it.  Even with Wifi, Bluetooth, functional office apps, etc, it sat in my desk or briefcase, only to be used a couple of times per week.  I could point out a lot of detailed reasons for this, but they all come down to the device being a little bit inconvenient (does not fit well in pocket, takes a couple of seconds too long to turn on & switch apps) to use, just enough of a barrier to keep it from being really needed or wanted.How often did I use the excel spreadsheet on the Dell Axim to do simple math?  about 5 times in 3 years.  How many meetings did I miss because the Axim was on my desk and not in my pocket?  too many to count!  How often am I using the MotoQ?  Enough to require a battery recharge every night... :)**********Update: 8/24/2006I am still happy with the MotoQ.  My MotoQ is 1 of 5 that my company purchased for some of the employees.  Of this group, 4 out of 5 really like this device; the 5th is OK with it.  The 5th person \"downgraded\" from the Treo 650, and she really seems to prefer the Palm OS.  None of us experienced the catastrophic problems mentioned in other reviews for this product.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Smartphone Device--KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BUYING BEFORE YOU BUY IT!", "Author": "Technophile \"ND\"", "ReviewID": "RZIU74X9WAZE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first statement right off the bat is that those who are writing negative comments seem not to understand the difference between the PocketPC and Smartphone operating systems.  I have personally been using both since the introductions of both PocketPC (with the original iPAQ) and with Smartphone (with the original Orange SPV).  I am switching to the Motorola Q from the i-mate K-JAM (aka the T-Mobile MDA/Cingular 8125); some of my more recent devices include the Treo 650 (Verizon), Samsung i600, Orange SPV, and the i-mate Smartpone2, as well as  several iPAQs: the 4150, the 2215, and the older models as well.  I will say off the bat that I agree, the Smartphone OS is much more simplistic, and I honestly LOVE it that way because that's what a phone OS should be like.  I definitely loved the PocketPC Phone Edition with the K-JAM but found myself wanting something smaller that would handle my contacts, calendar, To-Do list, multimedia, occasional gaming, occasional eBook reading, heavy web browsing and some light document viewing.  Enter the Motorola Q.  It does everything and it does it well.  I love the Smart Dial for instance: start typing in a name OR number and it will immediately start searching your contacts database for a match from which you can directly dial.  Try doing that with one hand on a PocketPC.  You can do it, but it's cumbersome (for the K-JAM/HTC Wizard, install SmartKeys from xda-developers.com for some improved one-handedness).In fact, anything can be managed with one hand because THAT'S how Microsoft designed the operating system.  I admit off the bat that I truly do not like Windows XP and I am a Mac user.  [I synchronize my MotoQ with my black MacBook using Missing/Sync and have not had any problems synchronizing via USB (occasional trouble via Bluetooth).]Microsoft's mobile OS, on the other hand, I am a great fan of.  To those complaining that you can't edit Microsoft Office documents, WHY would you want to on a screen this small?  It's not meant for that.  You can do some TXT editing as well as some light spreadsheet editing (using PTabs...check Handango.com).The PIM organization is nearly identical on both the PocketPC and Smartphone: if you want improved management of Tasks (as well as a better Calendar), I HIGHLY recommend Papyrus or Pocket Informant (both adapted from the PocketPC apps, and both are identical on the Smartphone).  Also, I highly recommend FACADE (again, check Handango or Smartphone.net), which enables a much more detailed (and TABBED) view of your schedule and To-Do list on your homescreen.For multimedia, the Q cannot be beat...the experience is much better than the Palm OS (the best multimedia app on the Treo 650, TCPMP, is better on the Smartphone).  I use TCPMP for video (it handles iPod-encoded MP4 video that is NOT purchased flawlessly).  For music, I use PocketPlayer 2.8 from Conduits (which displays a library screen similar to my iPOD's, with Album/Artist/Album Artist/Genre/etc. categories).  Sound quality using a 2.5mm to 3.5mm headset adapter and my iPOD headphones is excellent and sounds fuller than my iPOD, albeit with a lesser volume.  The Q supports Bluetooth stereo / A2DP as well; I have not yet tested this out.Other apps I highly recommend: CityTime Alarms SP (for a top of the line alarm clock application), PocketNES (NES emulator for the occasional Mario), MobiPocket Reader (for eBooks that you can purchase or, if using a Windows computer, convert with their free desktop importer-->I currently have The Kite Runner, The Devil Wears Prada, and The World Is Flat... on my device).  Agile Messenger is a great IM program.  SlingPlayer is a MUST for SlinBox owners and works flawlessly over EVDO (just be careful not to use 10+GB of data per month, or Verizon will terminate you based on their TOS).  Finally, Virtual Earth Mobile is PERFECT for a 411/directions app all in one...it's sort of like mini Google Earth.  Excellent for a free app.  Finally, PhatNotes from [...] is a top of the line notes application for jotting things down on the MotoQ...you can add text, voice, pictures, links, etc.On data: EVDO speeds in the NYC area are excellent and extremely fast, much to my surprise.  I don't miss WiFi much and love having fast internet wherever I go.  I use the EVDO for slinging, web browsing, Wikipedia searching for research information, Google.com/xhtml for everything Google (including access to my personalized homepage and news and GMail), Virtual Earth Mobile for directions, maps, and 411 lookup-type features, Agile Messenger for AIM conversations, and NewsBreaker for RSS feeds.Battery and performance: I was disappointed at first with battery and took advantage of Verizon's extended battery offer.  I have ceased to use the battery since buying it, however.  I can now use my Q for 2 days (with all of the above being used regularly, i.e. music for 45 minutes while jogging, browsing, eBook reading, PIM, etc.) on the STANDARD battery.  The biggest battery saver is a registry hack found on QUsers.com which enables EVDO time-out disconnects; without it, the Q remains dormantly connected to EVDO until you turn Flight Mode on or reboot the phone.  I saw a significant increase in battery life.  Note, this modification is not for those who use Wireless Sync.  For those who are concerned, pick up a car charger from Amazon.com for $8.99.  As for performance, the Q is SPEEDY, particularly if you disable the Key Tones (under Sounds in Settings) and if you use a Registry editor to increase the GlyphCache (again, see QUsers.com). The performance of the camera is excellent for a camera phone and, in solid daylight, the pictures are truly print-quality (with fuzziness of course, but printworthy nonetheless in 4x6).Overall, I have owned many mobile devices and love almost all of them; none of them have been as much fun to use as the Q, and none have seen the amount of use I get out of the Q (largely due to its size and ease of transport).  I highly recommend it to everyone who is not seeking a full-fledged mobile Microsoft Office editor; also, I recommend it to those who are at least somewhat tech savvy.  It requires a litte bit of work, but so did all of my devices.  Please do your research before slamming a device for not doing what it was not meant to do!", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent so far", "Author": "Dana Kowalski \"D K\"", "ReviewID": "R2O6H5OM4NRC6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first off if you're looking for a hardcore pda to manage your business or whatever, this may not be what you are looking for so do some research first before posting a review that this isn't the PalmOS that you can run your corporate office out of.This is a smartphone, and it lives up to exactly what I thought I would get out of it.

The audio quality both on calls and during playback is really surprising and crisp.PROS------ - lightweight and great design- - excellent audio quality for a smartphone- - advanced voice recognition and other features a great bonus- - great introductory priceCONS------ - battery life. check with Verizon on the extended battery. right now they are offerring a deal on it for like $19.99 (reg $60.00).

But after a some well spent minutes at [...] everything is good again.As with my Axim X51V, and Olympus E500 SLR, TRD Supercharger, these things need tweaking out of the box for them to work as one wishes.After making the mentioned changes this device not only flys but it has made up for itself many times over.I am shocked that nobody has mentioned its Bluetooth PC Remote, you can control the mouse/desktop/powerpoint/mediaplayer using your Q via a bluetooth enabled PC.I find myself traveling frequnetly attending lectures and presentations mainly by industry leading professionals.  Yesterday our VP was presenting to a large room and got VERY bothered by the fact that the admin did not have a wireless controller for the slide show he was presenting.  20 minutes into his 2 hour presentation we had a break, and I wirelessly connected my phone to the bluetooth laptop and offered him its use.  Not only was he grateful but blown away (I am known at the office for my tech savy, but its always nice to see its practical implementation in such context).Just had to share that..Other great features are its blazing EVDO connection, it is just as quick as my blackberry from work when browsing the web, and the interface handles webpages better then my BBERRY does.The Bberrys interface was much snappier out of the box but by applying a few quick tweaks from qusers.com its within competition.Somebody mentioned the rubber flaps are weak, not true, they are the same flaps that are used on my E500 Olympus SLR camera, and my brothers 2,000 Canon SLR.And with the recent updated from Motorola you can wirelessly (bluetooth) tether it to your laptop and you can access the internet on the road!!These are the main topics that I felt were not covered at all, everything else you will find in the other reviews..Also this may even replace my Axim X51V permanently.. time will tell Ill update this again in about a month.cheers", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Previous owner of an SMT-5600, really didn't like the \"Q\"", "Author": "J. Reilly", "ReviewID": "R2H9THOSCBBUL4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the \"Q\" because I expected PocketPC features on it.  I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked.  It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be.  The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily.  Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead.  It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features.  I'm very happy with that choice.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small.  I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use.  The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first.  Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do.  Finding the * and # keys is even harder!  Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Some simple points", "Author": "Patrick Thibodeau", "ReviewID": "RXW2GR25M3GDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "-- The screen clarity is exceptional, much better than a PDA I own.-- It's not cheap. Verizon unlimited data -- on top of a phone service -- is $44.00. If you have 900 minutes and unlimited data you may be paying around $130 a month. Also, be aware that although Verizon advertises \"unlimited broadband\" it isn't selling unlimited broadband. The agreement's fine print includes prohibitions against streaming and downloading large files. You can't use this a substitute for a cable modem/dsl connection if you stream heavily.-- Battery life is no good. I bought two extended batteries, which I use full-time. The extended batteries change the shape and size of the Q but, honestly, I don't mind. Plan on buying extra batteries right away.-- The sound quality is excellent. The best I've ever had.-- The Windows software is a little buggy. Weird things pop up every now and then, but nothing that gets me excited. I haven't upgraded yet.-- Cool thing: The voice recognition actually works with the bluetooth headset.

It's hard to use with one hand, if you're a text-while-you-drive kinda person (god forbid), but it can be done, nonetheless.+The phone works just fine.

I bought a screen protector and there are no scratches and it's very easy to clean.+The scroll button and \"back\" button on the side is a nice feature+The home screen convinently shows the links to the most previously used applications, and also shows the date, time, number of messages in your inbox (text and voicemail), in addition to showing your next appointment.+It is easy to use, and I DO use it. I also looked at the Treo 700 and for the price, the Q was the obvious choice. One thing to be mindful of, though. You can view word, excel, pdf files on the Q BUT unlike the 700 you cannot edit any word or excel documents.+Verizon's Ev-Do high-speed wireless network is great. While there is no wi-fi on the phone, this feature definitely compensates. I have no problem browsing even large webpages. Make sure to get the unlimited data plan if you are going to spend any amount of time online, though- which you should be if you buy this phone- because a data package is REQUIRED.+Speakerphone is clear and loud- works nicely and theres a one-touch button that enables it as well.+Camera takes nice clear camera-phone-quality pictures.CONS:-I bought a 3rd party calender application, \"Extreme Agenda\", and it would not load or install properly. Waste of 25$.-The processing time is a TAD slow. Not a real problem for me at all, but not razor sharp.-Price - data plans are expensive through verizon.

The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.  In fact, the Q multi-tasks like a champion: One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed, surfing the Internet, and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU.  Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly.  With a gadget like the Q, laptops are suddenly looking more and more like desktops.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Does what it promises", "Author": "Mark E. Day", "ReviewID": "R21FH2FFZIN4UN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All these people complaining about the phone are clowns.  The following are the reasons why.  They are expecting something that the phone does not promise.  They want a blackberry device, but purchase this instead?  Where is the logic in that?  Also, it should be noted that this is a Smartphone, not a PocketPC.  However, people are constantly complaining that their PocketPC applications will not install.  Of course they will not install! They are not the same thing!  Thats like someone complaining that their DVD player wont play their VHS tapes.  I also see people complaining that their device freezes, or locks up.  My device did that also.  Then, I called verizon wireless, and the tech reps were very helpful.  They made a phone call to the local verizon store, and told them to replace my phone with a brand new one.  The new one i recieved worked like a charm, and never once froze.  Unfortunately, my phone was stolen from me a week ago, but I love this device so much, accompanied with Verizon's service, that i actually bought another Moto Q.  It is true, the battery life is short if you push the tool to its limits, there is no denying that. However, what exactly do you expect? This is a cell phone and you're browsing the internet, reading E-Mail, Chatting on MSN Mesenger, taking photos, video clips, listening to MP3's, Watching movies or shows on Windows Media Player, and maybe even playing games. The fact that this little device can do all that on a small battery is pretty impressive.  All the nay-sayers are just expecting something that no phone can deliver to this date.  Lastly, Motorola has just released a firmware update for the Q giving the device improved bluetooth support, SMS-to-Email functionality, and Dial-Up-Networking, just to name a few.  I almost forgot.  \"B. Lim\" complains that the phone no longer fits in the holster with the extended battery.  This made me literally laugh out loud.

But, from my week or so with it, it's mostly style and not a lot of substance.I will start with the consIt's a Smartphone and NOT a PDA phone, it can do a whole lot more then a regular cell phone, but next to a PDA this is a semi-toy.  I think Motorola isn't saying \"smartphone\" and people see it and think it's a Treo.No touch screen, no Smartphones have them, but it would make things a whole lot easier.  Can you even select/cut/paste text from a web site? I can't figure out a way.  For over $400 bucks spent (wasn't eligible for upgrade) I expect a bit more powerit's butt slow, I did the \"speed hacks\" which I found online, and they did help, but it still takes forever to boot up and some of the programs seem to sit there and think before they open.contact section is a joke, there are almost no configuration options. I ended up spending $30 bucks on Photo Contacts Pro 4, which does what the phone should have done out of the box.this ties in to the last one, you can't use mp3's as caller id ring tones, it will allow you to set an mp3 as the default ringer, but not for people in your contacts.  Photo Contacts Pro solves this, but again, I shouldn't have to spend money to do basic things.surfing the web is hit and miss. Some pages don't display right (the screen is small) and some do.  And some of the ones that do, you can't navigate well because I don't see a way to select buttons. Something the scroll wheel could and SHOULD DO!My screen fades to white and requires a reboot at least twice a day. I am going to be taking it to the Verizon store to see if I need a new phone.  From some Googling, I see there are a bunch of people returning the phones due to problems that make the phone unsable.The phone has some pros.the size & shape are very nice.  Asthetics is a personal thing, but a lot of people seem to love the looks of it. It feels pretty solid in my hand, and it only took me a few days to get the hang of using it 1 handed, even to text messagethe screen is great, it's not as big as I'd like, but it's very colorful and the text is easy to read.the speakerphone is decent.  I am very hard on phones when it comes to judging the speakerphones.  It's not nearly as loud as a Nextel phone, but it does the job much better then any other cell phone from Verizon I've used.  Ringers are plenty loud, and at max volume it doesn't crack, or hurt your ears.  Sometime a Nextel can.Battery life - a lot of people have been complaining about this, so much so Verizon sells the extended one for 20 bucks.  I honestly think with the battery size and the screen size, the phone gets acceptable battery life.  I bought the desktop charger so I can charge both batteries, get data connectivity, and have a nice little stand for my sweet looking phone. So battery life is no biggie.phone is easy to use up against your ear, nobody has complained they can't hear me, and I can hear everybody fine.depending on your stance, the fact the phone doesn't have Get It Now, may or may not good a good thing.

I decided I wanted a smartphone, I had my eyes originally set on Cingular and the BB 8700.  But with Amazon you cannot port your number and that was a big deciding factor.  I chose to go with Verizon and with the Q.  I just wanted a phone that could sync with my work Outlook calendar, was not looking to use email.  I found out that the Q would do that.After a couple of months having it, it is a decent phone.  Signal strength is pretty good.  I just moved and my old house I could only get 1 or 2 bars (my wife's E815 had full signal) but my new house I am getting full strength.  I especially enjoy the Bluetooth for my headset while driving and the IR port for syncing my Outlook calendar from my work laptop which has an IR port.  The screen is nice and crisp and the camera takes decent photos.I do agree with other posts about how it seems to take 5 \"clicks\" to get something done.  Very annoying...I also do not enjoy the lack of home screen layouts.  None of the layouts that are pre-loaded I enjoy.  I do not know how to program in XML to get one the way I want to layout. One thing that does drive me crazy is the battery door.  It is made of this cheap, flimsy plastic.  You would think with a high quality phone like this it would have a better quality plastic or even possibly metal?  The corners constantly pop out.So all and all, it is an alright phone.  I can't beat the price that I got it for and it does want I want it to do.FYI- you do have to order the phone with the data package, but you can always CANCEL it when you get the phone set up.

Dunne", "ReviewID": "R1ZKPOKEOQNUH0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I've had a Blackberry since 2001 and am addicted to e-mail and the mobile web.  I actually worked in the mobile industry for 4.5 years and was involved in applications, handsets, and mobile access.  So, naturally I compare this Motorola Q to the string of Blackberry's that I've used.  I thought that this would be the right combination to make me switch to a \"smartphone.\"  I have to say that after a month of use, it's not quite ready for prime time.  It's a great phone (great reception, pretty good speakerphone, etc.).  As far as a data device, it's ok.  The big complaint comes down to...  It's not very intuitive to use.  The user interface can be frustrating at times.  Which controls do I use (is it the roller button, the back button, the toggle, the push button, the home button, the 'off'' button...).  The applications are not consistent in how they are used and thus frustrating.  As compared to the Blackberry (even the 7130e on Verizon, which is a horrible phone, reception wise), which uses a consistent user interface across applications, it takes awhile to get used to things.  It's hard to tell if it's the immaturity of the Windows Mobile operating system, Motorola's implementation, or the immaturity of the developer tools, but likely a combination of all of the above.  One really annoying quirk is the roller button keeps going into adjusting the headset volume (in a loop) when you're trying to navigate mail.  The other big complaint is that the mail interace is a data hog if you want it to push mail to you (it doesn't seem to actually push, the phone polls the network using your data allocation).  If you're going to use mail at all, get the $49.99 unlimited plan.  You'll burn through the 10mb pretty quickly.  I used 4.1 m the first day (realize there is some set up overhead, but it was still amazing).  Didn't use 4.1 m a day on my blackberry (ever) and I receive over 200 messages a day.I've only used it a month, which is good and bad.

The good news is that for less than $200 ($100 if signing new agreement) this phone offers one of the best values in the current batch of \"smart\" phones.  The bad news is that you will be paying alot more for VerizonWireless services.The phone offers most standard features which you would expect such as Web Browser, Outlook, MS Office, Multimedia, etc.  It has a nice design with big screen.  The phone's talk quality is very good.  I use Goodlink to synchronize the phone with my company's mail server, which works nicely.When comparing to the Treo, Q's biggest weaknesses are the lack of touch screen and the inability to edit word docs and spreadsheets (the Q can read them but not edit).  These features are not that important to me, but some of my coworkers find the touchscreen feature to be very useful.  The standard battery lasts only about a day, but the extended battery lasts at least a day and half with moderate/heavy usage.My biggest issue with the phone is the keys.  My thumbs are too big to type accurately, so typing a 100 word email sometimes takes much longer than it should.  I have been using Tmobile's SideKick for a while and it's ALOT easier to type on the SideKick.VerizonWireless pricing is another concern, since this phone is a VerizonWirless exclusive I believe.  The standard 900 minute plan plus unlimited data totals about $110 before taxes.  After adding on $15 for a feature which allows the Q to be used as a broadband modem (Older Q models will need to download the latest patch first), $10 for 500 text messages, and $6 for insurance, my total monthly bill comes out to be somewhere north of $150.  If you are concerned with the cost and your company is not reimbursing your wireless bills, I suggest giving up this phone and use another carrier as similar level of services could cost $40+ less.Compared to the Sidekick, the Q lack a free, basic sticky notes utility, which I use all the time when I need to lookup airline and hotel reward numbers.  Goodlink does provide such utility but it's not free.Overall, I have been pleased with the phone so far.  I tested the download speed when the phone is used as a modem and I got about 385kbps download speed and 56kbps upload speed.

No, you're probably going to be using it. I read this reviews, was nervous, but bought the phone anyways because everyone said it has great call quality- something you can't find in most phones with a QWERTY keyboard and windows mobile.So I've had the phone for about a week now. Setting it up on the network was tough because I ordered it with overnight shipping and Verizon didn't have me in their system yet. After calling customer support they had it on in an hour. After syncing my blackberry one last time I installed the active sync software and all my appointments and contacts were downloaded easy. I don't use outlook, I use gmail since I use 4 or 5 different computers depending on the day, so after setting up the POP access emails were downloading easily. Almost too easily. A glitch with gmail means any email I send from the web, also appears in my Q's inbox. Its annoying, but any email I send from the Q also appears in gmail so I always remember what I sent other people. with my work email account using SMTP I have no problems. If you do use outlook or something similar on your computer, wireless-sync will \"push\" emails to your Q. For me, it checks every 15 minutes which is often enough but not instantaneous. Like I said, all emails I send from gmail appear on the Q so that eats bandwidth. No problem if you have unlimited, but I don't. I set the Q to only download headers. If its important I then download the whole message (only another minute to wait) and if its not I delete it, and deal with it on my computer.The main reason I bought this phone over the HP Mobile Messenger, another Blackberry, the SDA, and the other sliding QWERTY phones is the call quality. My Blackberry sucked, thanks in part to TMobiles crappy reception. Verizon is clear as can be. People are excited they can finally understand me when I use my cell, and since almost everyone I know is on Verizon, its all free calls. So the phone is great, speakerphone isn't bad, but most speakerphones are less than ideal. You do get some noise in windy environments though.Controlling the device is a little odd since I'm used to the Blackberry which had a trackwheel and back button on the side. The trackwheel works the same, but the other button doesn't. There is also a back button on the front of the Q and the two act differently sometimes. I still haven't figured it out. The home and \"end\" keys also have similar functionality. There is a dedicated messaging key, and camera key which is nice. Again, since I'm used to the BB I'm not used to using the \"back\" button for delete- where the delete key on the BB was, is \"enter.\" This just takes time. Another nice thing is \"check names\" like outlook. When I compose a message I just type in the person's name, and then it will search after i hit send and I select the final recipient. Or, I can type the name from the home screen, select, and then select the type on contact method. Last annoying thing about messaging- a popup tells you when a message is sent. I KNOW a message was sent- I sent it.So that's how the Q fares as a communication device. As for PDA-like features the calendar is standard, nothing special. I haven't downloaded apps but since it is Windows I'm sure there are many. Included games are solitare and bubble breaker, which are addicting as any games. I haven't used the internet so I can't comment on that, nor have I used voice dialing. One thing I do like about the Q is that I can assign pictures and ringers to individuals contacts- something the BB was without. Camera is great, I just spent half a day going around downtown and the pictures are awesome for a camera. Not professional, but I'm not a photographer by trade.Another feature that I love about this phone is media player. I bought a 1GB miniSD card, and filled it with songs and used a pair of bluetooth stereo headphones from an old HP PDA and it works like an MP3 player. Audio does skip at times, but not too bad, and that has to do with BT not the Q- I've had the Q play as a radio in my office and it was fine.Some bad things: the battery does suck. Some people complained you had to charge it everynight. I've charged every phone I've ever had every night. This one won't make it the day if I use it as an MP3 player often. I plan on buying the docking station and an extra battery. The station can charge my Q AND a second battery. So, I hook my Q to my belt, and slip the battery in my pocket, switch them halfway. Its a small price to pay for the sleekness of the Q. Other solution: buy the extended battery and have it stick out a bit. Other annoying thing is that the phone isn't completely customizable. Granted my BB had two themes- Tmobile and BB, but with an open operating system like windows I would expect to be able to choose what appears on my homepage and where.Other problems posted here:-Freezing- It has now and then, not daily, and its not the end of the world to pop the battery out. I've found that since I turned off the device at night it doesn't freeze. Let it rest!-Processing speed- It takes time, sometimes, especially the camera, but nothing really aggravating. Just take a deep breath and its ready.-Closing apps- I couldn't find a way to close the apps that appeared on the quick launch bar (which I assumed to be a taskbar) My friend showed me the task manager and that only a few programs were actually open (media player, msnserver, quick list, remote API, solitare, and task manager) which only took 30 out of 50MB of RAM.screen off center- Yes, but doens't bother me.Bluetooth didn't work - works fine for meNo Office Editing - Don't use it, doesn't bother meSecurity code only numbers - don't use itsignal strength - never had a problem. I'm actually very happy with the signal since I came from tmobile which would loose signal once I went inside. Verizon works almost anywhere- even in basements and elevators (although barely).Can't input numbers in call - not true. I've called and used numbers for voice trees fine- verizon voicemail requires you to punch in a numeric password which works fine too.Screen stays on- to the guy that wrote \"you have to hit a button to see the time, and then it stays on until it times out\" I'm not sure what you were expecting. It saves battery life by turning off.Price of verizon- I'm paying what I paid for the blackberry, plus I now have extended warrenty and insurance about $80 (I have 10MB of data a month, whereas I had unlimited for BB)\"Spoofed\" email address- I've had no problems getting flagged as spam, I think it was how that guy had his spam filters set- that's your problem buddy, not verizon, and def not the Q. Your Q is not given a specific email address like my BB was so it appears to be sent from my gmail. No problems with that here...BB \"smart complete\" better than Q- perhaps, but I turned it off on my Q. With a key for every letter I don't need the phone to figure out what I'm typing like the BB 7100t did (two letters per key) I just type it out.\"Extremely Delicate\" - I dropped my Q on pavement crossing the street the first hour I had it. (I put it in the holster the wrong way) Minor scratch on the corner, but still works fine.Hard to feel vibration - I almost jumped out of my chair at work when this thing started vibrating on my waist- and that was just an email!Loud error beep - haven't heard it.All in all, the negatives you will read on here and other sites are the minority.

At first I was enamoured with the looks, size, flatness, internet and sound quality. All of those are great. I still love how flat it is and it doesn't seem to scratch easily (unlike my scratch magnet iPod.)I have had Verizon for a long time. I have not really had any bones to pick with them. They have been helpful. I really wish I hadn't mailed in my rebate so quickly. I would have returned it and gone back to plain phone and simple, cheap service. It will be nice while traveling though.I think we should all be mad at Motorola for producing such a crappy piece o plastic. The \"soft keys\" on the Q feel totally cheap. The buttons look nice, but the top ones don't really feel nice. They feel cheap. I do rather like the rest of the keyboard, though. The battery is JOKE. What is the point of having a MOBILE phone if you have to plug it in 50 times a day????? I expect it to last AT LEAST as long as I am awake during the day. That's really not much to ask for.Things to consider before you buy this:1)Battery life IS abysmal. I had verizon send me a new one because I seriously thought it was defective...Nope. New one is the same- no life after 9 hours of sitting around doing nothing. I am going to have to invest yet another $[...] in the extended battery. It's a good thing I rarely use the nice leather pouch since it isn't going to fit in it anymore. It is a good thing I managed to fanagle this phone for free with rebates and stuff. I have definitely made up for the cost in accessories and programs- don't fall for the accessories trap if you buy this thing!!! I was told the pouch I bought was only $[...], but when I looked at the receipt it was really $[...]....and I hardly use it because it's hard to get the phone out.. and I already stretched it out so it would go in without mashing the buttons.2)Expect to purchase every program you want to use on it. This does not come with anything useful except the internet, and the programs are not cheap! I really wish I had stuck with my Palm! Palm programs were way better and cheaper. The alarm clock allows you ONE alarm. That is IT. My old LG phone let me have multiples. The ringtones totally bite. It's a good thing you can use MP3s. There's not even a built in calculator. You can buy one. My old LG had way better functionality. I am starting to miss it even though I hated the flip phone. I am glad I still have it. I am going to keep it...just in case I get totally fed up with Q.3)Program selection for purchase truly sucks. I hope it expands as time goes by...and be sure to use the trial versions before you buy because they are not very good in general.4)Space for programs is limited. I have purchased 3 programs. Apparently that's about the max-I tried to load Mozilla's Minimo but I don't have enough space left! Boooooooo. My old cheap Palm could load tons and tons of programs and not have any problems...and they were GOOD and USEFUL and CHEAP.5)Maneuvering between programs is awkward. The home screen is not really customizable as it should be. Maybe your 10 year old computer geek kid might be able to hack a nice usable homescreen for you. I bought a program to rig it up, but it is still dissappointing- you can't add shortcuts like  windows- not that I expect it to really work like windows completely, but that seems simple enough and ya CAN'T DO IT. Boooooooooo. The quickie self building shortcut line of recently used programs is good enough though.6)Email Gripes: Please won't Gmail rig it up so we can easily use Gmail on this! The web version works, but not the mobile web version. Also, Hotmail is supposed to be super simple and already built in, but I have to log into messenger for the hotmail to work! Boooooooooo. I just wanna check my darn email! I get error messages more than half the time when I try to check Hotmail or Gmail. Forget using that handy email button on the keyboard- It would be great if that actually worked for me.7) Help is weak. FAQ's are weak. I can't believe how many message boards and sites there are dedicated to this thing.... because it is not good and people are frustrated trying to fix things. My screen wants to stay on all the time.. further draining my already lame battery. I think it is searching for network, but does it really have to do that all the time? Can't it wait until I actually want it to do something? There's probably a way.. but I am a decade too old to spend a week figuring it out.8) Shortcuts. I hope you like shortcut buttons! If you want to master this thing, be ready to memorize and create shortcut buttons for everything. You can easily set them up, but remembering what does what is rediculous.PROs:Freakin awesome reception. I get reception and internet in places that always dropped calls before.Internet wherever- fun stuff! ..but you can get that on virtually any phone now. (Google maps is totally awesome on it.)It's thin and nice to look at.Long story short: Black hole of accessories/programs/more money. I think it will break eventually becuase it is so cheaply made. PROBLEMATIC. I am very happy that I didn't get one of the first totally screwed up Qs, but even my updated new Q has too many issues. This phone seems like it should still be in the testing stage. It is not right. It is not a well built machine, nor are its brains very extensive. It's a pretty piece of plastic. It needs a way bigger hard drive memory, and drastic improvements in functionality and programs.OH YEAH.. also... I bought an SD card for it, which you will want to do if you decide to waste your time and money on this.. but it took me a day to figure out that I needed to jam a piece of paperboard under the SD card to make it connect. It's still in there- under the card, behind the crazy rubbery plastic door that bulges out where the card is. Don't get it wet!This is the first and last Motorola product I ever buy. COME ON! I seriously expected a far superior product from Moto.This phone, like everything else in our modern world, is...Cheap, Plasticky, Produced to make a lot of money while giving a lousy product.I am not a mega-computer-guru, but I KNOW they could have done better than this!!!Wait a year or two.

The basics are great (i can make calls, the person on the other end can hear me, the speakerphone works well)and the price point -- also great.However the screen is bright but barely seeable in bright sunlight (which may be a bit of a problem considering it's portable and people are prone to make calls -- outside). I find myself often looking for shade to see which contact is highlighted or which app is highlighted. The battery fully charged barely lasts 6 hours. The extended battery which I purchased after realizing this fact, lasts a robust 9ish hours. Of course the problem I have is that it's not like I am talking for a considerable amount of that time --- generally my day consists of a few (maybe 3 or 4) calls, that last a few minutes each (maybe 7 or 8 minutes top). I find myself rushing home, hoping the battery will last until I can get home and charge up the phone.Some minor qualms about the Q are the covers for the miniSD slot and headphone jack, the button sensitivity and the lack of software (the version of windows mobile 5.0 used on the Q is a hybrid of the windows mobile OS used for the treo et al). The covers for the slots are crappy and will probably break off soon.

It plays every music file (except apple format) but .mp3, .wma, and even .wav are clear as my pc. I even got the sterio adapter and have over 500 tunes I can listen to by plugging this puppy into my amp! I compress and converted video files to .wmv format and watch videos on the plane. There is also some great 3rd party software I put on this, and syncing to the pc is a snap. (now i use this as my laptop modem) I could go on and on about the features, email, im, sterio bluetooth, any song I want as a ring tone. I just don't know how this little device can do all of theese things! Laptop and ipod manufacturers beware, the price on this is way better than a laptop and why buy an ipod when all it does is play music...

Easy controls mean you don;t need a touch screen.3) Great sound - Superior as a hands-free speaker phone or for playing music. Headphones are still better, but this speaker is nice when you need it.4) Lots of accessories - I have a leather case, 2GB sd card, and bluetooth headset. That just scratches the surface. Also bought the hi-capacity battery.5) Email. Supports POP and Gmail (from my experience).6) Battery life not so good with standard battery. Needs a charge daily. Keep a wall charger and car charger nearby to ensure you can juice it up when it is low.7) Expansion options/versatility - Can be used as a GPS device with upgrade (not too expensive, either).

The Q was my first Smartphone ever, and it looked like a good first step. While I was impressed with the Ev-DO network, the phone's operating system is laggy, therefore accessing the internet quickly becomes a problem.The phone's design is pretty nice, although a little too wide in my hand. I really did like the slim profile of the phone, but I was afraid to keep it in my pocket for fear of damaging the screen. However, when you strap on the case for this phone, which is virtually required due to the delicacy of such phones, the phone loses this razer thin width. While the phone felt relatively well put together, one scrape, drop, or depressing of the screen will have you filing for insurance (and you must buy insurance).While the Q can surf the internet, schedule a meeting, keep track of your contacts, and many more things, it does not do any one of the functions especially well. The contact list was sluggish and entering a phone number was considerably harder than it should be. Additionally, the Q is a Smartphone and not a PDA. It comes with no copy/paste functionality, no touch screen, and mediocre scheduling features. For a phone that has a QWERTY keyboard, the lack of copying and pasting is fairly ridiculous.Overall, it is an alright phone, a mediocre planner, and an average internet browser.

The keyboard is great for entering info for contacts, notes, email, and txt messages.  Not having to worry about a stylus all the time is nice too.  You are limited by the Smartphone version of Window Mobile 5.0, but for my use it is perfect.It will sync with multiple PCs without all the hubbub you get from a Pocket PC.  This helps to get your contacts list all together instead of one set on your laptop and one set on your PC.My favorite Windows Mobile application, Avantgo, works great.  All the function it gave me before.  This is a must if you travel.  You are able to have the news, sports, and other sources of information brought to you.I have been able to convert my videos and DVDs to run on the Q. This works great on trips so I don't need to lug out my laptop or a portable DVD player.  I can have 2-3 movies and some music on a 1GB miniSD card.I have been searching for new applications that have been designed for he Q and have been pleasantly surprised at the number that keeps growing.  I found a program that let me keep my account register on here instead of keeping a checkbook (I don't write checks, just keep it for the register) with me.  I have also found language programs that give you translations for common phrases.  If you are a XM or Sirius subscriber, you can install a third-party application to stream from the internet.  This is great, but will keep you charging it up.I use the extended battery and have the standard as a backup.  This is the only problem.

You have to understand going into this that Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone Edition is a less functional version.

I wanted a decent phone that could also grab my emails off of my server at work, keep my calendar, and allow me to occasionally surf the web.  It does those things in a satisfactory manner.The call quality is rather good, certainly better than my old Samsung flip phone.  The dialing buttons are small, but manageable.  They are not marked with letters for dialing purposes(i.e - \"a b c\" for 2, \"d e f\" for 3, etc). The buttons have a nice feel to them, and are close together but not so close as to make using them difficult.  The back-lighting is adequate.  The screen is bright and the colors vibrant.The only truly annoying aspect of this device regarding its use as a mobile phone is the voice dialing function.  I've never had a phone which has so much trouble picking up voice commands.  In fact, it seems completely incapable of picking up a dialing command.  The most recent example:Me:  \"Call Jackie.\"Phone: \"Did you say, 'Call Rob?'\"Me:  \"No.  Call Jackie.\"Phone: \"Did you say, 'Call Tina?'\"Me:  \"No.  Call Jackie.\"Phone: \"Did you say, 'Call Home?'\"Me: *sigh*This happens every time.  Every time.  Bluetooth or straight phone, it doesn't matter.  The only thing that varies are the odd choices it makes.  The fact that they do not sound remotely like anything you said is a constant.  For those of you wondering if I mumble or have an accent . . . I do not (at least I don't think so!).  My old phones never had a problem picking me up.  I'm wondering if it's a software glitch.Many have commented on the battery life.  The battery life is only fair, but I haven't had the kind of issues that some other posters have.  I charge it every night and it has never quit on me during the day.  I'm careful to \"kill\" open applications when I'm done using them, and I retrieve my email manually rather than having it \"pushed\" to the phone.  I may buy an extended life battery at some point, but thus far I'm doing fine without it.  Those who are on their phones constantly may have a different experience.  A car charger is very cheap to buy through Amazon, and I keep one of those in the glove box just in case.The mobile Internet Explorer browser is a bit clunky and inelegant, but that's not the phone's fault. I'm hoping that when Mozilla get's done tweaking their mobile browser it will be a better solution.This device does not come with software to create or edit documents.  I understand that third party apps are available for this purpose, but it's not something I've looked into as I don't intend to use the device for this purpose.Verizon's EVDO network - though expensive - seems to be living up to it's billing so far. The lack of WiFi has not bothered me in the slightest.  I gave my old WiFi equipped Palm Tungsten C to my wife when I got the Q, and I must say that I like the on-demand nature of EVDO much better than having to search for often hard to find WiFi networks.  Subjectively, I have found the speeds while surfing the net to be comparable, with the Q perhaps being the faster of the two.The unit has a solid, well built feel to it. I've dropped it only once (so far) from approximately chest high onto a hard tile floor.  The battery cover and battery popped out and went skidding across the floor, but when put back together all worked fine.  In the three weeks I've had it, I've had it refuse to turn on twice.  Removing and then replacing the battery cured the problem.  There was no data loss.  I haven't noted any other functional glitches.At the end of the day I chose the Q from among several other likely prospects because of its relatively small size.  It's a bit slimmer than my wife's Razr.  I won't wear a belt clip (I seem to have misplaced my pocket protector, and it wouldn't seem right to use one without the other), and the Q does fit neatly into the pocket of either my jeans or my suit coat.  You do need to remember to lock the key pad when doing this.  Incoming calls can be answered without unlocking it.  Locking and unlocking is painless, requiring you to push two buttons in sequence on the pad.In sum, aside from the maddening voice dialing issue it's a good phone which provides email, calendar and web surfing capability.Hope this helps.UPDATE:  I just (1/08) gave the Q to my college-aged daughter after my workplace supplied us all with HTC 6800's.  As time went by I found that the regular battery was holding less and less of a charge and I ended up springing for the extended capacity battery.  I now agree with those that say that this is a must.  Other than that, I miss my Q!  The 6800 has a few more features for the \"power user\", but it's not nearly the phone the Q is from an ease of use and sound quality stand point.  But for the stiff Verizon data charge, I'd chuck the free 6800 and take back my Q.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Weak Antenna, Dropped Calls,  Battery Drained by Searching for Cell Tower", "Author": "P.

I wanted to replace my Treo 700P with Sprint because I was frequently getting dropped calls where I recently moved to. The Moto Q attracted me because I saw it in a store and loved the screen and thin design. Too bad that's all it has going for it. The EVDO was nowhere near the speed that Sprint offered. In fact, Verizon was even slower than the non EVDO Treo 650 that I previously owned. The worst thing was that when I dialed my home number to check my answering machine it would not recognize my code. If you call any number that prompts you to press a number for anything, the phone is designed is such a way that you cannot input numbers after you make a call. Verizon tech support did not know how to fix this. I had to call Motorola tech support and they told me to switch a TTY setting. Well I did and it didn't work. Then they told me that it was the area that I was in. I am in Los Angeles. How could this be happening in such a large city? Another bad feature was there is no manual control to shut off the display. You have to set the display to turn off after a certain length of time and when you want it back on again you have to keep hitting the center button. If you set the phone to go off after 1 minute and you want to check the time, it stays on for a minute. Nuisance and bad feature. So I'm back to my Treo 700P and just dealing with the occasional dropped calls until I move again at the end of the year. I will say this about Verizon, with the few calls I made with the phone I never had one dropped call and it worked well in my apartment where my Treo did not. One last thing, Verizon is outrageously expensive. Over twice what I was paying with Sprint. 450 minutes with Verizon was $40. I am paying $35/mo for 500 minutes with Sprint. My daytime minutes with Sprint is 7A to 7P. With Verizon it's 6A to 9P. What a ripoff! EVDO with Sprint was $15/mo. Verizon charges $40/mo and that was their special at the time. It's normally $60/mo. As bulky as the Treo is, it is still the best phone out there. I have the Palm OS version. I didn't like Windows at all on the Moto Q.

Spagnuolo", "ReviewID": "R3SZXBE5IFLU02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been holding out on replacing my simple LG phone with a Smartphone. The reason has been I just didn't think the technology was there or the price was low enough. Finally I think Verizon has stepped up to the plate with the Q. The phone was $199 with the unlimited plan (which you will need and can vary from $50-70 a month).Since the phone has only been on the market for a few days they are still working out issues, but once you get this thing connected Wow! It's great! Also if you need help call Verizon's Tech support they were great everytime I called.First off there are 2 types of Email technology integrated in the device and you should choose how you want to use them. For instance I'm using the WirelessSync software (a push technology) to connect to my Corporate Lotus Notes email. The software is running on my laptop and if I get an email at my corporate email account it will push it to my Q no matter where I'm at in the world (of course I have to have a cell phone signal). The negative to this is my laptop has to be up and running with this software. It's nice if I need to run out during the day and I want to make sure I don't miss that important email. WirelessSync can be executed by schedule or you can do it from the home screen on the phone. Email that comes in this way goes to the Outlook E-mail Folder.The other option is to set up POP3 accounts within the Q. This is a pull technology. I set up my gmail account this way and the Q check every 30 minutes to see if I have any new emails in my gmail account. You can set it to check more or less. But keep in mind if you check more you can not receive phone calls while it is check (at least that is what the tech guy told me on the phone when I called). Another tip for you Gmail users, the incoming server of pop.gmail.com is fine, but on the outgoing server for some reason you have to state the port: smtp.gmail.com:465I spent about 4 hours on that :)So keep in mind if you decide to do both of these do not set up a pop3 in your wireless sync. I did that initially but then on my first sync I found out I had duplicates. I keep only my work email in my wireless sync and my internet email in my pop3. There are lots of options with the software it's just a matter of working through the ports on the device.One other tip I have is make sure that the email account you are trying to add is currently working. We were trying to add a yahoo account and found it wasn't the Q that was having the problem it was yahoo's server that was down for maintance.Oh and of course since you have access to the internet you can just go straight to a website...like gmail and just log into your account if you really want to get started fast.Some of the other features that I love...the 1.3 megapixel camera! I wasn't expected that at all and they take great pictures (as long as your subject isn't moving all over the place)! It has an IR beam that I can send it to anything that has an IR beam as well. It even has a flash! Granted you have to turn it on before you take the picture, but still extremely cool.There is also a software package call ActiveSync and this is how you get new software and music to your Q. It's best just to use the cable with this. I tried using the IR but it didn't really work that well. One thing I will say the third party software out there is OUT-OF-DATE! I have found nothing so far that I can put on this. My recommendation is to get the trial and it will tell you right away if it is an older version. I've tried 2 games off the sight they recommend Handango and both were 2 old and they locked up when I tried to play them. To get out of them I just hit my house button and then uninstalled them with my ActiveSync software. No harm.In addition I purchased a 1GB miniSD card and ripped a few of my cd's using windows media player. I used 96kbps and transferred them to the Q using ActiveSync in the MyMusic Folder. I then went into my Q pulled up Window Media Player scaned for the music and WOW it sounds GREAT! It plays through speakers (there is a volume control on the right or you could connect your ear buds on top).We also bought our phones from the Verizon store and with that we got a 15 day trial on the phones. If we came back within 15 days we got the extended batteries for the phones at 60% off! We did that since the batteries are normally $50. Not sure if all Verizon stores do that but it wouldn't hurt to ask if your in the market. I would recommend getting the extended life battery.By far I have not even come close to listing all of the features, just the ones I'm excited about. So again just to summarize...this is an AMAZING phone (and to be fair computer). If you are looking for all the bells and whistles this is for you. It really is like a mini laptop that you can talk on.

I hope the problems I describe are described elsewhere in these reviews because this phone should never have even been put on the market and the notion deserves reiteration for those considering purchasing this phone.  This smartphone has a long list of negative issues that prohibit it from functioning as a phone.  I can't possibly get to them all but for starters:  every day it shuts off by itself, locks up, won't receive calls, can't call out, won't turn on, and the only way to fix these little daily annoyances is to take the battery out and reboot the phone.  And I am truly not kidding, I have to do this at an absolute minimum 3 times a day, some days I have to reboot it every time I pick it up.  Seriously.  The keypad fails, Media player skips all the way through the songs, miserable battery life, very slow internet speeds for what it is, etc etc.  I do like some of the Verizon salespeople I have talked with about this though: they already know all about it. I say that indicates the mass of customers that had to have come in when the salespeople won't even put up a fight and are simply resigned admitting the phone is garbage.  Several I've talked to won't sell anyone a phone with a Windows Mobile OS unless they are just hell-bent and won't listen. It also lacks the much of the smart function if you don't sync it with Outlook and only on your pc.

I was very excited about the launch of the Motorola Q, since I was completely over my clunky, boring Blackberry for some time.  I thought that the Q would solve my \"Blackberry problem\" of being able to read attachments (in plain text format), but not being able to edit attached documents or compose and email documents from scratch.  How wrong I was!  Don't get me wrong - the Q does have a lot going for it: (1) a more attractive form factor than ANY Blackberry or PDA-phone I've ever seen, it's slim, light, and looks as much like a phone as a smartphone can; (2) it runs Windows Mobile, which is infinitely more attractive and familiar to me than the Palm OS or Blackberry platform.  It's also pretty strong on the \"fun\" factors, since it has a cool internet browser, Windows Media player for your music files, and a built-in digital camera.However, the Q's main shortfall--the inability to compose/edit documents--was a deal-breaker for me.  If, like me, you plan on using your smartphone as part of a mini-mobile-office, and your job involves heavy review and editing of documents received via email, then you might want to look for alternatives to the Q.  If you're a Windows-over-Palm person, the Palm Treo 700w may be a good alternative that has document composing and editing capabilities.  (I'm opting to get a laptop instead of a Palm 700w, given its memory limitations).  Or, if you are wedded to the Palm OS, there's always the Palm 700p.  That said, if editing documents is not as important to you as simple emailing and messaging, then the Motorola Q may fit the bill.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Terrible.

With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something).

Brick", "ReviewID": "R2VZUAIN9R3RIH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, this is a great phone for many reasons. Read the five-star reviews if you want a glowing perspective. I agree with aspects of all of them.If you are coming from the Treo 600/650 series, however, which allows you pretty much complete control over the phone's behavior, has fairly strong vibration, AND is a decent PDA, this phone will frustrate you to no end.Example: Let's say the only time you want this phone to make a (speaker-based) noise is when a call is coming in. Sorry - not possible.If you have your phone set to make an audible ring, and you DON'T want it to give you an error beep (which is incredibly loud) when you make a trivial \"mistake\" in the complex user interface, you are out of luck. I tried turning EVERYTHING off but the ring in the \"Normal\" profile, and I still get the error beep. It's louder than the ring, by the way - and does not seem affected by any volume control.The frustrating thing is that there are actually phone settings for turning off various alerts. E.g., \"Warnings,\" \"Questions,\" \"Exclamations.\" All of these are set to off (you'd think an \"error\" would fall into one of those categories), and still I get thunderous error beeps. Note there is a vibrate-only mode (called Meeting) that doesn't beep for errors, but then you're stuck with its wimpy vibration. I can't feel the Q vibrate in any pocket. Maybe if I carry it between my teeth I'll be okay.Note that you don't actually have to make an error to get an error beep. Example: Enter an address in the browser, and press the RETURN key instead of the \"Go\" soft key. Both navigate you appropriately, but hitting RETURN gives you an error beep. It's like your phone is saying to you, \"You hit the wrong (yet completely intuitive and fully operational) key! BEEEEEP!!!\"Also, when you insert or remove the power cord: \"BEEEEP!!!\" Plus, in typical Microsoft style, you actually get a full-screen dialog when you pull out the cord. \"Charging is complete!\" it tells you, with a button to dismiss the message. \"Um, yes - I KNOW it's complete. I just freaking got out of bed and unplugged it. But thanks for scaring the life out of me.\"If a calendar is important to you (as it is for most PDA users - probably the sole reason to cary one), I'd steer way clear of this phone. The interface for accessing, viewing, and creating appointments is cumbersome at best. Also, it's missing key functionality: E.g: I get my hair cut every other week; my cleaning service comes every other week; There is no way to set a recurring appointment for every other week!If you want a phone that's a real PDA, get the treo 650 or 700, even though it's heavier and fatter. I can only speak for the Palm OS version, which is excellent, usability-wise.

Oh the days when I could plug my phone into a wall and it would charge! When the phone rang, I could answer it, and when I wanted to end the call, I could, just by pressing a button!Now, in the cruel fall of 2006, I am chained to the Q, which is chained to the incredibly poor customer service at Verizon. Imagine a man chained to a three thousand pound boulder, which is in turn chained to the planet Jupiter nearing a black hole. Yes, it's that bad.I made the mistake of purchasing a Q to send and receive calls, with an option to also send and receive data. I spent a paltry $130 a month, but this didn't seem to matter the second time my Q bricked up and refused to boot. I called tech support. \"Hey tech support,\" I said, \"this phone will randomly crash but the screen freezes. So, I'm missing calls even though it looks like the phone is fine. Plus, I'll look at the battery meter which says full, and then thirty minutes later my phone is off. And now it won't even turn on.\"Tech Support replies, \"Have you tried unplugging the phone, removing the battery, and letting it sit?\"Hmmm. No, I said. But I bought the $40 extended battery. And a car charger. And I keep both with me at all times, just in case the phone dies, or rather, for when the phone is sure to die, and I can remove the battery, plug the phone directly to the wall, and at least check the messages I missed while the phone was dead.Tech support sends me a refurbished phone - two day FedEx! They couldn't send it overnight. Perhaps there's some $300 plan where they care if you can send and receive phone calls, but it's unfortunately out of my budget.So I got my third phone. Yes, it would still crash and randomly turn off. Sometimes I would try to end a call, but it would just sit there, the minutes ticking away. The only way to recover it would be to remove the battery. You'd see me at Starbucks, sporting my Q and buying a chai latte. \"Yes Bill, 200% ROI. No, totally doable. Totally.\" Then, I'd hit the red button, wait, furrow my brow, set all of my things on the floor, take the back cover off, remove and re-install the battery, and then turn the phone back on. That lovely Windows Mobile sound would echo like a death rattle in the cafe, and then I'd stare at it until it booted completely, to see if I missed yet another call during the resurrection.And today, I arrived at the Verizon store, for the 7th time. This time, in Atlanta. I figured, maybe it was just my small town store that couldn't handle my problem. I explained - politely as I could - and said the phone had died again, and would no longer charge. Again. I received a blank stare, and then a sticky note with a number on it. I said, \"You want me to call someone at Verizon to complain about my phone that doesn't turn on?\" He stared back, blankly, and without a trace of irony said, \"Yes.\"I said, \"So, there's no one at this Verizon store - this is Verizon, isn't it? - who can give me a phone, right now, that works?\"He said, \"No. We could give you a new phone - we're one of the few stores that stock PDA phones - but we're out of the Motorola Qs right now.\"I said, \"Because you're replacing so many?\" No answer, but a finger extending to point to my yellow sticky note. I wept quietly in the car.I returned to the client site where I was consulting, and asked if I could borrow his phone, while apologizing for not answering my broken cell phone. Lo and behold, they had a three strikes policy, and I was eligible for a different phone! He asked me to hold while he got approval, and then returned and said somberly, \"Unfortunately, since you have had your account only six months, we are unable to offer you a different phone.\"I sat back in my chair, and tried not to spontaneously combust. \"I have given you over $1300 in the past six months in service fees and equipment purchases. And I am not allowed to have a different phone, when the one you sold me doesn't work?\"There was nothing he could do except try - TRY - to acquire for me a \"brand new, in the box\" Motorola Q. Instead, I had a different plan. I had them turn down the calling plan as much as was possible, and requested all data features be removed. Then I bought and older Verizon phone from a friend, which I will use to send and receive phone calls - hopefully - until I have found a different provider who cares to provide.So beware of Verizon and the Motorola Q if you are demanding enough require that your equipment works most of the time to send and receive phone calls.

All that for a base price of $200!  (The extras will cost less than $80)  And iPhones are for people who don't mind constantly spending money for the sake of not being more involved in making easily created content for the phone.

It doesn't automatically turn on the number lock when in a field that would typically have numbers (i.e., fields for telephone numbers, dates, and times).  You have to manually switch from letters to numbers on the keyboard.- New numbers.  If you want to add a phone number to an existing contact from your call log, you must manually scroll through the list of names, rather than typing in the same (and having the device search your contacts).- Lack of Notes.  It doesn't have the Notes program that is standard in MS Outlook and other Windows CE-enabled devices.  I use Notes for tracking lists of restaurants, books, and wines so that I have them when I need them.  Not so with the Q.- Navigational functions.  It's hard to get to the desired program quickly.  For example, if you want to get to your e-mail, you have to go through a menu that lists all messaging functions (i.e., text messaging, multiple mailboxes).- And, just to reiterate, the battery and keyboards also have problems.  Enough people have covered those issues already, so I won't expound on them.Some might think I'm being nit-picky, but I think these omissions in programming are unforgivable.

I have just sent the Motorola Q phone back to Verizon for a credit.  While the form factor is great, the ergonomics of the phone and software present many critical shortcomings for me or any real PDA Power user to adopt.A few of my observations are:-Absence of ANY LED's on the outside of the phone require you to check the phone too often as opposed to glancing at it to know if new emails, calls or text have come in (as is the case with Blackberry and Treo).-Screen visibility in bright sunlight is poor-Battery life is terrible, half day best case with limited voice use.  There is a higher capacity battery available, but not interested in investing more in a problematic phone.-Software Bundled with Q is simplistic and lacks any level of elegance, especially true in email and photo management.  Number of key strokes to do anything seems high.  Third party software should address some what in 60-120 days.- Absence of any 'hard keys' makes certain regular functions cumbersome.-Too early for reasonably simple Apple Mac Integration (Missing Link and PocketMac are working on software), will need to be revisited in 60-120 days.  Users of PC's not an issue.-Plastic construction of phone leads me to believe that the phone will not endure day to day use very effectively.  After a few short days in my pocket (no keys or change of course), paint finish showing signs of wear.-And last but not least, a few other annoyances: NO LEFT HAND SHIFT KEY, seemingly poor memory management, unstable mail client.......Hard to believe that Moto is positioning this phone to attract current Treo and Blackberry users, based on price and function seems like a great PDA for someone who has not owned one based on size and weight.

I'll be typing and either the predictive text will get a little too predictive (e.g. I want to say, \"I'm going to the show\" and without me even choosing to say it, he will type \"I'm going to the shootout.\" Now that is not what I wanted to say!).

After getting the windows service pack updates put on (MOL 2 and MOL 3 see motorola website) the life did improve somewhat but my phone started to experience some of the random power down issues I hear some of you complain about.So after about 2-3 weeks of wanting to toss my phone under a semi truck because of the frustration, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get the unit swapped out.Now, on my 2nd Q, I can tell you with, Microsoft Office Mobile (from Windows Smartphone 6), PDAnet for using my phone as a free highspeed modem (Which is reason #1 to buy this phone alone),Facade, Deepfish webbrowser, Agile AIM/Yahoo/MSN/ICQ messanger, Papyrus Calander Task manager (qhich also rocks along with Facade, Sprite, Orange, and lets not forget the NES, Sega Genesis, SNES and MAME emulators running over 1000 games, the DVD Mp4 movies, Mp3 collection and just about everything else my 2GB MiniSD card's heart's desire can contain, all I can say is thisphone ROCKS!!!!!The only crutch is that there's a bad batch out there like with any product on the market. It seems as if the newer ones are more stable and less likely to experience the headaches the older ones had people gripping about.But the final verdict lies with battery life and the customability of the device.1. I'll address the battery life:Its awesome!!! Let me explain...I used to have the old Q fully charged by 6am (time I leave for work) and make a few calls to my girlfriend 15-30 mins in the morning tops and check my bank account and a few work items = no more than 15 mins surfing the net. I'd immediately close all apps with task manager AND go into flight mode and out of it to log off the net completely (eliminate the arrows on the top of the battery meter)Anyhow by 4pm central my battery would be dead and I'd have to plug the Q in. I got the Extended battery and my Q would last till 9-10pm at night before it needed a full charge.2. With the replacement Q and old slim battery, I'm now averaging 14 hours of heavy use (emulators, 20 mins web browsing, music, 1.5 hours of phone calls total today etc) and still have 75% life left! Its night and day and looks as if my new Q is the winner phone we all should have. If yours isn't like this, SWAP IT OUT immediately.II. Stability...This new Q hasn't crashed at all even after doing all the necessary system registry tweaks (find out more on qusers)1. the glyphcache one to spead up the interface2. rearranging the keys (ex the old back key by the scroll wheel is now my speaker phone and vice versa)3. the 3x web speed enhance hack4. the memory cache hack5. and the bluetooth volume enhancer hack to enhance my Jabra JX-10 volume (again see Qusers.com)ALL of these and more and my phone just keeps going and going and going. I have had this new phone for about a week now and with HEAVY usage, enough to crash and burn my old Q for sure this new tank just keeps asking for more!I haven't even tried the extended battery because I don't need to...Bottom line, SWAP your phone out at Verizon if its not acting like this. I'm convinced this is how the Q was intended to be....now if only everyone here can experience this!I work at Enterprise in management and all the customers who walk in the door with Qs eyes drop when they see how customized mine is and how the battery life really is!For that guy who complaied about the layout, check out the wallpaper setup on qusers and get the setup you like!

This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is \"spoofing\" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to \"white list\" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Don't Do It", "Author": "Carmen A.

But even with a freeware, you need to check the resolution at 600K/sec, that's weird, it should work without any freeware, just with Windows media player, out of the box, just like on any Windows OS PC, but it doesn't, Windows mobile is really bad.Extended battery, still offers a limited life span, way less than other phones/PDA anyway. Video camera, isn't really good, have you ever tried to shoot videos at the highest resolution, did it freeze your phone after 15/16 seconds, forcing you to HARD reset the phone ? Well whatever your answer is, that happened to me all the time, forcing me to settle for the medium resolution, again, Windows Mobile ain't good at all, Oh you can't even edit the Word or Excel doc, just read them, that's all, let me guess another freeware to install, so this is like in a Windows XP computer that couldn't do anything by itself, back to the future, in the days with Windows 3.1 for Workgroups or what ? Oh yeah again, they say affordable phone with internet, I don't think so, 40$ a month for the Web, unlimited usage ain't cheap to me, 480$ a year just to surf the web or being billed as you go with Data usage like it happened to me, hell no it isn't affordable at all, it is a complete rip off from Verizon. Too many persons like me, who brought this piece of junk back to the store, and next thing you know the price is now 79$, instead of +300$ when I bought it, Huuuum, let see why in the world Verizon would slash the price after just one year, that bad, think...This supposedly smart phone, is a nightmare, you shouldn't buy it period, unless you are some kind of manager, business man, who believe it is necessary to stay connected to some kind of Network 24/7, at all cost, and being billed by Verizon Wireless for it. This is the worst thing ever when you buy that type of phone just for the big screen, and the Mini SD card, in order for you to enjoy your Pictures and VIDEOS on the go, yet having a screen big enough to see the details of these multimedia content, but do not care about surfing the web on a, then too small screen that doesn't allow you to see anything. THIS PHONE STAYS CONNECTED TO BROADBAND ACCESS (High speed internet download from VzW) 24/7, even when in standby, when you sleep at night and the ONLY way to discover this is when you receive your first bill from VzW. Verizon does NOT communicate AT ALL on this particularity of the Q, and other PDA, according to their sale persons, and No one at VzW Tech support is able to block this feature, in fact one girl from their Tech support did it once, and messed up the OS, the phone was trying to connect every ten second and sending to me error msgs, one after another with a horrible BEEP noise, I had to turn off the phone, and go back to the Vz store the day after, in order for the Tech people to download an upgrade and, billing me with DATA USAGE for it ! That was the LAST STRAW, after two months and a half of an absolute nightmare I return the whole thing and the VzW people in the store have been kind enough to take it back, and oh by the way the Customer service receives so many calls of persons like me that they never complain to wipe out our DATA USAGE bill, nothing to pay. AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE if you are just looking for a multimedia device that is also a phone with keyboard, it is NOT worth it at all, especially considering the other issues that this phone have, mostly coming from the OS, Windows Mobile is so LAME.You want to see a lot of your personal videos that you will copy on the MiniSD card. let see, Windows Media Player is ONLY capable of reading the WMV, who cares ! NO AVI, NO MPEG/MPG, the most common files found around the world, nope NO luck it is NOT working. You want to use the keyboard to write a note real quick, nope you can't, no Notepad available, ONLY a voice Notes is provided, yes this is a Windows OS without the Notepad.exe. The battery life expectations is ridiculously low even with the extended battery, especially if you are talking with someone, let see is it a phone or what ? The operating system is lame, the multimedia capabilities forces you to translate your videos files in Windows Media Video file format, good luck if you have the kind of collection like I do, the battery life forces you to stay in charge for ever, and if you do not want to have the bad experience I had with the phone itself being connected to the Super Enhanced VzW Network, you can buy the monthly DATA PACKAGE, for 40$/month, just because the phone itself connects automatically, 24/7, 480$ a year just because of the phone, working this way and there is nothing you can do about it, and being an IT computer myself, I went deep in the core of Windows, looking for an hidden, NOT documented settings, well there is none, the phone connects and that's it ! NO choice No confirmation YES or CANCEL screen, nothing, to let you know that you are connected, I'm telling you, STAY AWAY.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "I HATE this Phone!!!", "Author": "CAM301 \"baquauhm\"", "ReviewID": "R1I73P4C7OSX1Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've spent a week now trying to get this to synch with my office computer. Our network support staff couldn't get it to synch. Motorola tech support blew me off when I called. The CD's included were supposed to help me learn the software, but even that software failed. It was supposed to take me to a web page, I believe, but it kept saying it couldn't access it. The documentation is written generically, like they couldn't be bothered to write documentation specific to this device, so it's hard to figure out how to do what you want.I've had a Palm Pilot and an IPAQ. Software on the Palm Pilot was the easiest to use. IPAQ was pretty good, but the battery couldn't last through a whole meeting. But even that software was easy to use. The contact list on this one is bewildering. I entered my husbands work and cell phone numbers. But only one number showed on the display, and when you click, that's what dials. So I had to go down to one phone number for every entry. And then there are entries in the contact list for administrative things like minutes used. Makes no sense. So even if I could get it to synch, I don't like the software.Bottom line. I HATE HATE HATE this phone, and am exchanging it this week. Now to figure out what to try next.UPDATE: I turned it in and got the TREO 700P, which I love. The software on the Treo is so much easier to use and understand, and it has a lot more functionality.
