Both of them are running on Straight Talk.  All we had to buy is the micro sim card from Straight Talk (we bought the At&T; card) and off we went.  My internet and MMS (pic messages) work great with no problems.  The screen on the mega is awesome!  Both of us get compliments all the time on our phones and people are amazed that both of them are on Straight Talk with no problems.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!!!!", "Author": "BESTGUY", "ReviewID": "R1GQI6LH6ELEFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BOUGHT THE PHONE November 14, 2013Once you use it you may not want a Galaxy Note.

It is definitely not a NOTE 3 and it is a little bit oversize. But if you want a big screen and dual sim together from a trusted manufacturer you do not have much choices. As a result if you can tolerate the size I think this is the best phone you can buy.Dual sim works perfect. I gave up my Galaxy s4 to use this dual sim device and I am happy. Actually a regular user can not see a big difference from the s4 aside from the size and display quality.Buy it with confidence if you need a big display with dual sim.

In those movies it was not unusual to see an old-fashioned rotary dial phone used as a murder weapon. Over the years I've noticed that as phones have become smaller, lighter, and flimsier, so have the movies. Lately, though, smart phones have grown larger and bulkier, most notably this Samsung Galaxy Mega.  Now that we once again have phones that can be used as a bludgeon, I feel a surge of hope that movies, too, might regain their former weight and substance.
