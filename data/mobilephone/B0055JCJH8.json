I love the Android system, it is so much more user friendly that Apple iOS.The Shift is a compact phone, not as big as it's sister Evo models, but great things come in smaller packages. The slide out QWERTY keyboard is a great feature, you do not see them on many Smartphones. I cannot type on the touchscreen, so this got me really excited.The processor is FAST. Not once has this phone frozen on me, the programs start up quickly, and don't use a huge amount of memory.Netflix streams beautifully, no pauses or buffering, just straight HD streaming.The screen is bright and beautifully clear.I have had no issues at all with call clarity, dropped calls, or anything.I think the only thing that is a con about this phone is that like all smartphones, battery life leaves something to be desired, but that is common for all phones these days.I love this phone, and would highly recommend to anyone.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Evo Shift 4G", "Author": "Vince Calbro II", "ReviewID": "RRYDJ92R1IXYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second HTC EVO Shift 4G that I have owned.

The sliding mechanism is kind of hard to use to get to the keyboard but I figured after many times of sliding the keyboard out it will begin to loosen a little.

Churchill", "ReviewID": "R1AJ00TH0QSQO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone almost a year now, and for the most part, I really like it. The only reason I got a smartphone is because there were only 2 crappy junk plastic phones in the store at the time that didn't require a data package so I figured I would rather have a quality phone that did more than I needed it to. I don't use much internet or apps or whatever- I basically talk and text.  This was also my first touchscreen, so I was thrilled to have the slide out keyboard in case I couldn't get used to texting on a touchscreen- I did eventually but it was nice to have the option during transition.  This is a great phone, it probably does a lot more than I'm even aware of.  The camera is great, the screen crisp and clear (my pet peeve is when you can see the little pixel dots on a screen), and call quality is excellent.  My cons are obviously battery-  I charge it every night and I know thats to be expected of a smartphone, but good grief, I really don't use it much; and also the hinge on the slider is getting looser by the day.  I'm seriously concerned it is going to break apart any day, and I still have 14 months to go on contract. There is a noticeable gap between the top and bottom halves when its sitting and even when using it closed, it starts to slide open a bit.  Is this normal?

I rooted and flashed cyanogenmod, so my OS is not stock, but beyond the crap software this comes with, and the quite difficult time I had rooting it, it's a wonderful device.I gave it only 4 stars because there's a known issue with the ribbon cable connection, which I'm currently having major issues with (I bought a replacement digitizer to fix the problem, which I'm still waiting on) but considering how long I've had the device, one small issue is not big deal, really.The bloatware it comes pre-loaded with, as well as the OS that comes stock being one that is completely locked down, is a major negative in my view, but it CAN be rooted with enough persistence, so it's totally worth it.I have yet to have any major issues other then the ribbon cable thing, which is super easy to fix.One other thing I dislike about it is that it is CMDA only, and thus locked to sprint - you will never be able to take this phone to a different carrier, no matter how hard you try to make it work (trust me, I spent weeks doing just that... I hate sprint with a passion..)The QWERTY keyboard is wonderful, I've never had any problems with it's functionality, and I love the tactile feedback. The fact that it's a bit difficult to slide in and out is a plus for me, since my old phone snapped into place, and a piece ended up breaking.I have dropped this phone numerous times, and my water stickers show moisture damage, but still no problems with functionality (again, other then the well-known ribbon cable issue, which is a wear issue, rather then a damage issue) screen has not cracked or chipped, case tends to fly off spilling the guts of the phone about, but that's a small price to pay, IMHO, for abusing my device.I'd recommend it if not for the carrier limitations and relative difficulty getting rid of the bloatware for the average consumer", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "terrible experience.", "Author": "Brittany Miller", "ReviewID": "R3RPWSHNE2GOXJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone was in poor shape.

When I have had the phone on for a few days and have used a lot of apps, HTC Sense starts to bog down, so that the home screen takes a long time to come up. I have resolved this problem by restarting the phone on a daily basis before I go to sleep at night. Use the largest memory card you supported (8mb) if you load music or video, you will need it.2. As with many electronic music/sound devices the headset jack has given out on me. I am going to try a bluetooth stereo headset.3. Sprint annoyingly insists on pre-installing several apps that I never use, so precious phone memory is used by not having the option to uninstall those apps.

It concerns me that this is an ongoing problem with the people who supply these rebuilds and they have done nothing to address it.I have asked about getting the phone fixed.  They required that I return the phone and then they will send a replacement OR repair the existing phone.  Which ever is the cheaper option for them.

When I first got it I was excited because it's a smart phone and whatnot, but it is one of the worst. The processor is horrible, the internal memory is horrible, the sliding design is horrible, and the camera is god awful. This phone has less than 1gb of internal storage, which you would think doesn't matter since you can use a micro SD card. Wrong. Many things such as Facebook, Twitter, Contact storage, and other things that came with the phone must remain on the phone and cannot be moved to the micro SD card. Not only things on the phone, but many apps also cannot be transferred. The music player falls extremely short of that of any Apple device, and I'm extremely disappointed with mine. It doesn't get loud enough, and there is no equalizer (EQ) setting. I am constantly bothered with an HTC loading screen anytime I go back to the home screen.
