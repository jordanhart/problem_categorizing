{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought from Expansys early April 2013", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R3JGEP91DTH6NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Throughout my experience with smartphones, the experience has largely been the same through their lifetime. This is with Android devices and with trying IOS devices. This is my first Windows Phone. Well with each one, in the beginning honeymoon period, I would try everything I could. I would download an excess amount of apps trying to see how I can make the phone more interesting. Then I go around trying the camera. Then progressively it just becomes a weather, e-mail, social networks, and most importantly a telephone and texting device. This happens every-time. I look at new phones and think how much more powerful they are getting and then soon after I realize that not much has changed and I'm not even stressing the hardware with my usage. I try to watch videos from Hulu, Crunchyroll, Netflix, or Youtube and each time I realize that I don't like watching videos on such a small screen. I would rather on a tablet. So this review is mainly in the opinion of using as just a phone with a good calendar and email app.The performance is great. It is incredibly snappy and consistent. I haven't had a single crash in the two months having this thing. Things run fast and there really isn't any frustration at all with this phone. It is really straight forward in everything. People will caution you on the 512mb of RAM but that is only a real problem with the best looking games. Everything else is fine. Gaming on a phone isn't even that great of an experience. I always ended up on any phone trying the nicest looking games and then defaulting back to puzzle games, tetris, word search, sudoku, and bejewled. Battery life is the best thing about this thing. I'm not a heavy user. I can get through a couple days without needing to recharge. I use this thing mainly for email, communication, news, and to monitor my Fidelity account with their app. This is the most pleased I've been with a smartphone in terms of battery life since the days of regular tank Nokia phones. The screen is very nice and even though the resolution is sub-720p, everything looks crisp and vibrant. The camera takes very detailed photos in comparison to most other smartphones especially in this price range. My main motivation for buying this phone was for the camera and battery life. This phone excels in both of these.It's a gorgeous phone. The design looks amazing in person. The thing feels solid and built tough. I put it in a case just out of paranoia but it probably isn't necessary. the screen so far hasn't been scratched so that I could notice in my pockets. I haven't dropped it once. I was able to put in a 64GB SDXC card and it worked immediately after formatting. It does very well as a music player. It pretty much doesn't eat at the battery much at all. To manage the music I use Window Media Player; the sync app is atrocious. Nokia has a pretty nice equalizer and it supports Dolby headphone. This thing can drive an AKG Q701 pretty well at about 50% max volume. My desktop needs amping with those headphones but this phone does real well with them.This phone is a great deal. Look around and find it for less than $350. Unless you require the customization of Android, this phone will be more than sufficient. Unless you want to play the most graphics intensive games available, this phone will suffice. Just think how you use your phone before buying one of the $600 top of the line phones. If your just using it for communication - phone, text, facebook, email - or news and finance apps, this phone will please you. It has a great camera, comparable to the high end phones and the battery life will get most people though the day without reacquiring a recharge. You can use it to watch movies/tv but I don't like watching on such a small screen. I love this phone. I only worry about Microsoft being slow to update things. Nokia though churns out great applications and features. If you're buying a Windows Phone, right now Nokia has the best support for their devices.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1HTF1N5VWZTZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 720 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Nokia Lumia 720 has Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, 1 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait, 512 MB RAM (big minus?), 8 GB internal memory. microSD slot up to 64 GB which is awesome. Nokia Lumia 720 is the first time Nokia added an expansion slot for microSD (up to 64GB) into one of its polycarbonate builds. To access that slot you don't need to open the back. Like SIM card in iphones, you need one of those pins and push it to eject it and the microSIM card.This is a HSPA+ device, not a LTE. HSPA+ provides an evolution of High Speed Packet Access and provides data rates up to 168 Megabits per second (Mbit/s) to the mobile device (downlink) and 22 Mbit/s from the mobile device (uplink). These are theoretical of course, and in reality one can get 6-7 Mbps down and 1-2 Mbps up.Currently Temple Run is one of the Apps that require your device to have 1 GB of Memory hence I am surprised why the phone makers go in this route. Memory of 512 MB is not that expensive to put if they can sell in bulk. Microsoft says \"Memory (RAM): Some apps and features won't work on phones with less than 1 GB of RAM. To see how much memory your phone has, check the manufacturer's website or your phone's documentation.\"Screen is good, not great - 4.3-inch IPS touchscreen 800 x 480 pixels at 217 ppi. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised Windows 8 has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Battery is rechargeable 2000mAh Li-ion battery. (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) The Lumia 720 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery.Camera 6.7 MP is good enough, Bluetooth 3.0, 802.11a/b/g/n, G-Sensor, Digital Compass, A-GPS &GLONASS;, micro-USB. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia still makes the BEST", "Author": "rioloko", "ReviewID": "R3F9BFITP4GBUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this b/c of Nokia history, and my experience w/Nokias from way back in the days.  Despite the Apple/Samsung dominance in the smartphone world, it's unfortunate that more people don't give this brand a chance b/c Nokia still makes great phones.Even though this model Lumia 720 is not sold here in the States, I bought mine unblocked and it works w/out a hitch. Just went down to ATT and had them change my SIM card to a mini sim and was talking in under 5 minutes. I wanted something that could do email, surf, big (not HUGE) screen, and be durable.  I love the bright yellow colour!!The phone itself is very nice, screen is big enough to surf w/out drawing too much attention like a Galaxy. Touch screen is easy, responsive, and clear even in daylight.  I love the fact that there is a camera button, along w/screen button! About size, I do have to say that those (myself included) w/smaller hands may find the 720 a bit wider than desired, but hey, I'll trade the width w/wider viewing screen for slight discomfort using w/one hand.  Worst case, use both hands.....I like the toughness of Nokias, but would recommend getting a simple case for those unfortunate drops, that has already happened to me.  While the gorilla glass did it job, there's still a slight slit down the right side of the screen.  Screen is still completely usable/visable, but wish I had gotten a cover b4 the 720 hit the concrete, might not have any cracks now.  But overall, phone seems to be durable.About the actual functions of the phone, I'm very happy w/Windows 8.  I had toyed w/it in the stores and even bought a Samsung Focus w/Windows phone 7 (did not like that UI), so was familiar b4 buying this 720.  All I can say is that Windows 8 phones really are great phones!  I'm still finding a few tricks/shortcuts, so it does involve spending time w/the program, but overall, it's not too difficult and rather fun to use/navigate.  I would agree w/others that the whole Win8 format is the wave of  the future, very handy having the same format/layout on my phone as is on my ultrabook.  There are a few things I wished Win8 has/does that Android does, but the same can be said in the reverse, so it's a trade off.There is ONE APP that sets Nokia apart from others, the Nokia maps (Here Maps), I absolutely LOVE THIS APP!  Mainly b/c no internet/G3,4 connection is necessary! The bad side of Win8 is that there are not as many apps as Android or Apple, but hopefully, they will increase.  Me personally, I get pretty much most of the apps I could ever want now.Some side notes, camera takes good pic (and video) even in low light.  Again, it's a phone, so I don't expect high quality, nor did I buy it for the camera, but overall good quality. Skype works flawlessly, clear and no problems w/connection.  All the other things you'd expect in a phone work well too; calculator, alarm, ect. External microSD is a real positive!My only negative is the battery.  It drains rather fast if u use the phone heavily like surfing or playing games.  I have set my apps to the lowest energy usage possible but the phone still sucks out energy.  I've seen this complaint in other comments too, so I guess it's a Nokia thing.  My older Nokias got numerous days on a charge, but this 720 won't last over 24 hours if I use it to surf while at work, waiting on train, etc.  Light usage I get about 2 days, not too long considering, but I guess a big screen sucks power that much.....Also, I wish the ringtone were louder w/a stronger vibrate.  Older Nokias could be heard from many feet away, and vibration would startle you, but both are rather weak in this model.So, all in all, I'm very satisfied w/this Lumia 720.  It's a \"simple\" smart phone (no extra bells and whistles) which gives the average user everything he/she could want.  Build quality is typical Nokia solid and Win8 is rather easy and fun to use.  An excellent alternative to those looking for something other than the \"Big 2\" in smartphones.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb mid-range phone", "Author": "Angelo Statie", "ReviewID": "R3FX1ZPQW59VCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought two of these for my teenage kids via FGS Trading to reward them for excellent school performance. They are not application-hungry, and all their regularly required applications are there (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr). Both love the People hub, and there is a pretty decent camera with excellent low-light performance. Since both of them have Windows 8 laptops, all they have to do is snap pictures and turn on their laptop when they get home. The pics are automatically synched via Skydrive via a setting, so no downloading and transfers or synchs. Last but certainly not least: the ability to have different colors of phones, plus the attention they garner because all the other kids have the same bland-looking smartphones with row of icons, and their Live Tiles really stand out in the group.Very satisfied with the purchase, and also with the fast delivery from FGS Trading and Amazon.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seems to be chinese import", "Author": "fusio", "ReviewID": "RMLG8DWWV1WB7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone in general is great, much lighter than my more expensive Lumia 920.

She wanted a Window's phone because of it's easier integration with her Outlook calendar on her desktop.  As a working mom with two teenagers - having access to our families various calendars in real-time in critical.  She's previously used a Samsung android based phone.  I think android is great but their Achilles heel is the clumsy integration of Outlook calendar.  She loves this phone.  She's found so many awesome features that make this phone easy to use and a huge productivity tool.I wish my company would authorize Windows phones for use inside of our network so I could switch from my iPhone 5.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia smartphones are defective and this is no exception", "Author": "S. Davis \"Where there are bees, there is honey\"", "ReviewID": "RLMWS0ZLZU24E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do own this phone. I've also owned a pre Windows Mobile Nokia smartphone. Both did not work. I bought them because Nokia Maps (now Here Maps) is by far the best mapping application in the industry. The fact that you can download the map you want and use it anywhere offline is remarkable. However, this phone and the others are defective. It could be the software, but I bet you the hardware just isn't truly compatible with the software.My ear piece and camera have both stopped working. Completely! NOT intermittently, but completely. The infuriating thing is that today Nokia is marketing international smartphone picture day to coincide with their Lumia 1020. Total nonsense as a Lumia owner with a completely useless camera. I've been very careful with my phone and have not subjected it to physical abuse. I have done several hard resets and neither the camera nor the ear piece work. Since there are no warranties for this model in the US, I decided to replace the earpiece myself. Did the work and the earpiece still does not work (now I'm convinced it's software related).Before parts of the phone stopped functioning, the phone would crash perhaps 3 times per week! This has been a remarkably awful cellphone experience. I really do wish I went the way of the sheep. Whatever you do, stay away from Lumias and the Windows Phone platform. Whenever you're even remotely tempted, remember Microsoft's track record of software that crashes, is not robust, is not user friendly and/or just does not work. Also, as pretty as Nokia makes their devices seem I am here to tell you that the hardware does not work. They all invariably fail and Nokia customer service is no where near where they say or think it is. It's almost nonexistent in the US.In short, except for Here Maps, I have nothing good to say about this device or the two companies that put the product in your hands. Stay farrrrrrrrrr away.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to like this phone, but it is the software....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R23V5WQBEDPMKX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To sum it up: I love the feel of the phone itself, very solid and pleasant. As many others noted, the battery life is amazing, and so is the screen. It is very easy to use and Windows Phone has excellent options to protect the privacy, compared to Android. The big downsides for me are the glitches in the software that randomly shut down the phone in the middle of something, and also the poor browsing experience compared with Opera Mini on Android. Additionally this phone blocked tethering, although I can tether on the same plan with an unmodified Android handset. No wonder carriers like Nokia.I only installed a handful of apps and it worked well - at the beginning. After 3 weeks the phone suddenly started to turn itself off in unexpected moments. Hanging up after a call - the phone just went black, would not even show any signs of charging. After several hours and a few reboot attempts I got the phone to wake up again later that day. Then the same happened several times more, only these times I could get it to boot a few minutes later with a soft reset. Looking through forums it seems this issue has been known for nearly a year in different device models, but it is still not fixed. I need a phone that works reliably.The other big issue for me is the poor usability of the web browsers. The native Internet Explorer does not open links/tabs in the background and is limited by the number of tabs it can have open at the same time (around 6 tabs)! There is Nokia XPress which compresses the data and is generally faster (unless it has one of its server outages), but it also does not open links/tabs in the background. A third-party browser (UCBrowser) offers this functionality, but the rendering, convenience and speed are still short of Opera Mini. During these weeks I browsed the internet much less, because it turned out to be so cumbersome compared to Opera Mini on Android. And it used much, much more data as well.I would have loved to keep the phone hardware itself, but I am glad I am back on Android now (Sony Xperia). The Xperia phone is reliable, I can tether my notebook again when I need to and browsing on Opera Mini is a joy.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CB97ATM"}}
