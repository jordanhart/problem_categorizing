After having Nokia N900 I was skeptical towards Windows OS. I was very surprised how user friendly the operating system is. Doesn't lock, everything works seamlessly.My favorite thing is the dedicated camera button. It allows you to take pictures even when your phone is locked. It takes couple seconds from taking out of your pocket and taking a pic. The picture quality is unparalleled to iPhone and better than SamsungMoreover the design is very solid. I dropped it already several times on the pavement and all it got was small panel dent. I'm not the advocate of carrying my phone in protective case so solid phone is important for me. Weight is great to - you feel like you're holding a phone not a toy like in Samsungs case.I really recommend this device to anybody", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome product!", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "R2RX61QE703TG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is fantastic.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the services they provide. USPS failed to post transaction updates, so I had to sit tight for couple days without knowing where is my package or does it even in translation. But eventually it came within the expected delivery period in good condition.One thing you need to notice is this is an international version, I can't quite tell which region does mine came from. The charger is a type G one ( so most likely from UK or northern Europe). It does no use to me, but you can plug it with any kind of charger with an input between 100v-240v.As for the cell phone itself. I have to state I'm not a heavy cell phone user. All I really need is cloud storage (skydrive will do) and solid internet connection. I don't mind to pin my FB page in the browser.I don't use tumbler nor instagram. I don't play games on my phone.I travel a lot, and Nokia city leans is awesome to use, so does the Nokia map. The camera is simply amazing. Already installed Office kit allows me to check with most of my documents in a very efficient way. Also I have to give a shut out to Nokia Music, which basically serves as Spotify, but with offline radio, plus it only costs $4 to update to the premium, which allows you to do everything unlimited. (skip & download, ect)The phone is solid built, I spot no defection so far. Also,it's a big, heavy phone, so be prepare to feel it in your pocket all the time.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "3G Information", "Author": "Gabi", "ReviewID": "R3PT2JXNV2RAEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This model is for African countries just 3G (without 4G/LTE).

Fast service.Initially I was worried that the phone did not have 4G and maxed out at 3G support.This is correct, but it is not a hardware limitation. It is in the firmware. The model is the RM-821 which is the global variant of the Lumia 920. It has all the bands you would need to make it a true world phone.I have used it for a couple of months with the shipping firmware and 3G is the max speed it supports.However on the 17th August 2013, I changed the firmware to the European one and it now supports up to 4G provided your cellular provide supports 4G/LTE.I also got the Amber update which made a great phone even better. Which Amber the phone seems faster, plus you get Data sense and other goodies, including Nokia Pro Cam. Pro Cam new algorithms make the photos taken with the phone even better.Windows Phone 8 OS has detractors, but I have found no problems with it. It is fast, fluid and very stable.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch screen problems: Amazon would not provide warranty information", "Author": "Montana", "ReviewID": "RG3BZKJT058UW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I started using this phone a couple of months after I bought it.

I would have to hold the volume down + on/off + camera buttons until the phone turned on again, and I had to restart it each time the screen zoomed in, because nothing else would work. However, they only give you 30 days of warranty to send the device back for a revision (paying on your own for the mail, and restocking fee if they can't fix the problem). This was definitely not enough time to know how faulty the phone was. After a month and half of having this phone, the Data Plan stopped working as well as the MMS messages. I went to my phone carrier once every week for at least 5 weeks, where they would fix the problem. They even changed the SIM card a few times, but each time after a couple days it would stop working again. I finally decided to purchase a new phone at another store and have not had any problems since with my new phone. I will never buy from Factory Unlocked again.

The 920 uses mini-SIM card like my other Nokia phone, so switching them out was easy. I've had no drop or interruption of my service in USA and when traveling goutside of USA.Word of caution: Since I purchased an unlocked phone, I wasn't prepared to receive a phone that was setup with Portuguese settings, user guide, and electrical plug-ins. But I used the YAHOO Translator to convert Protugues to English and interpret how to get thru the first screens so that I could reset the phone to English and then proceed with setups. It took about an hour to overcome this drawback, but the phone is so totally worth the extra hiccup.My contacts/messages/calendar all transfered easily via the bluetooth syncing option and i have been able to download user guide from the internet and used the Nokia Discussion forum when I have very specific questions about phone features and settings (great resource of info!). The pictures I loaded from my old phone to new phone via ZUNE Windows phone app, very easily. This Windows phone is great, and I'm so glad that i left iPhone last year!

Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2ODWX70JQKEVT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this phone - from Mega Mobiles - and it arrived brand-new in a sealed box.  The phone is very well built and beautiful - with a gorgeous screen.  It was unquestionably new in the box and Mega Mobile is now a trusted seller for me. I have only had it two days but it seems to be quite a battery burner - my battery app is reporting almost 4% usage per hour.  This brings up my major issues with WP8:  you have to buy apps to show simple, stupid stuff like battery percentage.  This is  unacceptable and I see why WP continues have adoption issues.  Another case in point - say you want to use CardDAV to get your Google contacts on the Lumia?  Forget about it - it doesn't work!!  My phone arrived with the Lumia Amber version - supposedly the CardDAV issue is fixed in Lumia Black - due out in the future.  Also, trying to set up Gmail thru WP8's Gmail \"tool\" did not work well - I kept getting memory errors and had to set up Gmail using the IMAP functionality.  For crying out loud, it's 2013, and MS can't figure out how to set up an error-free Gmail connection?  Although the phone itself is beautiful - and I really like the hardware - MS has continued to be behind the power curve with Windows Phone 8.  Oh - back to battery percentage - there is still no way to have the battery percentage appear in the notification bar on top.  Even the live tile - which I paid $1.99 for - only updates once every 30 minutes.  OK - enough complaining - there are some nice positives for WP8:  MS doesn't scan all of  your e-mail (as far as I know, anyway) to try to target ads for you the way Google does - and Office documents look great (for a phone) since it includes Office 365.  Overall, the phone is a keeper, because Nokia did a fabulous job on the hardware end.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "There was an AT&T; logo on the cellphone", "Author": "Zz", "ReviewID": "RAD82GCUFQD3V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for my brother.
