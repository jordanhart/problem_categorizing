I also use the calendar,calculator and alarm clock functions often.There are only a few games and ring tones that work on this phone, but I don't bother with them. I tend to lose phones regularly,so I can't really say how long the phone will last, but I have had my latest phone about a year.This is a good phone to carry around with you if you make occasional phone calls.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good little Phone", "Author": "FreshNess", "ReviewID": "RD7TRS078EZ4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hey for the price it can't be beat, small, rough and tough little sucker, feels good in hands, nice grip while talking. Definitely worth it, if you just want a phone to make calls and light texting. It's no smart phone, but it's not stupid either!", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for texting.", "Author": "Rozella B", "ReviewID": "R3MQEMRIGOD3UT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good for beginner.

You can buy this at any drugstore for $10.As for the actual phone, I like it.  Have had it for 11 months or so, has been starting to show signs that it might be time to replace for a month or so.  Don't expect anything fance... but that's exactly why you're even reading this.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ringtones cost extra", "Author": "Robert Keith", "ReviewID": "R30VGBAWUOUMH3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a robust little phone and the Virgin prepaid plans are not too bad. However, it is supplied with a very small number of ringtones that sound like someones idea of cool electronica and are inaudible in any sort of noisy environment.Other ringtones cost $2.50 and buying them requires that you buy into the Virgin download plan for an extra $5 per month. Even then the only choices are songs and hip hop - and you don't even get to listen to them before paying up. The ability to supply your own ringtone is blocked.The support is non existent. It is impossible to talk to a human at Virgin. All you get is and endless maze of automated phone messages.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$13.98", "Features": "Multimedia and text messaging\nInternet and e-mail capable\nCustomizable ringtones\nColor display\nUp to 200 minutes talk time and 200 hours standby", "Name": "PayLo by Virgin Mobile - LG 101 No-Contract Mobile Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Qbpj%2BqXrL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00804VXYA"}}
