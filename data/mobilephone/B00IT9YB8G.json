Kingelon N8800 fits the bill.  This is an excellent budget smartphone that works like a premium smartphone.  The specs as listed are correct.Phone features:Phone calling works well, I can hear the other party, and I can be heard loud and clear from the other side.This phone has two sims.  The first sim is regular size sim, and supports both 3G and 2G. 3G has 850 and 2100 mhz bands, 2G supports 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 mhz bands.  The second sim is a smaller sized mini sim, and supports 2G only (850/900/1800/1900 mhz).  For this phone, I use AirVoice wireless service, a MVNO of AT&T;, and 3G data works quite well.Performance - This phone is fast, since it has the MTK6592 eight-core processor.  It can run almost all of the apps that I installed on it.  I ran Antutu benchmark and it scored 26,800.  I would think this phone can also handle games as well.Display - the display is amoled that is visible/readable even at oblique angles.  The resolution though is only QHD - 540x960.Battery - the battery is a huge 3400 mah, but with it's octa-core CPU, the battery drain is subtantial while running cpu intensive apps.  I use \"greenify\" for hibernating apps, and this really reduces the battery usage to a bare minimum when the phone is idle.WIFI - this phone's wifi is dual-band, it can detect 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi signals from routers.Sensors - It has only accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor, and microphone.  No magnetic sensor (compass would not work), no NFC.GPS - gps works fine, and can get a satellite fix in less than a minute from a cold-start.Storage and RAM.  This phone has 1 GB RAM, which for me is enough for running the usual apps.  Internal storage is listed at 8 GB, and for which about 5.5 GB is actually usable, and the operating system uses about more than 2 GB.  O/S is Android JB 4.2.2.  It has an external micro SD slot.  The specs states that it can use a 32 GB micro sdhc.  I tried a 64 GB micro SDXC and it works fine.Overall, this is an excellent value for the money.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IT9YB8G"}}
