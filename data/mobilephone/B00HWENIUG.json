{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lumia Icon", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2E85WU0ZWM1BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a couple weeks and consider it an upgrade over my iPhone 5, for the most part.  The downgrade is obviously with the app store.  The Windows Store does not have as many apps and I do miss a few.  However, there are many good apps and if there isn't an app, you can easily go to the website and even pin it to the home screen for fast, easy access.  I do miss Shadowgun: Deadzone and Real Racing 3, but there are good fps games like Modern Combat 4 and racing games like Real Racing 2.  The other problem with some of the apps is they don't have all of the same features as the apps in the App Store.  For instance, I downloaded the Amazon app for the Icon, but could not post a review from it.The call quality is about the same as with the iPhone 5, however the Icon is much more functional with my car Bluetooth system.  Not only can I answer calls through my car audio system like I did with my iPhone 5, but I can also read text and respond to text through voice recognition without hitting any buttons.  The phone comes over the radio and tells me who the text is from, reads it, and ask if I would like to respond, call, or end.  The other thing that is an upgrade is the audio quality, music just sounds better.  The music is clearer and has better range, with deeper base.  The screen is also an upgrade.  I got tired at having to look at such a tiny screen on the iPhone and the 5\" screen on the Icon is really the perfect size for me.  It's not uncomfortable in my pocket, but it is big enough to watch YouTube or the NFL channel without having the phone right up to my face.  The bigger screen makes for easier texting too!  The IE web browser is really fast.  This phone has 32gb of storage compared to the 16gb I had.  I was able to easily download my music from my Surface RT.  The camera is 20Mp compared to 8Mp and it has many cool features.  Such as, the ability to have something move in a photo while everything else is frozen, the ability to play with the ISO settings, slow motion video, 1080p video, etc.  Overall this is a great phone, the Windows Store is growing, has a couple XBox exclusive apps, the screen has Gorilla Glass 3 (not afraid of the screen cracking like it did on my iPhone), and I was able to buy it off-contract for $250 after Verizon gave me $300 for my iPhone 5. Oh yeah, it also comes with Office and there is a system update coming out in a couple of months (8.1), the battery last a long time and it can be charged wirelessly on a pad (Qi).", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia buld quality is back at Verizon!", "Author": "J. Welhouse", "ReviewID": "R15CXTY0JY4J1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many different brands of phones but this Nokia Icon has a build quality superior to all. It\u2019s sturdier feeling then an iPhone 5s with a better screen and camera. The galaxy s4 feels flimsy and fragile. My S4 was so loaded up with garbage apps, it was slow after a week but not this Icon. This phone seems to be asking me to throw more at it! it can't be satisfied, LOL! Also, i get 5 full LTE bars in more places than my S4 did and other people say i sound great on calls.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows Phone- A step Forward", "Author": "AlphaAl \"Al^2\"", "ReviewID": "R1MIGI7SF6V1AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumia Icon is a fantastic device that lives up to the Icon name. 4 1/2 StarsThe screen is vibrant and has a smooth, accurate feel to it. When I say smooth I mean SMOOTH. Showing it to friends and co-workers one of the first things they comment is on the fluidity of the device and operating system. Visibility in bright Sunlight is amazing, something I struggled with when I had the S3. Even the Iphone which has a technically brighter screen, struggles in visibility. Colors are not accurate, a little more vibrant as with most Lumia Devices. But don't worry! Changing the color calibration is easily done in the setting to suit your tastes.Camera. This was a big selling point for me, as I am an artists and constantly need to take pictures to incorperate into my artwork. When it comes to options and control, nothing beats Lumia. While I found that the auto mode did a good job in taking images, the potential of the 20MP was really unlocked when setting it on manual. Nokia does a good job of teaching those new to cameras about aperture, ISO and other important settings with their tutorial. On the other hand if you mainly use your phone to take quick snapshots and want a fast camera, this might not be the camera for you. The camera certainly is faster, then say the 1020, but it lags a little compared to the competition. (about 1/2 second slower)OS. Here is where most people are uncertain. In order to truly love your Lumia, you have to be committed to Microsoft services.The Live Tiles update frequently and flip to give you the information you need with out having to open many apps. Although the Store might not have as many apps as Android or Apple, I have yet to not find a utilitarian tool that I need and Nokia doesn't offer. I do miss the larger selection of games, such as DS Emulator and other highlights, but in the end it keeps me more focused on what I have to do and less focused on gaming on my phone.Nokia Drive which comes with the phone, is hands down the best experience I've had with free navigation services. Even compared to google Maps. This is largely due to the fact that it does NOT use any data, because it downloads maps beforehand and makes navigation more seamless. Integration of all my emails was great, and my contacts were imported from my live account. Those coming from Android or Apple will have a little harder time putting in contacts. (as you have to use verizon services instead).Microsoft Office is hands down the best experience working with word documents on a mobile device, and gives you a plethera of options and formats. A seling point for those that need to update presentations or write last minute essays on the fly.Call quality is great on my end as I can hear voices clearly and loudly. It's an even better experience for the people on the othe rend, because due to the FOUR microphones on the Lumia, it smartly hides background noise, even in a busy intersection.Overall this phone was been a Joy to use, and is the best windows phone VErizon has to offer. I do miss my notification center, and google Now/ Siri, but those updates are soon to come with windows phone 8.1 update and Nokia's voice assistant Cortana.

It has top specs, really good camera & look great.  The 5\" screen is one of the best there is, the camera is even or better than the 5s & only inferior the the 41 megapixel 1020.  The size & weight are not an issue as it smaller & lighter than the Xperia Z1 & 2 & only 1 millimeter thicker.  They could have made it thinner but I prefer not to have a camera hump & have included Qi wireless charging.  Camera operation is faster than the 1020(the Iphone is still the fasted around)  All the apps I must have are present in the app store so there is no app gap for me.  Battery last a full day with moderate/heavy - heavy use with, 10-15% left at the end of the day", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best is Yet to Come", "Author": "Eric N.

More specifically, I'm impressed by Nokia's attention to quality and detail with this phone (something I feel is lacking across most Android devices but which is exemplified by Apple). The phone is solid in the hand, with a gorgeous screen and is the perfect size for my medium-large hands. It feels light enough to hold for long periods of time but heavy enough to give you confidence in its quality. Most of the apps I was accustomed to using were waiting for me in the Windows Phone Store so I don't yet feel like I'm missing out on anything. Where this phone really shines, however, is the camera.  At 20MP and with optical image stabilization, the shots are simply stunning. They are good enough that I don't regret not bringing my Canon DSLR with me on trips anymore. Any complaints that I do have about Windows Phone, and they are pretty minor, are set to be addressed next month by the Windows Phone 8.1 update.

I was somewhat worried that she wouldn't like the WP operating system since she had an Android phone, but she absolutely loves it.  It has all the apps she needs (Instagram and Facebook mostly), and I showed her how to pin the Pinterest webpage to the start screen since I don't think there's an official Pinterest app yet.And the camera on this thing is sick!  I couldn't believe how good the pictures looked even on the automatic settings.  It's going to take her a long time to figure out all the advanced options it has (bracketing, f-stop adjustments, ISO, etc.).  She has Win8.1 on her computer, so she also likes being able to turn on her computer and automatically have all her pictures right there.I may have to get one of these for myself.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "CaptainMknuckle", "ReviewID": "R1MBHQYGVQMM6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I ever had.

That trend continues with the Lumia Icon with a great industrial design and hardware to rival the best phones on any platform. If you don't mind a 5 inches phone and I think that's the sweet spot for a large screen phone. You get great camera for photo and video and the only real drawback is that Windows Phone doesn't always get the apps like iOS and Android.

The official release will include some Icon firmware updates that I hope will allow WP 8.1 to run with a few less glitches. That said, I am enjoying the new 8.1 features.

The reason I got the phone was to be able to sync up with my laptop that runs windows 8 as well. Cool ideas as far as the tiles and apps for the phone but the nokia pro cam doesn't work that would allow you to do all the amazing stuff that the commercial says you can. I have an xbox which is another reason why I wanted the windows phone. To be able to use the smartglass but that doesn't work either. It has a fast processor which is why it got a second star in my rating. Otherwise the battery life drains quickly. Might as well carry a charger around with you all the time. In the 20 days that I have had the phone, I have had more issues of resetting and wiping the phone clean than I did in 3-1/2 years with my Motorola droid x. Now I'm trying to be able to send it into nokia for warranty repair and I can't even do that. Nokia says it is having system issues and can't finalize my repair request.
