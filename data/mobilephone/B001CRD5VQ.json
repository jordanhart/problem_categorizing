No frills, no extra features that you won't use.  Just the right stuff for the person who wants a phone to make calls and store all their contact information without the hassles and fees from having a contract.  Furthermore, this can be a great phone for emergency use or as a backup!  I've enjoyed using this phone and highly recommend purchasing it.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great flip phone!
