I ordered it at 5PM on a thursday, and it shipped the next day, I had it in my hands on that Monday. And i did not opt for anything more than the original shipping speed (3-5 days). Perfect.The phone is great. It seems to be a latin america model, but it works flawlessly on AT&T.; Just make sure you have a micro SIM card (or cut your full sized one). I am able to use 4G on ATT (NOT LTE, the HSPA+).This phone is so far excellent, and everything has gone smooth. The best part? No bloatware from AT&T;, and everyone wondering how you got a Droid Razr on that network instead of Verizon.UPDATE 7/5/12 -Okay, so when I got the phone, there was news of an ICS upgrade coming out. Well, lucky for me, I happened to get a RAZR from Puerto Rico (it was in English and was unlocked, of course) but the update wasn't coming through. I had to jump through hoops to get ICS installed on it, even go as far as changing the system version from the Puerto Rican version to one from Brazil so I could get ICS on it.I am not sure how OTA updates work for this phone, so I did it manually. It was a giant pain, but it did work smoothly, and I am finally on Android 4.0.4.Case in point - excellent phone, but if you want to upgrade the stock 2.3.5 that it comes with, it will require some technical knowledge to do. Besides this, I am loving the phone.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "motorola razr", "Author": "qcromwell", "ReviewID": "R21I9RQB5DNOUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the razr to be a very nice phone. it was unlocked and as soon as my sim was place in it t-mobile service was up and running. The shipping was excellent and the phone was package great. The feature of the phone are easy to use.  the battery life has been very good so far.  the touch screen responds quickly.Only cons is sometime it take a few extra seconds for programs to load but I believe this is because I have too many apps running at the same time. Quality of the sound on the phone is excellent also.  The slim design and clear screen graphics makes this phone a excellent buy for the price.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love Android", "Author": "Brennan Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R3DPPWRCBMBE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Made the switch a little over a year ago and love them. Started off with HTC Inspire, now I'm using the RAZR. This is a gsm version so it'll work with any SIM card. Stock there's a pretty polished UI and the camera takes awesome photos and movies, SmartActions is pretty cool too. The phone is definitely splash proof and resistant to scratches. Also if you root your phone note that this is from Malaysia, so if you want to download fastboot files look for Malaysia as the region. I'm using MIUI and I'd say the dual core processor does just fine.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "slazo", "ReviewID": "R1V0IDTT3TEJHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I find this phone easy to use as i had a motorola defyx previous to it.
