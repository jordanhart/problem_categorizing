{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ex226 does everything as advertised", "Author": "NoSciFi", "ReviewID": "R29C2AR8HNRMEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A 5 star rate should be assigned whenever a product does all that it is advertised to do. Motorola ex226 is a phone that has all the features needed in a non-smart phone. Priced right, easy to use, dual SIM. Dual SIM is the reason I purchased this phone, it is my second phone from Motorola, my first ex115. EX226 combines touch screen and a full qwerty keyboard. A phone like this gives you the opportunity to buy a data plan from a North American cell phone company or not. The dual SIM gives you the opportunity to have both your comapany phone number and your personal phone being answered on the same phone. Elininates carrying two phones. The lines are completely seperate, two voice mail boxes, messages, contact lists, call history.There has been some who are not seeing the caller ID or NAme from the contact list. This is corrected by copying their contact list from the SIM card to the phone memory. There was someone stating in a previous review that it was too hard to create a message or see the lists. They did not tap on the arrow sysmbol at the top of the screen. The screen, as you can see, is the top half of the phone and then there is the shade. There is a small arrow at the top of the main scrren that when you tap on it a shade is pulled down and the alternat buttons appear, cool idea.Summary: Great phone, great battery, using it on AT&T; in USA, Dual SIM simultaneously, slim, light weight, easy to use.Emjoy!", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone returned", "Author": "Herbert R. Perkins", "ReviewID": "R17XPMZ3X5VCQP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace a still working Nokia E 62 phone.  I wanted a phone with a separate wifi that could be used occasionally and I definitely did not want to have to pay for a Data Plan with the newer smart phones. While the Motorola had that function, and it did work as I expected, it failed in several other areas.The phone was supplied in two days as advertised.  While it looked as if it were new,I found two messages in the message folder which leads me to believe that it was a return that is being resold. Nothing wrong with this as cosmetically the phone looked new but I do think it should be noted in the description.The wall charger that was supplied had European prongs and was supplied with an American adapter. This was a nuisance as I am confident that the first thing that would have gone missing was the adapter.When first plugged in, the charger would not work. Fortunately I had another charger that did work so I was able to charge the phone.In checking out the phone the first thing I found was that the instructions that came with it were good to get you started but did not give enough information about the numerous function in the phone. A long and very arduous search of the internet revealed that there seems to be no manual available. I went to youtube and found several videos that were helpful and with some play time, figured out how to use most of the functions.Next was to get my contacts from my old Nokia to the Motorola. Of course the easy way is to copy them to the SIM card and move the SIM card over. No joy as I had too many contacts in the Nokia but I did get some to transfer. However as this was not a real data transfer, you lost things like addresses and comments.This issue should have proven to be an inconvenience and turned into a deal killer.  I looked for a copy of the Motorola PC suite on line as this would both allow me to back up the contacts and to transfer them from a Nokia back up file on my laptop. After a good bit of difficulty I found a copy. It loaded OK but when I tried to use a USB cable to connect it to my laptop the program would not recognize the phone. I initially felt it was a bad cable so off to the store for a new cable.  Back home, the new cable  would not work either.I first thought that the USB connector on the phone was bad as I tried to read it from a laptop and a desktop computer and could not get it to work with either one. Therefore, the next option was to use the Bluetooth connection \u2013 off to the store to get a Bluetooth adapter.The adapter installed on the laptop and the phone sort of found the laptop but I found that getting the two to find each other in the time allotted by the phone to link to a blue tooth device was quite a trial and error affair. One they finally made a link I found that the phone is not supported by the Motorola PC suite. The software put up a message that the phone was not supported.As I still needed to get my contacts across from the Nokia, it was back to the store to get a memory card reader \u2013 (of course none of my cameras take the micro sd card so I had to buy a new reader.)Back home I was able to back up the Nokia on to a mini sd card and it could be read by my laptop. Good so far. The micro SD card could not be formatted by the phone and consequently could not be read or written to by the pc. So now I am at a dead end. No way to move contacts and saved SMS messages to the phone.I made several calls with the phone and call quality was good. It did sync with my headset and that too worked well. But overall I have to rate it poorly, just because of the problem with moving contacts into it. If you purchase the phone as a first phone and then add your contacts as you use it, I am confident it would work well. The wifi did work and connected to my home system. Again it is a smart phone that does not need a smart phone data plan and this is a big plus for me.I am returning the phone as it is worthless to me if I have to transfer all my contacts by hand. Also the problem with the wall charger turned out to be the European to USA adapter.  If you bring the transformer half way out of the adapter it will make contact and charge the phone. While this is a solution, it is not an acceptable one. I believe the phone should be supplied with a proper American wall charger even if the price of the phone has to go up a few dollars.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "My all over the world phone", "Author": "DrSparx \"The Master of Sparx\"", "ReviewID": "R2ILCJOOU3I2I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an unlocked dual SIM phone with wifi.

They use it in Canada, US, and Asia (Hong Kong/Taiwan). Great phone. Very reliable. Battery life is solid and it feels well-made. Definitely not a crappy feeling phone. The body has a slightly rubberized coating which is nice. UI is slightly puzzling but just takes some getting used to (play around with the phone a bit!). I recommend buying a motorola charger separately for your country (or using a micro USB charger for your country) because it comes with a foreign charger (European?).

They look similar, but the difference is the \"Motorola Motokey Social\" has Facebook as the home key. So, the advertising is a bit missleading. I called the seller and they claimed that this was in fact the EX226 and they all have FB as the home key. I laughed and just sold the phone to someone that could use it with FB.

I have no problem with a simple system like those found on really chap phones... they work well and are intuitive. This thing though, it's some primitive stage in the evolution of modern operating systems and it is seriously backward. Also, it's nice that it has the touchscreen option, but for many things it actually forces you to use it, there is no keyboard alternative. I didn't like that at all.
