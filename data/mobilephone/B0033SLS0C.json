I have been a blackjack/Jack fan for a couple of years now. I had the original blackjack which is still one of my favorite phones of all time. When my phone broke I was searching for the blackjack 2 when I stumble across this device. Best buy I ever had it's a great messenging device, great camera(3.2 mega), has wifi which say works great. At the end of the day I must say this is my favorite phone so far and if I had to buy it again I would.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Jack", "Author": "curly", "ReviewID": "RVM3UQVUOWADW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This came to me in excellent condition. Works pretty much as i had hoped. I was under the impression when i bought this that i would not have to have have a data plan but ATT won't let use the phone without one. I would recommend this if you don't mind paying for a data plan....$20 a month minimum.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Jack Windows Mobile 6 phone", "Author": "Ryan Lester", "ReviewID": "RRN3SAUEBR6UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome. It comes with Microsoft Office 2007. If you upgrade it to Office Mobile 2010 ( ITS FREE!) then you can make Excel documents, Word Documents, and One Note Files. I have a normal calling and texting plan. I always wanted a smart phone ever since my dad got one. I couldn't when I upgrade because they keep saying Data is required. I got this one and I dont need Data. To go on the intrnet just log onto a wifi hotspot. When you go for an upgrade put your SIM card back in your old phone and take your old phone to AT&T; store. I got mine Used with a condition of very good. It came in the mail and I took it out of the package and my Mom said that does not look used. It came with a new battery, not one scratch on the screen, or anywhere. It looked brand new! When I showed it to my friends I just said it was new to save time saying why i got it used.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Smart", "Author": "Moderation", "ReviewID": "RBI2ISFL507EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good smart phone.

Freymuller", "ReviewID": "RJCADG9W1U37P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This JACK was given to me by a friend and I've been using it for over 2 years now. Overall, it works good. It's small, has good reception, the internet works well and you can search and do other things while making a call such as using the calendar and the ring is loud. Before this phone, I had the Blackjack and Blackjack II; the II is the best of them all by far, even compared to many of today's phones. The downsides to the JACK are: on bootup, the password window does not always appear requiring to turn off the phone (not power down) and turn it back on--frustrating; the battery needs charging daily if not more depending on use; accessories are expensive; keypad is not as good as the BJ or BJII; screen is unusable in sunlight; the phone can be slow at times. I would buy a BJII before I'd buy the JACK as the only advantage is the WiFi and frankly, I don't use that much.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone is a complete WASTE of money", "Author": "MommyDre", "ReviewID": "RJE6KUVOTVC5H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about 3 months now and all I can say is Don't purchase it. I went from a REAL smartphone (Motorola Atrix) after the screen shattered (no insurance) to this piece of crap cheap phone and I am very disappointed. It does not have any features that a smartphone does including a touchscreen, APPS, navigation, weather, text messaging auto-correct, etc. Not to mention the qwerty (sp?) keyboard on this is ridiculously small making it impossible to text without mistakes.The battery life is terrible. When you receive pictures via text messages you can BARELY make out anything because the screen is so darn small. When checking an email you have to press \"Get the rest of the message 10K\" just to see your entire email! And sometimes is won't even load!If you are looking into buying a smartphone, go with a more simple operating system and something that is touch like an android, apple, etc. DO NOT waste your money on this phone, you will regret it.

I dont know when this began but it looks like amazon is letting other people sell their stuff.. people who dont own stores.. Ive already bought like 4 cel phones and all of them came with their original boxes and all the accessories.. But this cel just came in an empty box (the cel with just a bubble bag) with a non original charger which is now giving me problems cause it disconnects when it wants to...I had to pay more than 60$ to get the other accessories (instalacion cd, car charger, headphones, etc.)The cel phone is ok, but is partially locked.. you have to hack it to make it fully unlocked..Shipping did make it on time..I wish amazon wouldnt let people sell their leftovers in this site, thats why ebay exists, and thats why i never buy there..Thank you..", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
