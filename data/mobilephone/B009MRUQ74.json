For people who don't want an expensive data plan but need to upgrade their stone age flip phone, the brightside is a great in-between. It's a good size, fits nice in my hand and pocket, and so far I haven't had any problems with it. the camera is pretty good for a phone, best one I've had so far. The key-board slides out nice, it doesn't stick or anything. The only complaint I have is the menu screen. Most phones have a home screen where you choose a background and everything, but this phone doesn't have that. The orange screen shown in the picture is your home screen, you can choose between orange or green and choose what shortcuts are on the home menu, but that's the limit of your home screen options.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!!!", "Author": "Aimee Cottrell", "ReviewID": "R5AO6U7P9T7QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a basic phone but delivers big.

Not that I recommend that plan, but at least she can in an emergency if necessary.With a full glass touch screen I bought a few cases & screen protectors with the order so it never left the house without either. Since it slides open the case is two pieces which tend to fail after a few months with normal use.

(She was showing me some of her photos.) So took a trip to the local Verizon store to check it out and purchased there.  After now getting to know it, I am quite happy with my purchase.I have been trying out the 75mb per month data plan package ($10) and with the 3g in this phone mobile webbing is fast! So I am going to stay with it for the several sites I enjoy having easy access to.I love the touch screen and its responsiveness.  The qwerty keyboard works really well and now works also with Verizon Opera Mini's recent update. (Yes! :-))  (Or you can use the onscreen keyboard of course.) The icons on the start screen can be moved around and replaced so there is some customization there as well as in other areas of the phone.  The camera has a good amount of various options and 4 picture quality/size settings as well as a camcorder.

It randomly dials people when it's in my purse. If I touch it when its ringing, just touch it, it sometimes answers even if I don't want to answer. It randomly turns on the Verizon app. Not sure if this is an issue with the phone or phone service, but I can get texts hours after they were initially sent.

It wasn't worth the hassle anymore. Getting away from this horrible phone and going with the Cosmos 3, had Verizon had those in stock when I originally ordered the Brightsides, I never would have gotten stuck with the Brightsides. I am lowering my rating to one star because the Brightside is simply the worst phone I've ever owned, and I've owned a lot of not so great phones.Update 5/17/2014: I have had a horrible time trying to find a headset that will work with this phone and last. I can't use bluetooth, so it has to be corded. I have been through five different brands of headsets, including Plantronics. I have paid anywhere from $5 to $50 for headsets and gave up trying to find one that would work. After countless weeks of returning defective headsets that keep breaking, headsets that won't work, or headsets that aren't compatible, I gave up.I was an Env and Env3 user for many years. I used up every Env3 I could get my hands on until it just wouldn't work reliably anymore. Then the moment of truth came, I would have to upgrade and get a new phone. When I looked over my options, they were very, very few on the Verizon Wireless Website for a feature phone that had a full sized QWERTY keypad, that did not require a data plan. As a texting fanatic and someone who spends hours a day on my phone making actual phone calls, I decided to give the Samsung Brightside a try over the Pantech Jest 2. Now, I'm not so sure I made the right choice.I was able to score the Samsung Brightside phones, not one, but two of them, through a Walmart and Verizon Wireless deal for 1 cent, with $30 per phone in activation costs. Since I would have paid $30 to activate any phone, I basically scored the Samsung Brightsides for 1 cent each, and even that is still too much to spend on them. First and foremost they are touch screen phones, and annoying touch screen phones at that. While you can arrange the icons to fit your liking, the only way to really lock the phone down securely is with a password, and that's not practical all of the time. Locking the phone with the side button is easy to undo by simply touching the screen, so it's not much help.The camera quality is fair for a cell phone. Since I am comparing it to the Env3, the picture quality is better, but it does not have as many features as the camera on the Env3 did. First of all, there is no flash, and it's difficult to get used to the dragging your finger across while accessing your photos once stored in your phone. The memory included in the phone is small. I don't save much in my phone, delete my texts daily, and was constantly getting memory full messages, and added a card to the phone to store more stuff. I haven't seen messages since. The number of ringtones that it comes with seems like a huge selection but there was no super loud continuous beep/ring like I had with my EnV3, and boy do I miss it. I have it on a semi-annoying ring, just so I will recognize it as a ring and not ignore it as a radio blaring a bad song.The Opera Mini browser that comes with it is irritating at best when you don't use the phone to access the Internet. There is no way to uninstall it. I checked all of the settings, I even asked at a Verizon store, not only can it not be installed, but it's very easy to accidentally activate it, which can result in data  charges if you are not careful. My solution? I called Verizon Wireless and had them disable all data on the phone, so now it pops up and I can hit the off button without a fear of being charged, and without too much concern.I like the screen on the phone in terms of the size. Maneuvering the text messaging inbox and replying takes extra steps then it did on the Env3, and everything about this phone seems like a step backwards rather then a step forwards in time. You can't use a photo as your wallpaper, but I have gotten used to the peaceful beach screensaver that takes over the screen. Charging it can be challenging as sometimes it tells you it's charging, but most of the time it doesn't. The screen does not stay on while charging and you have to press a button to check the status, and usually then it will say that it's done, unplug to conserve power. When you forget to unplug it after it's done charging, it continues to put a drain on the outlet rather than work off the newly charged battery.Battery life is also worse then the battery life was on my Env3. I spend most of the day on the phone and sending text messages. I rarely take photos, and I rarely do anything else with my phone, an occasional calculator use here and there, but nothing major. The battery when fully charged will last about 6 hours, but only about 3 1/2 hours with continuous talk time. I have purchased two spare batteries (one for each phone), keep them charged at all times, so that I am never without a phone.The most annoying part about the Samsung Brightside is that when you are on a call, you almost have to use a headset, otherwise if you so much as lean on the phone wrong, you will disconnect the call. I have tried multiple different headsets and have not had any compatibility issues with the Samsung Brightside yet. It has a 3.5mm jack, so it fits most headsets. Without a headset, I literally cannot use this phone unless I use it on speakerphone, due to the fact that the call end button is on the touch screen and is not a physical button. Really dumb design in my opinion. Too much reliance on the touch screen rather then actual buttons also makes this one impossible to put in the bottom of a purse or backpack because it always turns on, unlocks itself, etc.Overall, I hate the Brightside, it gets two stars for being affordable, made by Samsung, working with Verizon, and being blue in color. That's about all that I can rate good on this phone.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheap working great replacement", "Author": "Anthony Grande", "ReviewID": "R3B60OFOU4QG14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "worked fine for 1/3 the price of verizon at three hundered dollars for a new one at the verizon store", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Renetta Herron", "ReviewID": "R2LZ1A1V0KE3IG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am working my mother up to a smart phone.

I pocket dial and text people often, and even while wearing loose shorts with cargo pockets.  The phone constantly sends me advertisements about getting 3G or some new GPS app.  And these advertisements may not seem that bad, but if your phone volume is on, the advertisements go off at random times, and they are loud.  Also they lock the phone on, so even if it is in sleep mode, the advertisements will wake it up, and not let it go back to sleep, draining the phone's battery.  Also, My Verizon, if you have Verizon, cannot be taken off the main home screen, so, you get even more advertisements from that as well.  Also, sometimes the phone will try to send me through a process to buy 3G, and while in my pocket, I managed to buy 3G for my phone.
