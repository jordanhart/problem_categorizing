I emailed the seller who assured me he or she had had some shipping difficulties but planned to mail my phone at 4pm that day.  When I checked the \"Your item has shipped\" notification, there was no Tracking #. Sure enough, several days later I received another notification about my $$ being refunded..which did happen ok. So what was that all about? Stolen phones? Someone scamming to have \"borrowed $$\" to use for a few days? Who knows; I'm just glad I got my money back without a hassle", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "easily 6 stars..", "Author": "vincent", "ReviewID": "R31N2FTZ1SJEPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone was flawless and works perfectly.. zero scratches zero marks.
