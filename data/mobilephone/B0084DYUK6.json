Josie", "ReviewID": "R1SZJVGVWU0HK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First smartphone - provides all essential smartphone features plus WiFi for free internet use, GSM for international travel, micro SD expandable card, mature OS (2.3.4), unblocked (I use AT&T; prepaid and my wife uses T-Mobile prepaid) so unblocked provides flexibility to transfer SIM cards depending on minutes remaining.  I have pushed the phone pretty hard over the last few weeks - downloading about 15 apps  and numerous calendar entries.  I opened .pdf files, several mp3 files, played with the 5MP camera (very nice) and even forced myself to write and send several emails. The ability to access free web usage is particularly nice even on a 3.5 inch screen. I have tested at home, in two different libraries, at Starbuck's and Peet's, always a fast auto detect signal and I am on - with no data plan costs (an early download was the free AVG AntiVirus app - essential for any mobile OS nowadays).Only annoyance is that I wish the power off start-up cycle were faster (30 seconds before 3G signal lock).  This is slower than my previous Razor feature flip phone, but the ZTE is doing more work than the Razor too, so I can live with this given the great price $79.95 and no contract.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice, budget phone", "Author": "Yurek", "ReviewID": "R3EZU321LAHTZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a Android smartphone for my trip to Europe. I chose this phone because: it was pretty affordable and the company was near (NYC).When the package arrived I was extremely happy that the phone turned out to be pretty small. The screen and the layout of the keys is just perfect. I have to admit I like the phone much more than my Bionic when it comes to size and ergonomics.The overall quality is at least satisfactory if not good. The LCD performs pretty well in the sun. The screen is responsive. The speaker is pretty loud although a little on a muted side (the Bionic has much more trebled sounds). The talk quality is good.The only drawback is the battery life (fully charged in the morning, discharged by 11pm after like 30 mins. talktime, few txt msgs., some browsing the web over the 3G as well as GPRS and EDGE). But - you can live with it if you do not use the handset too much.

I was drawn to the Avail because it offers the android experience at a very affordable price, especially outside of a contract.  However, the low-grade hardware in the phone really limits the OS's ability to perform.  Most of the apps ran slow and there was constant struggles with internal memory vs. sd memory.  The basic features of the phone worked fine such as texting, email and calling, but if I wanted a basic phone I'd pick one up for $20 off amazon.  I think my disappointment stems from the fact that I had high expectations because of the android OS but neglected the fact that it was only $105 (at the time I bought it).  At that price of course they can't include top of the line hardware and the best android experience around.  So you get what you pay for.

The touch screen is responsive, the phone is pretty quick and easy to learn to use, and the battery life seems very reasonable. My one complaint about this phone is the internal memory, and the amount of bloatware that comes with the phone. By this, I mean games you'll never play, and apps you'll never use that you CANNOT remove. They hog all of the internal memory, and you can't move them to your SD card. I have installed a few apps onto my ZTE avail, and moved as much over to my SD card as possible...but I still have a huge list of updates on all the standard apps that needs doing that I cannot do because my phone is out of internal memory. It wouldn't be such a problem if the phone didn't start running slowly when you start using most of the internal memory. I have the suspicion that with the pre-installed bloatware apps, if they were all to update, it would eat up most (if not all) of the phone's memory. With any extra apps you're doomed. Doooooomed. I'm having to entertain the notion of getting my tech savvy husband to root the phone so I can delete uno and google docs, and all the other crappy apps I will never use.Also, as a minor complaint, I was getting a lot of launcher crashes that was making my phone unresponsive in the first few days. I tried several different launchers from the android market, but eventually found the cause to be a widget I had installed for either weather or time. Since I removed those two, not a single problem. If you start having crashes, ditch the widgets.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Teresa Moore", "ReviewID": "R3S5PWJJSMPJMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these phones for my boys in place of getting them a wi fi enabled mp3.

My wife has a ZTE Z990 that we purchased from AT&T; for use with their GoPhone service.  We have owned the phone for over a year and we contacted AT&T; to ask them to unlock it.  They would not.  I also contacted several online services to find out about unlocking it and none of them could.So instead of trying to unlock her phone, I bought this phone through Amazon, unlocked.  It was $89, when I bought it and the price is even lower now.  We have used it on a trip to Jamaica with a SIM card from LIME and it worked perfectly.  I also used it as \"cellular modem\" with my computer using PDANet from June Fabrics and it worked great.  The required USB driver is installed on the phone, just plug in the USB cable.Yes, the phone has an older version of Android, version 2.3 but it is perfectly functional. It also only supports 3G.  It does have limited memory, but I bought it to use as a phone and cellular modem and for minimal web browsing, not to download applications.  The screen is small but bright.  I did not have any the problems with short battery life that others have complained about.I highly recommend this phone for others who are traveling out of the country and are looking for a high quality, inexpensive, unlocked smart phone.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works", "Author": "SNOWMAN \"SNOWMAN\"", "ReviewID": "R3A1BA68FFAGDF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have not tested on other than AT&T.;  But, as a basic smartphone, it works.
