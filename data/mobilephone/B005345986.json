{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LIKE A MOODY PORSCHE", "Author": "E. Brown \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R2I24GGMXVWUBF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There's a lot to love - fast multi-tasking, large screen, 7 home screens and the overall feel, but I've run into a few disappointments as well.To be fair, most folks will only use this device for social networking, web browsing and casual photos. You will find some hiccups & occasional bugs. For those of you power users who actually make videos, download movies, run lots of apps at once and use the power that it has to multi-task, you will see Sensation shine. It's almost better at high speeds.DUAL-CORE MULTI-TASKING: Impressive. You can leave the browser open in the midst of playing a video, open Angry Birds, open music player, video player, Google Earth & pan about - all at once, then hop between these power-hungry apps with barely a hiccup. Hardcore multi-tasking will neither tax nor crash this device. Very impressive. The dual core doesn't make the unit faster than a 1.2ghz single core. It simply allows it to maintain 1.2 ghz speeds on more than one task. Impressive, but don't expect magic.As for speed, HTC's heavy Sense 3.0 user interface makes the phone less snappy than other dual core units. Not so much of a lag, just less snappy. Sense takes up 3 of the 4gbs of onboard memory. I run into more hiccups during everyday use, than when I'm doing heavy multi-tasking. However, Sense 3.0 is so glam, it makes *every* other phone look dated.For the record, you can't close an app w/in the app. You must open up still another app (task manager) to close them. A bit of an annoyance, but seeing as Sensation can handle quite a few, it's no big deal... unless you're shooting in 1080p. More on that below.CAMERA: Mixed bag. Camera is good. Video recording is quite good & realistic in 720p. If you're shooting yourself, however, the video camera is actually pretty bad. It takes a bit of luck & know-how to press the on-screen record button & have the camera focus on where you will stand. It's almost worthless for recording yourself for YouTube. What's more, Sensation can barely handle 1080p. You'll surely have to close every other app to shoot in 1080p & reboot if you wish to watch it right after. Sensation is more at home w/ 720p HD.The \"stereo\" recording is a joke. Of my five smartphones, this phone is the worst at recording sound. It plays back in quiet staccato - HD look, LD sound. I still use my non-HD phone for recording videos of myself. It's like buying a Benz but having to tow an old Honda behind for reliability and the basics. Buying an HD device & still having to use a basic one just for decent sound? Really?As for video editing, you can only trim. You can't merge or overlay music/text like my 'dated' Symbian can. You'd think a high-end, 1080p recorder w/ 'stereo' sound would come w/ decent editing software. I feel ripped off. Android doesn't offer any decent video editor apps either because Androids have issues of fragmentation. If you'd like an Android phone that trims, merges & overlays text, the Samsung Galaxy S2 does. No Android video editor is as robust as iPhone or even Symbian, though.CONNECTIVITY: I haven't had a problem with 'death grip'. The Sensation manages to hold its WiFi connection no matter how I hold it. However, I cannot program the browser to open w/ WiFi. On my 'dated' Symbian, I hold '0', the browser opens, WiFi connects, page loads - one step. This is the kind of engineering I'd expect from a high-end device.The phone cannot be programmed to automatically accept bluetooth files from my computer. If I bluetooth photos to Sensation from the next room, I must stop what I'm doing, go to the phone, scroll down & click to allow each file to transfer. My 4-year old Symbian can be programmed to automatically accept files w/o interruption. This 'super phone' requires more steps.I live in one of T-Mobile's 4G regions. The connection is strong and fast, even when downstairs. A pleasure.Sensation used to allow me to upload directly to YouTube, then it changed its mind. I Googled the issue, and it's a fairly common Android problem. This, along w/ poor sound recording, no video editing & problems trying to push on-screen record whilst having the camera focus on me, makes for a very disappointing experience for anyone making YouTube videos, or simply self-vids.CALENDAR: A bit convoluted & requires a lot of steps, but offers many options. Synching with other calendars can be tricky because their alarms don't always register.SYNCH: Think twice before synching with your Gmail account. Android will add, not just your personal contacts, but *every*... single... person you've *ever* emailed, along with their photos, MSN, Facebook, Twitter & personal info. One, big, convoluted mess of folks I've emailed once years ago, old appointments, duplicate contacts. Android will have Google invading every corner of your life & being. Can be a curse or a blessing. I suggest cleaning up your Gmail account before synch.WEB BROWSER: The browser is great, but it crashes on me more than I'd like. I am a heavy user, mind you. I recommend downloading Dolphin Browser HD. It's free, is better with tabs, and bookmarks are one slide away. It has never crashed on me and, **unlike most Android programs, it offers the option of 'minimizing' *or* completely exiting it *and* clearing the cache at once.**SPEAKER: Simply too quiet for phone calls and music, even w/ all settings turned up. Big minus for me. 'Angry Birds' plays very loudly, though.GLITCHES & BUGS - Quite a few: Sensation randomly assigns my personal photos as album art on most of my music. I don't know why it chooses these particular photos. Sometimes it downloads random artists like Nat King Cole as art for Moloko. I don't even have Nat King Cole. There are a few YouTube vids about this, so it wasn't just mine.At one point, my lock screen was only half of the screen. Another time, Sensation rebooted and came back to life w/o the icons for apps installed on my memory card. The apps are still there, but the icons were replaced w/ the Android bot. Nothing too serious, but surely a bit moody. It performs much more smoothly when you're working it. It seems to prefer working in dual-core mode, so take it to task, use what it has, treat it like a Porsche.ERGONOMICS: It looks & feels expensive - muted, matte, mocha-grey look, that shiny ear piece grill and a screen so large & user interface so slick that iPhone-users always remark. The curved back and narrower screen, make for a good fit for such a large phone. The glass curves slightly upwards to protect the screen when laid down. I love attention to detail.The earphones are made for Dumbo, however, - pretty large & uncomfortable. The charging cord is short & stiff so it limits range of motion. I use an extension cord.iPHONE USERS: Unlike the iPhone, Android phones are extremely customizable. They aren't simply app trays. So, they require a bit more set-up which can be frustrating for those who are used to out-of-the-box fun. The reward is a customized experience with widgets, multiple homescreens & more. Getting every program & setting to correspond and synch isn't always so fun, however. To this end, Android may initially frustrate iPhone users who are used to nothing but squares on their screens. If they don't mind a little set-up & confusion in the beginning, they'll be rewarded with a much more personalized, high-tech & customizable device than the iPhone. Sometimes the glitches & bumps are a bit frustrating for a first-time user.iPhone is like a Lexus - smooth, slick, quiet, efficient. You can't choose gears; you can't hear or feel the engine shift. A fairly dependable, bland & seamless experience. You get in and enjoy a nice prefabricated ride. iPhone is sort of the tract home of high-end devices. It's an app tray & the operating system is an app launcher.Androids are like BMWs. You choose your own gears, you feel & hear the engine rev and shift. You feel more bumps in the road. You get in and manipulate the machine. If you can't drive a stick, you might be a bit frustrated whilst learning.Neither is better. There is a market for Bimmers & Lexuses. Though, iPhones do feel rather basic & low-tech when compared to high-end Android devices, but the iPhone is *much* more consistent, far less buggy. Androids can be like PCs - freezing, lagging, rebooting, etc. Comparing the two is like comparing a sedan w/an SUV. The SUV won't ever be as smooth as the sedan, because it does so much more. Conversely, the sedan can't do a fraction of what the SUV can do, but it's buttery smooth.CONCLUSION: In two week's time, this $600, dual core, HD Android \"super phone\" has proven to be gorgeous, impressive, great for web browsing, apps, 720p recording/viewing and all with wonderfully customizable home screens. When it comes to multi-tasking, customization & tricked-out interfaces, Sensation basically KICKS BUTT! It purrs right along. ...It has also proven to have questionable recording qualities, be sporadically glitchy & inconsistent at times. Sure, iPhone 4 users are walking around w/stickers on their phones so they won't drop calls, but there are far more glitches w/ this device than with an iPhone.This is no finely-tuned V6. It's a somewhat temperamental V12 with a large screen, fly user interface, bling factor, HD, Android apps, 7 home screens & a thirst for tasking. ...but, yes, I still wish it was a little less moody with the basics & I wish the sound recording was on par with the visual.UPDATE: Ultimately, I returned Sensation for Samsung's Galaxy S2. It's far less buggy, can handle 1080p and records better sound.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Absolute Beast!", "Author": "Robert P. Seaton", "ReviewID": "RBZQI94U4UQH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome! It has a 4.3 inch screen, which is gorgeous for watching video/TED talks/etc on, but it's definitely not bulky. In fact, it's even thinner than the iPhone 3G that I owned previous to this, even though it has a larger screen. It has an aluminum frame, so the phone definitely doesn't feel cheap, like all plastic devices.Battery life is pretty solid, depending on what you're doing. For some reason, taking pictures and filming video really drains the battery, but for stuff like just browsing the web, battery life is great.The screen is really great, qHD resolution. Like I mentioned earlier, great for watching video. The 16:9 display ratio means you can watch widescreen movies without pesky black bars taking up space. The screen is bright enough that you can use it in direct sunlight. The viewing angles on it are kind of so-so, but that only really matters if you are trying to share your phone with someone (and why would you want to share this beauty.)Call quality is nice and crisp, very loud and clear. Definitely easier to hear calls on than my cousin's iPhone.The 4G speeds are blazing fast. Web pages definitely load faster than on my previous iPhone 3G and downloading apps is a snap.The 8 megapixel camera takes great pictures, although a little blurrier than a dedicated camera. One big difference between this phone's camera and my old iPhone's camera is that this phone actually takes a picture when you want it to and not five seconds later! On some pictures that I took I had to adjust the color balance, but I imagine that you'll need to do that on any camera that's in a phone. The flash is pretty good, too, and not too bright where it looks harsh.Video recording is gorgeous in 1080p, although it uses the battery pretty quickly. I mostly use it to take video of my cats, and it does an excellent job capturing a whole range of motion: jumping, pouncing, swiping, etc. Sound quality is decent, too.Altogether, this phone is a beast, with a 4.3\" screen, qHD resolution, 4G, a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor. A HUGE upgrade from my iPhone 3G and I'm definitely happy with my purchase. Now, back to playing Angry Birds (and everything else I can throw at it)!", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "DirtRider \"I like to play in the dirt\"", "ReviewID": "R2X1MBIT2TKTHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Short and Sweet Skinny:Pros:Super fast at everythingNo single core device can even remotely compete (no Evo 4g, no Galaxy S, no iphone4, nothing)Absolutely gorgeous screen and glassGreat battery lifeNO problems with RAM (NONE)Light but not toy-likeFits in pockets just fineOptimized for HD viewingTakes HD vidoes amazinglyTakes Wonderful photosHTC Sense 3.0 is pretty good (but resource heavy)Benchmark monsterCons:Fit and finish isn't as good as I thought it was gonna beSpeaker is on the softer sideSense lauch bar has aliasing (booo!)Read more!I am coming from a T-Mobile G2 at 1.9ghz and I thought that phone was amazing and couldn't be topped in speed. I am running Cyanogen Mod nightlies and that G2 FLYS.  I got the Sensation simply because I can and the first thing that I noticed was how completely smooth and fast EVERYTHING is.  It is definitely a benchmark beast in it's stock form, as it gets 130's in linpack.  Quadrant isn't set up for multithread so the sensation only scores 2300s. That is still pretty good for benchmarking one cpu core in perhaps the most hostile environment for android: HTC Sense.The phone takes amazing videos however, the sound recording capability is subpar. I still give this phone 5 stars as NO PHONE is good for that. NONE. (WHY???) Unlike the G2, the external hardware is not amazing but average with the exception of the beveled gorilla glassed screen. It is fantastic and LARGE. The beveled glass is just so classy.  The front camera works but looks like poo but they all are. OH! For some reason, the Sense launch bar at the bottom has a lot of aliasing on it. Tsk tsk, HTC.  Why did you simply upscale the existing package instead of optimizing it for the 16:9  4.3\" screen?I have had side by side comparisons to the following devices all of which belong to my friends and my G2.HTC Evo 4G (stock)HTC Evo 4G @ 1.2ghz(Cyanogen latest nightly)HTC G2 @ 1.9ghz (Cyanogen latest nightly)Samsung Epic 4G (stock)Motorola Droid X (stock-ish)Nook Color @ 1.2ghz (Cyanogen latest nightly)Galaxy Tab Wifi (stock)Acer Iconia A500 (stock)iphone 4 (stock)With the exception of the Acer Iconia, which is also a dual core device, the Sensation smashes everything else in opening and closing apps, download speeds (I get 15-22mbs download speeds on  Tmo's \"4G\" network here), menu movement and navigation, browsing, screen look and feel, responsiveness and battery life.When this phone's bootloader is cracked and the Cyanogen team works their magic, I anticipate a 1.8-2.0ghz dual core Ultimate Monster.  So many people are like \"it's not about specs anymore\". Um...yes it is and it will ALWAYS be about specs. It's been that way since specs were created. Those who disagree are always on the losing side of them.  The \"it's not about specs\" argument is nothing new. It goes back hundreds if not thousand of years. Sorry, Evos and iphone4s and Droid X's and such are great devices but they are OLD and SLOW and simply cannot compete with all these new dual core devices coming out.This phone completely boots in 8 seconds. Angry birds opens up in 2-3 seconds. Pictures snap quickly are are beautiful. The speaker is a little soft but I kind of like that now.  I am so completely turned off by annoyingly loud ringtones.Is this phone perfect? no. is it better than pretty much everything else out there? In my opinion, hell yes and this is only the beginning.  As development continues, I anticipate great things :)I have had absolutely no problems with this phone whatsoeverI have had only a good experienceEven though I feel that the G2 has a much better \"feel\" in my hand with it's amazing Sony super LCD screen, hefty construction and hardware keyboard,  the Sensation is just that: Sensational.  They picked a good name. They really did and I love it.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "great phone!", "Author": "yuval", "ReviewID": "RE5RV5TFLODAT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this is the phone i wanted, and i would have gave this product 5 stars if it came like i wanted.the shipping was fast, within a week FedEx calls and tell me that a package will be at my house the next morning, and that i need to sign it.about the phone, its great, fast, cheap, and one of the first phones of this new generation phones, therefore it will last long before i will need to replace, perfect buy for someone like me that isnt intrested in a contract, still getting used to cause i used iphone for the past 4 years.the phone also came with 8 gb class 4 (kingston) memory card, which i did see in other sites but not on this page, so i bought 16 gb mc just in case, so its great.now if you are looking for an unlocked device, this is not.its T mobile's htc and it even comes in their box and has the logo under the glass,above the screen and ofcourse tmobiles rom.the phone isnt unlocked, works only for tmobile, when you insert another sim it asks you to enter a password which the seller did not provide, after a long frustrating week with many calls, i was lucky enough and got T mobile to unlock it for me, because my friend is on t mobile.if you buy this phone you probably need it unlocked cause otherwise you would have bought it with a cotract from a network, or even live in another country and bought it cause it is cheaper on amazon.the seller did not contact me back so far, all through i managed to get it unlocked, if he will answer back i might change the review, but just letting you know, this is not unlocked, and if you are not on t mobile or have a way to unlock it, its a brick, might as well use at as a door stop.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "A. Smith \"electronics master\"", "ReviewID": "R2MQCAH1E3JUFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, this review might be an \"exaggeration\" to everyone's mind, but that's because my standard were so low, its impossible (i just upgraded from a Motorola milestone) so far this phone has been nothing but helpful to me. The battery lasts a whole day, 4G works wonderfully, the 1.2GHz processor doesn't have 1 second of lag, the screen is much better than the iPhone 4's retina display in my opinion *don't hate me all you apple fan-boys* its got the best camera I've seen on a cellphone, and its quite comparable to my CANON EOS REBEL XS. It may not be better than a full on DSLR, but its almost that good. I also like how it feels in my hands, its very light too and surprisingly not thick at all in my pocket. The fact its got HTC Sense 3.0 UI, makes the phone so much more fun to look at, and i can barely turn it off. When i show off my phone everyone says \"Ah, i wish i had that phone\" even all the iPhone users, and other android users.Now this is the part that everyone will go frown at, the speaker is pretty pathetic AT THE BEGINNING, you just need to burn in the speakers (i learned this through jlabs), it actually helps very much if you play songs or high to low frequencies for an hour a day at medium volume, and it gets better over a week. Another thing is the DEATH GRIP, this sounds terrifying, but the fact is, when you put a case on it (barely $2) it gets you at least 1 more bar. The death grip is eventually non existent when you get to a spot with full 4 bars, it will always stay 4 bars unless you try to lose a bar. Another thing is the battery - it lasts about a day, which for some is bad  but for me, i like the fact it lasts a whole day (7am-11pm) *my milestone barely lasted 3 hours* but that problem can be solved by buying an extended battery (1900MHz cost about $10 which is amazing compared to my milestone's extended battery -$60, which was also a bigger battery, the 1900MHz is the same size as the original, and according to reviews it adds a whole extra 6 hours, which i doubt it does) pros: android 2.3.31.2ghz DUAL COREgiant screenlag? no such thing awesome camera 1080p at 30fps and 8mp camera comparable to dslr good 4g speeds, barely drops to 2g love the sense UIvery thin and barely weighs anythingGORILLA GLASS FTW.not an apple product :plooks very good quality-stupid a few times without a scratch cons: has a death grip in 1 tiny spot THIS DOESN'T KILL THE WHOLE CONNECTION. It only lowers it 2 to 3 bars, barely ever hold it like that, but its knownbattery life is pretty bad, but it lasts a whole day, so i am good with it *problem with tmobile not the phone* - 4g didn't work for a whole day and had to call customer support to fix itmy only concern was the price, its quite expensive, but you know how they say \"you get what you pay for\", in this case, its the best of the best for a usual price.Update 1.24.12After 4 months of use, the phone does wear down quite a bit, the connections are spottier, and there's a little more lag than before.the battery still lasts a whole day, my only concern at the moment Is Tmobile.not the phone, the 4g plan seems like a scam.they say it's unlimited4g, but slowed after a limit? I couldn't even call the\"slowed 4g\" up to the speed of g, never mind edge or 3g.if you can get a phone on a different service,I would recommend that.in my opinion, the galaxy s2 hits every spot HTC missed, except sense ui and design.If you're a hacker, and want to root your phone, beware if you root your phone, it's very difficult to undo without deleting all your data on your phone (which is required anyways).also the update that supposedly fixes touch screen problems, and security didn't work unless your phone is unrooted.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "They sent me to BRANDED TMOBILE version (Z710A not Z710E)", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "R327CWCLWVQ2QF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First thing I noticed when I opened the UPS box was that it came in a Tmobile Box.

HTC should step up, recall and fix the issue immediately, instead they are playing a hide and seek.This issue could have ended up far worse if the battery got even hotter and caused a fire, which is definitely plausible.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE FOR THE TIME BEING.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really Low Speaker", "Author": "Ofir", "ReviewID": "R3M2I4HMDUHTFN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have the Sensation a month now.The device is great and working well.

I've had to RMA 2 of them, 3rd one broke and I just said the hell with it.The first time was the screen developing black lines. The second was the worst, that was when the microphone would intermittently stop working. Was talking to my cousin about a very important issue and suddenly stopped working. The last problem seems to be an issue for many people. At least so said other people on the internets. Another kicker was when I went to go rent a loaner phone, because I could not call tech support. The representative that I talked to using the loaner phone, informed me that all I could do is get another malfunctioning phone (another HTC), so said fine, got the third. They also recommended that I get a backup phone. I went out and bought a T-Mobile 665 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile), so lovely of lovelies, I had to carry that HTC & the damn that I bought at a Walgreens for 25$, so if the HTC malfunctions again I can do back surgery and yank out the sim & sd card. Which I did have to do.Third time it fell a small way and cracked. That was just after 2 am at an ER where I was just mistreated to boot. Had to walk 3 blocks sick with chills to a CVS to use the courtesy phone. Considering the circumstances when I left my apartment I did not have the backup phone. No dropping with prior phones or water damage with anyEven when it did \"work\" it did so badly. Quite often it would crash when dialing and return me to menu screen. That combined with microphone wonking out makes calling 911 a nightmare. 9-1-closes to menu. Yes that did happen. That is after the ring to unlock the phone finally worked. Same issue on all 3 replacements.Another big problem was the battery because it drained faster than a popped water balloon. Had to plug it in pretty much every time I put the phone down. I didn't leave apps running, or talk for hours on end either.One minor issue I had too was the weak speaker. I couldn't really hear any video or audio that was played even if it was pressed against my ear and volume maxed.Anyhow avoid this phone. It could cost you your life.

I will tap on the letters but nothing actually gets typed. And this has been ever since I got it but it has a really crappy speaker. My friend's Gravity T phone's speakers was way louder. Also I don't understand why so many people say that the battery life is good! If I play Temple Run for five minutes then the battery drains at least 10%. And half of the time when I quit out of an app my phone randomly restarts itself. If you are looking for a really good smartphone that will last you a long time then I suggest you just get an Iphone. I would rather have AN Iphone 3 than the Sensation. And if you aren't a huge fan of Apple the you should just get the Galaxy S 2 or 3.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely a nice Android smart phone", "Author": "Mama from PA", "ReviewID": "R1KYP1PLGGLIWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has a very solid and durable feel and has nice display and menus.

The screen is beautiful and the perfect size. It is very responsive to touch. The raised glass at the edges is a nice touch as well.  I have only had physical keyboards before this phone and I was a little worried about the on screen keyboard.  I have had no problems with it at all.  I use the internet all the time and have not had it crash once, not once! there are a few reviews on here that complain about it may be user error or some other apps they have downloaded interfering with the browser.  The camera is great for a mobile phone. It's pretty good in low light and focuses instantly. I wish it was around 5 MP though, I don't need cell phone pics that take up a large amount of space. NO cell phone is going to replace a regular camera in the near future. the sensor size is just too small. The same goes for video. It's great to have for fun and if you forget a regular camera but I wouldn't rely on any cell phone to replace a camera for these purposes.  This is the fastest phone I have seen. Everything is near instant.As with any smartphone the battery life is not the best, it depends on what you are doing... i.e. angry birds and gps.  The only negative would be the speakerphone.

Think about you have an emergency, you pick your phone and its off!! It happened to me when my wife was in ER!!-Sometimes battery discharges more than 50-60 percent in 1 hour!-I can't install many of the apps because phone crashes! I thought its because of the app but when I checked the reviews people didn't have any problems with their phones.-Even though it has 8mp camera it doesn't focus, I can't take clear pictures.-It soft restarts itself when I quit apps (even built-in ones) and phone becomes unusable for about a minute.-If you listen to music with your phone forget it with this phone, its battery dies in 6-7 hours and you have to charge it during the day.-Sometimes when charging it heats a lot, I can barely touch it.-Its speakers are awful. You can't hear anything from this phone's speakers.I would use my old Ericsson A1018 instead of this phone. I never had this much of problems with any other electronic device in my entire life.Their customer service is awful too. I wrote to them many times to have a solution but they only say they are very sorry to hear that and suggest me to uninstall applications!!! What is the point of having an Android phone if I cannot install apps!!There are many other phones in the market, don't buy HTC, look online for reviews first before you buy.
