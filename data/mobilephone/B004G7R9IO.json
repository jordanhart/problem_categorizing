I have read previous reviews of how it doesn't support internet even in 3G, or that the picture messaging does not work. I have used the web browser in normal service with only 2 bars before. While extremely slow, it does work, so I really don't know where the \"not working in 3G\" came from.

With that being said this phone really doesnt have anything special about it but its keyboard.It has a nice camera which you can edit pictures in, but because you are not able to send or receive files with photos/videos its kinda pointless. Good touch screen calibration, very responsive. Keyboard is simple and is big enough that you dont have your fingers press two buttons at once. Battery life is amazing as it can last a  week without dying, even after a year of use.However this phone does turn off on occasions randomly, or freezes. If it freezes you just have to put it on charger and it'll unlock.You can put music on this phone but you will need to buy other items to install the music.Another thing is that some At&t; stores give you this phone for free if your contract is expiring, so look for that.Overall this phone is good for texting and nothing else really.

Also, it had the previous owner's crap everywhere. Their contacts and messages and pictures were still on the damn phone! When I called AT&T; to talk about fixing the internet situation, they said it wasn't even an AT&T; phone so there was no way to get around it. I knew it was unlocked and AT&T; / T-Mobile ready but I hadn't realized it was either service provider's phone. I kept seeing Fido pop up so I googled what that was and it's some other phone service provider so now I get no internet or media messages as long as I have this phone.

It is also a very durable phone, which is surprising considering how small and light it is.  I work in a lumberyard, and I always have my phone on me.

Upon receiving the phone and activation with ATT, everything was great... until my mom tried to send me a picture message. tried sending one to myself and got an error message. called ATT customer care and tried to see if there was a way to relock it to the network, nope. so I just spent over $100 on a crap phone with no warning about data issues concerning picture, audio, or video messages because its completely unlocked and no way to fix it back. thanks for the heads-up guys. Maybe you should actually include that in the description? Would save you bad ratings and angry customers. Just saying.
