Abouseda", "ReviewID": "R3N1102YIPJHI6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just opened the box and loaded it up with 2 sims.  So far the reception isn't very good.  I live in an area that has weak to no service anyway but compared to all my other phones that show 1-2 bars and this dual sim phone doesn't show any bars no matter where I stand indicates not very good antenna.  The real test will come when I am in an area with good service.From what I can tell both sims work at the same time so the phone should be able to receive calls on either sim without me having to enable one over the other like a lot of dual sim phones require.I will update as I get more experience.update:: the above review was before i was in an area that i could be sure the phone was getting reception at all.  it turns out the phone was faulty and didn't ever get reception on either SIM.  i never successfully sent or received a call on either SIM.  i returned the phone right away.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Dual SIM phone\nLong lasting Battery\n2G Network - GSM 900 / 1800 - SIM 1 & SIM 2\nStereo FM Radio\nHeadphones in the box", "Name": "Nokia Nokia 101 Dual SIM Music Phone (Unlocked) - Phantom Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDxEPFNoL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005W3HP26"}}
