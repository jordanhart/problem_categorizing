I have had nothing but good luck with it so far. I would recommend it to anyone whose looking for a pretty good phone and doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg for quality. Im a basic texter and don't play any games so I wouldn't know how it would do under those conditions. But mine works great to access the internet, make calls and text. Again, so far so good.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good customer support on this purchase.", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1Q09K98C2Y4CL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to some misleading descriptions on GSMArena and Amazon I purchased this phone believing  it was a dual sim model. The vendor immediately offered a full refund and corrected the misleading advertising. Since then I purchased the identical \"dual sim\" S6812 model from BREED and I am very happy with this phone. I will do business with BREED the next time I purchase a phone.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C9D9P20"}}
