I've been a BlackBerry user for years, as I'm partial to opposable thumb typing on an actual keyboard.  Sadly, I stopped using this phone after 2 days and reverted back to my tried and true BlackBerry Bold.  The Curve 3G 9300 is noticeably lighter and smaller than the Bold and the battery life is a bit better, but the advantages stop there. The device looks and feels cheaply made.  The screen cracked the first day I got the phone-- I have no idea how.  I didn't drop it or bash it into a brick wall, although I was tempted.  Half the screen turned purple after whatever nanoscopic impact caused the crack.  But the Achilles Heel of this phone is the optical trackpad.  It's either completely non-responsive or spastic, which makes scrolling through e-mail, what should be an idle, painless activity, a major hassle.  I tried adjusting the vertical and horizontal trackpad sensitivities to no avail.  The other frustrating \"feature\" worth mentioning is that the screen is smaller than the Bold, so that when the phone is locked, the lock message obscures the little orange icon displaying the number of new e-mails in the top center of the screen.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 9300 Curve 3G Order from Worldwide Distributors", "Author": "Mila Balquin", "ReviewID": "R27SRB6QWLBD5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item ordered was well-packed and it arrived on time.

I bought my first one and it was a counterfeit phone from China, so was the second. Both of them were described as brand new. This is how you recognize a fake phone. I hope it'll help in somehow.1. All of the labels out side of the box are miss-printed, words and numbers are not clear. The REAL ONE comes with a very clear and well-printed.2. For those of you that had used BB before, you can tell the fake phone fell very cheap and light. The REAL ONE will felt very solid in hand as well as it is pretty heavy.3. In side the fake phone, labels in side the back(behind the battery) are also miss-printed some words, and also not clear. In the REAL one, all of the words are well-printed and that the MUST.4. Turn on the phone and try move the little touch pad in the middle of the phone. If you have a fake phone, it is very hard to move the cursor up and down, (sometimes left and right but mostly up and down). In the REAL ONE, you can easily move it any where you want and it almost no delay at all.Lastly, sorry for my bad English if I make any mistake. I had seen so many people blamed BB for bad products but the real problem is we are not using the real BB, we are using some bull @#% from China.I rate this phone 4 stars because I had used it before and still using it.

I am delighted that it worked with AT&T; 3G bands.I must say that I missed the keypad and it's been a wonder and huge relief to have physical feel on the typing, certain very assuring feel.  Also Blackberry 6 is definitely a nice update (device not supported by Blackberry 7) and a huge difference from my old Curve back in Feb  2009 when I last had it.  The menus and executions are fast and the aesthetics of the OS are polished--pleasing if that is what others would say although I didn't load it up with tons of apps as it is only a temporary device.  It has Vlingo - Siri's BB counterpart, not as intelligent as Siri but does the job.  I don't do socials very much so I didn't care about FB, Tweeter and social feeds although its got a unified social feed status.The track pad is very responsive, unless your finger is wet or oily, then you need more skin traction.The Blackberry Desktop for Mac is one that i love very much.  My Mac address book (not icloud, local address book), and calendar entries synced without a glitch.Keypad is still here to stay I guess.Just some thoughts about setting up BIS and for those with $30 Data Unlimited iPhone Plan:I initially had problem setting up the BIS because the device is not recognized by the network as this unit from Amazon is unlocked.  I called AT&T; and reported the IMEI and PIN of the device, rebooted and everything went well, including setting up my AOL email account on the BIS from the phone (does not allow you to setup BIS through your Mac or PC browser--very strange).  My $30 Data Unlimited iPhone plan which I had since Feb 2009 was converted to same $30 Data Unlimited Blackberry plan.

I bought it to Worldwide Distributors, 5 starts for them too as sellers. My only disappointment was that the one I received came with Wind (Canadian cell carrier) logo... but I can live with that.Regarding the 3G, if it does not work in Venezuela (I am venezuelan-living in Caracas) or any other country will be because your local carrier's platform not because the phone is a fraud or so, far from that.In Venezuela for you to have full 3G you should sign contract with Movistar which nowadays is the most advanced platform with 3.5, then Digitel with 3.2 and at the bottom Movilnet which is 2.5... so, if your local carrier is Movilnet you WILL NOT have 3G but 2G still..... so article advertising is correct, I did received what I bought!Bottom line, I am satisfied with the purchase I made and with the seller, again, it was Worldwide Distributors!Saludos y gracias!", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "I have two weecks with", "Author": "Pamelorais", "ReviewID": "R1WBY2K74P69JY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recive the product before that they say in the beginning, is a good product.
