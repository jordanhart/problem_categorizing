Note 2 is still really good and the SIM restrictions that are surfacing in Note 3 really makes Note 2 a great choice now. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones and probably does not apply to majority of people.Regarding the SIM unlock or regional unlock that is surfacing Samsung has clarified. I have confirmed in a model which my friend bought from Europe and activated. It works in T-Mobile in US. I have written more details. I am giving this 4 stars due to all the SIM lock restrictions that are surfacing now and never announced earlier. Otherwise the phone deserves a 5 star.DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has  1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally.

It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. for users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!In my tests for couple of  days, battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I really wish crapware is absent from these phones. People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks. No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display!Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsRegarding regional SIM card restrictions, why such inconveniences? The trick is to put the SIM card from the region that you bought the phone first. I have seen top tech blogs comment as \"Roamers can relax -- Samsung says buyers of its top-selling handsets can freely use SIM cards from foreign regions, as long as they activate the device using a SIM from their home region or with the assistance of a service partner.\" The phone will be automatically unlocked and region free. In other words, if you have the \"American\" version of the phone, as long as you initially activate the phone using a SIM card from within the \"American\" region, your phone will then be fully unlocked. You can then take it abroad, use local SIMs whenever you'd like.  Make sure you ask the person you are buying the phone which region it is and get a SIM of that region or get your local region phone. Of course this is a ***nasty PR situation**** if it is true that you cannot use the phones freely overseas, I will be highly disappointed and will be against Samsung in future. Hopefully this will be clear in next few months. Doing this to an otherwise wonderful phone is ludicrous.  Why did Samsung do it?Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III. I will be glad to answer any questions.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Technical/Hardware Masterpiece", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R3JK6N2RNZVKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I owned the Galaxy Note 2. I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are much much improved.Lets make this review simple and straight to the point, with a few comparisons to other phones:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. And WOW, what a screen it is!There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from the Note 2's 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a lot brighter. This screen has been technically measured to be the brightest screen of any phone, and just now bested by the Samsung Galaxy S5. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(as tested by DisplayMate).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). I can finally use it in the bright sunlight now!* Touch input response is lightning quick. This means when you touch something, it responses nearly instantaneously. It even beats the iPhone 5S, the previous champion, and is only just bested by the HTC One M8.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content! This phone is AWESOME for gaming.3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all - there are literally over 30 features! One of my favorites is the Smart-Stay feature, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle your hand and risk dropping the phone to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app. Also, there are tilt and hand-gesture features for when you want to scroll web pages, emails, zoom in on photos, switch to the next or previous photo or music track, answer a phone call, etc. etc. etc!5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud mono speaker is more useful than having two expansive speakers that space the sound out wider and making it harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use. Although the new HTC One M8 has much improved and louder speakers than the older M7.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly, usually from 20% to full charge in about 2.5 hours. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place. from about 10am to 2am, with heavy usage, I usually end the night at about 30%, which is actually quite amazing since I am on it constantly - phone calls, checking emails, web surfing, checking sports stats and news, and spending hours using my Pulse News app.CONS:*There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. The plastic back nice a nice leathery LOOK, but it is still cheap plastic and feels just like it. Thank goodness most of us cover our phones with cases, so in that aspect it's not a big deal, just that for a $700 phone it should have been made with much better materials and craftsmanship. With rumors of a new Galaxy luxury line, this may be changed very soon though.*The Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. There is a minute, but noticeable lag when you open certain apps or switch between apps with the multi-tasker. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will not satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it in one hang, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative, period. Samsung dominates the phablet market, and that's because this is a nearly flawless multimedia machine with an excellent, crisp, brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and AWESOME battery life.

It is region locked to the Americas. I am serving in western Africa and I do not have access to American networks. For almost 3 weeks I have attempting to unlock my phone. I have rooted and used Region Lock-away with no luck. I have contacted Samsung USA, they tell me I need to contact my carrier. Well, I don\u2019t have a carrier. I called T-Mobile and ordered a SIM card which I got today. Unfortunately, I get a message that says no network found. All my research on the internet has proven fruitless. I have read all the post here and it seems that the SM N900 has a very poor track record for unlocking. At this point, I will have to return the phone and hopefully get a refund.
