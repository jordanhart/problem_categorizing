{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a good phone", "Author": "nkgabo", "ReviewID": "RQ8RNEA304VVF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone last summer and LOVED it at first. It was my first smartphone so I was super excited and it worked very well for a while but then it started giving me problems. My first problem came a few weeks after I got the phone. It started to drop calls when I had all 4 bars (which it still does on occasion) and would tell me I had \"no service\" in locations where I KNEW I had service. So i took the phone to t-mobile and they told me I had to download an update on my device called \"froyo\". When I asked why they couldn't download it in the store for me, the said it was because some phones were having more issues even after they downloaded the update.... but I needed my service back to I took a chance and went home and downloaded the update. But the issues didn't stop there. The phone shuts down randomly, it freezes up easily, when you try to dial out a number it will delay for a while and then decide to dial out the call on its own time. T-mobile loads this phone with apps that you can't remove which takes up space in the phone. You can't have too many apps on this phone because you will continuously get a notification about low phone storage (I tried to download words with friends as well as Draw Something along with 3 other smaller apps I personally downloaded, and the phone gave me a \"low phone storage\" notification, so basically I had to choose which app I wanted to keep between the 2)  Most of the time when you try to text there is a delay, whether you're texting on the touch screen or the QWERTY keyborad. The battery life sucks even with the advanced task killer app. You have to charge your phone by the early evening because it uses up a lot of battery life throughout the day (you can't even leave your phone on overnight without it shutting off because it uses up the battery). Overall this phone just sucks! I would NOT recommend getting this phone, you'd rather spend your money elsewhere on a phone that won't give you all of these troubles.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Manny", "ReviewID": "R28Z6DUGJGTP6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great 3g phone, has a keypad and virtual screen to type, also has a swipe feature which makes texting a lot easier and fast.
