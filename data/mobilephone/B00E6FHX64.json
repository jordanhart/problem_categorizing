{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's the same as a regular Galaxy S4 with a few differences.", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R2N1JWYRJVWQ7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy S4 Active is pretty much identical to the regular Galaxy S4 with a few exceptions. I have a Galaxy S4 that I use as my main phone but I also got the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active yesterday. So there are a few tiny differences between the regular Galaxy S4 and the Galaxy S4 Active. First, it has three mechanical buttons instead of having two capacitive and one physical button that's on the regular S4. Second, the display that's used on the S4 Active is a TFT instead of the regular super AMOLED HD display that's on the regular S4. The TFT display is great with viewing angels but it doesn't have very good dark colors, especially blacks. Another thing that's different is the camera mode that's called aqua mode. When used, it disables the touchscreen from being responsive to prevent it from messing it up. When you are underwater, you have to use the hardware buttons to take pictures. The camera is also 8MP instead of 13MP that's in the regular S4.These are some of the things that that are different from the regular Galaxy S4:Pros:+Display / Screen:The regular Galaxy S4 uses a Super AMOLED HD display but the S4 Active uses a TFT display which has better viewing angles but the blacks are not as good as the regular S4. The AMOLED display that's used in the regular S4 produces better dark colors because it turns off all the black pixels to save battery. Everything else about the display is the exactly same from the resolution (1080 x 1920) to the pixel density (441). It's also using the exact same Gorilla Glass 3 that's on the regular Galaxy S4.+Android OS:The S4 Active ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is exactly the same as the regular S4. You also get the exact same TouchWiz features that's on the regular S4. There's nothing new in the OS from the regular S4 except that the camera has a new mode called aqua mode. Read the next paragraph to find out what it is.+Camera:The camera on the regular S4 is 13MP while in the S4 Active is 8MP. Also, the camera in the S4 Active has an underwater mode (aqua mode) that it warns you that the touchscreen won't be responsive when you are underwater. This prevents the water from messing with the screen and possibly ruining it so that's why it disables the touchscreen. You have to use the hardware buttons to take pictures when you are underwater. When you get the phone out of the water, you have to disable the aqua mode so the screen can start working again. The camera quality feels like it's the same quality as in the S3. The front facing camera is exactly the same (2MP).+Design:The design is exactly the same as the regular S4 but with a few little differences. First, the speaker, camera, headphone jack, volume button and the power button are all in the same place as in the regular S4. In the regular S4, you have the USB port exposed but in the Active you have a rubber door that's designed (obviously) to prevent water getting in. Another thing that's different is that in the regular S4, you have two capacitive buttons and one physical button. In the S4 Active, you have three mechanical buttons that are designed to be water proof.+Battery:The battery is also the same on the S4 Active that's on the regular S4 (2600mAh). Nothing has been changed in the battery department. If you get a great battery life on the regular S4 then you will also get a great battery life on the Active.+Storage:Again, the storage on the Active hasn't changed at all. It's still has the same capacity (16GB but only 9.2GB free space) that's on the regular S4.+Processor:The CPU is also exactly the same that's on the regular S4, Snapdragon 600 Quad-core 1.9 GHz. Nothing has changed in the CPU department as well.+Removable Battery:I wasn't expecting a removable battery on a water proof device but Samsung proved me wrong. I don't know how Samsung can make an amazing phone that has great specs with a removable battery and still be water proof. Samsung really knows how to make them phones!Cons:-None, maybe the camera being 8MP but it's not really a con for me.Overall, if you are someone who is around water a lot then the S4 Active is for you. Even if you are around swimming pools, use your phone out in the rain, or take it in the toilet with you and want to get a phone that will still work even under these extreme conditions then the S4 Active is for you. The phone is overall exactly the same as the regular S4 except for the mechanical buttons, camera mode, 8MP camera and the screen display (TFT). I also like the fact that it has a removable batter which is amazing for a phone that's designed to be water proof.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great idea.  But a flawed product...", "Author": "R. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R1DW49XY0Q86AK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to love the Samsung S4 Active.  I do kayaking, downhill skiing, and a fair amount of bike commuting in sometimes lousy weather.  I think the \"regular\" S4 is among the very best of today's smartphones (along with the HTC One and the iPhone 5), so the idea of a weather-resistant version of the S4 sounded like the best of all worlds for me.  I bought one in July 2013.The problem is that the S4 Active has proved to NOT be dependably water resistant.  My S4 Active got bricked by being on a lawn chair in my yard for an hour when the lawn sprinkler came on.  Android discussion forums show that quite a few other S4 Active owners have had a similar experience to mine. Some tech magazine reviewers have reported the same.I spent many hours in late July at AT&T; retail shops and service centers attempting to get them to replace my water-damaged Active S4, and for two weeks they refused to do so.  So, I went two weeks without a working phone.  After AT&T; and Samsung began getting increasingly frequent bad press regarding the failure rate of water-damaged S4 Actives, they changed their support policy on August 6, 2013.  Water-damaged Active S4's purchased originally at AT&T; retail shops or over the web will be replaced ONCE (and only once) by AT&T.;  After that, no further replacements will be made for you if your S4 Active fails due to water damage.So...I LOVE the updated Android operating system and the overall features of the S4 Active.  But I no longer trust the water resistant marketing claims of Samsung and AT&T; regarding this phone.I sincerely hope that Samsung learns from the unacceptable failure rate of water damage to this \"water resistant\" phone, and comes out with an improved second-generation model that is dependably waterproof under real world operating conditions.  But until then, I recommend getting a \"regular\" Samsung S4 and putting it in a water-resistant case.  The water-resistant and dust-resistant  intentions of the S4 Active are great ideas!  But unfortunately, the current S4 Active is a flawed, first-generation product that cannot be depended upon, IMO, to back up the weatherproof claims.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving the larger screen.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Sci-Fi and Fantasy listener.-\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQW1Y72H7DVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had an Samsung S3 a few years ago but have had a Windows phone (Samsung) and an Iphone 4s in between buying the S4 Active recently. I was really bored with the iPhone so I had planned on switching back to the Windows Phone (I know I'm in the minority but I'm a fan of the tiles) but after seeing the S4 that a friend of my had I was sold. I ended up going with the Active since I tend to take my phone everywhere with me and I would rather not be so worried about getting it wet or spending $250.00 fixing a sensor because of dropping my phone into a cup of coffee as I did with my iphone. So far I really enjoy the user experience with the big screen. It makes viewing movies and internet so much easier and better on the eyes. I've found the touchscreen function to not work quite as well as my iPhone 4s as I seem to have to be more deliberate with how I touch the screen. The default samsung touch keyboard was terrible IMHO as the letters were too far apart and it just seemed stretched. I switched to the google keyboard within the first few days and it's much more efficient as it is very similar to the iphone keyboard but has easier word replacement and seems to figure out my typos better.I don't mind the touchwiz interface as it has tons of functionality and for the most part is intuitive after a little research. I am disappointed that the active can not use the standard S4 cases and it was a pain finding one that I liked (I bought this Diztronic case from Amazon - B00DEQ4QW0The battery life is a disappointment for sure as it is actually worse for the Active than the standard S4 but since the batteries are replaceable and not too expensive that is easy to overcome. I usually get about 4 hours of use before having to recharge but I'm constantly getting email and listening to a book or podcast.I haven't really missed any apps as almost all of my favorites were available on Google Play with the one exception, MailBox, but all of my email is through Gmail so it was an easy switch over to the Gmail App.I'm still playing around with the camera but it seems to take a great picture and although it's only 8mp vs the 13mp on the standard s4 it can take pics underwater in aqua mode so that makes up for the loss I guess. Also, having Instagram like effects is a nice touch in the camera app. The sound quality is really good and on par with the iphone 4s at the very least and probably a little louder.The only other thing I can think of is I did have an experience with the phone getting pretty hot at one point but it has only happened that one time so not sure if it will be an ongoing problem.EDIT: forgot to mention storage. Love that I can add additional storage (up to 64GB) with an SD card. I was always near the near or at my storage limit with my 16GB iphone 4s.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "CTurbo", "ReviewID": "R2HAMQ60WJNA3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband insisted I get this phone since many of my other phones have met a watery death, and I love it.

The Wifi here is even faster than the so called 3G connection that I get from the Infuse(Im not saying the Infuse is a bad phone, for I love it still). The 4G speeds in the S4Active just blew me away! although I hardly use it for I rely alot on free WIFI:). The main selling point for me is the fact that it is battery replaceable and memory upgradeable vs the other powerhouses out there.

I had a 3, love the 4, and I am excited about the 5. I don't need to tell you that the operating system is great, it's fast and intuitive, and the screen feels and reacts like butter, amazing memory. Fantastic. The only internal problem is that the camera is not good. you can't move at all when you take shots and if you zoom in, it's instantly blurry. It doesn't react well to any kind of artificial light. The only way to take \"good\" pictures is with instagram because it filters the flaws.The outside is another story. My boss wanted me to get a \"better phone\" (she's an iphone user) and i choose the Active because i wanted something that could stand up to the heavy use my phone goes through. It was marketed as something more heavy duty and water resistant. Problems. It looks like it's been through the wars much more than my 3 (which my husband now has, and still looks great) with chipped corners and paint, scratches on the back surface (and it's hard to find cases that fit this phone, so it looks ugly or like a giant brick). the little flap that seals the electrical port doesn't stay put 6 months later - it's coming out. That's supposed to help it stay \"waterproof\" so it may now be more susceptible to damage and will likely fall off entirely in a few more months if i don't just cut it off myself out of frustration.I would not get another \"active\" version of this phone. I think the normal ones are just fine and would recommend that over this.

I absolutely love the color and and it does look pretty sharp.I have used an iPhone for just about 4 years and I have to say: there is a huge difference between the two. Using an iPhone is not the same as using a MacBook. It doesn't behave like a computer and at this point of time it can't replace a personal computer (if you are used to rely on one). When it comes to a Windows based phone, it is an actual computer with everything that is good and bad. It can sometimes crash, but it also can be controlled like a typical computer. I have always loved the task manager function (and have greatly missed it since switched to Mac).If iPhone is your best friend, I can guarantee you will be uncomfortable with this phone at first, because the difference is H-U-G-E. However, I have to give it to Samsung guys - they work their hardest to make the switch as painless as possible.SIM Card.Believe it or not, you can use your iPhone SIM with the Samsung Galaxy - just pull it out of one and plug into another one. I even went back and forth few timesSamsung Smart Switch.Free app by Samsung will help you make the switch. Back up your iPhone first and launch the program. Besides moving you personal info and data, Smart Switch will also run through the list of apps: finds compatible Android versions of your Apple apps, suggests to buy those that are paid or download free versions of the same apps. For any applications that are not available by Android, it will suggests similar apps.But why would you really want to switch?If you want more features and more flexibility, Samsung Galaxy has a bucket full to offer and it's Active model has even more.Smart EverythingThis might be a bit freaky, but this phone can follow your movements (I know all s4 do that, but it is new to me)It can scroll your email up and down following your head tilt and flip pages following your non-conctact air gesturesS-BeanThat is what you so in the commercial - touch another phone and share files (as long as you stay in a certain radius)What is so Active about Samsung Galaxy Active?Believe it or not this phone can function under water. Don't plan on going diving with it, but it is capable of working in up to a meter under water up to 30 minutes at a time. It is also perfect beach companion, because it is not a frraid of sand. Note! You have to make sure that you phone's back cover is completely sealed. Double check it before throwing your phone into the fish tankAnything I don't like?I do feel that it is too smart. With so many features and options it probably will take me a while to fully understand itI don't think the voice assist as functional as SiriYou have to make sure the screen is turned off - I have randomly pressed buttons few times while carrying it aroundThe camera lens - make sure to clean it before taking picture. For some reason it gets dirty very easy. I know it should have very good camera, but have made a bunch of lousy pictures because of the dirty lens. (On the good not it has a great set of filters and post production effects and editing tools)", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A lot good and a few bad", "Author": "Asif E Elahi", "ReviewID": "R8FKSCN47VFYT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung galaxy S4 Active [AT&T;]Just got the phone 4 days ago.Need more time but for now just giving a short review.Pros:# Water-proof. It comes handy, believe me or not, gives a lot peace of mind.# Screen looks way better than the Super AMOLED S4 Screen.# Size and shape is better than regular S4 and very handsome.# No Sign of freezing till now.# 2A charger comes with it.Cons:# The camera is bad. Not only bad, its REALLY BAD. They gave 8MP instead of 13MP S4 camera.I had a HTC Titan for 2 yrs and this S4 active takes worse picture than that 2 yrs old phn.

I think this is more of an android flaw but it is exaggerated by the overly sensitive screen of this phone. Even with the high touch sensitivity turned off, it will react to \"touches\" without actually touching the screen, which is also really annoying. I have been using various iPhone models for the last four years, and I returned the galaxy active to go back to my 4s. If you are going to have this phone in your pocket, either make the screen face out, or get a case. That is the only way I could keep it from calling 911. Really really wanted to love this phone but I didn't. Plus, the first day i had it it downloaded almost 1 gig of data in the background and i couldnt figure out where that went. So turn off background data usage for the internet (samsung browser) if you dont want that to happen. Oh and one more thing, even a 2 year old iPhone 4S operates more smoothly through the OS, and in video playback.
