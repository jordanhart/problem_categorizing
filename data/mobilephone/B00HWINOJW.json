The obvious choice would be the Note 3, but its advantages didn't have any value to me. For example, the Note 3 has a higher resolution screen but it's hard to tell a difference even up close. The Note 3 also has a stylus but I rarely used the stylus on my Note 2.So I took at look at the samsung galaxy mega, but that was way too big. I then looked at this, which is exactly as wide as the note 2/3, but a little longer. Still, I hesitated to buy this because the professional reviewers criticized its curved screen, but they were wrong. I can't quite explain why, but the curved screen looks better than the straight screen on my Note 2. The curving creates some sort of visual illusion. It's also easier to hold against your head when talking.One other advantage is that you can physically bend the screen. I tried this at the store with the demo and I bent it a good 5 degrees or so without it breaking. My note 2's screen cracked when I dropped it from four feet and it was expensive to replace, but I imagine this will be less prone to cracking. Huge advantage over the note line.It also has good reception and the sound is better than the note 2. It has a surprisingly good speaker (for a phone).", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "I tried it!", "Author": "Ash", "ReviewID": "R1BIQSPOM4BROS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a Note 2 and thought the Gflex would be an upgrade.
