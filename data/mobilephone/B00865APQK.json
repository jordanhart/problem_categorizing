This phone can also be set up on any network that uses sim cards.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super CUTE!", "Author": "Wendy V Brejot", "ReviewID": "R2643D4CMREC2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros It's Hello KittySmall enough to fit in pocket or a coin purse.Uses a SIM card.Has a hole for charms or a strap.It has WiFi and Blue Tooth capabilities.It runs on Android.It can use a Micro SD card up to 32 gig.Uses a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.It was unlocked.Will work with an American charger.Has a predictive text option.Auto rotation.It's under $200 US dollars.Multiple language options.Will work on American Mobile networks. You just need a little patients and some understanding of how international mobile networks operate.  More on that later.It can be used as a Wifi Hotspot. My Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 3DS XL were both able to connect to it.Has a speaker phone option.Has voice recognition software for searching or taking memos.Swype can be used if you don't like the small virtual QWERTY key pad.American apps will work on this phone.Things that could have been better...2 mega pixcel camera has no dedicated camera button.Radio needs headphones to be plugged in in order to function.I don't know about other people but my phone didn't come with the default Hello Kitty software. It came with the standard software for the regular Samsung Galaxy Y. NO HK power up/down animation. NO HK icons. NO HK wallpapers. NO HK ringtones. Lucky there are a lot of downloadable HK theme sets on the Google Play Market. Some of them are FREE. If you are brave or smart enough you can also root your phone. Or you can download a custom HK rom.Just a little warning for American buyers. This phone is not quite 3G compatible here in the USA. We use a different cell phone radio frequency then Europe and Asia. They use GSM-900 and GSM-1800  but we use  GSM-850 and GSM-1900. Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.  It will connect to American mobile networks but it will use EDGE. There is no software work around for this. This phone just doesn't have the right HARDWARE to pick up American 3G. Since it will only work on EDGE here, internet will be kinda slow. But from my experience calls, text, and e-mail will work normally. If you have access to WiFi, then please use it when ever possible.  I can't call this a con at all. I can't get mad at Samsung or at my provider ATT. Samsung had no idea that we Americans would import this phone. American cell phone service providers like ATT can't be forced to use European/Asian cell phone frequencies. Samsung has also made an official announcement that there will be no more OS upgrades for the Galaxy Y phones. The last upgrade is Android 2.3.6 so if you really want Jelly Bean, you'll have to look around on the net if you can't program a custom OS yourself.Some folks have complained about the small screen size. Not an issue for me. I'm used to the small size of Nintendo DS screens.Some folks have complained about call sound quality. I have not noticed any sound distortion. People I have called say I sound very clear. I can hear them very clearly as well. As for text and messaging issues, contact your provider. Chances are, the APN setting may need tweaking.If you get a SIM card error, just contact your provider. They may be able to transfer your stuff over to a new SIM card for a small fee. Something under $10.Some MUST have accessories. Miss Kitty is a fashionable young lady is she not? XDI have heard that the touch screen of the Galaxy Y is not made of the same material as it's family members. A screen protector will take care of any scratches.A case! There are a few that would look good on this phone and not cover up Miss Kitty's pretty face. Amazon has a clear/frost white TPU gel case. There's a also a clear/frost pink TPU case that look cute too.A stylus! Amazon sells some universal capacitive touch screen styli that would match perfectly. I haven't seen any HK ones but a plain white or pink would go very well with this phone.Amazon also sells a lot of HK themed cell phone accessories like charms, holsters, and straps.If you love Hello Kitty, just take this product for what it is. Don't get all huffy just because it's not a as fast as an American smart Phone, you've been warned!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The unlocked phone is AWESOME.", "Author": "Leland S.

Browsing Amazon for an iPad become a job for a day and suddenly she fell in love with the Samsung Hello Kitty Phone. I wasn't really enthusiastic, especially reading other reviews. So, with the price it was gonna save me money. I ordered and it came fully in a secure package. I opened and I was amazed at how neat the little thing was. I played with it and watch videos on it. It has built in WiFi, 2GB SD card, USB cord, Charger and happy ringtones. Awesome for teens.One good tip: GO TO SAMSUNG KIES AND DOWNLOAD SAMSUNG KIES SO YOUR NEW HELLO KITTY PHONE WILL BE ABLE TO SYNC MUSIC AND PHOTOS.
