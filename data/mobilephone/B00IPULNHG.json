Nothing about this phone is good. The only good thing about it, is its weight. Very light in that aspect, but overall performance is terrible. Do not waste your money. I can't even watch netflix on it, because it only runs on 2G.Ray,  Wv", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great quadcore phone.", "Author": "CINDY BELL", "ReviewID": "R2SIIPED3XXQJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find it very difficult to understand as to how lightahead is able to bring out high end models at lower than lower end models price.This is indeed a fairly well made quadcore phone with great high speed processor,good camera and immense call clarity.The sound is great and set up easy.Having a quadcore processor in a phone makes it a delightful experience as against the frustration and struggle experienced with most Chinese single core processors.The set up is easy and works best with AT&T.;This us vendor rocks. He has definitely created options in the market a big relief from the generic obsolete phones.Oveall great value for money.Super buy", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IPULNHG"}}
