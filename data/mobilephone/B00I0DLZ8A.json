I have not tried videos yet.While on the phone, I have had problems--I hear a beep and my call is gone--not sure what that is about--I make sure to keep the screen away from my face, so I can't believe I am \"ending call\" with my face.

I worked in the cell phone industry and that is why I use pre-paid service. That is all I am going to say about that and I will not respond to questions about that subject.Pre-paid is just a way to separate money from people who don't want to commit, can't commit or want the option to quit when things turn against their favor. With pre-paid you get cut-rate service at a cut-rate price. Those not familiar with pre-paid should know that when you call customer service you will not get a call center that is in the USA.Pre-paid companies were started by the big name cell companies as a way to sell service to everyone, pre-paid companies will cut corners with service to keep their costs low. With Tracfone I suggest creating an online account with them on their official website. From there you can activate new phones, register the phones to your account and transfer your numbers and minutes to new phones you buy without having to call tim-buck-too and speaking with someone that does not understand you very well. Try to do as much as your own problem solving and customer service as you can though their website to avoid their frustrating customer service reps.Review:This phone is Android yes: Cut-rate Android. It is limited to 3G speed for Data on the cell network. If you are expecting state of the art you had best go straight to the service providers like Sprint or Verizon and buy a phone there. There is a wall charger and usb cable included. The usb cable can be connected to the wall charger and phone to charge the phone or the phone and computer to charge the phone or transfer files like mp3 music to the phone.It has a single core 1ghz processor. It is not fast enough to run fast paced games or even multi-task.The GPS works fine, but slow, with the Google Maps app. A little slow to update changes and position at first but I don't know if this is due to the 3G data speed or the single core processor. It became more responsive as my trip went on. I only tested it once in a Midwestern area with no tall buildings.The Wi-Fi is fast and responsive with impressive range. It will also alert you by chime when you are in a free (unsecured) Wi-Fi area. Be very wary of using unsecured Wi-Fi as man in the middle (where you passwords and user names are recorded) attacks can happen.On mine, it has Internal Storage (for apps and user data) of 2.34GB available to use while a tiny bit is already used from the factory. The task manager app shows 386.31 MB of total RAM, just running factory installed apps I have 114 MB free. Again those familiar with Android know that 512 MB of RAM is pretty much the minimum you would want on a device that will run more than one app at a time with 1 GB or more becoming standard on top shelf phones.This phone comes with an SD card. Mine came with a Toshiba 4 GB class 4 card. The SD card can be used to as additional storage for ringtones, video files, etc. This ZTE Valet allows moving apps to an SD card from Internal Storage. Those familiar with android know some apps can be moved from Internal Storage to SD cards if the programmers of the app allow this and only if it is a program that does not automatically run on startup like the Facebook App, Twitter App or Outlook App do.The camera is low end 3MP. It requires a high amount of light to get photos that are not grainy. Indoors photos looked grainy no matter what I did except for when the subject was lit well from sunlight through a window. The camera is somewhat slow to respond, I don't know if this is because of the camera app or the single core processor. I have seen slower cameras on I-phones and top end Android phones though so all in all it isn't the slowest to respond. When I held the phone really still until I was positive the picture has taken the images had the best results. The camera features a flash but no \"automatic flash\" option. If I want the flash to be used I have to manually turn it on. It is also not a traditional flash but simply a white LED light that illuminates the subject, at close range only, when the shutter button is pressed and continues until the photo is completely taken. In complete darkness the flash had a maximum usable range of 5 feet for me and at that distance only illuminated the center of the photo. The images of faces taken with the flash on looked white washed.A top feature I have not seen before was an option to turn the Data (3g) on and off using the Power Control widget. A one click simple solution that makes this phone the ONLY pre-paid Android to consider. The Power Control Widget on my phone was installed on the first left screen. For those not familiar with Android, swiping my finger from left to right on the home screen reveals this screen. I removed the Android Tips widget from the home screen and moved the Power Control to the home screen to more easily use this option. This option turns off the phones ability to send and receive data over the 3g network thereby stopping any data usage when not on Wi-Fi. Of course you have the option to also turn Wi-Fi off with this widget too.This is a feature sadly lacking in other cell phone companies, so much so that people resort to putting their phone in Airplane mode (all data flow and calls are stopped) when apps like email, twitter and facebook start using too much of their Data plan. I've gotta give it up to Tracfone for this feature. A+ on this! So, if you leave  Data in the off position in the Power Control and only turn it on when you want updates on you accounts (email, twitter, facebook etc.) you can minimize how much data you use. Again I cannot stress how useful this feature is. If you are coming from another pre-paid or traditional cell phone company you may have found yourself exceeding your data plan when your phone was updating your accounts around the clock. On other phones it was possible to positively turn off your data for most apps by turning off Sync but this was often overridden by some apps and also stopped updates from coming through on Wi-Fi.Voice calls are fairly clear with a little bit of an \"overdrive\" or clipping on louder setting. The rear facing single internal speaker produces loud and relatively distortion free rings and music. It is however somewhat easy to block the speaker when placing it down on its back cover (like you normally would) especially on softer surfaces like seat cushions.The issue of \"Minutes\": Those familiar with Tracfone know that most newer standard phones give the buyer triple minutes. That is if you buy a 60 Minute card you get that tripled to 180 Minutes. Text messages on these phone were billed at .3 and more rarely .5 minutes per text.I have only bought my minutes for my ZTE Valet online via the Tracfone website and this is what I can tell you from that transaction. My 60 Minute card got me 180 Minutes of talk, 180 Text messages (incoming and outgoing) and 180 Mb of 3g Data.I cannot give 5 stars to this product because its single core processor, its small amount of RAM and its current price (as of October 14th 2013). Virgin Moble pre-paid (a Sprint company), StraightTalk (a Tracfone and Walmart company) as well as Net 10 pre-paid (a Tracfone company) currently have Android phones with similar tech specs for under $50. Virgin has a $35 a month plan for Android with 300 minutes of talk and \"unlimited data\" a month, StraightTalk has a $45 \"unlimited everything\" a month plan and Net 10 has $50 \"unlimited everything\" a month plan.I did not deduct any stars for the new Minute/Texting pricing model. This phone is not using GSM carriers like previous Tracfones and instead is activated using CDMA carriers. CDMA carriers play by a whole different set of rules than GSM carriers and Tracfone has no control of that. I am almost sure they are the ones moving Tracfone to this different pricing model for Android on the ZTE Valet.Final thoughts:There is not Minute bank display on this or any Android on Tracfone. You must open a web browser like Chrome (via Wi-Fi or 3g) and go to: mobile.tracfone.com You will be asked to enter your phone number. You do not need your serial number. You will, after about 45 seconds, get a text message that does not seem to count against your text balance, giving you your remaining Minutes, Texts and Data. Of course if you are on 3g and not Wi-Fi this counts against your data balance. Don't forget to close your browser and turn of your Data on the Power Control widget when you are done with this or you it will continue to use 3g and it will count against your data balance if not on Wi-Fi. I have even been able to access this website on my home computer and receive the text message on my phone, thereby not using any data on my phone.Also install Norton Security from the Google Play store. This app is currently free for its basic mode and works very well. It works better with a Norton account (access to one additional feature) and the Norton company says it even works better in the paid version but I have not tried.If you are giving this phone to a child Install and configure Norton Family parental control. It will block websites based on your childs age and send you an email when they try to access websites that Norton deems inappropriate. I have not used this on the ZTE Valet but do have it installed on my children's Android tablets and fine it does quite well.~~~~~~UPDATE October 21st 2013~~~~~~~~~This is a review with the intention of helping others make a decision based on my experience with the phone and my experience with a great many cell phones from working in the industry. This review is in no way intended to belittle tracfone users as a small number of people may think.Battery life is astonishing with the ZTE Valet when I have the 3g Data turned off. The battery is lasting at least 3 days 2 nights on standby, with wi-fi on, only a few minutes of voice calls, 3g Data turned off and about 10 texts per day (with some apps installed)! I would typically see standard battery capacity Androids getting around 28 hours of standby with the same apps installed but with the 3g data on (because on those phones it can't be turned off).The apps I have installed are: Outlook, Facebook, Google Calendar, Astro File Manager, Chrome, Easy Reminder, Alarm Clock Extreme, K9 email and Norton Mobile Security. All apps work flawlessly. I have set my polls and updates for these programs to 1 or two hour intervals and disable Email Push.I have had no random reboots or lockups. This is pleasant as even name brand phones of the lower end spectrum are susceptible to this.Cases for the ZTE Fury and ZTE Director are supposed to work with this phone. The case I got for a ZTE Fury fits perfectly.Voice dialing has never, ever gotten my numbers correct, even in total silent surroundings. My last Android phone had an almost perfect record for dialing correctly. I am referring to number dialing where I speak the numbers I want my phone to call. Voice commands rely on a fast processor so I am wondering if this single core processor isn't the problem there. However voice dialing has always been perfect when I say the name of the person I want to call, eg \"call home\".Google voice to text is also affected by the slow processor sometimes simply refusing to work or being so far behind what I am saying it just skips entire groups of words or sentences.Google contacts and calendars sync by default if you enter your Google account when setting up this phone or add it later through the settings>accounts menu.Microsoft calendars sync into the ZTE calendar app or the Google calendar app though the Outlook app. You can also sync your Microsoft contacts through Outlook and see them in the Android contact app but not edit them. I have written many articles on work arounds for this that basically tell the user to set the Outlook app to only sync the calendar and then add your Microsoft account as a Corporate account and set that account to only sync your contacts. You can then edit your Microsoft contacts through the Android contact app. This also works fine on the ZTE Valet.Youtube videos play fine over my home wireless internet connection. No lag or drops. I have not transferred video files to the device to play so I can't speak to the ability to view those videos.I disabled Google Handouts/Talk, Google +, Google Magazines, Google Books, GMail and Google Movies without any problems or adverse affects to the phone. This is an \"expert\" tweak that probably isn't even necessary.Last for my update the price is dropped by $10 since I bought mine. This brings the phone more in line to what I think it should cost. If it dropped another $10 I would say this is 5 stars far and away one of the best deals.~~~~~~UPDATE October 27th 2013~~~~~~~~~The data cable is standard usb 2.0 (1.0) size and the phone end is USB B micro This is the style they have used for the last few years on most, but not all phones and tablets. It is slightly smaller and distinguishable by its two small spring back prongs that help secure it into the phone. So if you have a 1 amp or higher charger with this end, you can use it.While waiting almost two weeks for my screen protector to come the screen somehow got scratched with a brushing type of scratch. Again (not trying to insult anyone here) but with cut rate phones they use plastic screens that scratch more easily than gorilla glass screens or scratch resistant screens. Be sure to buy a screen protector. I bought one for the ZTE Fury and it fit fine.By uninstalling and re installing the Easy Reminder app two times with restarts in between I have gotten it to work perfectly. At its current price as of October 27th 2013 I give it 4.5 stars. I don't think you can get a much better phone than this for Tracfone even in the Samsung for Tracfone.I am a very happy customer with this phone.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "twf2nd", "ReviewID": "R2SFA3XPUAZYOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seeing that I purchase a new phone about every 6 months because some of the tracfones are just all out garbage, but this phone which I got on Amazon for 30 bucks less than what it sells at the Tracfone website, seems to and probably will last a couple of years.

It's a little annoying. But overall it does work well, so far. I have had it out in the middle of nowhere and it still makes and receives calls, I have downloaded a few apps and they work for what I do and the wifi is as weak as everyone has mentioned I can only get about 20ft away from my router. This is an entry level Android not one of the $500.00 phones with a 2yr contract and a $100.00 a month bill so don't go crazy with apps because it can't handle them. But if you are looking to get out of the rat race and the high bills of the contract phones this is the way to go. If you are a long time Tracfone user, the way the minutes are divided is weird. You get a 200 min card but with the triple minutes you get 600 talk 600 text and 600 mg data instead of one pool of minutes.

Lin", "ReviewID": "R1HHUUCMC6Q1GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Considering that a Tracfone 200 minutes + triple minutes card is approximately $25 - $30, this phone by itself probably costs around $33 when purchased as part of the 600 minute package offered by this seller on Amazon. Where else can you get a full-featured Android phone for $33?  Sure, the Valet's performance doesn't measure up to the latest Samsung and Apple phones, but those cost just a \"little bit\" more than $35.  If you are on a budget and need a smartphone, this phone just can't be beat.Setup was fast and easy.  I had a basic Tracfone flip-phone (with active service) on which I had accumulated over 1800 minutes from repeated renewals every 3 months with a 60 minute card (+ double minutes).  I called Tracfone and used the automated system to transfer over my phone number, service time and minutes to this new ZTE phone -- a process that took less than 5 minutes.  A few hours later, everything was transferred over, and my new ZTE smartphone was fully functional with 3G capability for data.  As an unexpected bonus, the minutes that I transferred over were doubled by Tracfone, which came as a complete surprise to me.  So I ended up getting 3600+ talk minutes, 3600+ texts, and 3600+ MB of data, for my new phone.Yearly service cards from Tracfone cost around $85 and comes with 1200 minutes/texts/MB data (400 x 3), so you are looking at around $7 per month if you are sensible about the amount of usage that you put on the phone.  I refuse to pay the ridiculous amounts that regular cell carriers charge, so this Tracfone plan is perfect for me.  It's still hard for me to think that some people (who don't make that much in the first place) are paying anywhere from $500 to $1000 per year for their cell service, on top of the hundreds that they shelled out for their fancy phone.  And these people wonder why they never have any money left at the end of the month, and why they keep living from paycheck to paycheck.The phone itself has everything I need.  The speed and responsiveness of some apps leaves something to be desired at times, but for a $33 phone, I can definitely live with those drawbacks.  I recommend getting a 16gb microSD card for around $10, if you are going to download a lot of apps, as the 4gb card that comes with the phone will get filled up pretty fast.Overall, an excellent phone for the price.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "ZTE Valet Android Prepaid Phone", "Author": "Cheryl", "ReviewID": "R1LRCDBKB0XE7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has been great.

His bill averaged $110+ a month because of data, Text messages, Photos Text to him. I use tracfone myself and stretch my minutes to last months. I am pleased with not having a cellphone bill. I loved his smartphone but just didn't want another contract. I also have three teens without regular cellphones. They were using old andriod phones given to them to use in Wifi. I learned you don't need a phone turned on to use the wifi on android phones. In wifi you can use magic jack app to call, text-free app to text, and search the web all day long with no bill, At home we have wifi and at the kids school they do. The kids are home majority of the time. So they can get calls and texts whenever they want. It saves me a lot on cell phone bills.Then I found this phone. We can use wifi 90% of the time. Then the rest of the time use tracfone minutes when were out.1. First phone puchased was for my husband uses this phone to search the web, netflix, police scanners(his hobby), Pandora, reads emails,radio stations, youtube videos all with apps gotten for free with the play store. Now he does't have to worry about data. He has been able to downgrade his date usage on At&T; phone (since he uses his tracfone). His bill went down to $55 a month with AT&T.; He loves this ZTE phone. He hasn't even added the Prepaid phone minutes to his phone. He started using it right out of  the box.2. Second phone is for me and started using it also without adding the minutes yet. I forgot to mention that there is a way to turn off the data so that you know your using Wifi only. So that you can save data minutes for when you need them. I can have my coupon checkout 51, Target Cartwheel, ebay apps all for free. It been a month now and still haven't needed to add the phone card yet. I purchased the Miniturtle Premium Rugged Shell Hybrid Protective Phone Case Cover for about $10. Money well spent.I plan to purchase more of these phones for the kids. My teenager rated the back camera as average. There is no front facing camera, It does come with a 4GB micro SD card.

My bank is over 20 miles away, so going out there every week is a huge pain.  You need an Andriod phone to do this.  The \"smartphone\" craze has been a huge turn-off for me.  I have always had more to do with my time than stare at a 3.5\" screen.  However, like the Chase mobile app I needed, it is becoming almost necessary to own one nowadays.I actually purchased a Samsung Centura Tracfone but returned it because I found this.  The Centura new is $129.99, more than TWICE the price of this phone.  I do not see how ANYONE would pay an extra $70 for it.  This phone's operating system is actually  one level up from the Centura!  The only thing the Centura has over the Valet that I can see is a front-facing camera for Skype, but thats not worth $70, is it?Having said that, even the Centura is a VERY GOOD value compared to the high-end Andriods.I had an LG840 Tracfone before this.  The fact that this phone is only $10 more than the LG840 (the 840 was right next to the Valet on the shelf) is MIND BOGGLING!THE BADThe touch screen is frustrating but, like another reviewer stated, hopefully I will get better at it myself.  This is my 1st Android phone but certainly not my first touchscreen device.  Besides the cool vibrations I would rank it near the bottom.  This is the reason the phone does not get 5 stars because it has actually been a rather large annoyance for me so far.The fact that the phone itself does not display your prepaid balance is a moot point thanks to the free app, so anyone who discounts the Valet or Centura for this is pretty dense.My girlfriend has the LG800DHL and we will be getting her one of these this weekend.

I made the purchase through an independent dealer. The price and bundle offer was great. Reviews of the phone were good. I like that it has a decent camera, Android OS, a 1GHz processor, an SD card slot and WiFi. The fact that it uses the CDMA protocol is also a plus in my region.Unlike other writers, I like Tracfone's new refill plan for smartphones. When you buy and airtime card you, say a 60 minute card, you get 60 minutes of talk time, 60 text messages, and 60 MB of data. Yes, they charge you a whole unit for a text, but the way I see it I'm getting the texts ON TOP OF the talk time, whereas before texts came from the same 60 minute pool but cost 1/3 of a unit per message. What's more is that this phone gets triple minutes, so the 6o unit card gets 180 minutes of talk, 180 texts, and 180 MB of data. Works great for me.However, the issues I've had with the phone just added up to overall disappointment.Firstly, the first phone I received had a defective touch screen. No problem, both Tracfone and the dealer ShopCellDeals were great at replacing the defective phone.Next, everything technically \"worked\" on the replacement phone, but performance was lacking. The response of the touch screen is choppy and inconsistent. Seems like it's hard to activate the function you want, but easy to accidentally get the one DON'T want. Scrolling and swipe action is not smooth.Apps seem to load very slowly, i.e., around 10 seconds, despite the seemingly fast processor.The speakerphone feature is not loud enough to be useful except in a quiet room, certainly not in a car, even when parked.Lastly, and this was the deal-breaker for me, is that the WiFi radio is extremely weak. At home I lose the wifi signal at a mere 10 to 12 feet away. By comparison, my 3rd generation iPod touch can still get a signal at 15 to 20 feet. I specifically wanted a phone with WiFi. This was a let down. If I have to be  no more than 5 to 10 feet from the router to get it, i might as well have a wire.Perhaps I'm asking too much for an \"entry level\" smart phone.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Valet", "Author": "Hmc3", "ReviewID": "R2UVSL7UANABD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HiThese are our first smart phones so far very happy with them .

What really disappointed me most is how my micro sd was \"removed\" even though it's still in the phone (Nothing wrong with my sd btw.) It's better to use a standard micro sd not an ultra type which I was using. The apps I downloaded do somewhat work depending what you get. It's better if the apps stay on the phones internal storage than moving it to the sd storage, they don't show or start after the phones powered on. They will eventually show but not always and often fail to run. I was also unsatisfied of the available ram it has. Instead of the stated 512mb there's only 386mb total not only that, after I set up my device there was less than 50mb free. Even after I closed running apps there's still not much available. For what I know of course less ram is less speed. At least Tracfone's service is alright, making calls & texting works good enough so I cant complain too much. I hope Tracfone has much better androids soon.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good \"Fone\"... but wait!", "Author": "Whisper", "ReviewID": "R2UHR4TF3ZE41M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Tracfone runs Android 4.1.1 which is known to be vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug.I was  advised by the Android people to have my carrier upgrade to a later Version to avoidthis problem. Unfortunately, Tracfone has no info on their Site about any upgrade-but their user forum has hundreds of complaints about this issue.But when you register and lodge another request you are told (by private message)to call Tracfone Customer service. Customer service says a fix will be sent to the phone by \"Android\"or by the  Manufacturer ZTE- but they dont know who or when. When you call ZTE they say they dont support Tracfones but they give you a number to call Tracfone!So while it is a  pretty good phone- it's not worth the risk of getting infected with a nasty bug so easily.But I guess you can keep it off the internet and use it as a dumb phone.Shame on Tracfone for letting it's loyal users down like this.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Screaming Deal on a Good Phone", "Author": "Peter Adrian", "ReviewID": "RXRI6F1RA62CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have too much to add to what others have written, but I am quite pleased with my new ZTE Valet. The Android 4.1.1 OS worked fine right out of the box; calls and text messages go right through; settings are accessible and easy to use; data and wi-fi are easy to switch on and off. My airtime transferred without a hitch. Onboard storage is sufficient for my needs, and there is a way to store apps on the microSD card. Google it if you want, as it is a rather involved procedure involving a PC and external programs. The only real glitch I had was getting to my voicemail. The number didn't carry over when I transferred my contacts from my old phone via the SD card, but a quick web search led me to the answer.

WASTE OF TIME AND WASTE OF MONEY! If I could give it a 0 I would!I thought I would take a chance on this phone since the reviews were mixed.  However it only lasted a week, even prior to the screen refusing to turn on it was a total crap phone.  The camera takes 2 - 3 mins to turn on, so even if it does decide to turn on there are no spontaneous pics.  I bought this phone because I missed the apps I had on my old ATT phone, even though I did not miss their bill.What a piece of crap!!! Can't open the starbucks app in the time it takes to stand in line.  Can't open the camera quickly, even if you do finally get it open it takes THE WORST PICTURES EVER!

The problem arises in trying to deal with the company's advertising.Their web site advertises plans and offers bonus minutes for some of them. ...Imagine my surprise when I bought one of these offers and they refused me my bonus minutes all together because and I quote here their email ... \"Please be informed that promo codes are not applicable to Android phones.\"... My goodness do they really sell anything else BUT android phones?Moreover, they cannot point to any link on their website where this is explained, where the consumer can be informed prior to purchase, and then they just fold their arms and say all promo purchases are final and they will not refund my money. ... All this less than 1 hour after my purchase, after I have not used the phone at all, they refuse to back out the transaction. This is simply not a reasonable way to do business. I now have to cancel out this credit card transaction. Not good. Not good at all.I regret buying this phone, and I cannot in good conscience recommend any product offered by them. To say I am annoyed is a massive understatement.UPDATE: Now they call me a couple of days later and say that they have updated their website to reflect that they do not offer bonus minutes on Androids. I say fine, but give me my money back and they still refuse. They insist that I have to cancel the payment through my credit card if I hope to get my money back. Clearly they are in error as evidenced by their need to change their web site after my order, but unfortunately they are not honorable enough to refund a purchase that was made as a result of their ad, an ad that they now admit was deceptive because they had to change it.

In setting phone up, was disappointed that I couldn't transfer my previous Tracfone number...no big deal, but certainly something of an irritation.  Phone worked fine for about 10 days...then the screen went blank/black.  Eventually figured out from online forums, that if I took out the battery for an extended time (10-15 minutes)....it would come back.  Worked for a few days...then it got to where it couldn't make or receive phone calls (wifi was still working fine).  Spent ~2-3 hours with Tracfone customer service....to no avail.  Have returned phone to Amazon/shopcelldeals.  Very wary of this brand (Huawei) at this point.  Hoping that Tracfone will eventually bring some mid-range level smartphones to their product line as I very much like their 'pay as you go' model.
