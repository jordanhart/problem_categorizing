Attractive Bundle", "Author": "MI Feller", "ReviewID": "RZ104QSJFZVIX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As  an infrequent phone user,  and after losing a 3 year old Tracfone with nearly a year of pre-paid service remaining,  I headed off to the local KMart and picked up this new Samsung bundle for the very low sale price of $7.00.  At Tracfone  the agent who assisted in transferring my old phone number, minutes and airtime to the new phone was helpful and efficient.  A minor issue was foreign dialect - but still, I'll give them high marks.  (Keep the enclosed phone ID card in a safe place. Should you lose your phone, you'll need this information to transfer time and minutes.)The phone: The phone is pretty basic by today's standards. Lighted keypad. Nice clear LCD screen.  Simple to use menus and a \"vibrate\" setting.  Ringer volume is easily adjusted and remains at desired level.  Adjusting listening volume is more difficult.  The ear-piece volume can be adjusted upward from its low default setting - but only during an actual call. When the call ends, volume automatically returns to the lower setting. Making the adjustment requires pressing the upward navigation arrow while connected.  It worked, but there was an imperfect and sometimes sluggish response making precise adjustment difficult. The maximum volume setting provides \"speakerphone\" functionality. However, sound quality is poor at that setting.  Outgoing sound and volume (as recorded on my answering machine) proved strong - but somewhat \"rough\" sounding.The Bundle: A real plus of this bundle is that you get both an AC charger for in-home and also a car charger. The car charger appears to be of good quality with a red LED that glows while plugged in. A nice 2' (black) coiled cord runs from charger to phone. The case is also of good quality, having a magnetic closure flap.  Included is a small plug-type earphone and cord.  The phone lacks Bluetooth.Tracfone Service: I've used Tracfone for years. No contract. No long term commitments. It's easy to shop online for the different service options, and then purchase what you need.  Airtime and talk-minutes are immediately uploaded to your phone where they are easy to view. Reception has been generally good throughout Michigan and in several different Florida locations. We live in a rural area, so use a cell phone signal booster at our home (covered in a separate review).  You can purchase Tracfone service for as little as 30 days.  I normally buy a year's worth for around $100 so as not to have to worry about it.Instructions: I found the small booklet accompanying the phone difficult to use.  It's in several  languages and the print is small. Some information on phone operation seems lacking.  But Samsung's downloadable user manual available online is excellent - and worth a look if considering this phone.  A searchable phrase to help locate it:  Samsung S125g ManualRating: If grading Tracfone service and its value, I'd give it a solid \"4\".  The complete Samsung Model S125G Bundle with car charger I'll rate \"3\".  As for the actual phone, it's hard to see how it warrants much above a 2 - primarily for the sub-par volume/sound characteristics noted.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple and Perfect", "Author": "Ceri", "ReviewID": "RCBDFASX4OIAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son's 13th birthday. I wanted something simple for him and without alot of app and gaming options. This phone was perfect. Its been a great tool for teaching him to manage his minutes and his time remaining on the phone. It makes calls, it takes calls, it has text ability, and it has voice mail. What more do you need to teach a kid how to manage a phone? It doesn't have any bells and whistles. Honestly, if you don't want all of the extra gadgets this phone is the way to go.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung S125G", "Author": "Shack", "ReviewID": "R14GGOAENM369W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Tracfone works, but gets no signal in many locations where other brands of Tracfone's do get a signal.  Quite often it gets 3 bars of signal in one location and a few hours later it gets no signal in the same location while other brands of Tracfone's continue to get a good signal.

One for each of my teen kids. VERY important that it be this particular model, as it has no web access, no games, etc. (my son has autism and cannot be given access to such features). Almost impossible to find plain phones that just make calls and don't allow all the diversions.So here's the rub. I received the two phones via amazon. One came with an activation code that worked right from the box. The other activation code did not work. Called TracFone. They said: fax the original receipt, bar code from box, etc. We'll send you a new activation code. I did everything they said to do. TracFone says the amazon.com receipt isn't the \"original receipt,\" and I need to get that from vendor before they'll let me activate the phone. Literally hours of customer service phone time, on top of the faxing logistics. I gave up with an: Oh... nevermind. But, now I have a phone I cannot use.I'm debating if I should send the non-activatable one back to amazon. Might cost me more in shipping than it's worth.I'm debating if I should reorder another of these from amazon. Risk getting one that won't activate again?? So far I'm one-for-one. But I can't find this no-frills phone anywhere else. HUGE drag. Really frustrated with the whole situation. I need this phone to work.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Price", "Author": "Colin Hurt", "ReviewID": "R2X5R2WW9BQV5E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good price for a basic phone and it works fine.I bought it just for the charger and got the phone as well.

However, the vendor didn't scan the phone correctly and Tracfone wouldn't activate it.  They said it was not my fault but the fault of the vendor, but after two weeks of faxing this and faxing that, plus more than a little frustration on my part, they refused to activate the phone and I was forced to buy another one.  Perhaps if Amazon had included the vendors name and address along with my confirmation e-mails it might have made a difference but I am inclined to think not.  At the end of the day the phone looks good but is only useful as a paperweight.
