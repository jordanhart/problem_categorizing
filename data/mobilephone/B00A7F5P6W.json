{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Phone", "Author": "Charles \"Charles\"", "ReviewID": "R11RQKPWGIEMJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HTC WP8X provides a fresh, fun and usable phone experience that makes you happy to use a smartphone again.Hardware wise, the WP8X is sexy, fun and smartly designed.  It's extremely thin and light and the curved edges allow users to easily handle the phone in one hand.  The 4.3 inch screen is the perfect balance between screen size and portability, allowing me to carry the phone in my shirt and pants pocket.  The screen is also a delight: bright, color saturated, and razor sharp.  The resolution beats the iPhone 5 in ppi, and it shows.  Text and images come alive and are a joy to view.  The Gorilla glass provides excellent protection and a seamless, curved, and beautiful fa\u00e7ade.The HTC design team clearly aimed to create premium device using color accents throughout the phone including  the speaker and earpiece grill.  It's clever and sets the phone apart from anything else on the market.The audio quality is by far the best I have ever experienced.  Unlike my HTC Sensation, there is no static or hissing; voices sound rich and strong.  The speakerphone is also very strong.  Callers reported hearing me clearly and some could not tell that I was on a speakerphone.  The speakerphone's output was loud and very impressive.Call quality / reception was exceptional and did not suffer the \"death grip\" of my Sensation.  The HTC WP8 managed to pull in bars and hold them consistently.  Unfortunately, HTC WP8 does not support Wi-Fi calling which is something that I enjoyed with my Android handset (when it worked).The operating system is revolutionary.  Previously, I had an iPhone and Android, but was tired of both platforms. The iPhone had become stale, boring, and quite frankly old-fashioned and the Android was just too difficult to use.  Both platforms were stuck with an aged design concept of rows of icons launching applications.  WP8 takes an entirely different approach to phone UI.  The live tiles double duty as launch buttons but also hubs of information that communicate important information at a single glance.WP8 is also a master of aggregating information.  The people hub links with facebook, twitter, my Exchange and LinkedIn accounts and feeds updates from my contacts together.  It does not matter where the updates are coming from, information is presented cleanly and uniformly for each of my contacts.  How simple; how revolutionary.When I need to post an update, I do it from one place and WP8 takes care of posting it to all my accounts and services.  I don't have to enter LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. separately to post updates.  Easy, and something that I longed iOS and Android to accomplish natively.Xbox Music (formerly Zune) is well done.  I have been a long time subscribe of Zune Pass, and the Music app on WP8 really makes it easy to access any song from their catalog.  If you use a Windows 8 computer, everything syncs between them automatically.  Having the \"cloud\" at my disposable calmed my fears of only having 16 gigs of phone storage space.As far as applications, most every application that I used on Android and iOS are present on WP8 (or at least an equivalent).  My most used apps are Skype, WhatsApp, a great news reader, and Shop Savvy.  These are all present on WP8.And speaking of Skype, finally, MSFT has managed to produce a deeply integrated Skype experience with flawless call quality.  Making a voice calls on my Sensation was a miserable experience.  I was disappointed that this first version does not support file transfer, but hopefully this will be added in a future version.An earlier review said that you can only upload Notes and some Office apps, but this is not true.  You just need to download the SkyDrive app from the App Store and everything that you upload to SkyDrive is available on the phone.  You need the correct app to open the files, of course.This is a phone that needs to be experienced.  The operating system is fresh and unlike anything you have used before and is a pleasant relief from the antiquated iPhone and Android  OS's.  To borrow a phrase from Apple, this phone \"thinks different\" both inside and out!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "anonymous mom", "ReviewID": "R3ST6DZ0NVV01I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up the HTC 8X on November 15th to replace my HTC Trophy.  I am very happy with it so far.The screen is big and display quality is good.  It is lightweight compared to the smaller dimensioned Trophy.  I really like the new smaller live tile size and the customizability it gives to your start screen - I can make a bunch of stuff tiny-square size and fit all the things I use most onto the screen without scrolling with my calendar the biggest size to see my next meeting or appointment, mail mid-sized, and everything else extra small.The sound quality is fantastic.  I plug it into the stereo system in my car for my children to listen to their favorite songs - I generally can't tell the difference between normal and fancy audio equipment, but I could definitely tell the difference between my old phone's music play and this one.  It sounds crisp and the volume output is so much better.The camera is okay, but still not the best feature of the phone.  I think the camera on the Lumia is better.  I usually carry a digital camera for pictres, though, so the few that I snap with my phone of my kids to text to their grandparents works fine for my needs.  It works fine for scanning items, too.The KidZone feature is great, though it is available on all Windows 8 phones.  I've set it up with a few games, apps, and songs that my children can use, and so far it has stopped them from buying things a number of times.Overall a great new phone.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Owned for a year, mostly fine but one major issue.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1JQZRAC3MJ4BQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Would I buy this phone again?  As much as I want to say yes, I must say no.Cons with the 8x:Missed call tone: (REVIEW UPDATE 7-23-2013: Still no fix for this missed call tone, it is specific to Verizon and no update since I bought the phone in November-2012 has alleviated it. UPDATE 10-14-2013 The issue persists) I do not know if it still occurs in all new 8x phones, but there is a large community on Windows Phone forums who are experiencing the same issue:  After a missed call (if it isn't intentionally ignored by the user using the 'ignore' button), there is a three tone sound, no matter what state your phone is in (silent/vibrate/ring).  This happens no matter how your sound settings are configured!  For me, this is highly annoying, but not unbearable since my workplace doesn't have a problem with cell phones.  However, anytime I go somewhere that complete silence is required (movie theater/musical/church etc etc), I have to turn my phone completely off.  To me this is completely unacceptable.  I just got my first Windows Phone update today and it did not resolve the issue.  I waited to write this review until after the update because I understand all phones can have bugs.  Since it wasn't fixed, however, I remove one star from an otherwise 4 star review.Build quality:  Beautiful as it may be when new, the rubberized material is already peeling off revealing a hard plastic layer underneath.  Unacceptable after 3 months of use.  The glass is supposedly gorilla glass, but mine already has multiple light scratches on the display, and I'm careful with my phone.  Also unacceptable.  One star removed for build quality.  (Note: I've never dropped my phone.)Pros for the 8x:Style:  The phone looks great (apart from what I mentioned above)Comfort:  Feels really amazing in your hand, it feels MUCH thinner than it actually is.Camera:  Not as good as an iPhone, but it's good.  I love the WP8 camera software too.Battery life:  Definitely acceptable for a 4G phone.  I rarely get all the way to empty at the end of the day.Display:  Beautiful.Call quality:  Fine.The Operating System Cons:Lack of apps:  No stars taken off the review for this, since it isn't something specific to this phone, but I have to mention the lack of apps available for WP8.  I am not a heavy app user, so this doesn't bother me all that much.  For anyone used to the android/iPhone app store that uses a lot of third party apps, this will be a huge problem.  Pandora missing is, for me, the most notable.  (REVIEW UPDATE 6-6-2013: Pandora now available for WP8.)Search:  It tries to be smart and select the category it thinks you wanted for search (images/web/local) but gets it wrong a lot of the time and it's pretty annoying.  The bing results aren't amazing either.  I downloaded the google app for search and that alleviates the problem, unless you want to search while in the browser.  (REVIEW UPDATE 7-23-2013: This app is still available but hasn't been updated in over a year; I don't believe it's supported by Google any longer.)Default Alarm software:  It doesn't show you the time your alarm is going to go off on the lock screen, and it also doesn't allow you to turn off SNOOZE once you have turned it on without turning off the alarm completely.  Not a huge deal but it annoys me.The Operating System Pros:Overall I love Windows Phone 8 operating system.  It is smooth, easy to use, and nice to look at.  This phone delivers that in a wonderful, fast and glitch-free manner.  A few notes below--Integration with Office:  I use OneNote, and this is one of the number one reasons I love my phone.  It syncs fast and works well.  I haven't tested much with Word or other programs, but so far so good.Facebook integration:  (REVIEW UPDATE 7-23-2013: Loving the new Facebook update, works great for me.)Pretty good!  Could be better, but the fact that it's semi-fast and not buggy is a pro for me.Maps:  Now that Nokia has released their navigation software, maps is back to being awesome for WP8.  Download it from the store!  VZW navigation you have to pay by month for.. which in this day and age is pretty outrageous.Overall not a bad choice for a phone, definitely not.  But personally I would not buy it again.  The missed call tone is what pushes that decision from a 'pretty much yes' to a solid no.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "My new favorite phone", "Author": "James Baumgardner", "ReviewID": "R1SH491JISUZXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Facts:I've been using Android for the past 3 yearsMy wife loves her some Apple productsI used to own a Blackjack (admitting it is the first step)I have owned my black HTC 8X for about a week now, and I am really happy with my purchase.  From the first turning on of the device, I was pretty much blown away.  The phone is slim, with the buttons flush to the body.  The back is curved, and the edges are nice and thin.  The phone is light, but does feel solid.  Lots of screen real estate, and the glass is very responsive.  The device has plenty of power, so the experience with apps is very smooth.  No shuddering or long delays opening anything.  The animations and transitions are all smooth.  Very smooth.  I won't go into a bunch of detail on Windows 8 Phone OS, but there are tips and hints to help you get used to what is different about this phone from whatever OS you might be coming from.Camera:  There is a nice little button to fire up the camera directly, as well as operating the shutter.  There was no noticeable shutter lag, so I was able to snap several pictures in rapid succession.  This is important to me, since my kids never stay still.Sound:  Beats Audio!  Sound is great from the body's speaker as well.  Not much to say here - it works good.Battery:  The verdict is still out on this one, since I've been on vacation the whole time I have had the phone.  I habitually charge my phone whenever I'm home and not using it.  When I go back to work this week, I'll get a better idea of this, and will post the info for this as well.  For the time I have been using the phone while on vacation, it appears to have acceptable battery life.Apps:  You need to know up front that the apps for Windows are not as plentiful as the competing app markets.  This will change in the near future, I'm sure, but taking of stock of what apps you must have to survive is highly recommended before you go buying up this phone and then complaining that your favorite fart machine or annoying talking cat doesn't exist in the Store.  If this is your first smartphone, you probably don't care as much about this.Other:  I love the Kids Corner feature.  If you don't know what this is, but you have kids, I highly recommend reading a review or two.  I use Gmail and ActiveSync and both work with no issues.  I wish there was an archive button for GMail, but that's not really a huge deal.  Podcasts are a pain if you plan on using the built-in as you can't import a podcast that doesn't exist in the Store.  Again, I'm sure this will improve, but you might prefer to just get a 3rd party Podcast app in the mean time.  Xbox integration is great!  Skype/Messenger works well.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and while I'm only 1 week into ownership I would definitely recommend this phone to others.Jim", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the Switch!", "Author": "canislatrans", "ReviewID": "R3BYH4WW8A4KI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used all of the operating systems and I did a ton of research before getting this phone. I can now say without a doubt Windows 8 is the most fun and useful OS (at least for business)!I've been using the Android OS for a while. Droid is functional and versatile but it definitely lacks a fun, smooth user interface. Never thought I'd say this but Windows is a powerhouse of functionality (Excel and Power Point are incredible) and it has an attractive and super fun interface! Though I really like the business aspect I also love that this phone connects to my Xbox!The HTC 8x phone itself is pretty awesome. It is wicked fast, the camera is pretty good and the battery lasts me a whole day of light browsing and lots of talking.The one issue with Windows (like everyone points out) is the lack of apps. But, I'm not an aggressive app user (if you like useless apps to tell you when to drink water windows isn't 100 percent there yet- though there are plenty of useless W8 apps too). So far, I've found major apps (netflix, nokia drive, facebook, fitness apps, etc.) that are really good.I loved the windows phone after trying it out in the store but I was almost talked out of getting it by the sales folks at 3 different Verizon Stores. I was literally was in the process of checking out with a Droid phone and I went with my gut and switched at the last second to the HTC 8x. I'm so glad I did!All the sales guys told me this phone wasn't easy to learn how to use but I've had no problem. In fact, I think if you're a first time user, this phone seems much more intuitive than droid.Bottom line- if you can deal without tons of silly apps and you like this OS go for it!

In fact even my Apple fanboy friends have commented on how sexy the phone is and how great it feels in their hand. The 8X offers a great camera, although the resolution of the 8MP option does not fill the whole screen. The camera takes very good pictures and is very quick with the autofocus. The phone performs quite well, never really missing a beat, and it can easily run multiple apps in the background. Sound quality for phone calls is quite good, although nothing beats the sound of audio playback with Beats by Dr. Dre built in. One of my complaints about the phone is because of aesthetic purposes, the hard buttons on the phone are pretty flush with the bezel of the phone, this is especially apparent with the power/lock button, sometimes it is hard to hit the button. The screen is bright and beautiful with really crisp images. One complaint about the screen is the auto brightness sensor is almost too good, there are often times when the brightness is so low that the phone doesn't shine. You are always able to see the phone, it just doesn't pop. Battery life is pretty good, most days I am able to go two or three days between charges. As far as the OS goes, Windows Phone 8 is a great OS that is clever and colorful. It is easy to personalize and easy to use, it really just works. The only complaint about the OS is a lack of apps, anything you need you will most likely be able to find, but there are certain apps that are still missing at this point, but I assume they will make their way to the OS eventually.

It's only slightly bigger than the HTC 8S but both are remarkably smaller and lighter than other Phone 8 devices without compromising screen size.

Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times.  I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year.

But, I am so impressed with this phone I decided to write a quick review.I have been a Blackberry user for the past six years. My wife has an iPhone and all of my coworkers have Samsung Galaxy's and iPhones. So, even though my own phone is antiquated, I have seen the newest, most popular phones out there.I was torn between a Samsung and a Windows Phone. I decided to go with a Windows Phone mainly because I wanted something different from the iPhone/Android systems. I read many reviews on Amazon on various Windows Phone devices. I finally decided on the HTC 8X.My phone arrived today and I am blown away by the quality and innovation of this thing. I purchased this phone on Amazon without ever seeing it in person. So, my biggest fear was that I might have purchased a sub-par phone that iPhone/Android users would laugh at me.But, after using this phone for the past few hours, I am already addicted to it. It is beautiful. The phone itself is solidly constructed. It doesn't feel like some MS/HTC afterthought. It feels like a well thought-out design.The Windows Phone Metro user interface is beautiful. The tiles are a great innovation and makes iPhone look like an Atari 2600.The screen is gorgeous. Yes, it is not as big as some Samsung phones, but the resolution is crisp and clear. This phone actually fits in your pocket. A few Samsung owners I know have admitted that the phone is a bit too big to carry around.As for apps, this Windows Phone has plenty. It may not have Angry Birds (I didn't actually check) but if you want that, this phone is not for you anyway. Here's some apps I already installed:KindleAudible BooksESPNExcelWordPowerpointFor maps, there is Bing Map. It works great. I already use Bing Map on my desktop so no adjustment to something new there.I'll add more as I continue to use this phone but I just wanted to share my initial impression of Wow!Day two update:I tried out the sound system today. Holy cow this sounds great. Not sure about the \"Beats Audio\" feature. It seems that it simply bumps up the treble and bass. So that is a bit gimmicky. But there is no denying the high quality of the sound. It sounds way better than my iPod.I have a Win 8 desktop. This phone easily syncs with my Outlook account and my Amazon music library.What I am still trying to figure out is texting photos and movies in WiFi-only mode. I'd rather not use my cellular data connection to text images but I haven't been able to figure out how to send those things on WiFi. I need to turn on my data connection in order to send/receive images via texting.UPDATEA few days ago, my screen developed two flickering horizontal lines about 2/3 of the way down the screen. Then, a day after that developed, the entire bottom half of the screen became unusable. It altered between flickering and just being frozen. I pushed down on the bottom portion of the screen and that problem went away but I still have a few lines 2/3 down that flicker. It is a shame because the screen was so beautiful before that problem occurred. I'm debating whether or not to return this thing.

I just got this phone a few days ago, since I lost my Nokia Lumina 822 while overseas. So, I got this HTC 8x Windows 8 phone offered through my insurance (thankfully, I had insurance).Anyway the immediate PROs:Windows 8, Beats Audio (awesome sound quality thru my Sennheiser ear buds!) , Lighter/thinner than my Lumina 822, 8MP camera, BT, WiFi, VERY GOOD call quality!Immediate CONs:NO Micro SD card...!!!! REALLY! You're joking.... right?So, on with a more in-depth review.First, I THOROUGHLY enjoy and love the Windows 8 O/S. I like Droid, but not quite as robust since I like to be able to plug and play right into my Windows PC, Laptop(s) at home & work, without ANY effort to modify to accommodate a different O/S on a phone. Plus, the Windows 8 phone is just so smooth & fluid when rolling thru your apps/programs kind of thing, with easy setup to add remove icon/tiles to your \"desktop\" screen/home screen of the phone.Second, 16GB internal memory is pretty good for a general user of this phone, to remove/copy/paste file, pix, music to & from your PCs, etc.The 8MP camera is not too bad really. My Lumina 822 had a Carl Zeiss lens for a MUCH better picture, especially w/o a flash AND in the dark. However, the HTC 8x does come with a built-in photo enhancement App/program which has about 6 styles & then a free download update, which ads another 6 or 8 more I believe.These are actually pretty good to play with and do something different to your picture(s) if needed/wanted.I LOVE how the BEATs Audio sounds thru my Sennheiser headphones, along w/ attaching it thru my AUX jack in my car. Very impressive, w/ very nice stereo separation while playing the music! This is important to me, since I am a singer/songwriter/musician on the side (Yes, I can't quit my day job - I'm a realist), so sound quality is important for me to separate tracks when I record a new song and such (I usually listen when on the train or in my car).The phone quality is VERY good! From the actual phone call, too the physical craftsmanship as well. It is thinner, lighter in weight, and feels more comfortable to hold while on the phone.Bluetooth works great! The WiFi works great! *** The WiFi on this phone DOES recognize 2.4GHz & 5.0GHz WiFi networks, if you happen to use dual-band wireless at home/work/etc, like I do.Now the irritation part of this review. I would have given an EASY 5 stars if this device had the ONE THING it is missing! A Micro SD card slot! UNBELIEVABLE....?!?!?!?!?!You're gonna put BEATs Audio on a nice phone, geared toward music lovers, musicians, and the like! REALLY! At the VERY LEAST, HTC could have put a 32GB internal memory on the phone, w/o the Micro SD, and I would still give this phone 4 stars. At LEAST, with 32GB, I can put a good amount of music, and STILL have room for documents and pictures, w/o using up ALL the space on the phone! With 16GB internal memory, using a Windows 8 O/S and any other programs/Apps, you're going to use between 4 to 6 GB of internal memory like that, so you have 10GB left approximately. In my case, I used 5GB of memory, leaving me 11GB, since I do not use a ton of Apps. I can ONLY imagine if you're a music lover and an App lover, on how much you're gonna have left. I'm going to make it work out by slimming down my music folio, or make 2 or 3 separate ones and delete/copy to the phone when I get bored and want something different on my phone. My Nokia Lumina 822 had a Micro SD card slot and 16GB of internal, but no BEATs Audio.So, overall.... this phone is GREAT in every possible way for most cell phone/smart phone users. I do not see any major flaws to this phone, except for the music lover/musician who may have gotten this phone particularly for the BEATs Audio included on it.So, my rating of this phone:if you're a generally user with a smart phone - a 5 star phone!If you're a music lover/musician with a LOT of MP#s - a 3 Star phone-> minus one (-1) to the engineering department of HTC-> minus one (-1) for putting an App/program on a phone (BEATs Audio) that is specific to music lovers, and not having enough internal memory and/or removable storage (ie - Micro SD slot) for a place to keep those MP3s.Please don't get me wrong, it really is a great phone, but you cannot market a product like BEATs Audio to put on this phone, and then not have the memory/storage/resources to back it up kind of thing. This is where HTC had GREAT marketing plan, and FORGOT to tell the engineering department on what would be needed for the BEATs Audo and/or what type of people want to use BEATs Audio for, essentially.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE!!", "Author": "D.

I don't want to say I take bad care of my phone...but i really have no explanation as to how these problems started.1.  SIM error.  This happens several times a day.  You cant send, or receive any texts/calls/data requests.  A simple reboot usually fixes this2.  Sometimes, if it cant read the SIM on reboot, it will get stuck in a \"continual reboot cycle\" (phone keeps booting up and shutting down immediately after boot)...The phone is useless during this stage until you find a tool and pop out the SIM yourself and re-seat it.3.  The battery is non-removable.4. When you plug in headphones, the volume doesn't get loud enough.  Bad for when you're at the gym..the naturally loud gym music overpowers the volume you can get from your \"beats audio\" enabled device.  Ive tried several pairs of headphones/earbuds.5. When you unplug your headphones...every once in a while when the external speaker turns back on,  the volume is incredibly low, borderline unhearable.  A reboot fixes this.6. (might be verizon).  But sometimes the phone doesn't ring at all, and you get a new voicemail tone.  This happens when I'm at work with 4/5 bars.

Now that I've had it for a couple of weeks, I'm SO glad I did!  Why? This phone is fun, sleek, easy to use, and integrates with my life perfectly.  The styling is great, the soft, rounded features make it easy to hold in upright or horizontal position.  The large screen is great, and with the pinch to zoom feature, everything is easy to see.  I love the fact that everything I need is pinned as a live tile, so I rarely have to swipe over to access anything else.  Facebook integrates seamlessly with this phone, keeping me in contact with my friends and family.  There my not be as many apps as for other phones, but how many useless apps do you really need?  Within a couple of hours of getting the phone going, I had all the apps I could ever use downloaded and ready to go.  The camera is really decent, and again, sharing photos is so easy.  From what I can tell about most of the bad reviews, they were written by people that didn't take the time to get to know their phone and how to work it.  I found it easy to learn to use, it was really intuitive.  And the built in Beats Audio function made me straight up throw away my mp3 player.  All my music fit on the phone's memory with plenty of space left.  Get this phone, you won't regret it.

Why?  I was simply bored with the iPhone and didn't feel the 5 was worthy of shelling out the upgrade money for.  I've also owned a few Android phones in the past so I was open minded when I went shopping for a new phone.  I chose the HTC Windows 8X in Black and here's the top reasons why:1.  I was bored with iOS and android. The 8x offered a whole new system to experience.2.  Incredibly easy to use and set up.3.  It's not a huge phone.  This phone is sleek and light weight but offers a larger screen than my old iPhone 4S.4.  I love the live tiles and how they offer status notifications.5.  The display is simply gorgeous.  Bright and beautiful.  Be prepared for people to ask what phone you are using.6.  This phone is FAST.  It literally blows my iPhone out of the water in speed between screens, task etc....7.  Wireless charging. Works perfectly on my Nokia DT-900 wireless charger.  Super handy to be able to just set it  down.8.  Practically free! 0.01 right now on Amazon to upgrade.All my contacts, pictures and iTunes music transferred with ease over to the 8X using the Windows phone app available in Apple's app store. Speaking of apps..... All the apps I needed and used; Facebook, Words with Friends, Netflix, Pinterest etc....were all available on the Windows App store. The phone also Bluetooth paired without ease and without issues to my Uconnect system in my SUV.  It does not allow the voice to text feature to work on Uconnect because the 8X doesn't support MAP, but neither did my iPhone so it wasn't a loss. The camera takes great pictures. I did discover that by default the camera is set to 6MP and you have to change the setting to 8MP if you want better quality pictures. Battery life has been just as good as my iPhone 4S after making some tweaks to applications and syncing options. Call quality is fine.My only minor gripe is the power button on top which is difficult to feel.I'd highly recommend this phone to first time smartphone users and existing users who are looking for something new and fresh.

It feels very good in my hands, and the soft rubber on the back gives a good grip. I can't go any further without highlighting my absolutely favorite feature: the camera. This. Camera. Is. Awesome. I've taken a variety of photos, inside and outside, portraits and action. (I have 22-month-old and 5-year-old boys.) The photos are absolutely gorgeous, and they stand up well against my point-and-shoot camera (a Canon Digital Elph).I think the call quality and sound are very good. I have a relatively low voice, and I oftentimes have people tell me they have a hard time understanding me, particularly on cell phones. On the other hand, the people I spoke with said they could hear me loud and clear.The only (small) critique I have of the phone is a reflection of the nascent stages of the Windows platform, rather than this particular phone.

This being my second phone from them, I should have learned the first time around that a pretty design is hardly worth the infuriating software.To begin, my camera went green the SECOND day after it came out of the box. I took it to an ATT store (the provider) and they gave me lackluster feedback, claiming I was just being silly; after all, when it goes green you just have to restart your entire phone! Picture moment=gone.Thinking it may be a one time issue, I relied on the HTC warranty in case of future issues. Can you see how gullible I am? Of course, the issue happened again, and is currently happening more often.Not only that, but I am now having an issue simply trying to unlock the screen. When I type the password in, it opens to a black screen that states \"resuming...\" This screen appears for a good five minutes, rendering the phone completely useless. The only option to stop this is to take out the battery, which hasn't been an easy (or fun) thing to accomplish.Like I said before, I hoped to rely on HTC's warranty, at least some decent customer service.

It has all the features of a great phone, but WP8 is really dragging it. The design of the phone is so nice, I can't explain in words how well it fits in the hand and how nice it looks. It literally is a perfect fit for your palm and your fingers just wrap around the phone. When I showed it to my friends, they looked at it at first as just a phone, but I let them hold it, and they said  \"Holy cow. This is a really nice phone.\" They grip it and turn it around and look closely and realize that it really is a hidden jewel. It's a very simple look but so nice is a lot of ways. The camera on the phone is also really nice, I've taken some really nice shots with it in the sunset and at parties. Although, as I've said, the software drags it. The front facing camera is really awesome and is really clear, but it lags when I move it around, like it stutters. I'm pretty sure it's a Windows Phone problem, because a HTC One X with the same internals run perfectly fine and smooth. The software isn't all bad though, because it is a Windows Phone, it has a camera button which allows really steady pictures, and an easy to use interface. The start screen are very beautiful tiles which update which is cool when you can see your missed text messages flip through and your email. The web experience and the apps are probably the main problem. It doesn't have many of the apps on Android or iOS/iPhone, and the browser isn't as smooth, fast, or easy to use as let's say the iPhone safari or Android Chrome. That is in no way a fault of HTC though. It is a lack of focus from Microsoft to polish the software more and to get more developers to make let's say an Instagram app or maybe a good Facebook app.A really important feature of this phone is the display. And let me just say the screen is absolutely beautiful. It is so bright and so colorful, and to just see how nice it is, go on the Youtube site and load a 720p or 1080p movie trailer and you can really enjoy how great it is. Even looking at pictures from Google can show how nice it is. The colors almost pop out at you. When you look at a website, such as The New York TImes, the text is so clear, that you can barely tell there are any pixels at all on the screen that makes up the text. I'd go as far as saying, that in terms of clarity it is better than the iPhone 5. In terms of color, it is one of the best. The display definitely gets a 100 out of 10.Really, this is an amazing phone. It looks great, it feels great, it has great cameras, and a gorgeous screen. Windows Phone has a learning curve and lacks in a lot compared to Android, but it is very nice, and I think with enough time it will be pretty good.

By the time, I changed, I had less than 5 GB of storage left and that's even after I uploaded all my pictures to SkyDrive. I still couldn't connect to WiFi WPA2 with AES encryption.I'll wait until I can upgrade my phone to try another Windows 8 phone. I haven't given up on Windows 8 phones, but it's just not going to be this one.Please, HTC, please support micro SD extensions and WPA2 with AES encryption!!!-------------Update:I've asked two groups of people about this phone. And, I'm getting very different responses from both. I've told both sides the same thing. One group decided not to buy this phone because of it's lack of storage and WiFi connectivity issues (WPA2 with AES encryption). The other group doesn't care. They love the screen, the camera, and the apps. And, they think I've been too harsh on my rating (originally 1 star) based on just the hardware or firmware issues.I still think the storage and WiFi connectivity issues are a big deal but, at the same time, I really like Windows 8. And, I agree that the screen and camera are good. If it's just Windows 8 I would give it a 5 star. The phone by itself is a 1 star. HTC skimped out on the SD card extension, and they need to fix the WiFi firmware issue. So, I'm just gonna change the rating to the middle of the road - 3 stars.-------------I bought this phone recently, and I was ecstatic! I really like the simplistic yet elegant tiled look and feel. It was refreshing from the Android version. And, I develop primarily with Microsoft systems. So, I was looking forward to developing apps on the phone.There are many things about this phone that I like, but unfortunately the cons are starting to add up really quickly. I'm willing to keep the phone and wait for the updates, but as I've told my friends I can't recommend this phone to anyone. In fact, I'd put up a warning sign to wait for the next generation. The phone, like SharePoint, has such great potential, but it needs to be massaged and worked on. As a user ... nope, not yet ... at least, not this phone. Wait for another Windows 8 phone for Verizon.Pros:1. Simple and elegant tiled UI. Makes everything easy to use.2. Phone is light and has a solid feel to it.3. The screen is crystal clear even when outside.4. 2 years of dropbox subscription as a replacement for extended memory.5. Easily connects to Ford Sync (if anyone is interested).6. Easily connects and synchronizes files with Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs. Just click on the checkboxes and press add/sync.7. Internal speakers are good compared to other phones (Samsung Galaxy S3).Cons:1. Can't connect to my WiFi. I use a non-standard security setting (PEAP). For anyone trying to use this phone with an enterprise WiFi security don't get this phone until (if) they update the firmware ... system admins beware!2. No extended SD card support. Only has 16GB of internal memory with a little over 14GB useable. It's just not enough!3. Can't upload documents or video directly to SkyDrive using the SkyDrive app from Microsoft ... only pictures, and through their Notes and Office apps.4. If you're coming from Android, it has a learning curve.5. Battery doesn't last very long. Compared to Samsung S3, I usually get into work with around 86%, but HTC 8x was at 40% (I may have left the GPS on, so make it 60%).6. I can't control location services. I can't turn on wireless tower location services on. It's GPS or nothing. I rarely need pinpoint GPS location. This drains battery.7. Where are the other browsers (Dolphin, Chrome, Firefox)!!! If a site doesn't work with one browser, I usually just switch to another.8. The default browser (IE10) doesn't allow plug-ins.Regarding IE10 ... I'm a plug-in whore! But, most importantly, I use LastPass for most of my passwords and I can't just simply click a button for the auto-fill option. This is killing me! I don't want to go back and forth in order to copy the password and username. And, the browser that comes with LastPass breaks for certain sites such as Pulse.Conclusion:When I first got this phone, I was a happy child, but my happiness quickly burst into tears and frustration. I cannot recommend this phone to my friends and family. I have warned them to stay away from this phone. I think, Windows Phone 8 is a great operating system, but this phone's lack of memory storage and IE10's non-plugin issue has really done a number. I use my phone to carry documents, pictures, music, and application images. And, after 2 days of using this phone, I'm already down to 8GB of free space, especially since I can't upload my non-office documents to SkyDrive - this is after I've been using the memory sparingly (I don't even have any games, yet). And, I'm not willing to pay for Dropbox after 2 years of free subscription when I have so many free options already.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "I REALLY liked my HTC 8x until...", "Author": "runner4funner", "ReviewID": "R3MTU066G5KMPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Being univeristy students, my wife and I dont have a ton of money lying around. I became eligible for an upgrade in June pf 2012 but I didnt want to rush into buying a new phone that i woudnt love. I had never had a smartphone previously, but I felt it was time to finally make 'the jump'. I talked with friends and family, and searched reviews. After several months of saving and searching I finally decided on this phone. I ordered the HTC Windows Phone 8x through Amazon Wireless and received it in good time. I was very impressed, and I quickly fell in love with my new phone. I loved the menu, I loved the cameras, I loved the speed, I loved the apps, and I REALLY loved the HD display. However, 6 days after receiving the phone, I was sitting on the couch watching tv (not even touching my phone) when I hear a 'pop' from the other end of the room where my phone was. When I go to check the noise I see that my phone screen has spontaneously shattered. Nobody had touched it. I was the only person awake. There are no apparent points of impact as seen when a screen shatters from a drop or other hit. I can only guess that the phone over-heated, causing expansion of some of the interior components, which then put pressure on the screen, causing it to break. I am very upset. This is my first smartphone, and I BABIED it. I saved for several months to purchase this new phone. Now I cant get another new one, the price is out of the question, and a repair from HTC will cost $190 (not including shipping). I have basically gotten the 'middle finger' from both HTC and Verizon. I am sincerely hoping that Amazon has better customer support.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I jumped on the bandwagon...", "Author": "Mitch P \"Putty\"", "ReviewID": "R24UD84UPEKMRH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got the Windows phone because of all the reviews I read about it and how great it was.  I took it back the very next day and swapped it for a Galaxy 3.  Why?  1. For a guy who works with his hands, this phones buttons were hard to access and FIND sometimes (i.e. wake up was on top which was hard to do single handed and you had to mash the thin petite little button sometimes, volume would get accidently pressed while waking or putting the phone to sleep).  2. I liked the sleekness of it and the rubbery coating on the back made it feel secure in my palm but this seemed all for naught if I was to get a case which is a MUST for a smart phone.  3.The layout was decent but the \"tiles\" system seemed utilitarian and made it hard (and sometimes irritating) to customize.  It felt like it took away your freedom of customization that Android systems allowed.  You were only allowed black or white for your background and a preset palate of colors for your tiles.  4. The app market was cruddy and none of the apps I wanted were there.  5. When holding the phone to your head, it didnt have a \"phone\" feel...I felt like I was holding a graham cracker to my ear...didnt like it.  This phone has a classiness and a chicness to it but for me, the Galaxy S3 was the better buy and all around better phone in terms of customization, apps, feel, screen size, and expandability.
