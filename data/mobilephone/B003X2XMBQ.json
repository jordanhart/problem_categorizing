Misleading return/refund policy. I was told via e-mail...Quote...\"in order to receive a refund, everything needs to be intact.  Original box, packaging, stickers on the phone, if so you may send it back for a refund less 20% restocking fee. If there are any signs of usage on the phone we cannot accept it back.\"  This response was received when I asked for store CREDIT...not refund! Their policy effectively removes a buyer's ability to even TRY the phone. Well, enough of the complaining.  The phone works well but it is HUGE. So, if you don't wear a XXL glove, you probably will not like this model very much!", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Custom Made for AT&T;", "Author": "James J.

First off it looks very slick in my opinion.  QWERTY keyboard has very nice sized button that are tactile enough that you know you pushed it, so no run away repeating characters.  Display is very vibrant and clear.  This bar style phone is bigger than my old Blackjack 2, and I like that.  It has a solid feel but yet is lighter than my Blackjack2  I purchased this as I feel the need to have a Windows Mobile phone.  With my job I like having certain documents on the phone.  This makes for great reference to important things for me when I don't have access to the information at work.  That and syncing with Outlook always makes keeping calendar and contacts a breeze.  The converstaion threads with texting is a new thing for me, and I must say I really like that ability.  Dual speakers located under the back cover do a really good job on speaker phone and playing MP3's.Now for some of the bad.  Don't expect the battery life that is reported.  These phones have been out of production for a years so the batteries are a little older.  You'd think having been in a box it wouldn't be too bad, and it isn't.  Overall battery life is very good.  Another thing is that the Mobile Office apps do not support Office 2010 out of the box.  Looks like there is an update that may get you there.  2003 works great, 2007 requires an update also I think.  No WiFi available on this phone, that would have a great feature for this phone.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best simple phone", "Author": "Hypnos", "ReviewID": "R2KR2ZS3RV4JV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a simple PDA that fills out all your office needs (email, internet, calendar, corporate instant messaging, personal instant messaging, etc) you may want one of this phones.

I bought the software to the same seller \"The OEM Shop\" and when I received my package I only received my USB cable but the CD was missing .... I sent an email explainig my situation, on October14th I received an email informing that they were going to send me another CD, in October 29th I sent another email asking if they sent it again because I haven't been able to sync my cell phone with my computer and I bought it on September 24th. On November 1st I received ANOTHER email asking me to double check that someone in my house does not have the order and they included my tracking number. I checked in USPS and that was the tracking number for the first package the one with the USB cable, I sent another email asking them to DOUBLE CHECK my order but guess what?
