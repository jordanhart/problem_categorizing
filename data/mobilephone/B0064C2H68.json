If you are looking for a change into this operating system, this phone is the option you are looking for.It is a great phone, at an accesible cost.Pros:*Big screen, I love It.*Operating system, super intuitive.*Good performance for games, apps, etc. I've try Mass Effect and heavy apps on It. The phone is doing great.*Lightweight, and many others (check description).Cons: So far I haven't found one, but the dealer has to put in the review that the phone comes with European charger. I mean, international version is not only Europe :-/Great phone, totally recomended.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Xperia Arc S unlocked", "Author": "AlexG", "ReviewID": "RPGJT0T5EKTA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hmmm as far as what I expected from it, it exceeds it, as far as the features I wanted, it does them all one way or another. I really like the phone a lot, I like the Xperia bundled in it, I love how it interacts with other sony products for example a Vaio or a Sony TV.

I use the phone for email, chat and browsing and so far it works good, with no lags.So, why 3 stars? because it feels cheap. It doesnt feel like a USD 400+ phone.
