Like everything there are pros and cons. It is well priced, decently featured, and appears to be well built. The software is quite limited in that you can only download apps from their app center, and that to me seems to be this phones biggest short fall. I am by no means an expert on smartphones, but the software does seem a little more cumbersome to operate then other phones that friends of mine have. These are my initial impressions, but like I said, I've only had it a short time, and like with anything, as I get more and more familiar with it I'll adapt to make it more user friendly for me. I think for the price it is a viable option for a lot of people looking for an entry level phone.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B92ZGY8"}}
