{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful Phone with One Caveat", "Author": "George E. Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3GVLST5ZLQS6Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone (in Germany) a few days ago and would have paid less for it on Amazon.  It has a gorgeous, very bright and high resolution display - so bright that I have kept it set at minimum brightness.  I tested it outside today, under a partially cloudy sky - and I could clearly read the display when it was set to maximum brightness!!  LG has done a surprisingly good job of customizing Android (2.2.2 for now) on it.  Info on the internet indicates that LG will release Gingerbread for it in SEP 11 for those concerned about 2.3 and higher.  It has lots of extra widgets and apps - like battery and cellular data usage - that you would normally have to get from the market. Excellent battery life despite the bright display - it's kinda early to tell but I've gotten two full days with normal usage.  Cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity are also great - and no sound problems or dropped calls. I have two concerns with it though.  First, the main part of the phone is very well built but the battery cover is too thin in my opinion - the phone itself doesn't creak or bend but it sure seems as if the back/battery cover won't take much abuse.  That being said, the phone does feel solid with the battery cover locked in place.  And, related to this, the battery cover is also tricky to remove so this isn't a phone that you would want to frequently swap the chips in.  Last but not least, the included Euro charger is huge and it looks pure Stone Age - shame on you LG!! ***** Edited to add a couple more points: This is a small thing but a big plus in my opinion:  LG modified Android to allow screen captures on the P970!  All you have to do - kind of like on the iPhone - is press home and power at the same time and the screen is captured. Also - after two full days of moderate usage (easy to track battery usage in Android) it was at 42% battery remaining.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "M\u00f3nica C. \"Mokab\"", "ReviewID": "REC9R1L1CH2GU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using my LG 970 Optimus Black for two months now and I simply love it! I bought it unlocked for use in Uruguay, South America. It's light and slim, very comfortable to handle and use, with an awsome display, very clear and bright, even under direct sunlight, and also very responsive to the touch. Very fast on the Internet and mail. It also takes very good pictures with or without flash, with lots of settings to personalize your shots as you wish. I've downloaded many cool applications from the Android Market, most of them free or with very low cost. The only thing I'm not completely satisfied with is battery life. With a moderate use of Internet, WiFi and 3G on only during the day, it lasts less than a day. However, after installing Juicedefender Ultimate from the Android Market, it now lasts aproximately a day and a half ... not that bad. But its excellent performance and sound quality greatly compensate for this drawback.January 9, 2012.After 5 months of use, I've kind of fallen out of love with it... well, not completely, but it's not my prince charming any more... I've had a serious event of denial to reboot after running out of battery, and had to take it to the service where the only option was to make a hard reset, thus losing all my personal settings and downloads, luckily not my pictures which were stored in the mini card! I read a blog on this rebooting issue, and apparently it happens frequently with this model, also when you try to block the display with the on/off button. I'm very attentive now to the battery level and have downloaded a blocking-display application, so that I don't have to use the power button to do it. This has worked so far.March 5, 2012.2 months having past since my last review, I must say that I've run out of battery three or four times, and also had to turn off the phone because it had frozen, and I had no problem whatsoever upon turning it back on. I made sure each time to wait some minutes before turning it on after turning it off or starting the battery charge, perhaps that made the difference. In summary: I'm very happy with my LG 970 again!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish I bought a different phone - battery life is unacceptable", "Author": "Ievgeniia", "ReviewID": "RNTGZU72G2DTZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to update my review - this is the slowest piece of junk I've ever had. It freezes all the times, takes about 10 secs to open any app, keyboard app (when I'm trying to type a text) stops working at least once a day. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this phone. It's trash.When I first got the phone I was very pleased with it - nice design, great bright display.First problem I ran into in texting - it's pretty bad, keys are non-responsive, I usually had to touch the space 3-4 times before it works. Very frustrating. Scrolling down when browsing is really bad too - it either doesnt scroll at all, or scrolls way too much. Even more frustrating. And the worst thing is battery. I don't expect it to last for days, but it won't even last half a day. And I don't use it much at all. Recently it started dying overnight. I would go to bed when it's fully charged, wake up in the morning and it's at 30%. Seriously? I don't have a data plan, tried switching of Wi-fi, nothing helps. I checked the battery use - 50% Mobile Standby, 49% - Mobile Idle. WOW! I have no idea what's going on, but it's unacceptable. I really wish I chose a differnet phone. Can't believe it has great reviews.Would like to improve my review - the battery issue has disappeared on itself, now it lasts for a couple of days. Not sure why it was so bad when I first got it, but glad it's fine now. It's still a little slow at times, which is frustrating, but I don't expect much from a phone in this price range.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Check its origin if you can", "Author": "Phoebe Le", "ReviewID": "R328OV0YGPBMZ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first bought LG P970H in September 2011. That phone was from Spain or it was exported to Spain, i'm not sure. Its languages were only English and Spanish. It worked very well. The touch screen was very sensitive. The color spectrum was great. I loved it a lot. Unfortunately, it was stolen when I shopped at a shoes store in late March 2012. How miserable I was!Then I had to buy another one. People suggested me buy iphone. But for me, LG P970 was the best. It was light, slim, and had a wide screen. I loved the camera functions too. It was great for people who like taking pictures of themselves. It was really nice for playing video games too.However, this time I bought LG P970 from another seller. The phone was to be sold to Asian markets like China, Indonesia, Korea, and Vietnam, I guess, because the user book has languages of all these countries. I felt something weird this time, and it turned out to be true. The phone operates at a slower rate. The touch screen is not as sensitive as the previous one. Out-of-service condition happens at times.Still, I love Android. It has a lot of free stuffs. For example, I like taking pictures myself and I find Camera Effects and LittlePhoto applications are awesome, much better than Instagram.Anyway, I still recommend this phone to anybody. Just be careful to check its origin first before deciding to purchase. LG P970H from Spain is a suggestion.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone", "Author": "Sid", "ReviewID": "R3L4YEB7P22EII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for good smart phone for less than 200$.I am presently T-mobile customer and want phone which works with T-mobile frequency.

Stanton \"L S\"", "ReviewID": "R1AEBPM8H19KTW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After quite a bit of comparison shopping I thought I found a great starter smartphone.  I love the screen clarity and the rest of the reviews on the internet convinced me to choose this phone.  I was looking forward to using this phone for years to come.  I got it today and to get started I called a local Global Wireless network provider who uses the Verizon cell towers.  They informed me that just because this phone's network spec supported GSM did not automatically guarantee the Verizon Wireless Network allows this phone in their service. They had never heard of this phone. I also called Verizon and sure enough, it is not among \"their list of tested and approved\" phones. Turns out I also was not fully comprehending what unlocked phone meant. I thought I could use my new LG P970 Optimus unlocked phone with any wireless network of my choice provided the technical details were within the network providers parameters.  I'm still not clear what unlocked means.  Now I'll be paying a restocking fee to return it, and sadly I would rather not return it, but A T & T is a more expensive network provider.  It takes time to compare shop for a good phone if you don't want to be forced to buy from your local wireless provider.  I also found after receiving the phone, in order to save photos taken from the two cameras you have to have an external memory card. So you may as well buy either the 16GB or the 32GB flash memory card at the same time you buy the phone to fully utilize it's capabilities.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Optimus android Smartphone", "Author": "D.

But on this phone I can't type very fast because it reads my input wrong half the time and often I have to bang on the screen harder to get it to register the keystroke.I'm on the second device as the first one died after 40days, that had the same issues.  The new replacement was sent to me quickly, I'll give the carrier credit for prompt service, but with the new one running updated 2.3 operating system, none of the problems have been resolved.2_The phone interface is very stupid, the moment the call connects the screen goes blank, almost all calls now require user to punch in a number to get to the menue of choices, doesn't matter if its pharmacy, Dr.office, phone company, or wherever you're calling, until you can navigate your way through the options you can't get to a live voice, right?  That is why this interface is so dumb!  instantly the moment call connects screen goes blank regardless of what time-out you set your screen to, that is so irritating!3_The web/ui is as bad as the phone, the session you're in goes up in smoke, vapor with no apparent reason about 20% of the time!  If you were on a form you've lost everything, you have to start all over again!4_The camera with the stereo-scope (3D-like) is able to hone in on subject and focus quicker than most other phones which is a plus, but the end result in 5M is very grainy and looks more like a cheap 1Megapixel of eras past, NOT all megapixels are the same, LG obviously didn't spend more on a quality hi-density CCD here.  Picture quality is OK for posting on Facebook but forget getting prints out of it.5_Audio app which is pre-loaded on the device is garbage and annoying.  Imagine, it rings you go to get the call, you plug in your headset to be hands free and upon inserting the headset jack into the phone, the stupid audio player pops up and blasts the first song on the play list at full volume while you're trying to carry on a conversation, that's really special.6_App choices for this phone are very scarce compared to more acceptable brands like xyz (I won't mention competing brands because I'm nobody's troll), you'll discover that for example the CHASE online banking app won't even work on this LG!Its end of my day and I'm too tired to list all the other issues with the device, but in a nutshel if you're not a power user, you don't expect a lot form your phone, you're happy just making calls and surf facebook occasionally, then you might be thrilled!  But why spend so much for a substandard device when you can get cheaper phones that deliver that much for a lot less money?At face value, the 3D-like feature is sexy, that novelty wears off after a week unless you have a child that likes to watch the pre-packaged 3D gallery, there its a great phone for a 4yr old!", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Mario Henriquez", "ReviewID": "RYJ4YX8CAGLGA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I bought this phone based on the reviews I read and they are so miss leading, I wanted a smart phone to replace my Galaxy S phone as an upgrade to a front and back camara on a phone and I'm very disappointed with this phone.
