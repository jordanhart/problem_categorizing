The unit itself is built solid as a rock, very durable but once you turn it on and try to use the features you are quickly frustrated by the lack of user friendliness and the terrible lack of memory. You constantly have to go into task manager, thats right task manager (this is a miniature version of the windows that you use on your computer) and close tasks to get the camera to function. If you have one too many things open it won't work AND when you exit back to the home screen the phone does not automatically close Apps you were using, they stay running in the backround and have to manually be closed in task manager. The keyboard was an awkward size for my fingers and to send a text you have to go to MESSAGES, then MENU, then select the type of message, E mail or SMS or MMS, THEN you have to go to folders and select NEW. It a 3 or 4 step process just to text vs just hitting an icon and going to town. The camera takes decent pics for a low pix unit but like I said you have to make sure you keep the memory clear. It's just a terrible operating system, totally inefficiant. I definitely would not recommend this phone.The dust cover for the charging port broke off the second day.
