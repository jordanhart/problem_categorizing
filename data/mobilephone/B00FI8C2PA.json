The Lumia 1020 will let you manually change almost all aspect of the camera (except aperture) to take the shot YOU want, not the machine.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fastest International (and non) shipping I've ever had.", "Author": "Luca Ghezzi", "ReviewID": "RWIAON68IG8T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pack arrived 3 days after placing the order, at an estimated 3+ weeks of waiting; that was truly impressive;I did not factor custom taxes when I placed the order, but the cost still happened to be inferior or at least not too higher than expected (from Italy you oughta factor in an extra 30 Euros or 40 USD).The package was (thankfully), well sealed, the content was as new as it can get, the American adaptor had to be replaced with Western Europe counterpart (why can't there be one damn lone plug still goes beyond my comprehension), that wasn't a big problem however;As for the product itself:- as stated by the carrier, the product is Factory Unlocked indeed; put a Tim Micro Sim card which was read right away;- around 4 days after delivery and it has been working just fine;- the International model counts as many language options as I can think of, including Italian, Eastern European countries, Asian, etc.;- the Here Drive + allows to download GPS maps for using them even without a SIM Card, which I find much appreciated;- the store is indeed still low with the number of apps available (of course that depends on what people are looking for; \"common\" apps such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype, Youtube, etc can be found anywhere, including the Windows Store). As far as the Apple Siri counterpart goes, Ask Ziggy, it still is quite buggy and some functions are not working too well, but the inbuilt voice command option responds well;- tho it takes some time to get the hang at the camera settings, once you do, the quality of the photos you can achieve is outstanding;- free Microsoft Office is welcome;- it took awhile to charge and will dry out on battery quite fast; the Camera Grip accessory oughta help with this issue;Overall: If you like the phone, 0 problems with shipping and handling, probably best to order this if you live in the States, but if you remember to account custom taxes, I'd recommend to order this one.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, worth the money", "Author": "Michael S.", "ReviewID": "RDRCY06OLVU8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect, it's an awesome phone, worth the hype.

Last week I tried to activate the Nokia phone with ( strait talk )  phone is activated, I can  make calls and text  and receive them, but cant connect for data.  I have called the tech support at strait talk few times but no luck connecting to internet, we fill in all the required fields, but the save button stays grayed, can not save the settings.

I was a bit concerned about changing to Windows Phone after many years of Android, but it proved to be a good decision. The apps available perfectly fit my needs. If something, I only miss Chrome and an official Gmail app, but these are just out of question at present. The phone itself is very much what I expected, somewhat bulky and clumsy, but I find it likeable. Otherwise it's fast, responsive, enough battery for at least a day, but mostly more, and has an amazing camera. Oh, and despite all my expectations, I just love the camera grip, it really helps a lot.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$439.99", "Features": "Nokia Lumia 1020 Black RM-875 (Factory Unlocked) 41MP PureView camera , 32GB , 2GB Ram", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 1020 Black RM-875 (Factory Unlocked) 41MP PureView camera , 32GB , 2GB Ram", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yCbgL9U9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FI8C2PA"}}
