{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "dm", "ReviewID": "R6PDYTCQLB6HV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had previously purchased the n9000 but returned it; This phone is a perfect upgrade to its predecessor.  I am completely happy with the purchase.  Here's the rundown;Pro's:Every feature works as expectedHeadset jack accepts generic 3.5mm plug, unlike previous versionQuality fit and finishBright screenCamera and flash work surprisingly well. It takes exceptional night shots; panoramic shots are a little \"choppy\"Phone is overall very fluid; it just works.  Works better than some name brand smart phones I have usedPhone shares many of the same chipsets as the popular phone it looks likeCon's:Lack of accessories (Cases, screen protector, etc.)Has a very thin, generic battery so battery life is a bit shorter than you would get with a name brand phone.  This is especially true if you are in a low/no service area.  Being mindful of this and shutting the cell radios and using wifi when in my basement office increases life dramatically.  I also frequently use airplane mode while I sleep and see only a few percent of battery life gone when I awake.I occasionally share this phone with my girlfriend, putting her T-Mobile SIM card in the second slot.  I have noticed degraded, decreased, and/or sometimes finicky service when both SIM cards are on.  Very minor however, and the Dual SIM feature works perfectly.When I had the n9000, the pre-boot test/diag menu was in English.  The menu on the n9330 is in Cantonese.  This probably only matters to those who want to develop or tinker.  Not a biggie, but thought I should mention itAll in all, a very nice phone at a price I can live with.  You don't have to trade an arm, leg, or take out a second mortgage to buy it.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS", "Author": "John L.

Boy, was I wrong. The phone was shipped and delivered quickly, but upon opening the packaging, I received something tooooootally different. The phone was GIGANTIC and slow and looked cartoony. It had no memory, the camera was laughable, and open apps would force closed every 10 minutes. Overall, I regret this purchase, and do not wish this on my worst enemy.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Return", "Author": "ben", "ReviewID": "RTVR102AY8PPI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was worst than the older model .
