I was impressed that it was \"unlocked\" (could be used by any company).  NOT TRUE.  The only signal in our area is Verizon, and upon taking the phone to Verizon to be set up, we found that they will not set it up and it can only be used on AT&T; or T-mobile.  In our area there is no signal from these 2 companies.  So, because we had opened the package at the store, the company (Rugged Phone Specialists) stated that it was no longer \"NEW\", and charged us 30%($70) upon returning the phone.  They also said it was \"dirty, used\"-UNTRUE.  Obviously we could not use it.  In my opinion it was quite the rip-off and I will certainly not take a chance with this company again.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Network standard : GSM:900/1800/1900 complies with EDGE/GPRS.", "Name": "Sonim XP3 Quest Pro Ultra-Rugged Cell Phone (Yellow)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LABDUFGPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004PJ8RN4"}}
