I docked a point for the slide out qwerty because the left half of it where it shares letter and numbers is not as easy/fast to use as my prior phones. the pressure points should be directly under the letters and not the numbers imo. it slows me down a little when texting.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Dylan", "ReviewID": "R2B1L6RAMQNVBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone is great calling and txting is awesome on this phone camera works well. long lasting battery charge i get about 5 hours if i use every minute. but to use once and a while during the day ur good for the whole day.

Like every time i would go to slide my phone it would go to the menu screen and wouldn't let me exit out of it or press any arrow buttons. it works fine now but u just have to adjust the top correctly.\"", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this from Essex Technology Group", "Author": "Todd K Bach", "ReviewID": "R1FQJIE3OHQJHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do NOT buy this item from Essex Technology Group!!They don't even know what a 'LOCKED CELL PHONE' is.  When you receive the locked cell phone from them, and notify them of that fact.  They will not only require that you pay shipping to return it, but they will not even respond to you about the fact that it is a locked phone.  I even sent them the MEID number of the cell phone they shipped to me, they didn't even know how to research the fact that it is a locked phone.  They are stupid, possibly fraudulent.
