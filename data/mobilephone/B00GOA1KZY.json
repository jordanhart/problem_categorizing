NOTE: When I got it, it was originally in 24-hour format so you will have to change that later most likely.\u2022 Set the date, year, and day. NOTE: When I got it, the date format was in year, month, and date. You can change it to Month, day, year, or Day, month, and year if you wish.What I like about it: It has dual-sim capability [meaning that you can put two sim cards in ti] and it can work internationally. The user interface is very simple and easy to understand. The phone is light and not cumbersome in comparison to the smartphone that I previously used. When using the flashlight the light is bright enough to use in dark areas.  After using the FM radio, I was surprised primarily because it picked up of the radio station channels.  As for features, it does not have much but in this case, it has some internet capability and Bluetooth. However, I have not tested those out.  The camera is simple but not like the smart phone or iPod Touch quality.What I do not like about it:\u2022 It only has one wallpaper\u2022 It only has one ringtoneIn summary: The LYNXX-X2S cell phone is very basic. It has the necessary features that most would need. If you just need a phone that can call and text then this would be your phone.  Remember that this is NOT a smart phone. If you need a smart phone go elsewhere!", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone for the money", "Author": "Theresa M.
