I am very pleased with the delivery. It was really fast.Packed in good manner. Battery was 70% charged, started without any problem. This is unlocked model and I used AT&T; SIM to it. It worked without any problem.It is only 1 day since I am using it so it is too early to give any comments. So far it is very good. I haven't faced any problems with it.Very light weight compared to existing windows phone 7 HTC HD7.Call voice quality is not that good but with this cost it is acceptable.UPDATE: AT&T; Data plan is not working with this phone. I spoke to AT&T; customer service and even if they registered this Phone's IMEI number in the account, Data Communication is still not working. I guess I just wasted the money on this 'Cananda' based phone. Once I used Nokia E72 unlocked phone with AT&T;, and it worked like charm. I wish I could have the same Nokia phone handy.UPDATE 8/22/2013: After reviewing an user comment, I realized that I gave wrong feedback. Changing 4 star to 2 Star.

With that said it does not take away from the quality and in fact adds a little bit to the cool factor as you will be the only kid on the block sporting a Chic. Also calling it a Chic will get you teased by your friends. If you have an ATT or T Mobile you will have to get on line for some special instructions on how to get the web up and running.
