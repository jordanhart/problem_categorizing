He doesn't really like that the screen is so small but that's a comment on his eyesight not the phone. It works fine, his only complaint is that he can't see on screen when a voicemail was left. But that's something that you can find out when listening to voicemails anyway.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Brent A.

Didn't want a fancy 'smart' phone.  Like all the features this phone has and the battery life seems to be good.  I like how the camera feature works, it also has a video that I haven't tried yet.  Also received the phone really quickly, before the estimated arrival date!!  Will probably be ordering another one for my Husband.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery dies after a day of use - The Screen Display messed up after two weeks of use", "Author": "Joel L Steinberg", "ReviewID": "R1OP9S7BQ50LT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The reason that i'm not giving this phone one star is that when it did work it worked just as I needed.  Additionally, I'd like to believe I got a faulty phone and the rest work fine.
