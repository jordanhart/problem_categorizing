HD video, great Recorder, specially if your a creative musicians and want to do some quick field recording, quality is so good you can work it on your DAW software and get decent CD Quality.CONSThe microusb charging dort had to be replaced as it stopped functioning, no charge nor usb 2 computer capabilites, luckly Kies software as it works by wifi or blutooth, still slow compared to standard 2.0 usb ports.The sylus pen, you can use it, but you cant really write or draw very precisly, ive worked on this for almost two years, i draw, trust me, this stylus feature is not something youll be using alot, its not that good, if ever the time comes you want to use it.Battery Life is very poor, this is because of the huge output on the fantastic HD LED sreen, but ANKER sells on amazon these great wallcharger and 2 higher ampage battery for like 25 bucks, better quality than stock battery.CONCLUSIOnThis is an outstanding phone for a smartphone power user. This is what you want to get if you don't want to have both a phone and tablet, its small enough to be a phone, and large enough to be a tablet.Ive had this phone for almost two years and still dont find convinced to switch, not even to my wifes and friends S3's and nexus phones.If you want this type of screen for your daily use, i recomend to get the Note II, its faster, stylus pen works alot better.Samsung should put in better quality usb port charger. malfunction of this part happens to all galaxy models eventually.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wanted a larger screen", "Author": "Ronnie Mullis", "ReviewID": "R1AKGLWFPYXJ1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously had the Samsung Proclaim on Straight Talk (Verizon towers). I wanted a larger screen and Straight Talk told me that I had to go with an AT&T; compatible phone, so I chose the Note. Since this phone was less than half the cost of the S4, I chose it.

Got it in the mail super-quick.  The big screen is awesome coz I dont have to squint at anything.  Comes with Jelly Bean 4.1.2 OS on it right out of the box! This device is also great for folks with not-so-small hands, feels more comfortable than a regular-sized phone.  Read other reviews (not amazon) and some folks complained about the battery life for this device. (This thing get awesome battery life so far, puts my old motorola smartphone to shame!) Anyways, here are a couple tips that I'm sure those folks didn't follow...  First, do a few charge-discharge cycles, which means start using the phone as soon as u can, let the battery run down to 5% to no more than 15%. (DO NOT RUN THE BATTERY DOWN TO 0% AT FIRST) Batteries these days have their own sort of \"memory\", so if u charge your phone when it's at 50% for example, the phone may think that the battery is almost dead when it shows 50%.  Ok, after u r sure the device's battery is at 5% to 15% charge, let it charge to 100%.  To get a true 100% charge u have to let the device's battery charge while the device is turned off.  Again, that part about the 'memory' of the battery: if u let it charge to a true 100%, it will charge more fully more often.  Repeat those steps at least 3 times.  Futhermore, the Galaxy Note should ideally only need 2.5 to 3 hours to fully charge the battery, so........ DO NOT CHARGE OVERNIGHT, AS THIS CAN WEAKEN THE BATTERY LIFE in the short term and the long term.  If people do all these things for their device's battery (Galaxy Note or not) it can extend the battery's performance.  I'd HIGHLY recommend this device to anyone needing a solid, well-constructed, comfortable device.  Phone calls work good (i'm on at&t; prepaid), texts, instant chats, the S-Pen, it all works great.  If u properly charge the battery, the battery life issue that others have had, should not be a problem for you.

I couldn't wait to swap the sim  card from my old phone to this one. This phone does everything that they say and more. But I had a problem because my service carrier is T-Mobile and this came in an AT&T; packaging, I set up my phone and everything was running smooth except making and receiving calls.  So it was time to call T-Mobile customer care to connect my phone for me. That's when the problem started. I was on the phone with a service rep for almost an hour. She did everything she could to connect this phone on the network and it couldn't work. My guess is that this phone is not unlocked because the lady that was helping me told me that there's nothing wrong with the connection nor the sim card but the phone itself is not unlocked so therefore it won't work on T-Mobile network. She said that after she suggested that I should put the sim card back to my old phone to see what happens and the phone worked perfectly.I am not going to throw any stones yet, I'm going to call the seller and let them know what happened and see what their response is going to be. I gave it a 4 because it couldn't work when it was supposed to but neither than that, I'd have give it a 5 star rating. It's a great phone. Big and clear screen resolution. I can check my email and go on Facebook and You tube even though it's not connected on any network. It really is a kool phone, I like it, no let me rephrase that, I love it a lot. I just wish that my little problem with it is going to be solved sooner than later. Otherwise I will recommend it to anyone especially if your service provider is AT&T.;", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "jshconn", "ReviewID": "R3PXG7P2VVVOW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, the Samsung Galaxy Note i717 is an excellent phone with a stunning screen.

I purchased it from Top 10 cells and, as promised, it was carrier unlocked. I am a T-mobile user and had written down all the apn information expecting to have to set up data access, voice mail and so forth, but nope, as soon as I inserted the SIM it realized it was T-mobile and automatically set those functions up. I also used Samsung's Kies program to quickly update the included Android version from ICS to Jellybean (which it did with no problems). Since I'm using a T-Mobile Sim, I won't be getting 4g speeds but if I'm in an area where T-Mobile has refarmed their 3G to the 1900 band (some larger cities) you will still get some pretty awesome speeds. Since this is an ATT phone I was absolutely amazed at the amount of bloatware that carriers place on their phones (I have always used non-carrier unlocked phones in the past). This includes stuff like ATT Navigation (an app with a monthly charge that does not work as well as the free Google Maps included in Android). Because of the amount of bloat apps which can not be uninstalled in a non-rooted phone I rooted the phone, which was simple to do by following directions on the web. The easiest way is probably to search YouTube for a video explanation on how to root this model. After rooting the phone I uninstalled all the unneeded apps which increased the smoothness and speed of the phone.This phone now has 90 percent of the functionality of the new Note 3 at a fraction of the cost. It is still a large phone with a beautiful screen that works really well. Remember, this phone first came out towards the end of 2011, so there is a bit of lag compared to the newest powerhouses, but you still get the stylus, can run any Android app, and have a very clear, bright screen. Although this is a large phone you don't feel or look too funny using it to place or take calls, and the size makes video viewing and web browsing great compared to using a phone with a 3.5-4.5\" screen. If you're willing to invest an hour or two in rooting (make sure the phone works first since rooting will probably void your warranty) and de-bloating this phone is a fantastic value.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I just love it - great phone with minor flaws.", "Author": "Amz2000", "ReviewID": "R2IZFI8DB64LB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received absolutely brand new phone from seller \"Wireless Extra\".  This phone is unlocked as described.  And the screen is huge, sharp and clear.  HD movies play beautifully.  Came with the latest Jellybean 4.1.2 installed, awesome!Yes, for many of you who wanted a prepaid phone, it works for Straight Talk (AT&T; Sim Card) and T-Mobile.  I tried on both networks and all have 4G LTE speed.  Great I ditched my Sprint and go for prepaid plan, saving lots of money.  I'll give MetroPCS a shot after I'm done with Straight Talk.  Will update how MetroPCS network speed.Run Speedtest.net on ATT and T-Mobile 4G LTE hit over 10Mbps without any problem.  I have better LTE rate on T-Mobile than AT&T.;However it does have some flaws as well - Bloatware, a lot of them.  AT&T; preloaded bunch of their home brewed bloatware.  They eat up tons of internal memory.  Unless you rooted your phone and removed those unwanted apps, you just have to live with them and they do drag the overall performance.You will see lags when you launch phone dialer or switching between apps.  Considering it's a 2-year-old phone with just dual core and 1GB RAM, I can live with that for a sub $300 price phone.Battery life is miserable.  It couldn't even last 8 hours of normal usage.  Need to charge everyday and in the car to keep it floating.Overall this is definitely a great phone for it's quality and price.  Highly recommended.Updated: Called MetroPCS and tried to use their service.  What a joke, their customer said my phone is still locked! I have been with T-mobile prepaid and Straighttalk and no problem at all.  That's why this company is dead and bought by T-mobile.  You can't activate the SIM Card online and you need to call them and the customer service knows nothing.

It had many features, functions, and fruits of labor.It is a big phone.  So think twice about how you will carry it around with you.I have been poking about with this phone since I got it yesterday, and it has so many things to learn that I will take a long time before I figure out all of it.  From what I have seen, there is a lot customization allowed along with a lot of pre-loaded apps.  Example: The memo app is very nice for it to allow stylus writing, text writing, attachment insertion, voice writing/recording, ability to share it, etc...The connectivity of the phone is also very strong.  It seems a bit slow with hotmail for some reason, but everything else runs fast involving the net (4G / Wifi home speed).The camera captures great detail.  Dual camera is a nice option.  I have yet to test it for video calls.It has a fast-charging, removable battery.  The charge seems to last quite a while (I keep power saving features on such as screen turning off after a minute.).  There are many options to optimize your battery life when it is idle or to make sure your phone functions are not disabled if you want them to remain connected.The phone allows for expandable storage which is essential, in my opinion.  There seems to be an option to transfer apps from the phone to the microSD card as well.The product for the price is great.  If you have time, the Galaxy Note 2 might drop a bit more in price.

It's is arguable that it is mainly a phone but its functions says otherwise. I use it as a tablet first for prodction, school work, etc. then phone secondary, for, of course, for communication/text, calls, etc. It is the a perfect size if you don't think of it as a phone only (and folks seem intimidated by \"big phones\").I won't get into the techncial specifics but basically, it's the same as Samsung Galaxy SII with little exceptions. I've upgraded to OS JellyBean, and love the extras in the stylus however, the stylus can go a little out of control on keyboards.I don't like how the power button is positioned exactly opposite the volume control on the other side of the phone. I clasp the device, using my thumb to powerup/down but find that my other four fingers are latched onto the volume control. Hard to keep away from, so it calls for using 2 hands (which I'm trying to avoid if I'm not using it as a tablet). S Note app is a bit annoying. I don't need to use a template but it won't let me create a note without one (at lease I haven't figured out how to control that yet).Nevertheless, the device runs and displays my applications very well. I am encouraged to watch Netflix, and run bigger apps with ease.

She'd seen me using my work-provided Droid X2 for the past two years, and was finally fed up with the tiny thing she was using.  Plus AT&T; was charging her a premium for every text message that she would receive since her plan was voice-only.The Note arrived in brand-new condition, and a power cable with a microUSB connector, along with a pair of ear buds were included in the box.  However, it did NOT come with a microUSB data cable, so I was fortunate that I could use the one that came with my Droid X2.I put the battery in the phone and powered it up.  After the AT&T; splash screen went away and the home screen appeared, I checked the settings and verified that the phone had Android \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" loaded on it.  So the very next thing I did was make sure the battery had a sufficient charge to handle an update to the Android OS, then I downloaded and installed a program called \"Samsung Kies\" on my laptop.  That program detected the phone and notified me that an upgrade to Android \"Jelly Bean\" 4.1.2 was available, so all I had to do was hit okay and leave the phone connected to my laptop while the program took care of the update.30 minutes later the phone was updated and everything looked fine.  The appearance of the user interface is just like the one on my wife's Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, which thankfully meant a smaller learning curve for her.  The response time was quicker than I would've imagined for a 2 year old phone, and the depth of color and the crispness of the display was fantastic.  I connected the phone to the house wi-fi and began the process of updating every app on the phone as well as downloading stuff I knew she'd want.A gripe I had at this point was the amount of AT&T; branded software that was on the phone, with their icons cluttering a couple of the screens.  I did what I could to clean out as much of the icon clutter as possible since I couldn't uninstall the software, then began the process of migrating her cell service from AT&T; to Straight Talk.  The migration process was not without its issues since I had to be sure my wife knew her pin, etc on her AT&T; account before we could even attempt to move her number over.  Fortunately we got that resolved quickly, and then we followed the instructions in the Straight Talk \"BYOP kit\" that we bought from Walmart to complete activation of the SIM and the porting of her phone number.During the process of the migration, the Straight Talk website advised that it could take anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days to complete the transfer from AT&T.;  Fortunately for us, however, it only took about 90 minutes to get service up and running on her phone, and yes, I was able to verify that she was getting 4G LTE speeds.We were also warned that if we let our service lapse with Straight Talk, my wife would lose her phone number.  Since we'd just gone through all that trouble to port it over, we decided to enable the auto-refill option (requires a credit card) and also installed the Straight Talk app (available for free on Google Play) so that we could keep track of her service status.From a usability standpoint, one of the biggest things I've noticed over the past 24 hours is that the battery charge gets consumed rather quickly.  I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that we had wi-fi enabled or not, but within 5 hours I was plugging the phone in to charge it.  Charging took about 90 minutes to complete, which was refreshing since my Droid X2 takes 2-3 hours, but an hour later her phone's battery charge level was at 81%.  Others have mentioned this problem, so I know we're not alone here.Still, I'm hoping there's something that can be done, short of rooting the phone and uninstalling the bloatware, to improve battery life and efficiency.  (Note: While I've seen that a bigger battery is available for the phone, its reviews were rather poor)  Alternatively, I may have to give her one of those portable charging units that she can use to extend battery life when she's not near a plug-in.  I use a \"Photive Powerbank\" for my Droid X2, for example and it lets me double my use time between actual chargings.Overall, the phone itself is fun to use and has far better capabilities than my wife was expecting for her first smartphone.  She loves the big screen and has already sent a multitude of free texts to at least one of her friends.  Given the price of the phone and the power it has, the Note should serve her needs much better and cheaper than if we had gotten a newer phone from a provider and tied ourselves to a 2 year contract.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone without stylus, andc continuous flashing display", "Author": "tbuck", "ReviewID": "R326FSZCH56V8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone through Tablet Distributors.

The seal looks dirty and broken.The LCD already had a plastic cover that looks old (there were 2 bubbles).Nevertheless, I tried if its working-so I dont have to bother returning it.I am a very busy person-but when we brought it to T Tmobile-the gmal account was not connecting to play store.I certainly am soooo disappointed and it is unlikely that I will advice you to buy this phone from this company.I am definetely returning it.Having received a defective phone (and returning it now)does not define Amazon-as the other products I have bought were okay.But I just felt cheated inside. I hope that those who handle  and sends products will be more efficient and send a NEW PRODUCT that all hardworking customers like me so richly deserve.It is so stressful to read all the return policies, download the return authorization, find a printer, call office to verify, wait for UPS to come by, return each piece inside the box-just to return.I hope that this wont happen to other customers.It is not easy to earn money nowadays.I just got an email from the seller that I was sent what I wanted to receive-a new phone.My reply: NO-I got a defective one.NO-it is not new.  If a phone already has a plastic cover on the LCD when I received it-it is not new.When the phone box seal was broken and dirty-it is not new. If its not connecting to play store/if it simply stops connecting to internet all of a sudden/then it is not new.I am telling the truth and would like to help other buyers-hence I am being honest here.Please stop emailing me-I already have too much stress from your company.Please stop harrassing me by you're emails. I will still buy from Amazon(as I did in the past).But am doing this for the other possible buyers.Stop emailing me.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save money", "Author": "JHONATHAN DUQUE", "ReviewID": "ROLD0YSEQM0LA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi, guys I am from Venezuela and must say all these m\u00f3vils are really nice and work well for a year or so.
