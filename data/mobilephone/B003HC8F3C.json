{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Frustrating Phone", "Author": "M. Stewart", "ReviewID": "R2MQAXV48HVIZH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the good points of this phone:  The inside display is nice and bright, with nice, big numbers that are easy to see.  The sound and call quality is good, and I didn't experience any connection problems.  The phone can be charged with a standard USB cable from your computer, and it is a breeze to upload/download photos, and upload music to the phone, also via a standard USB cable (after a one-time driver download from the Motorola support web site).  The built-in FM radio works well; it requires the use of wired earbuds or headphones.  The MP3 player will work with either the built-in speaker or with your earbuds.  The speakerphone option works quite well.Now the problems.  The outside display is almost impossible to see in daylight.  The built-in camera is virtually useless for indoor photos.  The camera lens is near the hinge, so it is easy to block the lens. Almost all the menus are counter-intuitive; you need to make a lot of choices to do what should be simple to do; such as set the phone to vibrate only, redial a number, read a text message.  There are no keypad shortcuts for menu choices.  I just can't imagine having to use this phone on a regular basis. The cellphone caused some static occasionally on my computer speakers; my other cellphone never does.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid basic cell phone", "Author": "OlyNomad", "ReviewID": "R31SMS2AJS9W2C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very basic cell phone.  It would be suited for someone who doesn't care about the bells and whistles and just wants a functional cell phone. My parents would like this cell phone because all they do with their cell phones is make calls and this works just fine for that. I haven't had any problems with dropped calls and the reception is good in my area.  If one is into features and uses mobile web or does much text messaging, I'd pick another phone because it can be time consuming to use those features on this phone.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Loved it!", "Author": "Marilyn J.

Hutson", "ReviewID": "RX8UP0B710H6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone. I might be the only one though. I read an earlier review that called this a \"very basic cell phone.\"  I would not consider it very basic--at least not compared to my old cell phone.  You can read my review and decide for yourself..1. It is easy to use.2. I find the menu intuitive.  I push the menu button and a screen comes up with nine icons. When I select the icon with the navigation key I can easily see what it does (messages, web access, games & apps, office tools, phone book, personalize, multimedia, settings, and recent calls). When I select \"multimedia\" I can easily see the options: camera, pictures, sounds, music, fm radio, video camera (and I have to scroll down one to see videos).  I did need to do some hunting to find how to change the ring tone--but I can live with that.3. I like the mp3 feature. I connected the phone with the USB drive to my computer.  It recognized it as a external drive and I dragged and copied a couple mp3's to it.  It was that easy.  The volume is loud enough to easily hear when playing the songs.  This is where the \"external touch screen\" comes into play---when the phone is closed and you are playing a song.  I can play, pause, skip ahead to the next song, or go back to the previous song all while the phone is closed.5. The sound for phone calls is very good.  A couple times I got an \"echo\" but that seems to be because of the location at the time or some other interference. And, I haven't had any \"dropped calls.\"6. The buttons are easy to use.  They are large and raised so it is easy to tell if you pushed it.7. The FM radio is a decent feature.7. The camera doesn't take very sharp images . . . but I can live with that.8. I don't text, so I can't provide any useful information on that.Bottom line: I like this phone, but when I read other reviews . . . I might be the only one!", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Motorola EM330 with Consumer Cellular Service", "Author": "lil \"lil\"", "ReviewID": "R33TAEZISGFGLF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone is very easy to figure out and set up to use. Did not even need to check the booklet that comes with it tochange things on it like ringer and screen.Very nice basic simple phone.The coverage for my area says it is available when i go to the Consumer Cellular website and checkhowever when i try to make calls from this phone 80% of the time the calls fail.I called out of state with it again to another area that says it has coverage and the calls to them are jumbled and spottyhard to understand much of what is said then the calls have dropped.So for right now the phone gets 3 stars because i like simple and easy not anything too complicated but the coverage gets 2 stars because it is useless to me if i can not make any calls.I will update after more time using this phone and plan to see if the calls get any better.Am hoping that this can be used for our emergency phone but if i can't depend on calls from it then it is not going to workto use as the 4th emergency phone.Ok I try to use this phone daily so I can review it more.When I am outside with it my calls are better and do not fail or drop as much as when i am inside a building.I am finding that though very easy to set up it seems rather cumbersome to get to anything like using the web because you have to click through so many menus to get to what you are trying to do.Take using the camera for instance my other phones you just click the camera button on the phone.This one i have to go to the multimedia menu then camera then take the photo then save it.Photo quality on this phone is pretty poor but then again most of us don't get a phone based on camera quality.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "everything but", "Author": "Janet Schaferbeck \"Learner\"", "ReviewID": "R1EFACUCYT7NU5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "from day 1 it drained the battery after only a few (2-3) calls or a couple days.....which is totally useless.....then with Consumers Cellular, they wash their hands of it once you buy it from them, you have to deal with Motorola, there isn't a return for exchange...your stuck with it", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$75.00", "Features": "Flip phone in gray that's great for seniors with raised keys and easy-to-read color display\nMultiple flexible and low-cost pre-paid plans with no contract required; easy upgrade for when you need more minutes; discounts to AARP members\nAccess to text and picture messaging; 1.3-megapixel camera; Bluetooth hands-free communication; MP3 player\nUp to 7.5 hours of talk time, up to 250 hours (10+ days) of standby time; released in March, 2009\nWhat's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, charger, quick start guide, user manual", "Name": "Motorola EM330 Gray (Consumer Cellular)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314rKEcieyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003HC8F3C"}}
