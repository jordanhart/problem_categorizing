{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone with Many Set Backs", "Author": "Michael C.", "ReviewID": "R35RKUC6MSNIGM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a loyal tmobile customer for as long as I can remember and I'm a huge fan of the android line. Prior to this phone, I've owned the G1, the MyTouch (several versions), and the G2. This phone is definitely more refined. It has a great user interface, a nice sleek and clean look, and what would be very user friendly if it wasn't for a few painful setbacks. The memory on the phone does not clear itself so you are forced to restart the phone quite often in order to gain access to many features. the camera (photo and video), youtube videos, media players, almost none of your media will simply not work and display an error message until you restart your phone. This can be quite annoying. One of the luxuries of having a smart phone is to be able to simply whip it out anywhere during conversation to show someone something or to capture a moment. We live in a fast paced environment nowadays and this phone simply cant keep up with that. The fact there is no flash on the phone is also a huge setback for me, as I enjoyed that feature on previous models.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Device!", "Author": "Erica Reid", "ReviewID": "R1BI2S0LMZP5TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an amazing phone! I purchased this to replace my Blackberry 9700 because it was starting to act crazy. It got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up. Finally fed up I chose to get this device. Originally I was not interested in this phone because I was still scarred from the G1 experience and wanted nothing more to do with Android. After my friends found out I was intensely looking into the HTC HD7 they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to Android. This smartphone does everything and more. I will be as detailed as possible about this device.PackagingWhen I received the package I found that it was very well put together. The box, of course, was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone. Otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like I had ordered it from Tmobile. The items that were included was the phone, travel charger extender, data wire, battery, 16 GB micro sd card, Samsung premium in-ear earphones, and the manuals. One thing I did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone. This looks like it's the norm for this line of phones, so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer, just simply Samsung's poor designing. The back of the phone is a little flimsier than I would like, but that's all opinion. The weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier. I have the Samsung Behold as well, much cheaper than this phone, and it has a really nice metal-like back on it. Overall, however, the packaging was very professional.ScreenThe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen. The colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation.NetworkI have Tmobile unlimited prepaid service, which is $70 a month. I had absolutely no issues in getting service started. I live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and 3G, never fully 3G service so I had no high hopes for this device. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that I was on the 4G network. I have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady 4G so I am thrilled about that. The HSPA+ service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast. No issues in that department.Email SetupI had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone. I tried fruitlessly when I first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request. I gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect. If email is important to you, it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it's actually configured. I found that I needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the Marketplace. While it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the OS upon first turning the phone on (like the G1), you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account. I still have not synced my student email to the phone because it's asking for features I do not have (domain). In comparison the Blackberry 9700 allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain. I just input the email address and password and off I went. This is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world.MessagingMessaging is pretty standard here. The setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully. There are two keyboards on the phone: Swype and Samsung. I am not much on swyping because I kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating. I changed the keyboard to Samsung standard and my headache of texting went away!Call LevelI found that there were no issues on the calls that I placed. I heard no static, the calls didn't drop and that's all one could ask for. This phone does support WiFi calls. I made a few calls on WiFi and also found no issues in the quality.BluetoothIt took me less than a minute to sync my Bluetooth with this phone. The phone found the device in about five seconds, found the password OTA and entered it for me and then connected. I was shocked at how fast and effortless it was.BrowserThe internet browser is really decent. I was able to go to every site that I attempted with no issues. This phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video's within various websites without the video's being attached to YouTube which is really nice.Battery LifeThe battery life on this phone is excellent, as far as I can tell. I charged the phone completely when I received it without turning it on to ensure that I did not destroy my battery power before I even got started. I don't know if that's a myth, but I charged first just in case it wasn't.Overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it's listed for. I have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and I am glad that I made this choice. I would recommend this to anyone on the Tmobile network but I cannot definitively say that this works on other GSM carriers because I was not able to test other carriers. Minus the battery charger, the back cover, and email issues I give this device a 4.5/5.0!**Edit June 27, 2011**This phone has a really nice, crisp, vibrant display but one problem I have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what's on the screen. For this inconvenience I am dropping this review down to a 4.0. What is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone?Another issue I have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring. There are times when I have notifications when I turn the screen on but I did not hear the tone go off. For this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on. I don't know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little. The ringtones are also a little lower than I would like.I have been enjoying this device, but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because I like the phone. I still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then I would find something else.**Edit June 29, 2011**I never reviewed the video and music player because I had not tried them at the time of the original review. I typically don't use my phone other than for what it's intended for because I have a Zune HD which is music and video ad I like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however I wanted to see what else this phone could do. I have .avi movies on my computer so I decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like. I was blown away at how crisp the screen was! When listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in 5.1 surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater. I really enjoyed this feature. The mp3 player was delightful as well. I listened to an entire 12 song album and viewed a 1 hour 50 minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars. I am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it. Very nice experience!**Edit July 5, 2011**I took a mini trip for the 4th of July to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on T-Mobile's network. I ran into a lot of problems with this phone when I got into this area because the phone is provisioned for HSPA+ and this area is Edge/3G, more Edge than 3G. When I tried to use my phone I continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and I am not going to get started on the net service out there. Because of the phone constantly looking for a 4G connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn't working. I am glad that this was just a getaway and not where I live, however, it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to [...]and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a 4G area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it's the coverage, not the phone. I am not too sure about the AT&T; customers and how they may fare with this issue because I do not have an AT&T; sim, but I would send my advice their way also. Check the coverage at AT&T; if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites.**Edit July 9, 2011**  Wireless TetheringI know this is a lot of updates, but I am still finding new options on this phone. So, I was in the Android Marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my Blackberry 9700 had a tethering service named Tether and it was great and useful while I was at work. I found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it. Much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up. I had to download something called Samsung New PC Suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video's to the phone. While playing around with my settings I found that I was able to plug my phone into the computer with the PC Suite, activate tethering on the phone, and connect to the internet! I was not on my wifi at the time and I was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer. I did not have to download any 3rd party tethering program (and pay for it) because this phone has a built in tethering program and no, I did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone. Here are the steps to activating the wireless feature:1. Download Samsung New PC Suite (preferrably an updated version) and install the program.2. Plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install, in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone.3. On your phone, hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the Kies Firmware Update, Mass Storage, etc. After you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone.4. Hit \"Applications\" and scroll over to \"Settings\".  Click on \"Settings\".5. Tap \"Wireless and Network\", then tap \"Tethering\".6. You should have a \"USB tethering\" option. Tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box. In your task bar at the top of the phone, you should see tethering enabled. You can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone.7. If your computer is Windows 7 and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time. This will tell you that the connection is active. If it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet. At this point you can surf the web! No extra money to put out, no gimmick, just internet.I am super glad that I was able to figure this out because I downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once I figured out how to get the app installed on the computer I was going to pay for the full app which was, like, $32 dollars. That's a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free, in my opinion. If you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues. I cannot say that this is the same process on Vista or before because all of my pc's have been updated to 7. As far as AT&T; I cannot say if they allow this connection because I also have no AT&T; access but it is definitely worth a try. I think that this is a great feature and I thank Samsung for caring enough to add this, and for Tmobile not blocking my connection, because it's a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done.**Edit July 24, 2011** Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh BatteryOn the 1620 mAh battery that comes with the phone I was ultimately able to squeeze out 11 hours of usage, from 9:45 a.m to 8:00 p.m, on heavy use. The problem I ran into was that I actually leave my job at 10 p.m, sometimes a smidgen later, and I was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with. With that, I chose to get the Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh battery from amazon. I received this battery on Friday afternoon. Charged it from 7:30 p.m to 2:00 a.m Saturday morning. I used this phone from 2:00 a.m until 4:00 a.m Sunday and my phone was still at 4%. This is after over 3 hours of conversation, non-stop messaging, Facebook messages and status updates, internet, YouTube video's for 30 minutes, gaming and using the OI Shopping app when I got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for Sunday dinner at Wal-Mart. Calculate the time: From 2:00 a.m Saturday til 4:00 a.m Sunday I did not touch my charger. I took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse. That is 26 straight hours of power, and then some because when I went to bed at 4 a.m my phone was at 4% and I could not kill the battery and trust me I did everything I could to kill it because I am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead. However, I gave in and charged it at 4%. There is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond 4% because I had to give up and go to bed and I needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when I woke up 8 hours later. Nonetheless, this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day! This battery is $56.00 here on amazon.com and it's worth every penny! (I did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey I will be updating that review as I get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time, especially next weekend when I am done conditioning it.)**Edit August 14, 2011**Less than 2 months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls. The dialer is forcing close as well. This was my main issue with the G1 when I had it a few years ago. It forced closed so many times that I was forced to get another phone. I have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re-booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal. I am not going to throw in the towel just yet. I will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon I will be forced to get another device, which I really do not want to do at this point. For these new issues, I am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if I can fix it.**Edit Auguest 17, 2011** Roots and Mobile Access Points, Oh My!Okay, a few days ago I have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full 4G signal strength. I went through my settings and realized that I was a \"Super User\". Now, I know that having a \"rooted\" phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection, however, ever since I \"unrooted\" this device I have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls. For those who don't understand what rooting is, this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer, only it's taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications. The phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked, so that's something to consider if you start having issues similar to what I experienced.I also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point, which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices. I tried this last night with my Zune HD and my laptop and it works beautifully. To enable this feature:1. Go to Settings2. Go to Wireless and Network3. Go to Mobile AP (3rd Option)4. Select Mobile AP (1st Option; option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point)5. Activate Wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network, usually named \"Android\" with some numbers after the name.I cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than Tmobile, because I have no other sim cards to test, but it's always worth a shot! Remember that Mobile AP is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot. Tmobile has no more than 5GB of data, which is rumored to be unlimited but I don't know because I am somewhat midway through the month and I have used over 2GB of data, so we will see at the end of the month if it is, indeed, unlimited.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best android in the market my opinion.", "Author": "Manuel Condado", "ReviewID": "R3U92N8IGIH0ST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a few months of having the phone in my possession. I decided to write a review, the phone itself is very slim, and portable. When comparing the the galaxy 4g with the newest iTouch. The galaxy 4g is way lighter than the iTouch. In my opinion its a very important factor because it isn't heavy or bulky in my pocket. Sometimes I have even check my pockets to make sure it's there that's how light it is.**  Battery Life**  The phone comes included with a 1650 mah battery a usb cable and the usb adapter for wall charging. A full charge takes usually about 1hr to 1hr 30 min, and it last me about 1 1/2 day to 2 full days. Normally I use the phone to check my email several times throughout the day, surf the web, send an average of 6 calls per day and several texts.** LCD ***  One of the good things about the phone is it's LCD. It  has 4in screen it appears to be better than the iPhone's screen. It's bright and full of color, ideal to watch movies in HD.**Camera**  The phone came with a GB microsd card meaning you can store thousand's of pictures. The galaxy has a 5mp camera for decent photographs but it lacks a flash. So when taking pictures at night I suggest you stand near a light post so enough light is provided.** Internet***Internet is super fast on T mobile's 4g network. You can also surf the web using any WiFi network without worrying of going over your data plan limit. When connected to a network the phone also has a feature for Wifi calling, so you might not have service for but WiFi calling will use the network to produce the call. Beware that WiFi calling uses your minutes in your plan.*** Call Quality***Having this phone for nearly a 9 month period and not a single dropped call. Love this phone I've had several friends complain on how their iPhone has too many dropped calls but my galaxy 4g hasn't. I can hear the person on the other end nice and clear.The only defect with this phone is it lacks a flash that is why i decided to give it a 4 stars and not 5.

I do not know much about android phones, but the reviews seemed to indicate that this was the closest to the iPhone of any available. So far I like the phone. It is somewhat lighter than the iPhone (it has a plastic back cover instead of the solid glass and metal) and feels somewhat cheaper, but is a solid phone nonetheless. I am getting used to the android interface but have a lot yet to learn before I am as comfortable as I am with my iPhone. My only disappointment so far is that there was no memory card in the box although the box and manual said it was included (also no sim card but that was expected although the box indicates that it should have one); I suppose it was left out to make the phone cheaper, but it seems like a sneaky thing to do. Now on to the pros and cons so far:Pros:- I LOVE the beautiful large display! Not quite as good as the retina display of the iPhone but close.- Works with t-mobile (my wife's plan) with no jailbreak/unlock needed- Android is new to me so it will be a new learning experience- Easy network data disable in the shutdown menu (nice touch!)- Very fast data transfer on wifi (have not tried 4G)Cons:- Cheaper feel, not as solid as iPhone (but then again, nothing is!)- Larger footprint- New interface will take some getting used to", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung T959 Galaxy s Vibrant", "Author": "Marielyn Harrison", "ReviewID": "R28KDOTS4INS40", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Rated this purchase as 1 star first of all the product did not come with a charger and when I check they did not say it did not come without charger when it was advertise, the product advertise as unlock and I had to pay to unlock phone hence I would not recommend no one to purchase this product, it was far beyond what I was expected I was dissapointed.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "New smart phone user, happy about my decision (so far)...", "Author": "Hitesh", "ReviewID": "RI7EWX02GR2TL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello,I'm a first time smart phone user and obviously the biggest question was to choose iphone or android...and which phone in Android.After thorough research of available options, my expectations and reading reviews about various phones & plans, I preferred to choose Android...with GSM Samsung Galaxy S phone.As a customer, I expect that I should be free (not bound by any contract), don't want too much and yet get everything I could get...Apple definitely does not qualify (even if I jailbreak) and Android is clear winner. Android allows to keep my options open. I could gift this phone to my family member outside US, if I wish to too.Being new to smart phone, it definitely takes sometime to understand smart phone.

Promised fixes from Samsung did not fix the problem. I can usually drive to my destination before the phone is able to lock onto its location. The Navigation app will not work unless it gets a GPS fix (not just coarse location from cell towers).- Insufficient battery capacity. If you only use this as a phone, then the battery will get you through a day, but turn on any of the smartphone features (GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth) or use any apps and the battery runs down very quickly. I need to keep a USB charger at work and one in my car just in case.- No Android updates. Samsung is focused on releasing new models, and has not provided any Android updates since 2.2.- No Customer Support. If you contact Samsung about any topic the response will be something like: \"We cannot provide information related to your request as that would cause confusion\". I swear! I've gotten this response multiple times.- Camera has poor contrast in low light. The \"brightness\" setting in the app has no effect. Again, no updates to fix this.- Many delays and lock-ups in apps. This may be related to the Android apps themselves, but I suspect it is related to the processor and file I/O.- When using SWYPE keyboard, there is a \"hidden word\" dialog that persistently pops up, and cannot be disabled.

Now if you live in an area with rampant 4g you might be okay. However if you are in a location with any reduced coverage the phone is horrible. Seriously bad.It can't register at times and is a major fail in areas were 4G isn't the best. I found a few users on the t-mobile site with the exact same issue so it wasn't just me.  It will hold 4G till the cows come home, meaning when you have absolutely no 4g signal, then it searchs/finds another network and disconnects your call. With three bars of signal I could not to make calls. Not registering on the network is a problem. Usually means a bad sim. This was not the case and as a former tech for AT&T; I know how to troubleshoot these types of issues. If you call customer care they will give you this valuable tip, \"Powercycle the phone\". Rebooting may or may not work. I removed the sim and put it in an older phone and it works good. A sim either registers or doesn't on the network. It can get hung up during activation but that is generally not the case.And BTW waiting 24 hours is foolhardy no matter how many times the Salesperson/customer care rep tells you thats what you need to do. I allows give the person on the line a complimentary AT&T; dial tone if I hear the 24hours nonsense and call a real tech. I have done it on Sprint, AT&T;, and T-mobile and nearly every time the phone was completely functional before I completed the call. Normally if a system like that is failing orders back up fast and so do the phone lines. Because retail folks can't stand to lose a sale and they immediately call and so do online customers.  Customer care / Retail / Business sales ....call their support staff and wait on hold just like you do. If it was a real problem and you'd be on the line 1-2 hours before you ever get a rep on the line and thats only if the overloaded IVR doesn't randomly dump your call.Wifi will grab a network and hold it the same way as 4g. I could walk from one end of the house to the other and still be connected to the wifi on the other side of my house at 1 bar while standing in front of my other router. I'm not browsing on the web or anything just standing in front of the router holding the phone. I can turn the phone off and back on and it will connect to the weaker signal. That is not good. I have not seen any device do that before.For the camera function there is no flash. Not sure why. Probably because the device eats batteries so fast they didn't want any additional battery draining hardware running. It does take decent pics as far as I could tell.I didn't tether the device but I read another users account. I did use the music player and it seemed okay. I thought it lacked some features but played okay for me. Was plenty loud on speaker and good on the headphones. I also connect it through a cassette deck in my car and it was okay. Browsing was pretty good on wifi but I didn't notice this phone making my wifi connection look slow as they claim.My software/firmware was current on the phone. I used the kindle app and so did my wife. Worked great. I installed netflix but after not being able to make calls for three days I returned the phone before testing that.The bottom line is the phone is good for $57.95 but not $200-400. It actually made calls about the same as the 8 year old prepaid phone the tmobile guy let me use to test before I switched to them. Then he let me use a real phone because I told him it didn't work and I was going to pass on tmobile. I took the phones back. I have not really had good luck with samsung. They are the only phones that failed for me in a problematic way. I went against my judgement and listened to the sales person. I did some research and it seems the previous 3G devices had random shutdown and other problems. And I could see similar issues on my devices. Most devices didn't start failing for a few months.There are alot of people out there that will tell you you need to reboot daily, or powercycle the device often, or perform constant updates. What that really says is that the building, testing, and quality control is in your hands and that the device wasn't ready for prime time. I have an old palm pilot and I can't recall rebooting that device more than two or three times in five years. Rebooted more often with my 2 other Android Phones because I am rooting and installing things I probably shouldn't, that access the file structure easier.Putting the power button on the side of the phone wasn't well thought out. This phone is light and sleek, your reading an email, and your index finger naturally sits were the power button is. I found myself constantly turning the screen black and at first I thought the battery was dead. Then I would have to drag the puzzle piece or slide to unlock. Very annoying. The slide to unlock was awkward and seemed to not work that great. Sometimes I would have to try a couple times,  or with both hands, to access the menu/screen/application. This was not user error. It just didn't work well. Maybe the sensitivity could have been adjusted but I couldn't find the setting though. I have a 4G Evo and a HTC G2 and they are much smoother with screen unlock functions.I really liked this device initially. If it could have performed moderately well I would have been pleased and might have kept at least one. It couldn't perform it's number one function as a phone with any consistency and that was not good. The sad thing is I bought cases for them on ebay, because I wanted to protect the device, and have no use for them now.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "STUPID PHONE", "Author": "molly shorty", "ReviewID": "R1O2VH6WMPI4QE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst phone I ever owned; it should be taken off the market.

It even came with the forward-facing camera which I was unclear about until I actually opened the box. The box was new, the packing was crisp, the phone was protected front and back with manufacturer decals and promotionally marked screen protector. The phone came with the USB charge/sync cable (24\") and DC wall USB charger. Condish of the refurb phone was CHERRRYYY! Not a single sign of previous wear. It sincerely to me is a NEW PHONE. It is sleek, sexy, and light in the hand and functions like...it feels great to be a Samsung Galaxy S/Android convert. Ive never owned another smart phone that could compare. My brother has the iPhone 4 and it smokes it in so many ways. 1) Its way lighter and easier to handle. 2) I don't feel like the thing is gonna shatter if I drop it. My sis in law's iPhone fell from the pouch in the car door to the dirt driveway (maybe a little over 2 ft) the screen shattered. I don't feel like that's gonna happen with this phone but I wont be doing any tests to prove it. I have fully customized the Android platform on this phone to my liking and that makes my brother very jealous since he's stuck using the iPhone as-is. I didn't unroot this phone and have access to the thousand odd apps free on the Goofle Play market, in addition to the ones that came preinstalled on the phone. So, that makes me happy. The 5mp camera is beyond adequate for me and the forward facing cam (i think 5 mp too cant recall the specs of this cam) have made it pretty easy for me and my wife to video chat. The Super AMOLED display easily rivals the iPhone retina display. When the brightness of the screen Is turned up the layperson's eye can not detect the diff so to me this is really a no brainer. The colors (16 million) are sharp vibrant and rich. The video player has no problem that I have seen yet. The battery life definitely requires the 1650 milliamp (which it is advertised to ship with) as auto-sync and and other apps put the processor to the test but as long as the battery is charged you should get plenty of usable time. I have ordered the 1650 and am waiting delivery. Mine shipped with the 1500 and I generally get a solid day of use out of it with auto-sync turned off. My phone didn't ship with a hands-free package but luckily my brother gave me some iPhone ear buds that work perfectly. He's so jealous that he is pretty much sold on getting the Samsung Galaxy Note III. In  summary, Im happy with this item COMPLETELY and I recommend this phone to any basic smart phone user and I recommend Samsung product lines to anyone who wants a durable, innovative, ballsy handset/communipanion that will run tech circles around pretty much any brand on the market today. Sorry, Apple iPhone fanboys and fangirls, the crown is being stripped from thy head and it all started with the Samsung Galaxy S 4g Vibrant.

If I use wifi during the day or running couples of app, then there is not much battery life left for the phone call. Battery is almost drained in the late afternoon even if my battery is fully charged in the morning. (I later bought a second battery cuz I thought it was a battery problem, but still drained quickly using second one.)The second problem is that the phone freezes frequently.

Thus I bought an Android mp3 player that works fine, and then I bought this phone from T-Mobile but soon my initial enthusiasm was dampened by the phone's inferior quality and Apple-like restrictions.The best thing about this phone is its bright screen but this phone has a mind of its own and, among other irritating things, although I set Brightness at maximum, NOT AT AUTOMATIC, it goes to Automatic and dims whenever it feels like it. This phone also overheats markedly after half an hour or so of usage. It also does other things on its own: useless programs pop up on their own and the worst is when the phone suddenly freezes at least once a day. To unfreeze you need to either turn it off or remove and re-install the battery. Contrary to other phones, like the Sony Ericsson, the alarm does not ring when the phone is off, so you have to keep it ON connected to power all night if you need to use a wake-up alarm. The phone has no hardware Home button, something that makes it difficult to answer the phone having to grope for the virtual button.Some of the programs that pop up on their own are not only pre-installed, but Samsung does not allow you to remove them. They are not only useless but also irritating. It seems counter-productive and unfair that you own a phone but you are not allowed to remove some of the unwanted garbage that, in addition to wasting your time by popping up, they waste memory space. The iphone that I did not like gave me the option of many keyboards including Greek, which I need for scholarly purposes. This Samsung phone offers only 5 European language keyboards and an Asian.I bought this phone thinking I would be able to make Skype video calls but that was not possible because it was equipped with the old Froyo Android software. The people at T-Mobile said Samsung would soon offer upgrading to Gingerbread that would solve the Skype video call problem. Nobody knew when the upgrade would take place; so much for T-Mobile and Samsung customer service. One day I saw on line that the upgrade was available and took me quite a while, owing to poor instructions, to finally raise this phone to standards long-enjoyed by iphone owners. Samsung has grown too much and too fast for its britches and as a result it ignores or cannot keep up with the increased demand for service.Bottom line: I am not going back to iphone and its oppressive proprietary restrictions; I will await the appearance of Google smartphones, following the acquisition of Motorola by Google, in the hope that such phones will be as well-performing as iphones and will include Google's extensive language capabilities as now available in Google News and other Google programs.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "worst pos I've ever owned!", "Author": "specter", "ReviewID": "R3FZ2JP1HOI7TQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Going from a vibrant 3g to this so called 4g galaxy was a huge let down.

I needed a new phone to replace one that had been stolen so this phone, being that it was unlocked and and priced well seemed to be a good fit. I received the phone and yes I will admit the screen on this thing is amazing! It lives up to it's name and displays a vivid and vibrant picture quality. With that being said, I believe that that is the only nice thing I have to say about this product. The problems started out as little quirky bugs that I assume almost every phone has. But then the problem escalated to applications needing to be forcefully closed, the screen not responding for a few minutes, freezing with just about every touch (exaggeration but what I mean is that the screen freezes so frequently it feels as though every application you tap on freezes instantaneously), a problem with my keyboard is that I will write something and not notice that there isn't anything being typed even though the area to type the message in has been tapped in order for me to begin typing my message. It just wont show up. To combat that problem I'd have to close out of my messaging app about three times in order to finally type my message. When I take pictures upright. They send/share as being sideways. Even when I rotate the picture it will still send/share sideways. There is no flash on this camera which hasn't really been much of a big deal to me, but to some it may. The camera does have great focus. This phone will turn off by itself. Randomly dim the screen (even when you aren't running low on battery) and will auto rotate your screen even if you didn't select the setting yourself (I find this bug in particular to be the most annoying) The internal storage on this phone was great for my usage and provided me the opportunity to explore as many apps as I pleased. Battery life is less than stellar. Heavy social networking usage leaves me with a dead battery unless I charge at some point throughout the day. And my messages have a tendency to not send at times.Now I write this review not to discredit the sellers who want to sell this product, but as a consumer who has a deep hatred for this phone.

This was not helpful and kinda upset me, that I was expected to buy a code for a phone that was labeled as unlocked.  Ultimately it worked out, I found a local store in-country and the professionals took the time to really work the phone and get it unlocked.  Apparently, it is not an easy device to unlock, and simply entering codes would not get the job down.

When typing a \"text message\" in the landscape position, my right hand little finger would accidently touch the \"Send\" button which is located immediately next the letter \"L\" on the key pad; I would send out a text message with part of a word or sentence, very frustrating.Another thing that I appreciated about Android OS is the transfer of documents etc. between my laptop and the cell phone via USB cable; I can see exactly what folder/files were stored on my phones' memory card. With Windows 7 & 8 OS, you have to use Microsoft's \"Zune\" and if you read through the fine print, they basically have access to any and all personal data stored on your phone and possible your laptop computer. However, this is also simular to \"Think Free Office\" document reader on this cell phone. I recommend that you select \"Later\" button every time your document is loaded, thus avoiding \"Activate now\" button; your documents will load just fine.Battery power drain can be reduced by going to \"Settings\", \"Sound\", \"Vibrate\" , and selecting \"Never\",  this extends considerably the battery life between chargings. Additionally, turn off the \"WiFi\" calling feature when not needed.darrel of Texas", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks and feels old", "Author": "Edet Afonchwi", "ReviewID": "R32Z3KZ4TFFZZ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is frigil and the experience was poor to be frank.Very different from the locked model.Can't recommend to anyone.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slick + Quick with High Quality Sound and Video", "Author": "B.

At Least The One I Received", "Author": "Learna21", "ReviewID": "RQ0LAJFKHSQ2I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I get it.. not all phones work properly, just like how not all computers work properly either, but this phone crashed way more than my iPhone 3G which I had previously before this. My father and I got our phones for $50 during a promotion by T-Mobile. I took a few days to get used to an Android device and my father LOVES his phone. He never has problems with his, or at least none that he even mentions.Here are some positives on this device:1) It is actually quite fast despite the fact that it crashes often. Scrolling pages of applications has never been smoother and opening certain apps is usually instant.2) Focus on camera makes pictures look very nice.3) Very light phone.Here are cons:1) The biggest problem with this phone is that if you go to a place that doesn't have any network, and then leave the area to a place that DOES have network, the phone would not reconnect to get any signal. You won't receive phone calls or texts. It was funny how I thought for an entire two days why no one called or texted me, and it turns out because this phone lost network unless I restarted the phone, which I did eventually (not even on purpose). Then, I was bombarded with texts and missed calls from like 18 hours ago.2) This phone force closes the simplest things when 4G is on. For example, when I turn on 4G (even with or without 4G) and go to view text messages, it would force close it. If you click on \"Messaging\", it would show you your texts with people, first loading their phone numbers then replacing the numbers with their contact names, then closes immediately. It would do this a minimum of 8-10 times before the messages window would actually stay open. 4G or WiFi on would force close my music player occasionally, and would force close the \"Phone\" section so I can't even make calls unless it stops. Doing anything with 4G or Wifi on would cause the phone to freeze randomly with weird key characters displayed directly on the screen and then take ages to power off and finally turn back on.3) Camera is slow. I like the fact that it focuses on objects, but the camera takes so long to take pictures that I would miss the moment I want to capture. There is also no flash which is unfortunate, because I generally go out at night and can't take pictures.4) No official way to actually do screenshots. I could be wrong, but I have been trying to find the hotkeys to screenshot on this phone but I can't find one. Holding certain buttons don't work so I'm forced to download an app just to screenshot.5) Like another reviewer said, this phone does not listen to its settings. I would uncheck automatic brightness and sometimes, it would randomly adjust brightness on its own despite the fact that I disabled it.6) The default keyboard is kind of annoying. Every time I type, it \"ends.ui.like.tis\" because I either hit the period key more often that space bar, hit the \"keyboard settings\" (the little gear) key, or the \"Voice Input\" (microphone) key. I always miss the letter I want by one key and this keyboard gets me so mad.7) It would fail to send my text messages too often and suddenly. For example, usually if you type over the maximum amount of characters of the text, it would continue the message on a separate text message. For this phone, if you send over the maximum amount of characters, it would refuse to send the text. If I use any symbols like the Degrees symbol or the Cents symbol, it would not send the text either. It also would send text messages but claims it \"failed\" but people told me I sent the text numerous times.I guess for this phone, it truly is fast in most cases, but it crashes so often even on its OWN built-in \"Default\" applications. I tried deleting all other downloaded apps, and even reset the phone, but it still has the same problems.

I am not a touch typist, so swiping over the words is much easier and quicker.

That phone, saddled with Android 2.2 Froyo could only do video one-sided calls. The other person could see you but you couldn't see them as the front camera does not work on Skype calls with Froyo. I contacted Samsung about a whispered upgrade to Android 2.3 that enables two-way Skype calls but their Support Dept. coldly replied on Nov. 13: \"Samsung Telecommunications America [is] unable to speculate when/if a software revision with this feature might be available due to the fact that this might lead to inaccurate information and confusion.\" So much for manufacturer's service. Furthermore, while the iPhone allowed you to text or type emails in dozens of languages, the Galaxy only offers six, whereas Google offers dozens too. Next, the Galaxy is loaded with junk software such as Double Twist and Layar that, even if you paid for the phone and you are legally the owner, you simply cannot uninstall them, unless you root the phone, something that may cause problems. Other things are annoying too. Even if you set the Brightness at Full, suddenly the phone darkens as it sets itself to a lower brightness.

Although that is not currently my profession, I am able to speak intelligently about technology. My experience with this product has been so negative that I thought others would benefit from my feedback.My decision to purchase this product was made after reading very favorable product reviews. My experience using this phone has not even come close to matching the expectations I had.This phone's single greatest downfall is the poor integration of the software that was written for it with the reasonably capable hardware that is the Galaxy S platform. The software is TERRIBLY buggy, requiring frequent reboots and causing individual applications to force close. The end result is a terrible user experience, especially when one needs the phone to \"just work.\" Following are specific issues I have had with this phone. I have no reason to believe they are specific only to my individual unit; I believe they would be common to this entire product line:1) There is no FM radio. I suppose I could have found this out prior to purchasing the phone, but I expected that FM radio was part of the standard Android specification. Not so on this phone. Perhaps the carrier(s) wanted the consumer to use (and purchase) an internet radio application, along with the data that such use would require.2) GPS has rarely worked on this phone. I have tried many times to use Google Navigate with this phone with very little success. TeleNav is loaded on the phone but it is a paid app, and I refuse to use a paid app when there is a free app that works (or should work) just as well.3) Phone frequently hangs and becomes non-responsive, requiring me to remove the battery and reboot. This happens at random intervals, sometimes as frequently as once per day.4) Phone is filled with bloatware, which I suspect is a major part of the problem. Bloatware refers to programs the carrier or manufacturer wants to push on the end-user in hopes he or she will spend more money and increase profit margins. Often the bloatware is included to the detriment of basic usability.After such a terrible experience, I was ready to defect and purchase an iPhone, because at the end of the day, I need a phone that \"just works.\" However, I recently learned that Google is selling its newest phone unlocked and without a contract (and without the horrible bloatware I described above). I will try the pure Google experience and for now will attribute the problems I described above to the horrible integration between manufacturer and carrier on the Android platform.

The phone itself works fine but the GPS is terrible.  Most of the time it doesn't work at all and when it does it tends to stop working in the middle of a trip.  Also, it cannot play Netflix without constantly searching for the signal and the voice control is worthless.  On top of that the WIFI doesn't work either.  It keeps searching and then disables the WIFI. And the worst thing it does is the battery life sucks. If you plan to use this phone frequently, buy at least one extra battery.  Overall giving this phone 2 stars is generous.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  I am returning it tomorrow for the Galaxy 2S.  I hope it is better because if not I will be stuck with a 2 year contract with another lousy phone.Follow up.  I got the Galaxy S2 and it is sooooo much better.

I really like the phone, but am going to have to return it because there are too many glitches.1. When you hit the text message button the messages open, and then suddenly closes.  This happens several times before you can actually get to the text messaging screen.  I asked a friend with this phone and she said this happened to her and her husband.  They've had their phone a few weeks and I've had mine a few days.  So it sounds like an ongoing problem.  Also it takes a few minutes for the contacts' names to appear.  It will only show their number.  It shouldn't take that long.2. It freezes up often.  Too often for a new phone.3. In sending texts to two separate people today, the message kept saying message failed.  So I tried to resend it several times and my sister said she got 5 of the same texts from me.  But on my phone it still says message failed.  Usually it will tell you if it actually went through.  I'm still not sure if the text I sent to the other person went through or if they got several texts from me as well.  This is extremely frustrating and a waste of time.4. Also I'm not sure if this is an android thing I'm not used to but when I tried to send a text message to several people it sent the text message to some of the people's emails.  I know it links to your google contacts but if I'm sending a text and the person's number is in my phone then why would it send them an email?  And I couldn't tell until afterwards that it sent it via email.  Frustrating again.Other than those things I actually liked the screen size, the typing was very smooth and user friendly.  But these frustrations are too annoying for something I've only had two days now.  And from what I've read on forums tons of other people have these issues and there seems to be no solution so it's not worth keeping the phone.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "just a few words", "Author": "Ricky campbell", "ReviewID": "R17HNDTGMH144V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the phone was fine but I could not get the volume to turn up  I had to send it back . but amazon you are great I will buy from you from now on  Ricky", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "quality of phone volume", "Author": "Dawn Savage", "ReviewID": "R3CTKJ01KPBRHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "overall phone is great. but as manyb have commented it is very hard to hear callers voice with volume turned to maximum and even when set to HOH setting.

If you're reading reviews, check the dates on them. This phone probably was awesome a while ago, but I would say it's aged quite a bit since release. Before I dig into what's wrong with this phone, if you want a phone to make calls with, do some messaging, and run an app or two, this phone *might* be ok for you, but if you want a phone that runs smoothly and is more up to date, get something else.I know, you're thinking, \"Great. I've spent hours checking phone reviews and someone always has something negative to say about the phone I want.\" That's how I felt as I was looking for a phone. After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to get this phone and it was a constant frustration. It comes with Android version 2.1.x (note - some might ship with 2.2), and while that works for most apps, there are a few apps that require 2.2. For me, those apps were Instagram, DoubleTwist, and MLB TV. I'm sure there are more than that, and there will probably be more in the future. Sure, you can upgrade to 2.2, but the upgrade application (Keis) is iffy (from what I read) and can brick your phone. I never used it.I did root the phone and try a variety of ROMs, but it was all meh. Rooting the phone is not difficult, but you do have to wade through quite a bit of information and out of date forums with broken links - or maybe you get lucky and get the right info right away who knows. If you're not super geeky like me, it might be kinda tricky. The battery life was terrible to start with and seemed even worse with custom ROMs. To be fair, from personal experience, the T989's battery life is not much better. I didn't do any kind of side-by-side tests of the T959 and T989 but I'm used to my iPad battery lasting forever with 3G on. Not so with either of these phones. However, the processor/speed difference between these phones is immense. Also, the GPS on this phone didn't work, whereas everything works great on the T989. I never saw any reviews for this phone that mentioned the GPS doesn't work, but after I got it and did some research, it seems quite a few of these phones have GPS problems.The default OS on the phone is fine and runs fairly smoothly, which is why I say if you don't want to do anything fancy, this phone might work for you. However, I like to tinker and I spent way too much time trying to get the phone to just work. Maybe there is a good custom ROM out there that runs smoothly and has all the features and isn't buggy, but unless you feel like learning all the information necessary to root your phone and install custom ROMs on it, you might want something else. I must have gotten a phone that doesn't allow you to go into recovery mode, so I had to work around that, which made rooting/custom ROM installing even more difficult. If you do get this phone, I'd recommend writing down what date you can return it by, because you very well might want to make use of that option.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "changed mind and exchanged for infuse", "Author": "Norm Dayplume \"Zeke\"", "ReviewID": "R3K1FKF2W8MVVC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to get the Infuse instead.

It crashed EVERY DAY from the day I had it. EVERY DAY. It could not go 24 hours without crashing. Apps were constantly disappearing mid-use, and the phone freezes daily to the point where the only way to resolve it is to pull the battery out and put it back in. This P0S phone also has no flash. Seriously? Which genius decided this phone didn't need flash? The firm ware is so horribly designed it freezes and it is extremely slow. It takes a long time to load icons even though the phone was brand new.This phone is essentially unusable without rooting. I finally broke down and rooted the phone and installed Octane Rom. The phone finally stopped crashing on me every day, although the 1GB ram proved too little, so Yelp and Gmail cannot be opened at the same time or the phone freezes. The phone MUST be rooted to be a usable phone, and forget about a decent camera. If you want your phone to also double as a camera, this is not the phone you're looking for.I also forgot to mention the genius who designed this phone locked down the FM feature from the hardware so even after rooting I could not get a signal on the FM app I installed. This phone cannot do FM.Also, this phone was loaded with bloatware galore. I had to uninstall a lot of the bloatware just to get enough phone memory so I can install a rom. The phone's internal memory is a joke. I would steer clear of this phone all together. It's such a P0S that if Costco did not break my awesome MyTouch4G and shoved this P0S in my way as a \"comparable phone\", I would have never chosen this P0S for myself. I heard they fixed a lot of the design issues with this phone in S II. If you want a Samsung Galaxy that much, get S II or S III.
