{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great! but......", "Author": "R. Lieber \"Teamdeez\"", "ReviewID": "R3E2RV6INQ414B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so the phone is awesome. I am an avid iphone user but didn't think the 4s or 5 was worth the upgrade. Plus I can purchase this phone unlocked for 300 bucks and use it when I am in the States or Mexico. The one caveat is this one, (the I8190), won't work with 3g data speeds. You will get Edge data speeds but if you want 3G Data in Mexico Telcel, or At&t; in the US, you will need the I8190-L. That model has the 850 band that is essential to the Telcel and At&t; 3G network data speeds. If I am mistaken on this fact, please correct me, however my research (and experience) spoke to this being true.Bottom line is the phone functions flawlessly and the Android OS is a breeze. Very easy to learn even if you are accustomed to iOS from Apple. Also has a few great features like NFC, toggling wireless and bluetooth and gps connections from the home screen; also a really useful feature of text to call where if you are texting someone and want to call them, you just lift the phone to your ear and after a 1 second delay it automatically dials them. Seemed trivial at first but I found myself using it all the time.The camera is great, although I never used it for video calls because I am married to facetime. Other than that, I highly recommend this model if your local network supports it or the \"-L\" model for use in the States and Mexico.

I've been using it about a month and a half now.  I have t-mobile and actually didn't have to change the settings for my mobile data or pictures messages to send, which was nice.It's a pretty small phone, which is convenient, but it's still big enough for texting and browsing the internet.  I've never used swype input on the keyboard in the past, but I've started using it on this phone and really enjoy it.  I think it is because the screen is small enough to swype quickly.It has a camera on the front and a camera on the back.  The back one is 5 MP, which is decent, takes pretty nice pictures.  The front camera takes pictures like you would expect from a front facing camera.  It has a flash, which is nice.Overall, for the price, this phone is more than worth it.  Most unlocked phones (that are android and good) are normally ridiculously priced, so I was glad to pick up this phone for a cheap price.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung i8190 galaxy siii mini", "Author": "Lyanne F.", "ReviewID": "R33R6XFXKM1W67", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the cellphone is fine and complete my requeriments!! i like it,i am from Venezuela and works perfectly corre thanks so much", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "thecomputerguy06 \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "RUVL17GM1G95T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm in the South East U.S.A. and I was concerned about purchasing the phone because most of the comments were about phone use in South America and over seas. I am using Simple Mobile unlimited pre-paid which utilizes the T-Mobile network.The Phone works fine! At first the battery life was horrible but once I turned off services like \"location\", \"wi-fi\", \"auto-updates\", the battery lasts for days. Charging it all the way and letting it go completely dead a few times also helps extend battery life.Internet is fast, app switching seems fine, no complaints from me. Other reviews claimed it paled in comparison to the S3 but I'm not seeing much of a difference. It does all I need it to. To be fair, I'm not one of those people who use their phone like a personal computer. I talk, text, and pretty much that's it. I might look up some driving directions occasionally and watch a youtube video here and there. So far doing those things have been a breeze. Haven't tried games or pandora and all that other jazz, just not into it.If you are a person who just needs to talk and text with occasional internet usage, but you don't want to pay $600 for a phone, this is the way to go! The size it awesome it doesn't look like I'm talking into a tablet!

Phone came with a U.S. electricity power supply, no international sockets although it came with a separate international adapter outside the phone box.

Also, the phone will have Orange branding on it (back cover), an Orange boot-screen and Orange bloatware accompanied by the typical Samsung bloatware. While the Orange branding/bloatware is a little off-putting, it doesn't have a major impact on the overall experience. Moving on...-------------------------------This thing is super light! Before this I had a 5\" screen phone and while that was nice for some things, it was huge when making phone calls and doing single hand actions. I love the size of the S3 Mini. It sounds great for music. Jelly Bean (Android 4.1.2) runs really smooth on this thing, with the occasional lag here and there. The screen resolution is great. Wi-fi works very well. I put in my AT&T; Prepaid SIM in and it worked straight out of the box. I got this phone mainly for travelling in Central America. I am super happy with it so far.MUST HAVE ACCESSORIES:Screen Protector: Spigen SGP S3 Mini Screen Protector 3-PackPick these over the more cheaper options available. I originally made the mistake of buying the MPERO 5 Pack and I don't even want to link them here because they suck so bad compared. The Spigen ones fit WAY BETTER and are much nicer.Case: E-LV Matte Flexible TPU Case Cover Skin With Adjustable and Removable Back StandThis case is a PERFECT FIT for the S3 Mini. It feels sturdy enough that it will last a while, plus it has a removable/adjustable kick stand which is very usable.SDCard: G.Skill 32GB Class 10 MicroSDHC Flash Card with SD AdapterThis is a given but I figured I would add it anyway. Get yourself a reliable, quality SDCard for this thing and don't look back!-------------------------------Like I said above, it ships with the usual Samsung bloatware as well as a couple Orange apps. These can be disabled via the app manager now in Jelly Bean. If you want to take it a step further, you can freeze/uninstall them with Titanium Backup after you have rooted. Rooting is a very simple process with this phone.*** ROOTING *** (at your own risk)UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE VIA KIES APP FIRST IF NECESSARY.Apparently, Amazon likes to strip links out... anyway go search the XDA forums and all the info you need is there.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice and recomended", "Author": "Eddy Barrios Orozco \"Eddy barrios\"", "ReviewID": "R1TKG9D3WVWTUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this phone and got the chance to use it for several month and loved it, i just sold it but only because im gonna get the s4 mini jeje not for any other reason. the seller and item both recommended", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a great phone!", "Author": "Michelle Mu", "ReviewID": "R12WQKP29QEQXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just upgraded from a HTC Wildfire S, and I'm so glad I did! The only problem with this phone was that it was an international model, so I had to adjust many settings (including time to 12 hours instead of 24 and celsius to farenheit). It also didn't come with an English manual. It came with an European charger as well, which living in the U.S., was pointless for me. But it did come with a separate USB cable that I just plugged into a USB wall port to charge it on the day it came. It works fine, as I set the language to English, U.S. The cell phone is perfect for my use! The cell phone itself is not to blame for the certain adjustments I had to make by being an American resident, so I gave it 5 stars. I would recommend, however, searching for an American model (if there is one) as opposed to this international model that I received if you are a U.S. resident. Otherwise, it's an amazing phone with many great features. I have T-Mobile and it works great.
