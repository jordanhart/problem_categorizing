Yes it is great that I can access the fm radio, but only with use from the headphones. The phone does not hold much memory so I had to buy a mirco sd card. I also do not like how the camera has no flash or zoom in or out function as my old phone that is not a touch screen has. This phone doesn't even fit into a case or screen protector, the samsung galaxy mini is much better, and the price for this phone is a ripoff, should go for at least $ 40.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible antenna reception", "Author": "Mariana Buela", "ReviewID": "R1STDV7KZHSAGK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "horrible antenna reception. probably cause it is a cheap cell, however I normally don't spend much in cells and never had such a bad experience.
