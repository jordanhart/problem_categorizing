The ring volume is just fine with about twenty included ring tones. The factory seting has the ringer starting soft and getting louder. I just changed mine to ring loud all the time that way I can catch it on the first or second ring. For some reason I have been getting text mail ads like text back and Win a new ... and such nonsense... I have blocked the numbers on the phone( a simple act) and gone online to their web site and opted out. Why do I have to wast my units of time on these ads.  The phone comes with a number you enter on the Tracfone after you go to [...] web page. It alco comes with a little booklet of offers for minutes. One of them is two hundred free minutes plus 90 extra days ( code 94437 I think)added to your one year. So you end up with 1400 minutes and 365+90 days... fantastic deal.  As a phone it is fine... no, it is not an iPhone or another fancy fone but a nice phone. The camera is a disapointment and just OK. Very low resolution,only 640 Kilopixls.  You can record your own ring tones... like Hay Answer the phone, Yes you... but then I haven't figured out how to apply the ring tone... it says some sort of file format issue? Oh well... I'll try again. I think the manual can be downloaded  from online...  Again simple well working phone. A very good buy and I would do it again.

It could not be set up and had to be returned. Not every model of Tracfone works in every part of the country.

The hardware is usually fine, but the company does not fully disclose everything about their products.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't Beat The Price!!!", "Author": "jimb220 \"jimb220\"", "ReviewID": "R175H1LATB2RIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone over a month ago now and am very pleased with its performance. The only dislikes are that the battery must be charged every three days, even if you do not use it much. My old Motorola flip phone would go about a week and I am not sure if its a bad battery or just made to be charged more frequently. Another issue is that, yes you have to watch for the browser button that others have complained about. I manage to hit once or twice myself but figured out how to open it with my left hand to help curb that problem. Other than than those two items I like this phone, but for those 2 dislikes I am giving it 4 Stars instead of 5. On the flip side, it is clear easy to operate, small and compact, easy to see outside and set-up is a snap on line with the use of the Tracfone website. Did not need customer service that others have complained about, so that is a good thing.I only use this phone when not at home and for long distance calls. I replaced a cellphone through Consumer Cellular that had 100 minutes/month ($18.95/month plan) before finding this one. Canceled that service and started with this Tracfone and will pay less than half for the same service. When activating on line I did nothing special and got about 2 months of extra time plus extra minutes, which was nice. When this time expires, I may just buy another phone rather than the 1 year 1200 minute card since the price seems to be the same here on Amazon. I also canceled my long distance service, on my land line phone, that cost me about $7.00/month extra and use this phone for long distance calls. Based on that reason for the 14 months/1200+ minutes alone it cost me less than keeping the long distance home phone service and I now have the mobility of a cell phone. This is a pretty good all around deal for someone who uses minimum cell phone time like me.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Hunny Bunny", "ReviewID": "R3QI9178D54XF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received promptly, activated phone and added minutes quickly, no problems!

Great coverage deep in the Wisconsin woods, worked well even with \"zero\" bars. The speaker volume was adequate if used as a phone without my hearing aid but really does not serve as a conference phone -- not a significant issue since most mobile phones are poor that way.But the big deal is the triple minutes feature and the included minutes.

It arrived sooner than estimated, just as described.  Being all thumbs was not an obstacle - it activated easily, and was up and running promptly.  It is too bad that it didn't come with a user's manual, but that is an issue for Samsung, not the seller.  Everyone assumes the world is computer fluent and needs no instructions.  I haven't tried to reload minutes yet, but I'm sure they will triple as promised with no problem. I like the slider better than my old flip phone, but have to get used to not picking it up by the \"end\" button.  Sound is fine, graphics are good.

The phones are great, with all the basic features, and very sturdy.  I've dropped mine several times and it keeps on working well.  They're reasonably priced, and I note Amazon's prices even with added shipping are better than Wal-mart's or Tracfone's. Over the past 12 months I've spent a total of $360 for phone and cards. I saw on Tracfone's website an 'online only' offer to change my double minutes phone to a triple minutes for life phone for $30.  Great. But in fact it's cheaper to purchase a new phone with triple minutes on Amazon than it is to buy that card plus airtime.In the past year my computer has never allowed me to go online to purchase anything on the Tracfone website. I thought the problem was my laptop.  But my desktop blocked it also.  Windows won't let me email them either. I'm assuming the problem is over-vigilant anti-virus programs in my 2 computers.  But calling or texting customer service is just not wise.  There are language problems, and endless loops of annoying music.  I've been transferred through 3 levels of 'customer service', first when I tried to switch the phone from Verizon, then when I tried to buy air time.  Each time I eventually gave up and waited until I was near the store where I can buy aircards.  That's 25 miles away.Imagine my surprise to find Amazon has a decent selection of tracfones.  I can order on Amazon in a snap. These are basic phones with useful features.  You control the useage, and you always know how much time you have available. My work involves a lot of texting, and texts are cheap on tracfone. Try it. Order it on Amazon (where internet purchases are easy!), or pick it up at your local department store (where it will cost a little more--about the same as it costs on the tracfone website).  Just stay away from Tracfone customer service and you'll be fine.  I give the phones 4 stars.  They're fine, tough basic phones.  I give customer service 0 stars.  The composite score is 2 stars.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery needs charging quite often", "Author": "L.

Otherwise, it has some really great features and is easy to use once you get use to the extra steps required performing some basic tasks.

I bought one of their fancy smart phones because it was a similar deal and was triple minutes.  It was a good deal, but for a guy like me who uses his phone to talk, go figure, this phone is perfect and very small and handy.  So I am super happy to get my favorite phone back with triple the minutes for life.  Love it and love the coverage, have never had a problem when I traveled.  I laugh at all the people who pay monthly what I pay yearly, and I can't stand smart phones anyhow.  Yes this doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it is PERFECT for me.  I love it!!!!I would activate the phone first and then add the airtime.  this way you can be sure you get coverage before adding card.  if not, just use the card on a different phone, you only paid 79 bucks for the card, lol.Also, you get 420 days not 360 when adding the first card, so this would be a great choice for someone just wanting an emergency phone as well.  Lasts longer then just a year.On tracfone website this is not an option for my area, but I took a chance and it worked anyway.These phones are just miracles, between my wife and I we have had over 8 tracfones and they have never even came close to letting us down.

Only complaint is that there were 2 years of coupons good one each month but the last good coupon expired Dec 2013 so they were of no use.  Other than that phone works well.  We are in a very rural area and had limited Verizon service, but have found the coverage in Central Wisconsin very good.  We retired and had Verizon for years because it was the best when we traveled for work for many years thru all the USA.  Now no longer need the talk time or the smart phone use on this phone, we have another phone for that.

I can't say that a Tracfone is for everyone but for us they are the perfect solution as we don't walk, drive and sit with our phones attached to our head or text that much.

I consider this disposable, but like I said Tracfone 3x minutes is the selling point.
