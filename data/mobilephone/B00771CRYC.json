(This review pertains to the International Unlocked version.)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"bestbenwade\"", "ReviewID": "R1NCKU39ANSFIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say I will never lock myself into a contract again. I waited two weeks before writing this review, so I have really used my new phone. I read that you need two hands to use the phone. I have not found that to be true, but the reality is: if you have very small hands - don't buy it. After I first bought the Note, I was having some \"buyer's remorse\" because of the price. However, the phone was half the price of the soon-to-be-released SG3, although it didn't have \"Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS),\" and it's processor had slightly lower specs. In operation, I found it to be very fast and responsive, even after I installed another launcher that caused my old phone to \"choke.\" I am VERY HAPPY with the volume on this phone. The speakers are loud and clear (for a cell phone), and the in-call volume is great (I'm hard-of-hearing - so that's a big deal for me!).The phone is very thin, if that's important to you (I think this concern is just an overblown advertising gimmick perpetrated by the \"fruit\" company. What finally got rid of my \"buyer's remorse\" completely was when I found out that the phone CAN be updated to ICS. Just Google ICS and Samsung Note and you'll find simple instructions.  The phone does everything I want it to do and it does it quickly and seamlessly. It never freezes or chokes. With Aldiko - a reading app, and the Kindle app, I can read all my books without squinting thanks to the huge screen, and the sound is great. Enjoy this phone for half the cost of the competition and use a pre-paid GSM SIM to get unlimited phone, text, and data. As an aside, I am using this phone with pay-as-you-go T-Mobile (under the brand name SIMPLE mobile - with unlimited everything). The phone WILL NOT GET 3G on T-Mobile, it only gets EDGE, but I find that getting UNLIMITED data makes up for that, and it is fast enough to stream Youtube etc. The phone WILL get 4G on AT&T;, but I cannot find a true unlimited plan from AT&T;, so scr*w them. On the other hand, because the phone is unlocked, I can use AT&T; pre-paid anytime I want to if I really need 4G and I don't mind being ripped off.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best phone I have ever used....", "Author": "Fernando Diaz", "ReviewID": "R8B0VC7UPPQ14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just start saying about some people here on Amazon giving the Note bad reviews cause its to big....YOU ARE THE PROBLEM...YOU GOT TINY HANDS....GO BACK TO YOUR IPHONE 3.5\" TINY SCREEN....PERIOD...Also let me point out that this import version completely destroys the ATT version of the NOTE..I had the ATT version and after a month of use, its a sloppy slow phone...things start to slow down and bad battery life..GET the real version...with the Exynos GPU...I have my Note running a 1ghz down from 1.4ghz, and let me tell you its buttery smooth...especially with ICS.Also the middle button is 10x better than those capacitive buttons on the US version..You don't have to look at it when your driving and need to exit any app..NO LTE meaning no battery life drainage..meaning it runs fine on HSDPS+....And my favorite part about it is the rooting community...It has so much support compare to the US Note....", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best mobile device on the planet !!!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2XTOGDMB43AQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buy one of these for everyone in your family.

The screen is large, yes, but amazingly beautiful and sharp colors. Very easy to change batteries if needed, and sim access is just under battery. I love the home button on this better than the USA version for AT&T; as it's much easier to find. It came with Android ICS installed already, so no need to upgrade yet. It automatically switches between WIFI and my data plan with no issues.Only two things worth mentioning. Being as it is an \"International\" version, it doesn't come with an American style charge plug. However, the plug is easily removed from the cord and has a USB plug which can easily be plugged into PC or laptop for charging. I ordered a car charger online for a few dollars and it works great.When buying a case for this I chose a bookstyle model which takes the place of the rear cover. The USA and international versions apparently have different back covers, so I ordered mine from AmazonUK and it fit perfectly.

For example, Note didn't have the ability to scroll the top menu (where you have wifi, blue tooth, sound, etc).  You were limited to 5 basic functions (wifi, bluetooth, gps, sound and auto rotation).  There are more features that Note missed from S3.Fortunately, Note 2 is an S3 in Note form.
