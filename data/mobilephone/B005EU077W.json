I took it to the AT&T; store and they couldn't make it work either.  It's not clear if this was an issue with this particular phone, or if this model doesn't work on AT&T;'s network.It appeared to be some sort of European domestic market phone, as the charger connects to house current with a Euro-style two-pronged \"snakebite\" connector, and the package included a Euro-to-US adapter.  Instruction manuals, etc. were in English.It seemed like a neat little phone for $50, and from the limited time I spent messing with the software, it seemed fine.  But, no network connection, no use.  The phone is now returned to Amazon.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone but not really unlocked", "Author": "JDM", "ReviewID": "R1XO7I165EWJPF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone was purchased as \"unlocked\" but like another purchaser I received a locked phone from a South African mobile company.  It would never accept the sim because it wasn't from vodacom.  So, I had to return to Amazon.  It was disappointing that the reseller continues to sell\"unlocked\" phones that really aren't. The phone's features were everything I expected and great to travel with overseas. It is not a smart phone but its Blackberry-like features will serve your basic needs.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "wow", "Author": "lmnop", "ReviewID": "R3UAKBO7H1KWH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am beyond happy with this purchase. i am going abroad for 2+ months and was looking for a phone with a qwerty keyboard that i could use with a sim from greece. after doing my research i purchased this phone and it came much faster than expected. not only did i get a brand new phone that exceeded my expectations but also a european converter which i didnt expect at all. would buy again a million times.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "does not work!", "Author": "PJ", "ReviewID": "R15FQ0ZL7ZQ900", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone does not work either with AT&T; or T-Mobile, although the product description claims that it is a unlocked GSM phone. When I turn on the phone, Vodacom logo, a South African telecom company, appears. It makes me seriously doubt that it is indeed unlocked.I like the phone per se because it is easy to use (i.e., typing/texting). But if it does not work, as claimed by the seller, it is useless.
