You can also buy cases for it too which is even better. The speaker is very loud which is good if you left it in the other room. The numbers are a bit too large for me, but it works okay. Isn't an easy phone to text on, but I'm sure ill get the hang of it. The only bad thing I have to say about the Coast, is when you flip it open, its a bit too long. They could have made the screen smaller. This is your everyday basic phone. The 2 megapixel camera isn't that bad, but isn't great. You can't expect too much for $20.00. All in all, I would say it is worth your money, and very easy to use.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad to see a flip phone for boost Mobile.", "Author": "Mary Brasel", "ReviewID": "R2ITYPMGRR1K6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this an A+++++ Glad to see a flip phone for people that only make call's.

The backlighting is very nice to make it easier to see (can be dimmed as you like of course). the buttons are soft to the touch and large enough to be easily used by anyone with finger or hand problems. the outside is not slick and has a slight texture for easy grip. the menus are not complicated. contacts are a bit of a challenge to put in due to how the typing of letters are keyed. but this is not a deal breaker for this phone. battery seems to be reliable for the few days I have owned this phone. boost mobile set-up is easy. boost mobile website is not complicated and is easy to navigate. Service areas are good even in the mountains of WNC. I do wish there was a way to turn off emergency alerts since the beep in the middle of the night can be disconcerting. but some people might want this. if you are into fashion, amazon offers pretty and colorful covers for this phone at under $5.00 including shipping. My most recent other phone was a sanyo katana which was several years old which is my comparison for the Kyocera coast. Kyocera offers the same phone with a different name through the virgin mobile service. of many basic phones I evaluated this was the best for simple uncomplicated use. in my research I discovered that the biggest players in mobile services do offer basic phones but do not have them in stock and the display phones are often not even the same as the ones available. I also found that the largest of companies just did not want to deal with someone who only wanted a basic phone as opposed to a smart phone (they also had the poorest quality basic phone). so do yourself a favor and don't bother with going to the \"store fronts\" - get your BASIC phone at amazon and choose a simple plan from your carrier of choice. Also be cautious of set-up of your phone if you go to a big box store. if they do it incorrectly it is a big inconvenience to get them to fix it (they will fix it or accept a return with some prodding). amazon and boost make it all easy with a great basic phone.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Not Great", "Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "R14UEI7TWO9A6O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for about a month now and it's just okay.

Kyocera has been making low to middle end phones for years for Boost Mobile aka Sprint Pre paid. This phone is good if your not interested in any of the advanced services Boost Mobile has to offer. It's good for people who want a decent middle to high end flip phone with a decent amount of features. My business uses pre paid phones all the time for short term communications over the course of a few days to a week. We started using the lowest end pre paid phones we could find from ATT. While the calling was fine the phone it's self was difficult to navigate and use. The Kyocera uses Sprints standard interface for feature phones which is simple and easy to use. It's literally point, scroll and click using the middle pad. The good thing about Boost mobile is if the phone goes without minuets for over 30 days you will loose the phone number. I know that sounds bad but it cost nothing to re activate the phone with a new number. ATT charges 10 bucks for a new sim card if your phone number expires.Pros:It has 2 dollar a day unlimited use or 35 bucks a month unlimited use.Very large screen for the price point compared to other prepaid flip phones.Large outer screenLong battery lifeComes with some basic apps installed like facebook and twitterOnline activation is crazy easy and simple.Boost Mobile online account manager is nice and simple to use.You can re fill the phone from the phone it's self which is a added bonus.Cons:Flimsy back coverSpotty coverage outside of populated areas (This is over all the case for Boost Mobile)This phone will not roam in CanadaBasic plastic casing could use some improvementFor the money this phone is a solid buy. Most places sell it for 29.99 or more. If you can find it for less then your getting a deal.

First the phone has bigger screens inside and out than any other CDMA flip/slider phones from Sprint.  But bigger screens will come with a bigger form factor, comparably to Samsung Factor and thicker as well.  The phone has pretty much the same functions as any other feature phones from Sprint, including Voice Command from Nuance.  So I can make calls while driving with no need to dial or looking up contacts, except pronouncing their names to the Voice Command.  I like the big raised buttons and not arrays close to each other.  But one thing I do not like about the phone is its keys/buttons feedback.  They take some force to press, unlike Samsung Factor's.

I downgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus (temporarily) while I investigate the relative usefulness of other networks and get away from paying Verizon a ridiculous $120 a month.  The Nexus is brilliant, and when I find an acceptable network to use, I'll be getting another or one of it's cousins.  It absolutely never dropped calls even in terrible network access areas (like where I live).  I couldn't get 3g or 4g signal very well on my GNexus/Verizon setup, but it would never drop calls.  My HTC Incredible had similar issues, but not as bad as this Coast phone.Though I'm on a different network with Boost, the towers each network operate from are the same.  I can pretty much make a network map of my home based on the signal meter (and other) behavior of each of the three phones.  They're all weak in the same places, strong (ish) in the same places, so I have no doubts as to the similarity of the networks.The Coast is easily the worst of the three phones in terms of signal and reception.  I can make it work as long as I don't go in the bad places.  I'm not complaining, really, as the phone was bought to use for a month and be done, and I'll be switching it out to a T-Mobile or AT&T; network burner next, but if you're planning on using this phone, check your options.  If you've always got 4 bars, you'll be fine, and it's a capable dumb phone.  It does what they all do and it makes phone calls.  Texting is equally as horrible on this phone as it is on any other dumb phone.If all you want is a phone that works and you are always in a strong cell phone network area, you could do worse.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "BOOST.. a carrier for people who do zero research on cell carriers and are vulnerable to primitive sales tactics", "Author": "Maxzis", "ReviewID": "R14SX95UOF0TSL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bottom Line: Boost phones have drastically less features than carriers like Tracfone, Cricket, AT&T; NET10, Virgin, T-Mobile, at at-least double the subscription cost. If Tracfone makes more sense than you that's bad..My parents have been subscribed through the local Boost store for about 4 years. My mother just got this exact phone today for $20. She was told it was a deal by the sales person while she was making her outrageous $50 payment. Funny thing is, it has literally no difference from her old phone, in the subscription or phone features. She basically wasted $20 on a service she is already spending too much on..Another Reason Boost and their phones are bad: Every ~3 months they find a new feature to remove from their phones. Last month it was GPS; which is next to worthless anyway because these phones are all based on legacy Java->J2ME at best, and it's not even a network feature. Not long before that they removed some other feature. Also, I've yet to see a Boost phone you didn't have to pay for MMS or Data to get your pictures off of. Because they all have their microUSB ports firmware locked, Bluetooth has the contacts feature if even that, and none of the phones have a media card like microSD.Use your brain, you'll save money, get better rates, get drastically more features, using just about anything except this carrier..", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Even for the low price, Not worth it...", "Author": "mitchell green", "ReviewID": "R33KKJUVNB3S94", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I switched from a smartphone to this and was very disappointed.
