{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Product!!!", "Author": "Kyle Da Vid", "ReviewID": "R1C4X9Y5OW0VZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing. My contract with verizon is ending next month, and I will be switching to prepaid for good. It is an unlocked phone (which means it can work without a contract.) All you need is a sim card (tmobile, at&t;, etc.) Get prepaid minutes. For 30 bucks a month, I get 1500 minutes. Thats 25 hours worth of talk time. More than enough for me or anyone else. You cant beat the price.PROS:The SVP G13 GSM Quad-band Watch Phone can be worn like a regular watch. It has a touchscreen dialpad and menu, a pin sized camera for taking still pictures and video capture (You would need an optional Micro SD card for storage) It has a wall charger which is USB and you can also charge with your computer as well. When it comes to talking and hearing, there are two ways: One, you can talk directly into the watch phone with the speakerphone turned on, or you can used the included or any bluetooth headset. If using the bluetooth, you dont need to talk into the microphone which is cool. The G13 also comes with a stylus pen which can help with navigating through the easy to use menu. Also, when typing in a contact, you can use the stylus' scribble feature to easily type in. The call quality is excellent based on your phone service, tmobile's coverage doesnt work well in the basement.It could work globally.CONS:Not recommended for texting, people with fat fingers, or 3-way calling. It is NOT waterproof either.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Gadget but not perfect", "Author": "Michael Somerville \"somertech\"", "ReviewID": "R2G1D7FWHN4YNH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As I am sure others have pointed out, this gadget has a few flaws that keep it from receiving a perfect rating.1. The display is not very crisp. The digits for the time (especially #1) appear very low res and are not in keeping with the rest of the device's features and technology.2. The screen sensitivity is not great. You really do need a stylus to manipulate the watch with any accuracy. Combining this less than stellar attribute with the poor screen res can make for some frustrating moments interacting with it.3. The menu system can be a little bizarre. For example the process of adding new contacts into the address book takes you through a strange sequence of steps that seems needlessly complicated. It's very easy to make a change to data, but then it's equally easy to not save those changes resulting in No change at all.4. The battery compartment is on the underside of the watch and provides direct access to the watches internals. The SIM card and MicroSD card slots are under the battery, but the seal around the battery does not appear to offer any measure of moisture/water resistance. I would recommend removing this watch during vigorously hand washing as you might end up getting water inside this thing.Forget about keeping it on while doing anything that might wet your wrists in any way.Having said that. The call quality is quite good according to the few people I have called using this gadget. It's Bluetooth radio paired effortlessly with my headset, and the call quality in both directions was usable and satisfactory.Once you have some numbers in your address book, speed dialing is quick and easy and calls seem to initiate very quickly, actually faster than most smart phones I've used.The built in speaker is very loud for ring tones and alerts, but oddly call volume is fairly low and requires that you literally put the thing to you ear to hear the other party, if you are not using a BT headset. Strange.However strange it looks, you can actually carry on a conversation with the watch speaker at your ear, as the mic seems to have the sensitivity to capture your voice well enough for the party on the other end to hear you. I personally don't care for walking around with those dorky BT headsets stuck in my ear, so I would just as soon use this with it to my ear, or preferably in speaker phone mode, if it had one.I'm a middle aged gadget freak, so I couldn't resist this item when I saw it, but the novelty wore off in about a day and I don't really have a need for it, so I gave it to my teenage son. He'll make better use of it and I like the fact that it is unlocked and will therefore work with just about any SIM from a contract free service provider. We are not believers in giving children expensive electronics like iPhones etc, so this will allow us to keep in touch with him after school without giving him something that will distract him from school and studies.Lastly, text messaging on this device works surprisingly well, and will allow us to send him messages during the day, and as long as the phone is in vibrate mode, will not be a disturbance during school hours.**** UPDATE ****Well, after just a little over 2 months, this thing is basically dead. Shortly after writing my initial assessment above, the poor materials and construction of this device became evident. It will no longer charge the battery as I suspect there is a fault in the charging port, or the charging cable. It requires a proprietary charging cable, so it is not a simple matter of replacing it with another. I have no idea if that is even possible or worth pursuing. Unfortunately, I suspect that this device is headed to the trash can less than 90 days after purchase and with only normal wear and tear being the cause.Great idea, poor execution, and I would not come close to considering a replacement (unless free) as I suspect the issues we encountered are not at all unique.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kids Love it!", "Author": "Sidney", "ReviewID": "R1AE53GTQ7A18R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perfect for what I needed it for. A child to keep his cell phone on! We have gone thru droping, drowing, and losing cell phones. He doesn't text or internet yet. But does love to call friends and family to see if they can play.

About the other things though:Design: The watch looks cool, and I've received a lot of compliments from people. They suspect that it's not \"just a watch\" and occasionally ask about it. Sometimes if I feel like it, I like to show the person some of its other functions and watch their jaw drop. Other times, I can just pass it off as a watch and feel like a spy. So, fun stuff aside...the screen is a bit big, so it's probably better suited for men. It looks a little less natural on women, but I'm ok with it. Overall, good design.Difficulty: The instruction manual that came with it wasn't too helpful when it came to details, but it covered the basics. I had to experiment for a while to find out exactly what this watch could do. Even now, I don't think I've figured out the whole thing. For example: Originally, every time I pressed a button, turned it on/off, etc, it would make really loud, annoying sounds. After exploring a bit, I finally found a mute setting, but it wasn't so obvious to find. Now, I think the online description of this watch says it includes a calculator, but I still haven't been able to find it. Overall, it takes some experimenting and time, but eventually it's pretty simple to use. I wish there was some more in-depth manual out there though.Functions: All the watch's extra capabilities make it a must for gadget lovers. Its multimedia functions include audio player/recorder, video player/recorder, camera, and a handy file manager to keep track of all those things.~The camera takes pretty small but decent pictures, 128x128. I would prefer a slightly better quality/bigger photo, but that's just me. The camera also isn't very noticeable, so if you turn off the shutter sound, it's pretty good for taking secret pictures. Um. Yeah. You should probably ask permission from people first though. Should, anyways.~The audio recorder isn't too great. I can barely distinguish voices, so it's not too good for recording lectures. There might be a way to improve the mic reception, but I haven't found it yet.~The video recorder uses up a lot of space. I haven't bought a mini SD card yet, so I haven't been able to try the video recorder. There's half a MB or so of built-in space in the watch, but that's not enough for a second of video recording.~There are also a bunch of other misc. functions, kind of like on a normal phone. Stuff like and organizer, a calendar, a stop watch, etc. Things like the planner are impractical because of how small the keyboard is, but it's still a cool thing to have.Battery: I like how they included two. If you charge both, you can easily switch them for twice the battery life. Most of the time, my watch is on standby anyways. I only occasionally check the time and sometimes use the other functions, mostly multimedia. One battery lasts me about 3 days, but if I guess if I were to use it more, then the two batteries would get me through the day.Conclusion: I think I've covered the main stuff about this phone watch. Sorry about not being able to comment on the important thing-the phone part. Judging by the poor audio recorder, I don't think talking through the watch would be a good idea, but the included earphone and Bluetooth set should make up for it. The earphone has a built in mic too. Without a SIM card, there are still so many functions I can't use (SMS messaging, speed dial, even this one button that I think means INTERNET) So overall, I really like my watch, though I definitely would change certain things. (audio recorder, better manual, etc)  It's great for gadget lovers and really can impress people.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "almost perfect", "Author": "dman", "ReviewID": "R2YR61KG72TM96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bluetooth headset that came with it is total crap.

Shing", "ReviewID": "R2V3PUE1UIJ917", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only had it for a day and am impressed with many of the features.  UI is a bit quirky and the \"1\" for time display is hard to see.Got this phone for my kids.  I am sure they will try texting, but it being so small, will slow them down.PRO:  Purchased a new TMobile pay as you go SIM card $10 and it worked immediately.  Added $100 1000 minutes.  Speed dial is useful.  MOM, DAD, HOME, etc.  Camera works great.  I like the way Calendar shows you the number of week of the year.CONS: Can't get volume on speaker phone to be any louder than a handset would get.  Does recognize my 8GB microSD - probably only SD, not SDHC;  Was able to take a few 640x480 pictures to store on phone memory.  USB charger uses a propriety connector to watch.

Dancejic", "ReviewID": "R3RSX5EJRSGBRA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While hardware limitations are understandable (battery needs to be charged daily, camera is not really usable - but it is not even needed, Bluetooth is disconnecting easily), this can't be said for software. Basically, menus are not well organized and basic operations should be much easier than they are. It is noticeable that this aspect was not well designed.One example would be operation of calling somebody. One button press brings contact list (which is good), you can then scroll with another button (which is OK), but then instead of just being able to press button to make call - you end up with next level of menu (for selecting what to do with that contact).There are numerous examples like that, and they are perfect to demonstrate why Apple is usually succeeding where others fail (it is all about user experience and usability).Other than that, this product is kind of OK for what I needed it for. I was on vacation, and did not care to carry smart phone in my pocket (wanted to have as few items as possible in my pockets). And I was thinking that built-in speaker was a good option, but found that it is kind of awkward to talk with my hand next to my ear (I ended up using Bluetooth most of the time).In retrospect, this gadget would be more suitable for kids, and I am not sure if I would recommend it - maybe if operations are redesigned to be simple (there is no need to have too many operations with this product, just to make them as simple for use as possible).", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Watch Phone is Execellent", "Author": "Bety", "ReviewID": "R2Z7SA4IIGP5TT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this Wath Phone y USB memory too. hopefully it takes so sending, should have a better option than not more expensive the item and arrives quickly.
