{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Apple iPhone 4S, Does it Live up to the Hype?", "Author": "The Gifted One", "ReviewID": "RJHYN034LR9JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I entered the smartphone world back in 2008 staring with the Apple iPhone 3G.  Coming over from my old Sprint flip-phone, the iPhone 3G was a major upgrade and blew my mind with how much it could do.  It was amazing that cell phones had advanced into a sort of mini-PC.Fast forward to the present-day and I have now used and experimented with various smartphones, different cellphone companies, and smartphones OS's (iOS, Android, Windows, etc).  I also run my own small cell phone shop and get to play with these devices on a daily basis.  Back in the iPhone 3G days, there were only a few smartphone options to choose from.  Today there are literally hundreds of devices across several carriers.  All with different functions and designs.  I'm going to cover how the iPhone 4S stacks up to the competition, what the competition is, what the 4S can do, and what improvements it makes over its predecessor, the iPhone 4.HARDWAREThe iPhone 4S is almost identical in hardware design to the iPhone 4.  It features the same rectangular shape with the flat gorilla glass back and front screen.  The front and rear camera are in the same position.  The only visible difference on the outside of the phone is that the volume controls are slightly moved on the 4S.  The real difference in the hardware is on the inside.  The iPhone 4S uses a dual-core \"A5\" processor.  This makes it significantly faster than the iPhone 4.  The processor is the raw power that apps need in order to operate fast and fluidly without slowdown or hiccups.  With basic use, users probably won't notice much difference from the iPhone 4's speed.  The extra power boost mainly shows its worth when playing some of the more high-end iOS games and apps.CAMERAIn addition to the new processor, the iPhone 4S has an improved 8 megapixel camera.  It also now has the ability to capture full 1080p HD Video.  Unless you're a professional photographer, you will be blown away with how great the 4S is at taking pictures.  It is on par with most of the dedicated point-and-shoot cameras that are currently on the market.  Images are clear, crisp, and very colorful.  I even sold my 10MP Canon point-and-shoot after using the 4S for a few weeks.  When comparing pictures taken with the iPhone 4 side by side to the 4S, the difference is like night and day.  As for the 1080P videos, they're also very beautiful.  Just like the photos, the videos rival dedicated point-and-shoot devices and look absolutely gorgeous on the iPhone's retina display screen.  The only drawback to these 1080p videos is that they can take up large amounts of memory.  So if you plan on shooting a large amount of video, you may need to consider getting the 32GB or 64GB iPhone 4S.SIGNAL RECEPTION AND DATA SPEEDSThe iPhone 4S has been expanded to include a 3rd US carrier Sprint.  This brings your total choices to Verizon, AT&T;, and Sprint.Signal reception and data speeds will vary by carrier and location, so I'll give you some basic information about what to expect on average.  Signal reception is greatly improved compared to the iPhone 4.  The antenna problem from the iPhone 4 has been removed and the 4S uses separate antennas for incoming and outgoing calls in order to increase overall reception. AT&T; is a GSM carrier while Sprint and Verizon are CDMA carriers.  Verizon has the overall largest and most expansive voice coverage of the three, closely followed by AT&T;, with Sprint in third.  The 4S Data speeds will largely vary by carrier and location.  Being a GSM carrier, AT&T; is the only iPhone carrier capable of using the 4S's improved HSPA+ data speeds.  AT&T; users will notice their iPhones showing \"4G\" in the top left corner rather than 3G.  Though this is faster than standard 3G, do not confuse it with the much faster 4G LTE network.  The iPhone 4S is not yet capable of using that network.  Verizon is second in 3G data speeds, with Sprint bringing up the rear.  Again, these are average speeds from across the nation.  Individual results may vary depending on your location.  It is also important to note that Sprint is the only carrier that still offers unlimited data.  This may be an important factor in choosing a carrier for some.BATTERY LIFEiPhone owners have come to expect excellent battery life from their devices.  Previous iPhones have ranked among the most impressive in terms of battery life compared to rival Android devices.  In the past each new iteration of the iPhone had better battery life than the previous device.  With the 4S however, the overall battery life is about the same as the iPhone 4.  Apple claims this is mainly because of the dual-core processor used by the 4S as well as the more demanding iOS 5 software that is included with the iPhone 4S.  Due to this, there were some widespread complaints about the iPhone 4S battery life initially.  Apple has since addressed the issue with their iOS 5.1 update.  The iPhone 4S now ranks among the top smartphones in overall battery life.  I can easily get through a full day on one full charge of average use.SOFTWAREUsually when comparing the iPhone to other phones, it comes down to the software.  There is a big ongoing debate among techies between the iPhone's operating system \"iOS\" and Google's \"Android\" operating system.  It's comparable to the famous PC vs Mac debate.  Rather than type a whole page comparing the two, I'll just cover a few basics.  The main difference between the two is choice.  Customize or not customize.  iOS is more fluid and crisp out of the box.  All iPhones/iPods/iPads use this standard OS.  Less powerful iOS devices are often able to move as fast or faster than more powerful Android counterparts.  However, major modifications and customizations of Apple's iOS are not possible.  The standard 4x4 row of icons is what you will get.  Android offers tons of customization options.  This is great for advanced tech users, but can be overwhelming to novice smartphone users or those not really interested in editing and customizing a lot to get the device to do what they need it to do.  I usually recommend iOS to customers new to smartphones due to its more simple and easy to use interface.  If you like customizing and making your the software on your phone look different from everyone else, I recommend an Android device.The other major software difference between iOS and Android is the Apps.  The Apple app store still has by far the most support and overall apps from developers.  Most developers create an app for the iPhone first and port it later on to Android, or sometimes not at all.  From personal experiences with both, I can say that many times the iPhone version of an app usually runs better or has more features.SIRI Personal AssistantUnless you've been under a rock for the past few months, you've heard of the iPhone 4S's SIRI personal assistant software.  Apple touts it as a feature that allows you to speak voice commands to your iPhone and SIRI will do whatever you ask it to do.  Well it can do some things, but not quite everything.  SIRI is great for finding places for you.  You can say simple things like \"I'm hungry\" and SIRI will open the Maps App and show you the location of all restaurants in the nearby area.  You can also do things like tell it to play a certain song or artist from the music stored on your iPhone or ask it the Weather forecast for any given day.  SIRI can also be pretty entertaining when asked random conversational questions.  Questions such as \"How old are you?\" will cause SIRI to respond \"Does this concern you?\", \"I didn't think so\".  Or saying silly things such as \"SIRI I love you\" will cause it to say \"I'll bet you say that to all your Apple products\".  Overall it's a pretty nice added feature, but not a major selling point at this time.  It's limitation is that it currently is only integrated with the standard apps that Apple provides on the iPhone.  Once it is integrated with more of the third-part apps, I can see it becoming a seriously useful feature.Overall I would definitely recommend the iPhone 4S.  From the sleek hardware design, the beautiful camera, and the very large Apple App store, it's my top phone at the moment.  The iPhone 4S has the battery life to last most people a full day and in terms of overall speed and ease of use, it is currently among the best available.  The only people who I would not recommend the 4S to are current iPhone 4 owners.  With all of the iPhone 4S's improvements, I don't feel like they're significant enough to spend more money to upgrade from your iPhone 4.  You will be better off waiting for whatever iPhone Apple releases later this year.  However if you're looking to purchase your first smartphone, tired of your old Blackberry or Android device, or just have an older iPhone 3GS or 3G, I would strongly recommend getting the iPhone 4S if possible.

I'll make this short and sweet.What I love:1. The awesome camera, especially when paired with the Camera+ app, allows me to keep my bulky DSLR at home when I need a good, serviceable scenery shot for social media posts.2. How much nicer the apps are compared to those on the Android platform.  The iPhone apps run smoother and are much nicer to look at.3. The size is perfect.  It fits with ease in my hands as well as my pockets.  It feels natural when I hold it - probably explains why a klutz like me hasn't dropped it yet (knock on wood).4. Siri is a reliable personal assistant for very basic tasks.  I regularly ask her to set my alarm and she has yet to let me down.  No important dates/meetings missed yet!  I can't wait to see what else she can do.What could be better:1. The price could be lower.  I bought mine unsubsidized for $649+ through Virgin Mobile to avoid the ridiculous two-year commitment Verizon wanted from me.Overall, I have no regrets moving to the iPhone 4S, a beautiful, intuitive, well-designed mobile device destined to become a modern museum piece.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone !", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "R1L87SAM3AFES6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Awesome product! :) it works really well :D it was just a little too expensive but it was worth it :)", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "false advertisement", "Author": "jesse", "ReviewID": "RMFH30QYKO2XI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The ad was specifically for a iphone 4 with an AT&T; network and once i recieved it and tookit into  the store they discovered it was a verizon phone.

I was ecstatic to open the box of the most raved about smartphone of this generation. Not only is the iPhone a great phone, but it has become a status symbol of our time.After a year with the iPhone, I can still say I love it (which is unusual with cellphones I've had in the past, they're usually having a glitch of some kind after a year or less of use)! It has all of the wonders of a generic cell phone: text messaging (with the added fun of emoticons), calling (including FaceTime, exclusive to Apple products), calendar, alerts, and now social networking. When I first powered up my iPhone, I was surprised to find the \"Twitter\" app already installed, because apple is partnered with Twitter, their built-in app is AMAZING! The Apple app store is another bonus of having the iPhone. You can find any and every app from Apple's app store. I also love the simplicity of the iPhone, with one simple button on the face, a lock button on top, and volume buttons on the side, it's not too hard to figure out. I can go on forever about how amazing the iPhone is, because it hasn't let me down yet.Apple does, however, fail me in one aspect of the iPhone. The phone is made of glass. The fragility of the phone makes it like a prized possession that must be handled carefully, any wrong drop at the wrong angle can shatter your screen and break your heart in an instant.

Now that you can get the iPhone 4 for free with a two-year contract, it's worth giving this little workhorse another look.Only two years ago, this phone had the fastest processor on any smart device. While the competition ( including three new iPhones from Apple) have better overall specs, the 4s is no slouch. Performance is still snappy even running Apple's latest version of iOS 7. Frame rates are consistently smooth when swiping between home pages and opening apps. And first party apps like Siri and Maps run without a hitch.Next to the competition, the screen on the 4s seems to get smaller everyday, but the quality of that screen, in terms of dots per inch and color reproduction, hasn't given up much ground. The same goes for the camera, which arguably produces better results than flagship phones such as the HTC One, and can still easily replace most point-and-shoot cameras.And for most people, the reason why they buy a phone is to make calls. To that end, the iPhone 4s does not disappoint. Calls are crisp. Simple, but often overlooked tasks, such as visual voicemail, or copy and paste between contacts, text messages, and dialer functions is taken for granted by iOS users, but still refreshing for Android users, where these features feel much more half-baked.The biggest and most obvious feature you'll miss out on with the 4s is the screen size. While it works great for basic tasks such as making calls, looking up directions, or playing music, it's not nearly as comfortable as a go-to device for browsing the web, reading books, or watching video.That said, the iPhone 4s is still a world class-device that shouldn't be overlooked. At just over two years old (and despite what marketers would have you believe), it does a fantastic job doing the things you need it to do, like taking calls, snapping pictures, and delivering on the promise to put the Internet in your pocket. What's more, you can get it for free, which makes a compelling case for which phone gives you the most bang for your buck.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product for a great price.", "Author": "Yolanda M.

Milliken \"Rev Ralph\"", "ReviewID": "R38EZF6503PCW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the third smartphone I have owned, and the first one I have genuinely loved. From the first moment to now I love this phone. This is rare for me. The first smartphone I owned was the Palm Pixi, and it did not live up to the hype. It was fragile (not to say that the iPhone isn't, because by all means it is very fragile), came apart easily, and after less than 6 months, it was rendered almost unusable. When it came time for an update, I decided that even though my family would be taking the iPhone route, I was not an Apple Fanboy, and I would give Android a try. I got what was supposed to be the best smartphone \"in the world\", but ended up being a mistake, the Motorola Atrix. It worked well, there is no denying, but the screen was plasticky and almost couldn't be used without the constant turn off, and turn back on, to make sure that no random contact would get a text from me that would read: hfdhafjkadjkfaj;sdfjasdfjd  djfakldfjadjklfasd. Not to mention the battery life was not the greatest, it took forever to charge, and the phone itself took a long time to learn. Suffice it to say that after one long year with the phone I decided I would go against all my ethics, slip out of my contract, and spend an arm and a leg for a cellphone that I was not even sure if I would like. I was by no means an Apple Fanboy, but I had high hopes for this phone, and it has surpassed them and more. It is fast, it is built well, it is a seamless learning process to get used to it, the messaging app is crisp and clean, the visual voice mail and the calling app in general are great, there are tons of well designed apps, the screen is crystal clear, the music application far surpasses most Android phones (including my old cellphone), and it has a reputation of high-quality, long lasting products to back it. Yes, it is expensive, but it is very worth it. If you want a phone that feels well built, and solid, and will perform well, I assure you that this one does not disappoint.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The item wasn't in a condition as described", "Author": "Alex Galata", "ReviewID": "R34PILF16P0U0J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The item wasn't in that condition as it was described.

Though Buymart and Amazon gives replacement only within like 3 months, I was expecting Manufacturer warrenty of 1 year from Apple.To my surprise Apple said the warranty expired as this product was purchased in Sep 2009! The most surprising thing is that They said lots of parts in this phone has been replaced and tampered with. This was surprise to me since I payed almost 300 bucks to get this phone in \"New\" condition!I Don't see an option to attach a file else I would have  uploaded the diagnosis results from Apple Store here. But these are the highlights from Apple diagnosis notes. I have decided to file lawsuit against amazon and Buymart as both are doing fraud- Upon Visual inspection Unit appears to have third party modification- Unit was purchased in 2009 and taken to a third party location to have repairs- Unit receiver and Speaker is third party- Back module is third party- Unit was sold as \"like new\" however there is evidence of third party repair- Service denied due to unauthorized modificationSo think before you decide to buyThanks,Sunil", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am very disappointed", "Author": "changping wang", "ReviewID": "R2OLQUGJD4VROB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Charger is bad.back Cover is not original, Battery charging 300 times, I am very disappointed,If I'm not in China,I must return", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "RLZKPQTQU909W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The specifications were all correct and this phone has not given me any problems.

In addition, this review is not baased on a purchase thru Amazon.com.Usage:I have had this model of phone (Apple iPhone 4S 16GB White) since September of 2012. I have had it replaced in April of 2013 due to a mix of personal and manufacturer issues. I have also had that replacement replaced in November of 2013 due to manufacturer issues. However, I still have to say, because of the Genius Bar and overall Warrenty (AppleCare+) experiences, it's a key part of this device's goods. Plus, if I am not a power-user, I don't have to replace it! In addition, for a long term feel, I think Battery Life could see improvements, even the newest could see some more improvements because the sub 2000-mAh battery is not enough for real world usage. I'm down to 50% before mid-day even passed so it's not a device for the power-user like me.Connectivity:I have to say, there is indeed still somewhat of antenna issues but it's not as bad as it can be, which means it's comparable in performance with most comparable smartphones out there. However, I would say this, this device can perform better than comparable devices, simply due to the communication technology algorithms, especially since I can have a HD video load smoothly in real time without any issues when not throttled on \"4G - 3G\". I would also note that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are solid when you are on iOS 6.1 or higher, however if you do not want iOS 7 taking up storage (assuming your current device doesn't have it) don't turn on Wi-Fi or your device will have up to 3GB's lost depending.Audio/Video:The iPhone is pretty much well know to have an amazing screen and audio preformance, however I just wish the device has a slightly larger screen, and a slighty better speaker so I can see and hear much better, but I would be more scathing if this device is released in 2013 as in 2011/2012 only the smaller devices had better performance. I would indeed say this, the color accuracy is great, the screen is sharp and everything look great, especially high-quality photos. Music listening is also great even so the speaker could see more improvements, still it's probably the best speaker on a Smartphone in 2011-2012 years, perhaps even in 2013 from iOS to Android to Windows Phone to Blackberry. The iPhone 4S is just solid still, even 2+ years later!Camera:Coming from Feature Phones and owning a 3GS and iPad 2 for a little over a year when I upgraded in 2012, I have to say the Camera is amazing, it's a dramatic upgrade. Even so there are better cameraphones out there like the Lumia 92x/102x series, Samsung Galaxy S4/N3 and iPhone 5S, the 4S still can deliver in 2013, and for the greater part of 2014. So you'll have a solid device for at least 50% of your contract if you buy before New Years 2013-2014 so it's an amazing device to own still. The 8 MegaPixels deliver sharp images, comparable to a Canon upper range Point & Shoot, though I wouldn't put it comparable to DSLR as Apple puts it since it doesn't deliver RAW as DSLR's deliver RAW.Overall: Overall rating is 4/5 stars as of November 2013, so I would highly recommend it, especially if you are comparing it to the 5/5C since the 4S is good enough if not, a tad bit more solid oddly.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Phone, even in 2013, which is 2 years from birth!", "Author": "Kevin AcelaExpress", "ReviewID": "R1KRI6S862ZZ99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I personally have an intermediate/advanced amatuer kind of knowledge so I am not an expert expert if you will so this review will be based as is.

As a college student I am always on the go, however need to stay in contact with certain aspects of my life such as checking and sending emails, keeping up with social media, etc. The iPhone 4S truly does make this easy to accomplish with minimal problems or issues. The phone is easy to operate once you get the hang of it, much like any new and unfamiliar device. I was impressed with how simple the layout is of the phone itself also. I use this phone for basically all of my day-to-day activities, and this phone only makes completing these easier. I feel as though everything I could need for my lifestyle currently is at my fingertips with the iPhone 4S. One of the only negatives that I have for this phone is that it is extremely fragile. Many of my friends keep a cheap, plastic case on their phone where it could easily break after one fall. I recommend something more durable for keeping your phone safe since the screen is the largest and only component on this phone. I also thought that I would have more issues with texting on my phone seeing as I have been used to actually pressing buttons and not just typing on a virtual keyboard, however texting and typing on this phone was simple and easy to pick up.

It is very similar to the iPod touch but has more features that make it more compelling. It's the perfect for people aged 16+ because of everything that it has to offer. It makes phone calls which every phone does but at the same time this phone works better than ever phone I had in my life. It also has an app store feature which you can go on and buy several different apps. I love to have educational apps, apps for school, and games to keep myself busy when I am waiting somewhere. It also is capable of uploading and purchasing music so that you can listen to it when ever and where ever you are. I also enjoy that you can hook it up to wifi and google or web search everywhere. That is very helpful just like having a GPS built in so that you never get lost again. It also captures videos and photos great but it could have better zoom. The software updates every so often to make sure that your phone is up to date and virus free. I honestly will never have any phone but and iPhone. I can't wait to get the newest up to date version.

I was overseas so i put my overseas sim card in and used free hotspot :-) I was getting 2g speeds but it was great thanks to the iphone 4s....Since then i sold it for about $400 to try out the galaxy note, nope i somehow had to find my way back to the 4s so after trading and trading phones i ran across the 4s again. I was tricked lol into trying out the galaxy s3 and it was really nice, i dunno i just had that urge to go back to the iphone since all my notes was synced and pics was sync. so about 3 months later I just traded it back in for a iphone 4s my 3rd one. I'm probably gonna stay with the 4s for another year until more devices carry the new iphone 5 port for plug-in. androids are ok but i just feel they dont have any unique features you cant get on iphone.

When I received the phone for my mother, I took it into AT&T; with her to activate it. They took it into the back and promptly returned, telling us that their system had it listed as stolen. They said that it may have been a refurb and the seller hadn't had it removed from the blacklist. Either way, this phone either wasn't \"Brand New,\" (I did notice some possible wear when I took it out of the box) or worse, it was stolen. The happy-ish ending is that it was fulfilled by Amazon and when I called them about it they were incredibly surprised themselves and very nice and quick to issue a refund (it was back on my account within 30 minutes). They said they'd never heard of this happening with an Amazon fulfilled order and were very apologetic.

Like the iPhone 4, which sparked a class-action lawsuit over its poor wi-fi antenna, the iPhone 4S is dogged by thousands of blog postings and reviews all over the internet that expose a serious problem with its wi-fi abilities.  The 4S is really a small computer, with Apple's endless offering of apps and very good voice control via Siri, but all of that causes massive data usage.  Unless you have an unlimited plan, you really need to use wi-fi as much as possible to avoid overages.  Perhaps even more important, the phone is much slower in 3G or 4G than on wi-fi, and you can't update the operating system unless the phone can access wi-fi for the massive download (unless you hook the 4S up to a computer, but then the update often fails multiple times before completing, causing hours of lost time).Despite Apple's reputation for innovative products, they also have a well-deserved reputation for ignoring these types of problems.  Despite all the blog entries in their own forums, Apple hasn't acknowledged this problem or offered any solutions (other than buying yet another phone, of course).Having used the 4S for over a year, I can say that it WAS a big step forward from my previous phone, but if I had known about the wi-fi issues, I would have bought something else.

Read on if you like to hear of my experiences with Apple customer service.My wife purchased this phone and it worked okay until I installed a wireless system in my home.  My Galaxy III had no problems finding the network (nor any problems, I highly recommend it), nor did any of my computers.  However, her phone would not see the network.  We chatted with Apple support numerous times to no avail.  Finally, they said they would send a placement phone, a refurbished one (Beware of such phones).  Also, I had to guarantee we would return the old phone with a $450 charge to my credit card.The refurbished phone finally arrived and on the third day it would not power on.  However, when placed on a charger it would work but would not charge past 30%.  Again, after several phones calls they decided that this phone was defective.  The tech person said he would have a brand new phone sent and seem surprised that I was not excited over this.  The original phone was less than 9 months old.  However, he could not authorize this and I would have to wait another day for another person to phone to set up the delivery.This person phoned the next day and also seemed surprised that I was not delighted in the fact they would be sending me a new phone.  She explained in 4 to 5 days I would receive the new phone and would again charge my credit card until they received the old phone.  When I complained about some compensation for my trouble with their defective products she seemed surprised that anyone would ask such a thing of Apple.  She made a vague offer of some inexpensive accessory.So we are currently without a phone unless it is plugged into a charger.BTW, from my recent experience you will find all of the Apple people rather sickening in their \"sweetness\" and use of phases like \"have a perfect day\" or \"that is just perfect of you\".", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad things in Amazon sell", "Author": "Bhadra Rai", "ReviewID": "R1IRX4H88P1XU4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (White)  from Amazon.

I explained that I was from out of town and that Apple support told me to just drop by, I have an open case number and won't be around for long. They refused to exchange my phone and said they could give me an appointment in a few days. My expensive Apple iPhone 4s is broken and I can not exchange it. Thanks Apple. I will make sure that I never purchase another Apple product, customer support and service is horrible. You make enough money and should repair or replace a product I paid for and is under warranty.

This is the first apple product I have ever owned. There are things about this phone that I really like. I will get to those first. I like the way you can delete apps from the front screen without having to go into your settings and struggle to find what you are looking for. I think the display is pretty good and the phone itself is quite sturdy. I like the design as I don't accidentally push buttons that turn the phone on and off all the time like I have had problems with on previous phones. I like that you have so many screens and storage folders that you can access on the front screens so you don't have to spend forever looking for where you put something.All of those things are nice, but here are my problems with this phone. I hate that there is no removable media. Good luck and best wishes if you want to add music to your phone you had stored on a previous sd card. With apple it is either feast or famine. You can pay a ridiculous amount to download the music you want from Itunes or you can try as you might to use the itunes software to download the music you did not buy from the apple store. I had around two thousand songs saved onto my previous sd card from my last phone and low and behold, only about ten percent of them successfully made it over to the iphone. I hate that it is ridiculously hard to add pictures to your phone unless you downloaded them from the net or your email or took them from the actual phone camera. I miss having an sd card you can slide out and edit the contents of from your computer. The selection of ringtones that come with the phone are a joke and in order to add new ones, once again (kinda seeing a pattern here) you have to go to itunes on your pc to do so unless you want to pay for them.Often when a phone call comes in, the phone pops speaker phone on and you can't shut it off without disconnecting the call. Sometimes it will refuse to hang up the phone call you are on. occasionally I lose 3g coverage for no apparent reason and the only way to fix this is by shutting off the phone and waiting a few minutes before you turn it back on. If you leave the phone off and don't touch it, the battery will last for days, but if you use it regularly, you had better have a charger nearby. I have had this phone for about six months and wanted to wait until I felt I was used to it before leaving a review. My over all opinion is that it isn't a terrible phone, but for someone who is used to an android device, it is bound to be somewhat frustrating. I would think carefully before getting an iphone about what your needs are and if this phone can fulfill them.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nightmare to Set-Up; Fun to Use Afterwards", "Author": "Eric K.", "ReviewID": "RMQE9IULEZAQ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that setting up the iPhone initially is a nightmare that can take -- literally -- days.  I can't even imagine how horrifying it would be for someone who isn't familiar with network connections, programming issues, etc.  There's this connection, that connection, linking it up to iTunes on a computer, contacting Sprint to resolve issues, contacting Sprint again to resolve more (or the same) issues.  I had better luck with reception in the 1970s with a sheet of tinfoil and a TV antenna.  I've had the phone for over a week, and I'm still contacting Sprint to resolve set-up issues.The iPhone activated in stages.  An hour after \"activating\" it online (and connecting it to iTunes), the phone part started to work so I could make outgoing calls.  Two hours later, the Internet kicked in.  Three hours later, texting became available.  Why it's not \"plug and play\" baffles my mind in today's fast-paced, instantaneous world.Then came issues with the phone calls and texts.  We finally discovered that it was because the Airave that Sprint sent us because we have poor Sprint reception at our house (in a heavily populated neighborhood) wasn't/isn't compatible with the iPhone.  It \"hiccups.\"  Phone calls go straight to voicemail.  Texts won't send out.  Multiple same texts come in.  Over and over and over again.  After reading up online about other people's similar problems and contacting Sprint over and over again, we finally just unplugged the Airave.  It was the lesser of two evils.Another problem that arose was that when sending texts to email accounts, they showed up as picture mail, regardless of a picture being attached or not.  Several chats with Sprint later, there's still no resolution.  We've given up on that.  Similarly, when sending these \"texts\" to email accounts, the email address shown was a randomly generated email address based on the first person's name of the shared family plan.  That became confusing when the person sending the text wasn't the first person on the plan.  Two hours of chatting with Sprint, that was finally resolved.  (You can't manually change it online yourself for whatever reason.)The actual iPhone itself is fun to use.  The apps available are numerous, and you have to hunt and peck to find out which ones appeal most to you, download them, arrange them, and learn how to use them.The sound on voice calls isn't as good as my last non-smart Samsung phone, but I'm getting used to it.With my old phone, I could charge it every three days or so.  With the iPhone, I have to charge -- at the minimum -- nightly.  It drains energy/power faster than a half-working air conditioner in NYC in the middle of summer.  And this is just casually using it during the day, not heavily.  I also practice steps to reduce the power usage: toning down the screen brightness, closing all apps after use, etc.  I recommend getting multiple charging adapters -- for home, work, and car.  But make sure to only charge them fully when they're close to being out of power.I went with the iPhone 4S vs. the iPhone 4 mainly for Siri.  I thought that would be a great addition/concept, especially while driving.  Unfortunately, Siri has a mind of her own and only wants to work when she wants to work.  I'm constantly getting, \"I'm sorry, but I cannot take requests at this time.  Please try again later.\"  Isn't the main purpose of asking things of Siri because you need that information RIGHT NOW?  Like directions?  Or to remind you of something later because you'll forget?  In those cases, \"trying again later\" isn't feasible.  My advice is to NOT get the 4S for Siri alone.  Get it for other features/reasons.  Otherwise, stick with the very similar 4 and save yourself a hundred bucks or so.Do I recommend it?  Maybe.  Once you get over the huge hurdles of set-up, it can be fun to use, and the features are nice to have at your fingertips.  I don't have any comparisons to other smartphones, though, so I can't say whether the iPhone is better than others or not.  Sometimes I wonder if it's better to go back to having one device to use as a phone (that's small and actually works) and one to use as a computer, though.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective item", "Author": "Josue Petit-Homme", "ReviewID": "R243LIXDVJOCRM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received a defective phone I returned it and they refuse to replace my phone.

And if you are considering upgrading from the iPhone 4s to an iPhone 5, keep in mind that with the new Lightning connector exclusive to the iPhone 5, it is not compatible with previous versions of the iPhone nor are the connectors on other iPhones compatible with the iPhone 5.  Though Apple does sell an adapter, it is still going to cause problems with those users who have invested a lot of money in other accessories and peripherals for their iPhone 4s's, because they're not going to be compatible with the new iPhone 5.  Though not in all cases, many people will have to go back and repurchase all new accessories and peripherals to replace the ones they had for their previous iPhone.  In my opinion, the iPhone 4s is the better deal if you absolutely HAVE to invest in an iPhone.  Not only is it cheaper ($99 through Apple, not Amazon), but it basically has just about all of the same features and functionality of the iPhone 5.  But I know there will be many people who will still overpay for their iPhones, either the 5 or the 4s, because it's not a matter of need for a lot of people, but a matter of status and bragging rights to buy into a brand so they can strut around showing off their new expensive toy.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "O.

My wife loved it.But, the first day, my son inadvertantly dropped it on the floor from about 2 1/2 feet height (before we had installed the case / screen protector).  And the front face shattered.  Spider cracks throughout the entire front screen.  I'd never seen a phone with so many cracks (and I've owned and dropped several iPhones with no problem).  I should say, that was until I was sitting at the Apple genius bar, before the store actually opened (open for genius bar support only) and I saw two other white phones brought in with the same problem.  HMMM ... wonder if Apple has a problem.Beware ... if you insist on buying the 4s, either buy insurance in one form or another, or immediately put the phone in a case with a screen protector.  Because Apple will not acknowledge even the possibility of a defect if the screen cracks (it's assumed it was your fault).  And the repair cost lists at $199, though some Apple stores will drop that to $149.And as much as I like Apple products (I own several), when things go wrong, they are not easy to deal with (stores full of hundreds of young, eager technicians / managers that have no authority to do anything).Perhaps I should have been more aware, given the extent of the cottage industry I have since discovered that has built up around the iPhone to repair broken iPhone screens.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Locked/unlocked?", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RO4VNII6CNXZV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Has anyone bought it?

There were multiple times  received sides cannot listen due to the activation of this mute button by unexpected touching. Sound volume is low. The only good is internet, that is.

Ive had my iphone 4 months. Spent a fortune for it and for a warranty. My speakers went out yesterday. I spent two hours on the phone fighting with Apple all the way to corporate. Their options were for me was to give them a credit card number so they could put a $650 hold on my card so they could send me a different one. That way if they found I had mishandled it (which I had not),  they could run the charge through for a new one. When they tried to run the hold charge it was denied because I believe I have a limit as to the amount I can charge in one day and if I could have placed the charge on it I might not have had  enough available on my card for other purchases.  Or, according to Apple, I could call my credit card company to see if they would authorize it. My other option was to take it to UPS and have them send it to Apple and once they got it they would repair it or send a reworked one to replace my 4 month old one, but they wont send me a replacement until they receive mine. My phone was brand new 4 months ago.  I do not want a reworked or refurbished replacement.  I paid a whopping amount for my phone and a whopping amount for a warranty.  In addition, Apple badmouthed UPS by saying they didn't trust their tracking numbers (as if somehow the tracking number could be changed) and they couldn't trust them to actually put the phone in the box and ship what they were supposed too, back to Apple.  UPS was not too thrilled to hear what Apple's opinion of them was and they commented that perhaps they shouldn't even do business with them.  In the meantime,  I am without any phone now for emergencies. Worse still is the fact my 84 year old Dad is in the hospital and just had two major surgeries. He has been extremely ill and now the hospital can't reach me by phone in an emergency. SHAME ON YOU APPLE!!!!!!! Your customer service is appalling. Any other phones that I had in the past, if they had some defect, as long as they were under warranty, I was able to go into my carrier and have it replaced. Not Apple. They do NOT care about their customers or their needs. Personally,  I don't trust Apple to not send me some scrappy refurbished phone or to come back and tell me the defect was my mishandling. Think long and hard before you buy an Apple product.  I do have to say that I love the iphone.  It's a wonderful product and I'm not sorry I purchased one with my local cell phone carrier.  However, my disagreement and frustration is with Apple themselves.  Even with other Apple products, it's very difficult to get anyone to help you and they make no effort to improve their service to customers when they have difficulty with one of their products.  They simply do not care or even attempt to bend over backward to try and work with their customers or make things right with them.  Good customer service is very important.  Without it, eventually your company will suffer if you can't or won't back your product. Speaking with friends who have also had problems with their iphones, their opinion is the same as mine - dealing with Apple is a NIGHTMARE.  If you have ever had to deal with them regarding Itunes, you will know what I am talking about.  If you have never had problems with your Apple product, congratulations.  I hope you never do.  But you may find yourself in the same predicament down the road of life and in an emergency situation (what about all those emergency employees who are \"on call\" and end up without their phones because of Apple's poor customer service?)
