{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phone is great but NOT unlocked!", "Author": "Nari", "ReviewID": "R2M0GKSTC14HTK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this product about one month ago and bought another for my wife.  The phones were delivered on time.  The ones I purchased online had no carrier logos but upon arrival I discovered T-mobile branding on them.  So I thought 'ok, no problem - it's supposed to be unlocked,' and went ahead and slipped in my sim card.  What I did not mention as yet is that I live in Trinidad and Tobago (in the Caribbean) and travel a lot, hence the purchase of an unlocked phone.  Upon switching on the phone, I was greeted with a very cool green Android guy.  Unfortunately, I could not get past that screen - because lo and behold, the phone was not unlocked (as advertised)!The only reason I did not automatically return the phones at this point (as advised by the Amazon Rep.) is because it would have been such a hassle to do so.  That's only the first part of the problem.  I then thought that I could just get the phones unlocked by those smart tech people you see in the malls all over the place...  Only to discover that I needed a data plan to even get past the first screen (mind you, this was ALSO NOT advertised).  The end result is that I ended paying about $100 each to get the phones unlocked and activated. I close by saying that the only reason this review did not get only one star is because after  the headache I endured to get them unlocked, the phones are actually great phones.  My wife loves hers and for someone who is not too interested in gadgets - she is absolutely hooked on hers.  My advice is that if you live outside the US, do NOT purchase this phone - it might be okay if you live in the US (but I can't really comment on that).", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect But Will Do", "Author": "LMBADS90", "ReviewID": "R112YF1H2EI542", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this phone on time which was great. It came in new condition and the second I insert my SIM card everything went smoothly. I got my G-mail account set up, put in my contacts, installed my Bluetooth - ready to go. This is my first Smartphone so I have low standards at this point for functionality.It's fast except going on the internet, I think it's a little slow on that part; but I am patient. What frustrated me the most was I am unable to download apps like Facebook and Fifth Third because this device is too old. That was a huge bummer! However somewhat relieved there are a few alternatives in the App store for this phone.Other thing is not getting picture messages, but that has been an ongoing problem and doesn't relate to the phone. I will resolve that later, though. Not a huge deal.The Bluetooth is great as I love the hands-fee device. It works fine but the Bluetooth signal truly sucks a lot. If I am 10 feet away or if the phone's in my pocket the other person can't hear me very well and I have to set the phone near my head which practically beats the purpose of a Bluetooth.The battery is very bad! To the point I bought a second one just to last me the whole day. The charging takes hours without using it. I am not a huge texter or caller these days but it doesn't take much for this phone.So you may wonder why 4 stars from all these negative things. Well, it's a 4 because it's very user-friendly I think and easy to use. Setup was very easy and everything works. Got it early and in perfect condition. Had no issues like the other reviewers did. But I do wish we could use today's Apps and it'd be nice to have a better battery, too.So if you are looking for a decent Smartphone to start out with, buy this. Just beware of the battery drainage and lack of Apps.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Phone for a good Price", "Author": "floridalady", "ReviewID": "RI8JH7W3JQZC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Phone is my first Android and HTC Phone and for beginners this is a great Phone.

I paid for Saturday shipping and it arrived on schedule.  I was surprised at how small the phone is, but it came in new condition (i don't yet know if it's unlocked although it SAYS it is.) I will agree with several people about the bad battery life. It takes about 6-7 hours to charge the phone and about 1 hour (or less) to drain. Good thing is I called the company who shipped the phone and the CSR offered to send me 2 new batteries. I should have been suspicious because both of the new ones are bad also. But on the flip side, at least I have 3 batteries. Everything works well, except youtube which doesn't always play the VIDEO but does play the audio.
