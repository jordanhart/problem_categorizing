It is not user error they made the phone this way, I looked it up. How very stupid!!! I wonder why anyone would want a phone like this??? Why would anyone want to check their phone 1000000000000000000 times a day to see if they have a message?", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Phone", "Author": "Scott D. Welch", "ReviewID": "R2FNMA1LLNE75X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a basic phone for simply talking and texting as I have a smart phone with another line for email, web, etc. This Samsung S380C from Straight Talk fits the bill quite well. I had read lots of reviews about many different phones everywhere and decided on this one as the notification feature had been corrected and there are notifications which may be set for voice and text (which have several different tones/sounds for each). The only aspect I was concerned about was texting with the keyboard. I am happy to say that I actually do better on this S380C than on my smart phone virtual keyboard (i.e., less mistakes). The sound quality for talking has been excellent and I am solidly at 5 bars almost all of the time. Battery life is strong, lasting several days with fairly constant use. The hands-free speaker works as well as other phones I have owned, sometimes a little \u201cfuzzy,\u201d but I can live with that as I have with the others. There is a keypad lock so you won\u2019t accidently call or message the world unknowingly. It can hold up to 1,000 contacts holding up to 4 numbers each, as well as email addresses and provides nine one-touch quick call keys for your most called numbers. And, it was fairly easy to set up. Porting my old number only took about three hours. Again, keep in mind, I bought this for talk and text only, not for photos or surfing the web, as I have other gear and devices for those activities. If all you need is talk and text phone, this is a solid choice at a good price point.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "love the phone", "Author": "Erik", "ReviewID": "R18VJRB8RFKOTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought mine at my local Walmart and it rings when i get a call and it alerts me when i get a text or pic message it didn't come with a bunch of website preloaded u can text perfectly with it i would recommend this phone for people who just want a phone for phone calls and text messages btw my internet doesnt work that good on mine which is fine for me cuz i have internet at home so overall its a good phone for phone calls and text messages", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "No trouble here!", "Author": "buyzalot", "ReviewID": "R310OJ43N12HOH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this phone at my local Walmart, who had just gotten a new shipment.  Apparently the problem with the tone on text has been resolved, because my phone works perfectly.  I love the features and the style.  I have no issues except that it doesn't tell you who the text is from until you open it.  Other than that no problem.  It rings when I have a text or a voicemail.  I would recommend this phone.  Maybe not online, but in the store for sure!", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lame phone!", "Author": "Renaki", "ReviewID": "RLVKUBR8N0T87", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do NOT get this phone if you're looking for a phone for texting!! I got this phone from Walmart thinking it was a great phone for texting until I found one very BIG flaw: this phone does NOT have notifications for texts at all...seems like a step back for Samsung, don't you think? $50 down the drain. I returned that phone to Walmart for the Samsung Galaxy Centura, which is MUCH better!I give this phone two thumbs down!", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "looking for a better one", "Author": "ugly bug", "ReviewID": "R17JRGS4J8TKCC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has 3 strikes against it from the word go. No text alert. No voice mail alert and no loudspeaker ability. Text will only let you send 160 characters at a time.
