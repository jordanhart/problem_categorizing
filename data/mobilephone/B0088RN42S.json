{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the Cost Conscious on ATT", "Author": "C. Hua \"A Student\"", "ReviewID": "R31VPX1BO20TBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is going to be my benchmark for all other future phones I get.  It is older, stuck at Gingerbread of Android OS, has slightly lackluster color if you are spoiled by IPS displays already, but it gets the job done and is a rugged phone if you put a small investment into a proper phone case such as one from Otterbox or Trident.  For ATT users, this phone will pay itself off within a year if you do not need more than 4G speed and are willing to root the phone and wish to tether without the added plan costs normally associated.  I live in the Bay Area but regularly drive up far toward Sacramento and go far down South to LA.  When I took it to Las Vegas on a road trip, I had my wife and sister in law tethered to it, reading email, streaming Youtube, and doing some remote desktop while in the middle of the fricken desert.  Of course this entirely depends on your carrier's signal strength, but for ATT, it is fine.  I start all my reviews at 5 stars and will ding one star for each major thing that irks my attention.CPU & RAM: This is a dual core CPU but the built in bloatware is pretty bad.  It will be a junk phone out of the box for a power user unless you are willing to root the phone, use an XDA Developer script to unbloat it, use Titanium Backup to uninstall/freeze junk software, and then replace the home launcher with Go Launcher or ADW.  In addition, you WILL need to run the Supercharger V6 script on this phone if you want to have a smooth launcher experience.  I would normally ding one point for how much work goes into this, but most power users do not adopt Android because it works out of the box.  We adopt it because of the flexibility to modify its system.  If we didn't, we'd probably adopt the iPhone, which is locked down, impossible to modify, and simply works out of the box.  All of instructions I mentioned here are available on XDA Developers Forums.  Personally, I had a HUGE blast modding this phone and enjoy it significantly more than my LG Optimus 2X or HTC Tattoo from two years ago.  However, I WILL DING 1 star because even with the massive amount of system manipulation, the dual core phone and its 512MB of RAM just BARELY can run 3D games.  Front Line Commando was the only high end game that barely worked.  Anything higher, forget it.Score: Ding 2 Stars for poor CPU performance, inadequate RAMMulti-Tasking: Assuming you successfully modded this phone, this is a killer multi-tasking phone.  The keyboard is convenient for those of us who use foreign languages while texting or typing.  When doing plain English, I just use Touch Pal's keyboard (also an add on) to do English.  But when the wife is bugging out, I flip open the keyboard and start typing away in Vietnamese to avoid the hassle of auto-correct.  I am easily able to listen to an eBook, browse the web or check email, and have a full blown, Windowed text message conversation, all at once (Go SMS Pro is the one add on everyone needs).Score: Add 1 StarScreen Resolution & Size: I personally don't understand why anyone would want a screen bigger than 4\".  This phone has the perfect screen size, allowing a single thumb to traverse the entire dialer.  I tried using larger phones, near 5\" and the Galaxy Note, but found it impossible to dial without both hands.  This phone is the right size.  In addition, for us who work blue collar jobs, this is a good phone because you can really feel the weight of it (with a phone case).  I man-handle the phone out of my pocket sometimes and won't feel afraid of it shattering in the warehouse because it's very rugged if you have the right case on.  It has a nice weight to it, and I appreciate the feel in my chubby grip.  However, I will ding 1 star because the color quality on this phone is only just barely bearable.  I used to use an IPS display on my LG Optimus 2X and was horribly spoiled by it.  After using IPS, I have an insanely hard time going back.  If you are not concerned with system graphics or high definition video, the screen is more than adequate, no ghosting, but color depth is a little bit lacking.Score: Ding 1 StarData Rates: This phone is 4G capable and an international phone.  The Droid 3 is a US phone locked to Verizon's CDMA only.  The Milestone 3 XT860 is an international phone, unlocked to the US market.  I will most likely buy one more backup just in case unless my company is willing to subsidize me a line.  I can confirm that ATT's network will see this phone as a dumb phone, not a smart phone.  This makes it eligible for the $10 unlimited data plan for non-smartphones.  ATT and all the carriers are quite smart in how they bill the heck out of us for data plans.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  But technically, SMS picture messaging is actually on the same bandwidth.  I currently have this phone on ATT with a $10 unlimited plan that they do not see important in doing an IMEI sweep for (they do this for Google's more popular Nexus phones, which have a wider audience, so it's harder to get qualification for a non-smartphone unlimited data plan).  You need to root your phone, download fox-fi, and you will be able to tether to your phone without a tethering plan (using the built-in tethering app will flag your phone and cause ATT to slap you with a full blown data and/or tethering plan).  In addition, you get unlimited 4G speed for $10/mo.  I regularly exceed 4GB a month.  But because of this, I get the benefit of a $60 data plan w/ tether for only $10/mo.  This pays for my phone and helps me stick it to the man.  And hey, my family plan is 5 lines already with 1 full data plan and unlimited texting.  This costs the carrier nothing to maintain and costs me $200 a month.  They are still making money.  The carriers became aware of this and now release international phones that lock out use in competing carriers in the US.  As an example, the Droid 4 is international unlocked capable, but the radio firmware has a hard-coded lock preventing it from working with ATT in the same way the Milestone 3 XT860 does.Score: +1 Star for Sticking it to the manOverall: This phone is good for power users who do a lot of nitty gritty and are willing to root, unlock, and script their phone.  If you need something straight out of the box to work and are willing to spend, just get a carrier locked phone or an iPhone and don't ask stupid questions.  Also, because of the nature of the hardware line, do NOT expect an upgrade of the OS past Gingerbread unless you are willing to try to use Cyanogenmod, which I gave up on for this phone because it breaks Youtube.  I work a warehouse, text a thousand things a day, and multi-task.  I do not game.  Gaming and heavy graphics I do with a regular digital camera on my workstation at work or laptop at home, which I tether anyway.  There is a concession you need to make if you get this phone but for the cost conscientious or power user, this is the phone to go for, for sure.  Here's a rundown on my scoring:5 StarsDing 2 for underpowered CPU and RAMDing 1 for screen color depth/richnessAdd 1 for being able to work around carrierAdd 1 for super multi-tasking easeTotal: 4 out of 5 starsBuy it if you can get it for $250 shipped, or less.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unhappy, Defective ; Refurbished phone that seller is advertizing as \"New\"", "Author": "Tiffy", "ReviewID": "R2VC7KDIFHTZWN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Delivery was timely, no complaints there. Opening the box, everything looked as expected, each individual part wrapped in it's own mini plastic bag. All protective plastic sheeting/\"stickers\" were in place also. (As you would expect of your NEW device.) I took the device out of its bag, removed the plastic sheeting on the screen, and plugged it in. I was so excited to charge it so I could begin setting up my phone.. I mean it was beautiful! I'm not a person who needs the latest, fastest, fanciest phone. All I wanted was a decent camera, a slot for my SD card, and a full keyboard (makes e-mailing 100x faster), and the Motorola Milestone 3 XT860 met my 3 criteria. Aesthetically it was perfect. Sturdy, good screen size, not a single scratch or scuff, and the keyboard is the best I have ever seen and felt. Wish I could say I got to use it, because everything went down hill after I plugged it in.It's unfortunate, but the device had issues IMMEDIATELY. First off the phone turned on when I plugged it in but shut down as soon as it reached the unlock screen. I thought this was weird, and that is when I noticed that my package didn't come with the typical product information sheet/booklet. I also noticed that my charging/notification light wasn't on. I left the phone charging for 6 hrs, came back and turned it on. Well, I tried too. The device would not start up. So, I unplugged it, removed the battery, inserted my SIM and SD cards, replaced battery, replaced back cover. Pressed and held power button. Phone turned on! Set up screen prompted me to 'slide out keyboard to type', I followed the instruction. Phone cut off.To make a long story short, I was not even able to complete the normal set up, much less customize it to make it feel like my own. At one point, the device prompted me to \"disconnect power supply to conserve energy\" (or something like that), so I unplugged....oops, black screen again. (by the way I know that it is for sure OFF at these moments and not just a locked screen, I made sure to check before writing this review) Anyway, from what was happening I thought perhaps the battery was defective or maybe even loose. Basically the phone turned off any time I touched it, and sometimes, it would NOT come back on. I took my SIM out and began using my old phone again. However, I still wanted to keep trying with the new one....each time I tried to turn the phone on and use it, more and more issues came up. It now shuts off if you even place it on the table gently, open the camera app, slide out the keyboard, or simply just leave it sitting there....I honestly can not do anything with this phone. I made a call successfully, only for it to turn off 1 minute into my conversation.I have no choice but to send it back.Also, on the inside wall of the box I met this little disclaimer:\"THE CELLULAR PHONE CONTAINED HEREIN DID NO EMANATE FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER, AND NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE MADE AS TO SOURCE ORIGIN. THE PHONE MAY BE NEW OR USED, BUT RESTORED INTO OPERABLE CONDITION. NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OF IMPLIED, ARE MADE.\"It is a huge deal to me that BuyCellular left this disclaimer out of the Product Description.  This statement was no where to be seen when I was purchasing this item. I feel tricked and consider this false advertising, because no where did BuyCellular indicate that this is or could be a refurbished phone. Title, product description, etc all said NEW, NEW. I would not have purchased this had I known there was a possibility it could be refurbished. I live outside the U.S. and it's difficult to return items.I rated this 1 star because the product arrived defective and I feel cheated because I thought I was paying for a new device. I feel that if the phone came in operable condition I would have rated 5 stars because aesthetically I see nothing wrong with it, and to reiterate...the keyboard is awesome! Researching this device I realize that there are loads of problems with this model, which is such a shame. I don't feel that it is even worth me asking for a replacement, hopefully I can just return the device and get my money back.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont buy this is a fraud", "Author": "ricco123", "ReviewID": "ROEQWFZRCJV08", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "not so much the phone so much the fact that the seller wrote it saying its Unlocked when its not, also I had to pay 20 dollars extra to \"unlock\" it and still couldn't get a GSM signal so the phone is Useless whats the point of selling a phone You say that is unlocked when its not??? what a fraud", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but not great", "Author": "Rodrigo Frias", "ReviewID": "R76IWMPE9Y62H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Great screen and internal memory 8G. you can download and install wherever you want (from someone that comes from Galaxy Ace with just 250MB)Negs: I bought this phone mainly by its external keyboard.
