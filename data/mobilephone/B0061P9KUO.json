Waldman", "ReviewID": "R2YN974KSW47AE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone does everything I wanted to do and does it with ease. The slide out QWERTY keyboard has buttons big enough to actually type on (albeit with your thumbs) which makes all my friends with Blackberries jealous. So if you're a competent typist, you can type without really looking at the keys as you would on a proper keyboard. You can also change the size of the  text on your texts as you read and write them with one touch, something anyone who needs reading glasses will find invaluable.The camera is basic but good enough that I used the framed pictures as gifts.I use the web browser for basics like finding directions or addresses; if I wanted to do a detailed search on the mating habits of squirrels, I use a computer, not my phone. But that's just me...I'm sure there are others who give their phones a more strenuous workout. In that same vein, this might not be the best phone for gamers or people who want the newest apps, you'll need a \"smart\" phone for that. But for anyone who wants a phone, likes to text, enjoys sharing photos, and needs your basic web browser in a pinch, this is an excellent phone.  And let's face it, do you really want to spend a couple hundred dollars on a PHONE?", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bogus Product", "Author": "tom a", "ReviewID": "R1PKNQ6J26OQIM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I live in Michigan and bought this phone for my wife's birthday.

It works just fine until you go to send a text message, or make a phone call and it randomly decides to SHUT OFF. In fact, it often just shuts off for the sake of shutting off. On a daily basis I look down to check my phone and discover that it has turned itself off, and I have missed phone calls or messages, also, I frequently have to check my outbox to make sure that all my messages have sent, usually I have failed out-going texts thanks to this unreliable phone. Forget about using this phone as your alarm clock, too! This insidious product will, free of charge, shut off while you're sleeping, and you won't know it until you're running late the next day.I have a friend who also has this phone and runs into these same problems as well, so I can confidently say that it is not just my phone, it's the model altogether. Can't wait for an upgrade so that I can escape this nightmare.

I've had it for two or three weeks. The slide out keyboard  and no touch screen were my main requirements.I keep information in the memo app(which allows enough chars to make  complete phrases) on the phone and I can protect it with a pin code.  I'm old school, I don't use a data plan or internet or email or text.  I have computers for that. So I can't speak to these functions. I make calls, I get calls, I have phone numbers on it and can assign a few to shortcuts, I can set alarms, appointments or other important info on the calendar and tell what time and day it is.  I don't use games or even voice mail.  If you are a youngster (people younger than 40) you may not appreciate this phone.The phone has no touch screen to hate. The ringtone can actually be set to sound like a real telephone ringing.  Sound is good, I have my music on the SD chip.  The music player works well and is convenient to operate.  Bluetooth will hook up to my wife's Bose soundlink mini (awesome sound) and I use it on the treadmill.  When I  run outside, the music sounds good on the phone's speaker or I put it to a Bluetooth earpiece.  Music will come over a regular Bluetooth earpiece or car Bluetooth speaker.I have found no problems with the operation or reception.  Price was reasonable.  I definitely would recommend it if you just want a good phone and organizer with a music player and bluetooth that works well.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't Work with AT&T;", "Author": "Nicoleasm", "ReviewID": "R3K1RA7WJQHFLG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I read the reviews on amazon about the phone not working completely or some of its features like texting were disabled, but I didn't head the warning.  It's described as an AT&T; phone, and when I activated it with them, they said it was recognized as such.  Then my text messages weren't being sent, I couldn't open others, some of my calls werent going through, and I spent over an hour with text support to finally learn that it's not a true AT&T; phone.  They recognize the model but not the make apparently, and the phones serial number shows up as an unknown phone in their system, making some of its features not work.

Fun phone and much easier to text than the \"clamshell\"!UPDATE:  After a month of use, I have noticed the reception sometimes goes away at night and the screen keeps \"searching\" for the signal hours, sometimes until mid morning the next day! Otherwise I liked this phone.  Have now switched back to a Motorola Tundra for a stronger signal, minus the easier texting. Evergreen was good though, if not for poor reception!

Wills \"AzNetCowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1638KIKN3ZQNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As with any purchase of this type, it will take time to totally get accustom to all of its idiosyncrasies. I like the slide out QWERTY keyboard for doing messaging and any text entering. It has a weird set of ring tones (IMHO) but I am able to use the ringtones off my memory card which came from my old AT&T; cell phone.If nothing else, so far this phone doesn't seem to be too smart or smarter than myself. It seems to have better reception than my older Pantech Breeze III which makes the use more to my liking. The speaker seems like it could be a bit better and it seems to crackle more than I am used to. Maybe it will get better as I play around with the volumn.One thing I did find irritating was the Shortcuts/navigation button. Evertime I pulled the phone of of the belt case it was as though I had pushed the upper navigation button. I was able to get around that by setting the button to \"None\" and now it is fine. I don't as a normal practice used the navigation buttons for shortcut purposes any, never did and don't ever expect doing that. ;-)This phone comes from the AT&T; affiliate Telus. It works just fine with the AT&T; network. The one thing I like is this AT&T; cell phone doesn't go to the browser mode when you hit the OK button in dormant mode. No more using up minutes when accidentally hitting the OK button.For those who want more options, there are plenty of them. Games, music, Internet browsing, etc. For me, this is just a little more than a basic cell phone. Oh yes, it works just fine with my Microsoft SYNC on my Ford Fusion and my Ford Focus. It is approved by Ford to be compatible with their MS SYNC.

Not because I am rough with them, but because no one could figure out why it was such a problem child.I called AT&T; at least once a week for about three months. They exchanged my phone for a replacement. Functionally it's no good either. There's no 3.5\" headset port. The only way to listen to stereo is buy a Bluetooth stereo headset or a proprietary Samsung brand wired headset that plugged into the USB port. I found one here on Amazon b/c even AT&T; didn't have one. You couldn't even charge your phone and listen to music or take a call from the headset at the same time. Then it started shutting off randomly on it's own. Three hours went by one time while I was waiting on a call. So Samsung fessed up it was a firmware error and had me send the phone down to their HQ's for a new firmware install. Luckily I still had my trusty Motorola Karma to use. Two weeks later it arrives back without being repaired. AT&T; said pick out another phone and didn't even want the Evergreen back.

It is still just as reliable as it was from day one. The only issue that I have ever had is that about once a week it turns itself off for no obvious reason. I am so used to it that I just check it periodically. It never really is a concern, but certainly worth mentioning. I also like the couple of cute games it has. It has been a life saver when in the waiting room for doctors or dentist appointments or in the ER (I have kids, it seems like we're always at one of these).  The keyboard rocks.
