I've had my Style for a year now, and I have to admit, it is by far the best cell phone I've ever owned. Sure it's got its quirks, but what cell phone does not? The clam-shell model of cell phones just makes the most sense, no butt dialing, no fumbling to answer a call, keypad protection and ease of use makes up for the shortfalls. I've owned android cell phones in the past and unless your sitting at a table with no distractions they are a pain in the backside to use. Sure the apps and games are great, but what most people need is a way to communicate (that's why it's a phone). If someone wants all the glitz and glamor of a computer then get a computer!!! The Blackberry Style is a user friendly communication and organization device. It does what it's supposed to do, make phone calls and keep you up to date with appointments, etc. The OS6 is a godsend compared to the OS5 and lower. It will provide the user with all the data needs anyone could want out of a smartphone. Decent apps, great phone service (I have Sprint), and ease of use make this the perfect phone for anybody.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have had so far", "Author": "K T Duncan", "ReviewID": "R32M2RM1S30293", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Blackberry Style for over a year now and I LOVE it!!

Harris", "ReviewID": "R1UO94LWUXHR50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about six months now, and I have to say that it's a good phone.  Sadly, the Sprint network in this area prevents me from using it to its fullest, as it is 3G capable, but stuck in a 2G city.THE GOOD: It's a flip.  In fact, it is the ONLY flip/clamshell form smartphone on the US market (there are a couple of Android-powered flips in China and Japan).  This is a definite plus due to my absolute detestation of bar form phones.  Easy to set up and customize, and the apps aren't bad, either.  Sure, a lot of them are paid whereas they're free on other platforms, but the functionality is the same, and it's a FLIP.  Upgrading from the LG Lotus, I find the size and feel to be about the same.  App installation and OS updates are easy, though the latter can be time-consuming.Did I mention it's a flip phone?THE BAD: Whoever placed the camera and flash needs to go back to design school.  Other flip phones have their lenses on the cover, but this one has it on the main body.  Thus, one has to hold it in a fairly awkward way to use the camera.  Another downside is that there are no soft, form-fitting cases like there are for other flip-type phones like the LG Lotus.  It's either snap-on or sleeve.  Also, some popular apps are incompatible with this particular model.Also, the phone will freeze occasionally (with or without the \"spinning clock\" icon), but these events are always brief.And then there's the lack of 3G network in the area where I live.  The built-in Wifi and Bluetooth do make up for it, but it would be nice if Sprint would upgrade some of their smaller markets to 3G.THE UGLY:  Should you ever get a corrupted app installation, it will take drastic measures to fix.  In my case, a corrupted download of the Twitter app put the phone into a reboot loop, which required a complete wipe and re-installation of the OS and apps.Considering the whole, the good far outweighs the bad and the ugly, making this an ideal phone for someone transitioning from a standard flip or feature flip.  That said, should a flip-form Android ever hit the US market, that, not another of these, will be my next phone.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sprint Blackberry Style 9670", "Author": "Eastward Traveler \"CJ\"", "ReviewID": "RVW5OER0SXPL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Clam shell design helps keep the screen safe.

Would have upgraded to something more powerful by now, except this is the only full keyboard flip smartphone you can buy and the BlackBerry 9810 slider won't work on Sprint.It's a little slow and will freeze up momentarily from time to time. This phone was designed for OS5 but then got OS6. However, it will run Google Maps if you're patient. You really have to download the Opera Mini web browser, because the built-in browser is a complete joke.You can't beat the design for being able to stick it in your front pocket and have it completely out of your way, unlike other smartphones which become a nuisance and have to be left in the truck when real work has to be done. It's also somewhat durable and won't get cracked screens or anything from being dropped. However, it will not survive being hurled against a brick fireplace when you get fed up with the little black clock (I have insurance for \"accidents\").Another really unique feature of this device is charging contacts. You get the optional charging cradle, and simply drop the phone in there when you go to bed. No screwing around with putting the tiny plug in the tiny hole, then ripping it back out every time you get a text.The camera is decent, once you get used to the oddball location of the lens.

I have informally done hours of training for friends and coworkers on the wonders of the Blackberry phones.  Ya, to say I've been an addicted advocate puts it mildly.  Not any more.Before I get into the problems, just want to note that Research in Motion refers all concerns about their phones to the service providers - forget about ANY help from RIM.  Second, the carriers say that the phone's quality is bad, but do nothing.  Consumers, we are holding the bag for an expensive phone.  Sprint was particularly useless, and I would also say their customer service is useless in this regard.  They tell me I purchased a bad product, and I'm stuck with the outcome.  You have been forewarned.Through a rotten twist of fate, I have three of these phones in the last year, two of them slowly bricked.  I will readily admit that one of them fell in a bowl of water, but the other two just stopped taking a charge.  One of the reasons why I had been an advocate of Blackberry was because they were durable phones - heck, friends/coworkers would tell me they dropped them on pavement, with no problems.Each of the three phones I had started glitching before they died, freezing up or retaining an imagine on the home page though I had exit the application.

Without taking a single call and only using my phone to look at an RSS feed via the web browser, the battery will drain completely by the afternoon. This happens constantly. Even without touching the phone, the battery will drain completely in your pocket. I've felt it vibrate to notify me of its low battery in my pocket after having done nothing with it for hours, then once again to tell me that it's too low to even get a signal. And don't try using the phone as a camera for long if you need the flash... it will drain very quickly then.- Bad hardware. I had to replace my phone because of the loose charging port, only to be given another phone with another loose charging port. (This is, of course, after the folks at Sprint decided it was because of a battery short and had me wait a week for a new battery, only to wait another week for an entirely new phone. You cannot replace the charging port by itself.)- Slowness. This is the phone's biggest issue. It will gradually become slower throughout the day, regardless of whether or not you use typically processor-slowing applications or close them after use instead of keeping them open. Typically, I will, say, decide to write a text message. I'll pull the phone out of my pocket, open it up, try to scroll, see that it's frozen... wait 5-10 seconds, maybe longer, for it to unfreeze... and repeat these last two steps at least one to two more times during this process. Sometimes I'll just put the phone back in my pocket because it's taking too long to do anything. The manufacturer's solution to this is to remove the battery while the phone is on, then replace it... the same thing as basically turning a computer off while it's running instead of shutting down. This is the official solution for this problem, and it's only temporary on top of that.I just can't put into words how frustrating it is to wait over and over for my phone to catch up just so I can type a simple text or Tweet. Once, the phone even froze while I was attempting to answer a call and it required a hard shut down, as described above. (This takes about 3 minutes or more, by the way.)Do not get this phone. Get a different one that you aren't constantly waiting on to un-freeze or constantly hoping you won't run out of battery life.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "BLACKBERRY 9670  IS GSM???", "Author": "enny Urbina", "ReviewID": "R2532KWCWO0PYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "hello, good night I want to know if they are gsm blackberry ??... chip technology ??.... please respond ....
