I am pleased with the quality of the phone and it's overall functionality. Though somewhat quirky when it comes to the menu navigation, it takes some getting used to (but it's not Rocket Science). It surprisingly has a lot of the bells and whistles that come with smart phones these days, WiFi, Bluetooth, handwriting recognition, social networks pre-loaded (and easy to set up and use). Unlike its predecessor, the EX119 does not log calls made to and from each SIM separately; it now aggregates the call log - much like how the EX115 did for text messages - i.e., although it notifies you as to which SIM a call is received from the instant you receive one, it does not separate calls per SIM in its call log. Although if you look close enough, you can see the SIM number from which a call originates indicated beside each call in the log (there is no indicator for messages though). The phone book is central, but with each call or text made out, you are prompted to choose which SIM to use to complete the action. You have the option of using one SIM only if two are installed, or have both of them active. Because it is a Dual-SIM stand-by type phone; when a call is engaged on one SIM(1) and there's an incoming call at the same time to the other SIM(2), that call [on SIM(2)] will go to voice mail (if you have voice mail service i.e.). However, if a call comes in on the SIM that is currently engaged, you will receive the call waiting tone (if you have call waiting service i.e.). Incoming calls can be engaged as they occur and you will see an indication of which SIM the call comes to. It has a basic media player and radio as well as quick-access widgets for both in the new tile styled menu (which also has various display options to choose from), WAP, calender, calculator, currency converter, a (watered down but useful) unit converter, reminders, notes, alarms and profiles (where you can set a different general ring tone and message tones for each SIM and /or/ each contact). It's pretty cool and VERY VERY light and small!!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Dual SIM phone", "Author": "Sohrab", "ReviewID": "RP4QUP02A9FHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Checked and researched.. as a second phone to carry around, it has an excellent battery life and reception worldwide.

Oleynikov \"food experimenter\"", "ReviewID": "R2PEZY0JF1A17Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have long held this opinion about Motorola products - their hardware quality is really great (nice to touch, good design etc.), but their software division is run by aliens!For the life of me I can NEVER understand their interfaces - extremely unintuitive, inconvenient sometimes to a point of utter frustration.I had major doubts before buying this phone, but after reading many good reviews on EX119 I decided to take a leap of faith that Motorola has finally created something usable.Now I have come to regret my decision.  I bought this phone for my wife, since she lost her old Motorola (which neither of us liked anyway).Again, I totally agree with everyone's reviews about the excellent quality of this phone (touchscreen, buttons, the case etc.), but unless you have a special craving for masochistic UI's, don't buy this phone.  Where to begin?- No buttons to place and end a call (despite a full QWERTY keyboard!)- I could not find out how to listen to ringtones while editing contacts - had to call from my phone to just listen how it rings.  C'mon now!- Could not send any contacts from my Blackberry to this phone (tried e-mailing, SMS, Bluetooth - nada)- There is ENTER/OK key, but no BACK/ESC button - have to use the touchscreen- The camera can be activated only after accessing it from buried 2 levels deep in a menu - forget about taking quick pictures when you need them- The touchscreen goes to locked mode on its own all the time (why can't I just leave it unlocked?)- The overall menu navigation is so convoluted and geeky it is hard to believe. For example, the menu for configuring SIM is called UART Settings!!! (For those who does not know what UART means - in computer lingo it stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter and is generally referred to serial ports on computers)- The list goes on...I have owned several Motorola phones (mobile and landline) and every one of them had unusable user interface.I should have listened to my inner voice telling me that I should trust my first impressions and not fall for this phone.

Under $100 and sold on Amazon, can't beat that.Pros.  Light, slim, really nice looking.  Fully functional with all the buttons, and pretty intuitive.  The touch screen is suprisingly high quality.  It has only been a week, but no problems.  I like that the buttons still work though as well.  Very vivid and sharp screen.  Fully functional for my basic needs of having a phone that can carry both SIMs for the cell providers in Nicaragua.  When you cross call here you get destroyed.  So instead of carrying two phones that would reach $100 I have this very nice one for the same price.Cons. I prefer a Sim1 & Sim2 button for phone calls.  But they seem to have stopped producing phones like that.  You have to hit a couple buttons to get to the call, similar to the annoyance on smart phones like the iPhone.  But this has no \"favorites\" list for most frequently called (or I haven't found it yet).  Also the display of the phone book is a small annoyance. (it only fits two on the screen at a time, so scrolling down it always necessary).  If you type to reach your contact your first click activates the feature then you have to spell...I am constantly starting spelling on the first click then having to delete characters and start over, annoying for making calls to ones not on the recent call list.Those are small complaints really.  Everything about this phone is great, especially for the price.  Like I said it has only been a week, so it might explode.  But has been great.Thanks Amazon.
