Would have rated them a 10 but, found one issue the phone did not come with a Micro Sim card. This item should have been clearly Noted!! Could have save time and I could have order one from them at the same time.  Would buy from them, Near perfect condition as stated, a success!!", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am never buying anything from AMAZON again - especially not electornics!", "Author": "Nedda Viscovich", "ReviewID": "R22GSO4684ZM7B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item I received was defective. It was supposed to have been refurbished - which would lead one to believe that it was tested prior to being resold.  I could not get internet service, the voice calls had echoes and static and the power button did not work.  Overall this phone should never have been resold.The sellers replacement policy was  not acceptable.  They wanted me to return the phone and then they would send me a replacement - which would mean I would be without a phone for at least ten days.  the other option was for me to buy another phone, return the original and they would then process a refund.  NOT acceptable.  I paid for a working phone, it should be their responsibility to see to it that I had one.  Furthermore, they want me to pay for return shipping even though the phone was defective.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Delilah M Zabor", "ReviewID": "R3VTHY89QDE627", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great seller, great communication.Near perfect condition SGH-T999. it did come with android 4.0.4, however the OTA updates to 4.1.2 have been a success!", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$459.99", "Features": "16GB internal memory\nAndroid 4.1.1 Jelly Bean operating system\n4.8\" Super AMOLED color touch screen With 720 x 1280 resolution allows simple navigation and ensures a highly visible display.\n8.0MP camera\nUp to 12 hours talk time and up to 33 days standby With the included lithium-ion battery.", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S III T999 16GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 4.0 OS, Super AMOLED Touchscreen, 8MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Pebble Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Bna7-ILpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008A9CZCY"}}
