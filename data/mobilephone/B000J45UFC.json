{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Upgrade and Virgin Mobile Listened to Customers!", "Author": "KDMask", "ReviewID": "RWKJFKQLWJZPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned Virgin Mobile for my last 3 phones. I even have their oldest model in use (my son). The Cyclops is a great addition to the line and is an affordable camera phone as well. One of the biggest complaints of Virgin users in the past was the low ring tone. I used to have to set my phone on \"high and vibrate\" just to hear it. That's definitely been fixed. The phone has a great range for volume settings. I could also transfer my phone number and BALANCE when I purchased this phone. That was  welcome surprise, especially since these don't come with any contract. Because I use my phone so little, it actually costs me about $7 a month when I 'top up'. In addition, the Cyclops phone has free evenings and weekends. Wow..what a bargain! I really recommend this phone to just about everyone, especially those with kids. It's a great first phone at a great price. The Virgin line also comes with a pre-paid bag to send in your old phone for recycling. I've had great customer service, btw...even on Labor Day.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Low end phone hiding in a mid end packaging....", "Author": "Hattori Hanpei", "ReviewID": "R1C23ZCX6WM6R7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having owned the Snapper a few years, I was looking forward to upgrade to the Cyclops. This Kyocera phone seemed like an improvement over the older UT Starcom model because of it's slimmer casing, internal antenna, and a 1.3 MP camera. However, I ended up keeping my old phone because I can't get over the many flaws of the Cyclops. I'll briefly summarize:PROS:-small form factor-internal antenna-1.3 MP camera-colorful design-external displayCONS:-audio interference (white noise) possibly caused by antenna-when opened, phone bends too far back and is uncomfortable to hold-large external red LED flashes continuously during calls-text messaging is a pain because of small buttons and software glitches-average quality internal LCD display with childish graphics-camera quality about the same as higher end 0.3 VGA MP cameras", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "I like this phone", "Author": "Christine Murphy \"cmurf1960\"", "ReviewID": "R2AXVMR38IHVG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I switched to Virgin Mobile from The Evil TracFone several months ago.  I knew I wanted a camera phone, and I looked at the models that VM had to offer.  I opted for the Cyclops because I like the flip-phone design and the affordable price.You gotta remember...this is a camera phone, not designed to be your primary camera.  Picture quality is okay, pretty much what I expected from a camera phone of this price range.  The user interface is easy to figure out, I was able to figure out how to do what I wanted to do with the phone without having to look at the instruction booklet.I'm happy...both with this phone, and with Virgin Mobile's service.  If you ever have trouble with your VM phone, you can call them, and the person who you get on the phone speaks ENGLISH, as opposed to the reps over at TracFone.I've tried other pre-paid phones, but by far, Virgin Mobile is the best!", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "J. riley", "ReviewID": "R2W7BGVD04PJ49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone since december of '06 and love the phone, however i am having a problem finding a replacement home charger for this phone and if you go thru vmobile they want you to pay 30.00 bucks for it!!! not gonna happen!  so needless to say that is my only complaint.  the charger seems to have shorted out and it as been quite difficult to find one to replace it!", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is an excellent phone!", "Author": "H.

I just wanted a new phone, finally.This phone is really cool. The camera takes decent pictures (if you want nice pictures, buy a real camera!) and you can set the pictures as backgrounds or as caller ID's. You can record voice memos with it, which is also a cool feature. And as for what the other person said, I don't think the phone bends back too far when you're talking on it. And I'm an avid texter, and the buttons are not any smaller than the other phones I've had.Pros:Downloadable games, ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers.Internal AntennaExternal Caller ID / DisplayVery lightweight and slimCons:Cannot put into silent (vibrate) mode when the phone is charging.Pre-loaded games are only demos and can only be played for a minute before it asks you to purchase it.Boring backgrounds/ringtones that come with itOverall, this phone is pretty cool.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mediocre at best", "Author": "N. Klingler", "ReviewID": "R3L7T8J6FME5IJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about one month ago. I rarely upgreade phones but I really wanted a camera phone so I bought this model because of its price. I now wish I could return it or throw it away. I usually love flip phones because I find their quality to be better but this is not the case with the Cyclops. The red light on the outside flashes constantly which is annoying. When texting the letters often get scrambled because of a software glitch so the message is completely incoherent. I often have to erase and then rewrite it several times. The camera is horrible too. Every picture is either too bright or dark and they are very grainy. In addition, sometimes when I check my pictures the phone just turns off by itself for no reason. I believe this is another software glitch.I would go ahead and spend the extra money on a better model if looking for a phone that you would like to use.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great prepaid camera phone", "Author": "YB Normal08", "ReviewID": "R6D1QM0PH1VJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just traded up to the Wildcard messaging phone and have owned the Cyclops for 3 months and highly recommend it for a basic prepaid phone. Texting is easy on this phone and the red-lit keypad is different from all other phones out there. The bright LED missed call/message indicator is very easy to see and the loud ringer really gets your attention. Battery life is excellent and the external caller id/message alert is nice also. This phone has many of the same features as the more expensive Wildcard,however the same 1.3mp rated camera works like a cheap vga camera compared to the one in the Wildcard. The only real complaints I have with this phone is the case is real smooth and it can slip away in a heartbeat, the camera quality,the installed graphics/icons are simple-minded and I could never get IM to work properly. This phone also has picture messaging capability and a basic internet WAP2 browser. Overall, it's an excellent BASIC phone and I miss using it.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than you'd expect", "Author": "Tlmsrr", "ReviewID": "R1BNWRZHK05IBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is pretty great. I've had this phone for 7 years now, and I love it. I never had a problem with it (well let me explain). I once had an issue with it. The phone would not ring and I couldn't figure out why. It was because I never erased my OLD text messages and all the OLD phone history/records of calls. After I erased that, it was fine. I dropped this phone (so hard) and yet it never broke. The calls sound really good too. The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud). The ringtones you d/l are also crystal clear. However, the cons: the speaker phone volume is abit low. The camera is good, if you have proper light. Actually, in my room, it's quite dim (at night) and it's hard to take a picture at all.Overall though, this phone is great. probably one of the best flip phones.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "DONALD  FLOWERS", "ReviewID": "RCTZC55V2NNCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "recd phone in excellent time, and thanks for sending/adding the charger, i use the phone every day and for me it's easy to use, no tex, no anthing but phone, thanks so much....", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "$125.00!!!

I checked these reviews and bought the Cyclops since it had some features I liked.  After activation and waiting more than the time suggested,  I tried to get a signal and make a call, but the signal kept fading out and I was lucky to get one bar every now and then.  Since it wasn't usable from my home, I returned the phone.  My previous Virgin Mobile phone was no great shakes, but at least I could get a decent signal and make a call.  I also have a Sprint phone which is so old it's laughable which gets a decent signal from my home.  I really don't know if it was the Cyclops per se or if I just got a dud.

But I have spent a lot of time researching it and can share that), like:-Has 500 contacts available according to Amazon's product page-Again per product page \"the phone's PC Sync capability means that you can connect the phone to a computer with a cable and synchronize calendar and contact information\" (synchronization is not mentioned in the online pdf user manual from VM though, and the \"optional data cable\" is mentioned only on the diagram on page 3, item 14 of the user manual and I have not been able to find this mythical cable anywhere) -- this is vital for me as I have 200 contacts with multiple phones/addresses/URLs/notes -- can anyone confirm this?
