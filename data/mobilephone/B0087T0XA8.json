I have had a Blackberry in the past but since that owned just a dumb phone, but that being said I wasn't about to spend a fortune on a phone full of features I wasn't sure I needed or wanted. Then this phone caught my eye and for the price I was ready to gamble since it was only 10 dollars more than the last phone I bought. I have to say I was skeptical since it was so cheap and looking at it on the VM sight it did sort of look cheap, but it was packed with features so I ordered it. So far I have to say that this phone is all it's cracked up to be, it's fast, thin, easy to use for first time Android users,and I have to say that although I have never heard of PCD I would recommend this phone no problem.The phone works with all the Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk plans so for as little as 35 a month you get to use all this phones features. Parents why let your kids have all the fun?? I will update this after I have had it longer than I have which has been about two weeks, so far so good. Oh and bye the way it's actually better quality than it appears to be in the pictures, I have seen some complaints about the battery life but I don't see any problems with it's life, really it's all in how you use it just like any other electronic device.Only reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the lack of accessories, but I'm sure they will start to come out soon. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW !!!!!!So now that I have had the phone for a while I can update everyone to a couple of things I have come across, first this is still a good solid phone,that being said like all Android phones it will suck the life out of the battery if you use a lot of apps or if you have turned on everything this phone can do. You should download a battery saver app and install it, this will help a lot with battery life, second shut off the functions you don't use all the time, because much like a computer operating system, there are applications that will run even though you are not using them at any given moment. The touch screen seems a little quirky at times, sometimes it seems VERY sensitive while other times it seems as though you have to press things several times to bring up a function, this does not happen a lot but enough to notice. The volume for all functions seems low even when turned all the way up, especially the speaker part of the speaker phone. I swapped out the 2GB micro SD card the phone came with for a larger ( 8 GB ) version just because I like to have a huge music selection, the phone can take up to a 32 GB card which is massive.So all in all this is an awesome phone for the money, works very well, great reception, a huge variety of free apps, large storage card capacity, and very slim design, still not many accessories but some have appeared already. overall a great buy for the money.Oh I forgot one more thing, the battery meter seems to be off all the time, it tells you your almost out of a charge when in fact your not, but again this is a glitch with almost all Android devices and some other phones in general.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it so far...and found a \"workable\" case!", "Author": "L. Klepzig", "ReviewID": "R1ABLYF3T59VYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been considering getting a smartphone for a my daughter for awhile, but wanted to find something that wouldn't break the bank, and also wouldn't lock me in to a 2 year contract (just in case it doesn't work out).  I ended up selecting Virgin Mobile's PCD Chaser because it seemed to be comparable to some of the better end devices and was one of only a few of Virgin Mobile's offerings that allowed Wifi connectivity.I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and have been loading apps and playing with it.  It has been a great little device so far!  There are lots of apps in the google play store (though, I'm a bit disappointed that Temple Run says it won't work with this OS) so I quickly downloaded a few games and the Where's My Droid app (highly recommended so you can easily locate your phone when necessary).Also, I have to say that Virgin Mobile was very helpful in porting my number from Vonage.  It took about 52 hours to complete.  I wish Virgin Mobile had chat customer service though--every rep I spoke to on the phone had a heavy accent which made communication challenging at times.Regarding battery life, yes, it does suck it up.  So does every other smartphone (blackberry, android, and iphone) that I've experienced.  I just make sure to throw it on the charger every night and I bought one of those $20 portable chargers to throw in her backpack as well).Like everyone else, I've been frustrated that there are no cases on the market for this device.  I've searched everywhere and tried a ton of cases.  The closest hard case that I've found is the case for the LG Optimus Elite, but unfortunately that phone is just a little bit thinner than this one--enough so that I couldn't snap the cover together.  The LG Viper case looks like it is a bit thicker but it still may not be thick enough, and in any case I think the camera hole is too high for the Chaser.Then I just happened to stumble across a clearance item at my local \"big box\" electronics store...a two pack of silicone skins for the Phillips Go Gear Connect for just a few dollars...and THEY FIT!!!!  Most of the side holes are \"close enough\", and I was able to cut a small hole in the back for the camera lens and at the bottom for the USB Charger.  OK, so it isn't perfect, but it is truly the only item I've found so far that will work out of maybe 50 different cases and skins I've looked at.My daughter will get her hands on it in two days for her birthday, so we'll see how it holds up!  So far, however, I'm very pleased and think it is a great value for the money.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy with the Chaser", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R116HJO3CMCRSB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a long time iPhone user I've ceased finding value in the iPhone because of its price point and the major carriers costs for data/minutes. I only use the phone and email, with a few apps. providing some value.I've been using skype over wifi on my 3GS as my main phone for the last 2 years or so, which has become untenable.I was going to go with Republic Wireless, have a spot in their Beta and have been waiting patiently for 8 months. When I saw the phone they are releasing and looked at all the potential issues one can have (this is a beta platform that combines wifi/cell for unlimited everything at $20/m. The idea is that you will be making most of your calls when you are close to a wifi network) I decided to just go with a value unlimited-all in carrier like Boost or Virgin and hope Sprint's coverage would be good in my area.I chose Virgin over Boost and didn't even look at MetroPCS because of this PCD Chaser phone. (which is exactly the value prop/business plan Virgin designed Im sure)I took a chance and just ordered the \u00c7haser because it had the latest AndyOS preinstalled. I'm new to Android, having only used IOS. Wow! the choices on Anrdroid for all matters phone are bewildering, and I mean that in a positive way.Ok, in any event... I'm super impressed with this phone for the price point:-Standby Battery life is great.-I can customize anything I could ever think of and then a whole lot more, lol. (reminds me of my time spent Jail-broken on my 3Gs)-Call sound quality is acceptable. People can hear me just fine.-Even with the rubber/cheapy case backside the phone feels of quality.-Even with the too small screen 3.2 (I'm thinking what does one expect for $80 retail/no contract) I can manage just fine.-Even with the somewhat byzantine, to me, navigation of the Android OS  which I've figured out just playing with the phone I am happy.-Performance of this its underwhelming processor actually snap-crackels and pops for the most part.-Gingerbread 2.3 seems to be the latest OS iteration on inexpensive smart phones - I'm happy.-There's an app. for making the phone work with iTunes/Mac (for DRM free) so I won't have to carry my iPhone with me as a music player.I am very happy with this phone and my $60/m (including tax and 911 line item cost) all-in-cost-for unlimited calls, data (at 2.5G they throttle your speed, but I dont ever use that much) and texts with no contracts.Seriously, I know folks can get very particular about their phones. This phone would not be for you, if only because the 3.2 inch screen is really to small.I'm not a picky phone guy and don't want to pay for fancy features I won't use, but wanted a decent solid smart phone. If PCD has good management they should do well, lol.

I and my other teenage daughter were already on VM and loving our LG Optimus V's. This was the cheapest android phone VM had available at the time -- it was not much more than a used Optimus would have cost me so I rolled the dice. It's a been a disappointment from the start. It started with random restarts a couple times a week. She could live with that. It's progressed to complete and total failure to start up. Shortly after the first month she left the battery cover removed as it would freeze up so often and she'd have to remove the battery to get it to start back up. She has minimum apps installed (fb, twitter, etc.) My other daughter and I have have had ZERO problems with our LG Optimus V's. I HIGHLY recommend staying away from this phone at all costs in order to save you or another family member extreme disappointment.

I brought this phone with me on a trip to NYC for entertainment on the bus. from 8AM to 1PM it was already clinging to life support at 15% battery life.Screen:The screen size is just a tick smaller than whats comfortable. when holding the phone in the upright position the keyboard onscreen becomes  a little too small to comfortably and quickly type without having to slow your speed. It lags time to time and requires patience.Performance:Mediocre at best. the processor and internal memory can barely keep up with the apps that you install in the phone. You'll find many apps \"aren't compatible with your handset\" The internal memory says 512MB total but after the OS, Google app updates there will be just enough to install maybe 5 to 10 apps if youre lucky. unfortunately even if you have enough internal memory left to install an app once it reaches near zero expect intolerable lag and freeze-ups. the phone will become a headache and you'll be forced to choose only on average of 6 apps to keep in the phone. I did manage to install Netflix on this phone but it's hardware is so slow it will not play video smoothly; Pandora on the other hand worked flawlessly. There's also an issue with the SD card. it randomly time to time will unmmount. To fix this you have to physically remove the card and reinsert it to successfully remount it. expect to do this a lot.Camera:blotchy and slow. understandably its a 3MP camera but i've had lower MP resolution cameras take better/faster shots.the images come out fuzzy, blotchy, chromatic aberrations everywhere, not to mention the lack of a simple dedicated camera button is outright annoying.Conclusion:Don't buy, its a no-brainer. save your cash and the headache. choose the better phones in virgins lineup. Their service is good, albeit sparse in some rural areas but strong everywhere else.

Abraham", "ReviewID": "RC9442USEF6ON", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The outsides of this phone are fantastic! It has a small, slim profile that is perfect for my small hands. The back is rubberized, so it never slips out of my hands (and I have a tendency to need to replace phones every 1 - 1 1/2 years after dropping it so many times it breaks). The screen is nice and glossy, though on the smaller side, and it has physical home, menu, back and search buttons. Too bad the problems with the phone far outweigh my joy with it's exterior.This phone runs an outdated version of the Android OS (Gingerbread). The Kyocera Rise, which was the same price at Radio Shack, runs ICS. As there is no information on the boxes about the phone (seriously - it's just one big ad for Virgin Mobile - not helpful!), the sales guy assumed it would be ICS like the Rise. I decided against the Rise because my hands are small and the keyboard on that phone would be a bit difficult to use (normal - sized hands should be fine!) and the phone was a bit bulkier, so I went with the Chaser.Imagine my surprise at finding that the phone was not running ICS. Not only that, but the limited internal memory will not support too many apps. Virgin Mobile has this \"I.D.\" program that allows you to switch between different \"I.D's\" - packs of apps. It is pointless and takes up more space than it's worth. Added bonus - you can't remove it.Because of the limited space issue, an app like Advanced Task Killer is essential. You will likely want to use it frequently, because otherwise all the apps running in the background will cause the phone to overheat and crash and you will have to take the battery out to restart it - not good.I have had the phone for two week, and have had to restart it by removing the battery about five times before downloading the Advanced Task Killer and clearing data from the apps I don't use and can't be deleted almost every day.If Virgin Mobile gave users the option to remove/delete junk they aren't using, this phone would probably operate a little better. But if the manufacturer knew all this Virgin Mobile garbage was on there, shouldn't they have included more internal memory? Throwing a 2GB card for free wont really help me if I have to uninstall every Google app only to have them automatically re install.This phone could have been better with a little more internal memory and really should have included Ice Cream Sandwich instead of Gingerbread, but the outside is solid, so 2 stars.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost as bad as the PCD Venture", "Author": "DJ Apoc", "ReviewID": "R1N3PDX3UVYQ79", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone suffers from many of the same issues as the PCD Venture from Virgin Mobile. It is slightly better, which earns it one more star. It still forcibly installs Mobile ID software, which in turn forcibly installs more crapware that you can not remove or move to the SD card, stealing away what little precious internal memory the phone has, and leaving no room for any apps you WANT to install.The screen feels sort of sticky to the touch, and not smooth at all like other touch screens. Typing was very awkward as well, even with Swiftkey 3 from the Play Market.Seemed to work okay for about one day, when it started dropping calls left and right, because the actual PHONE app process CRASHED.

Nenstiel \"omnivore\"", "ReviewID": "R33E7JB6Z1CHH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone for people new to Androids, and smart phones in general. Its simple usage, relatively large touch screen, and clear tones make for a smooth learning curve. It comes with standard apps, like Pandora and Yelp, that let new users learn how to manipulate apps without having to spend money on pricey downloads. And it has a clear tone and broad reception, for those few among us who still use our phones as phones.The touch-screen QWERTY keyboard, which pops up on command, makes texting easy for those of us who always resisted typing on the number keys. And the fully digital screen has minimal pixelation, meaning incoming texts and photo messages are easy to read. It comes with a book reader program, but the screen is really too small for that. It is not, however, too small to double as a media player, and it plays both streaming audio and saved music.I do not recommend this phone for seasoned smartphone users. It has a very small onboard memory, meaning you get in the habit of moving your newly downloaded apps to the SD card right away. Its onboard speaker is small and tinny, meaning speakerphone conversations and music listening result in ear strain. And the battery life is dismal: if you don't charge it every single day, it runs out of power with little warning, leaving you incommunicado.In short, if you're trading up to a smartphone for the first time, this is a good learning tool. Its functions require minimal fine-tuning, and it forgives routine clumsiness. This is definitely a beginner's phone, but if you're ready to try out the smartphone world, and don't want to learn on a cluttered, expensive model, this one will let you practice until you're ready to trade up to a more sophisticated phone.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The worst phone I've ever owned.", "Author": "Rory", "ReviewID": "RQVKG1N7GN1MC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will take you through my morning. It is my day off, but does this phone care? Not at all. The stock alarm clock on the phone was so bad I had to install a third-party app. Said app began to ring even though it is, as I already said, my day off. I tried to disable the alarm, only to find that the app was unresponsive and needed to be force closed. Repeat four times. Finally, my phone got the hint and stopped playing the alarm it should hav played tomorrow morning.Now, I must have un-plugged the phone in my battle with the alarm clock app because after I was finally awake, showered, and breakfasted, the battery was down to 39%. I hadn't used it for anything, and the alarm clock app had finally realized what day it was and stopped ringing.Then, the screen went black. This happens every couple of hours, and the only way to remedy it is to remove the battery. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done--the battery door is attached to the phone with teeth-like grips that cling to the body of the phone and refuse to let it go. I have ripped up my nails trying to remove it. I look like I have severe anxiety, or a job at a lumber yard. I finally managed to pry the battery door off, and pulled out the battery and re-inserted it.At this point, I was frustrated, even before the tape on the front center of my phone came off. The reason there was tape on the front center of my phone? Because of the red light that shines while charging, directly into the user's eyes. Even when it has charged to 100%, an almost equally irritating green light switches on.I have had this phone three weeks, and I have already had to do a factory reset once. I have long since given up hope of downloading very many apps--you can have four or five tops before the internal memory is spent.Spare yourself!
