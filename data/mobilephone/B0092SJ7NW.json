Battery has to be charged every couple of days with medium use....way better then my S2. Nice camera and video. Big screen, but not too big. Makes it easy to read screen.

I was using a regular Droid before I got this, which made the transition easy for me. I love all the apps I can use and the 4g is sooo much faster. The battery life is great! If I am not using my phone very much, a charge will last 3 or 4 days. It is fast and efficient. I am getting used to the phone's keyboard as my other phone had a pull out keyboard but that comes with time and use.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Never buying new again", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R1IQH9ZAJMX33I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great! Works just as well as the brand new one that caught my fall. I'm not sure why I ever buy new phones with contract upgrades, this was cheaper!", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfactory", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1JE7J6Y98BWNH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was only looking for a phone to make it through the next year of my contract after I broke my Galaxy S3. I ordered this phone new and it certainly did not come new. When I turned on the phone it did not automatically bring me to the easy set up. Furthermore, there was already a video loaded onto the phone. I did a factory restore and after that it was easy to set up.As far as the system goes, it is a bit slow for me. It's only running on Jelly bean 4.1.2 and Motorola currently has no intention of updating this. There is no default was to manage tasks or save the battery like higher versions of Android have so I downloaded apps to do replace this feature. Most apps are compatible with this version of Android however, I have encountered a couple which were not. These apps were simple maintenance apps and again easy to replace. Perhaps, I am being a bit high maintenance myself, but I think it's important to know the few restrictions on the phone.All in all, it will suffice but there are certainly a few sacrifices made for the purchase.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faulty phone out of the box", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32BAFN1KA9242", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as \"new\" and again, it clearly is not new. The phone wouldn't activate as it had a faulty IMEI number. It was also very buggy, opening programs and typing sporadically by itself. It also would reach a 20% charging level and stop there. I am returning this phone immediately.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Nice!", "Author": "Vircury", "ReviewID": "R26219H3GC4GA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was in great condition. Better then great. Phone was like new. Battery is great. Especially when comparing it with my old phone, the Rezound.  Delivery was very quick. Got it faster then expected. Only downside was I had to get a new sim card. It uses a much smaller one then my old phone. Which wasn't a downside at all because I went to the Verizon store and explained the situation. They switched over everything painlessly and easily in a matter of minutes and they gave me a new much smaller sim free of charge. I also got to keep my unlimited plan and I am now able to use the foxfi app for hotspot on this phone unlike my old Rezound which blocked the app. All together a win win for me.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life and charging issues", "Author": "Kara", "ReviewID": "R3QKZBM3CREXR1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone arrived on time but the battery hardly lasts at all.  This is very disappointing since I purchased this model specifically for the long battery life.  Additionally, I frequently have trouble getting the phone to charge.  I have to plug it in repeatedly and place the phone \"just so\" before it'll consistently take a charge.  I'm not happy.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent service but had problem with phone.", "Author": "cpiner", "ReviewID": "R11NG1ZWHU806V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The eQuick company was great to work with and they did everything they could to satisfy me but, I received my phone very promptly and had it activated but it had a bad speaker.  They immediately sent me another phone that worked fine at first but it froze up on the second day which is very rare.  I requested a refund and an RA which they did without question.

I didn't want to wait and every time Verizon sent me a new Stratosphere it would work fine for a few days and then it would crap out.
