But I am so disappointed with this phone. It keeps blacking out for reasons unknown to me. I have only been using this phone for a few days now and I hate it. The touch screen only responds to your finger tip and it keeps freezing. As a result I am missing my phone calls. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!! YOU ARE ONLY WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good compact smart phone with slideout full QWERTY keyboard & Wi-Fi... But it's NOT an Android", "Author": "Kyle Y", "ReviewID": "R2DBYIBBLO89VU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to write a review because I just don't think the phone merits one star...Maybe two and possibly a three :-)UPDATE 6/20/2012 - No updated apps or OS from SE since I've purchased it. Still not holding my breath.  Also I just got an Xperia Mini Pro SK17a White (the updated version of the X10 Mini Pro). Yeah I like to play with SE phones.TLDR - The Sony Ericsson txt pro is a decent smartphone for people who want a basic, compact, stylish smart phone with a slideout full QWERTY keyboard, built-in Wi-FI, *AND* who will be satisfied with the pre-installed features and apps as-is.  It is a GSM/EDGE 2G phone that works with AT&T; or T-Mobile (but for how long?) including their pay-per-minute plans.  This phone is not for people who want to install Android apps or who need a phone with a larger display or QWERTY keyboard.IMPORTANT: People who want to use this phone with a data plan must carefully research whether this phone or any unlocked smartphone will work with their network.  This phone is 2G EDGE only not 3G though I'm no expert on this. I don't use a data plan and I'm happy with the built-in Wi-Fi.  Also, if you do buy an unlocked smartphone, be prepared to research how to configure it to use your provider's network (internet, text, multimedia server settings etc.)  This doesn't always just happen auto-magically after you turn on the phone. Also, I've read rumors that AT&T; is trying to phase out phones that use ?2G EDGE? in the NY Metro area something or other. So far my phone still works fine on AT&T;'s network and they haven't cut me off.REVIEWThe Sony Ericsson txt pro is my first smartphone.  I purchased it from EVERYDAYCELL fullfilled by Amazon.com.  Shortly after purchasing it, I purchased the very similar Sony Ericsson X10 Mini Pro from an auction website so I can compare both. Note that the \"Pro\" designation means the phone has a slide out QWERTY keyboard which both phones do have.The Sony Ericsson(SE) txt pro is a 2G GSM phone that works on the AT&T; or T-Mobile networks. It's designed for people who frequently text message and want a (very) compact smart phone with a slide-out full QWERTY keyboard. People who want an affordable stylish beginner's smart phone and want to avoid a paying for a data plan will also like the phone's built in Wi-Fi.The phone looks and feels like an Android smart phone but *IT'S NOT* an Android phone. It has SE's own smartphone interface and version of apps such as Google Talk.  This is a decent phone *IF* you will be satisfied with the phone's built-in features and apps.  However, be aware that Sony Ericsson has a reputation for being slow to provide software updates to their phones (if ever). So, don't count on them providing updates to their apps and obviously you can't install any Android apps.Another reviewer remarked that this phone is too small or made for children. I bought the phone BECAUSE it's small AND it has the slideout keyboard. Length and width it's the size of a business card! and about thick as a finger. I have big hands and the txt pro keyboard is indeed small but I like the phone and find the keyboard quite usable (if you always keep your nails trimmed :-)). I dislike touch screen keyboards and prefer the buttons and tactile feedback of the txt pro. If you need a larger display or keyboard then shop around.PROS: - Touch screen interface similar to Android with a home screen that has your favorite apps in the four corners, finger swipes to move screens, etc. - Popular pre-installed web apps - Web browser, Gmail, Google Talk, YouTube, Facebook, etc. as well as the common productivity apps (MP3 player, calendar, calculator, etc). - Slide-out full QWERTY keyboard - Built-in Wi-Fi - Stylish and comes in white, red, or black.CONS: - It's not an Android phone. So no apps from Android Marketplace and no updates from Sony Ericsson as of 6/20/2012 - Touch screen interface occasionally lags a second or two but not too badly - No LED light - Slide-out keyboard and phone is too small for some people - No touchscreen QWERTY keyboard - The touchscreen keyboard is the 0-9 keyboard.COMPARISON TO SONY ERICSSON X10 MINI PRO (ANDROID 1.6/2.1)The X10 Mini Pro is very similar to the \"txt pro\" except the X10 is an actual Android phone (1.6 which you can upgrade to 2.1 using SE software which I did). I have two cell plans and so I use both phones. I can say I much prefer the X10 Mini Pro only because I like to install apps from Android Marketplace.  Also the Android version of apps such as Google Talk work better than the SE version.  Of course the X10 costs a little more than the \"txt pro\" and now SE has launched the new versions of the X10 phones (simply named just \"Xperia Mini Pro\") costing even more.  Beyond that, the \"txt pro\" is a fine phone for people who want a compact stylish smart phone with Wi-Fi, slideout full QWERTY, and happy with its features out of the box as-is.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "sony ericsson txt pro = piece of junk", "Author": "f117b2", "ReviewID": "R2VL1RXTWFBOSS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "People, please read my review before you purchase the piece of junk.First of all, in my opinion, the phone is NOT designed for adult uses. Instead, it is designed for kids, especially for girls at age under 12. BTW, I bought the phone for my 10 yr. daughter.Now, let's get into the worst part. I bought the phone from newegg, not from Amazon. My daughter used the phone for about a week, and told me the touch screen didn't work in half of the time. You can ONLY use the touch screen to make a call, answer a call, or terminate a call. If the touch screen doesn't work, the phone is useless. You have to turn off power to terminate a call. I did try to calibrated the phone [...]I contacted Newegg customer service, and was told the phone was defected and could be returned for refund, but I needed to contact Sony Ericsson to create a case #, and then they could work on the refund. I called Sony Ericsson at 866-766-9374 on 09/30/2011 Friday afternoon around 4:00PM CST. A woman answered the phone. First she took all my personal info; phone #, cell #, address, and e-mail address, and then asked me the phone info and what was wrong. I told her what was wrong, and the seller asked me to contact Sony Ericsson to create a case # for refund. After I said that, the woman immediately said, sorry can't do that, the system is down. Then I said, Ok, since you got all my info, phone # and e-mail, when the system is up, can you call me back? The woman became mad, and very rudely said \"sir, I am telling you again, the system is done, I don't know when it will be back, it could be 5 or 10 minutes, or maybe next week (What hack is that, next week???.)\". Give me a break!  I have never had experiences like Sony Ericsson Customer services. The people who work there are trained to lie, not to solve problems.
