It's android, it has an external keyboard, and I don't do that much internet browsing. If the price were under $200 then it would be a deal despite some of its shortcomings but overall it is still a decent budget phone.

A good entry option to Android OS based equipments for those who want to feel real keys under their thumbs / fingers. However, after realizing many apps will force you to put the equipment sideways you will start asking yourself why didn't you go for full touch screen right from the start.Call quality is good. GPS works fine also, camera is fair under good lightning (no flash)", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice for te price. Perfect for old Blackberry users", "Author": "Edmundo Pimentel \"SAP / ABAP Wiz\"", "ReviewID": "R3UZGTLD0P7GA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought for my mom, cause she is not very technological and this would be her first Android. I couldn't be there to give it in person, so every support that i gave her was by the phone. I was very surprise that  she got everything right away, connecting to wifi, installing apps, making phone calls, and even syncing with google account every contact.The phone itself its not fast, but that what you get for the price. Descent picture quality. Perfect for Blackberry user that are used to haven a candy bar phone with the qwerty keyboard. Touch screen its a plus, cause it helps new user (like senior person) to get used to touch the screen to trigger an action.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Noor", "ReviewID": "R89QKE6AJQK8I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're one of those high tech people that absolutely adores the latest technology smart phones, then this probably isn't for you. Me? I just wanted an upgrade from my regular non-smart phone. And this phone seems great. Got it yesterday; been messing with it all day. I LOVE that it has a touch screen AND a GREAT keyboard. In fact, the keyboard is exceptional. The touch screen is great too. It gets the job done without any glitches. It's a great phone, really. I'd recommend getting a memory card when you buy this if you don't already have one, otherwise you can't take pictures and save them. But really, this phone's great for those that wanted to upgrade to a smart phone, just not one of those iPhone/latest technology HD phones with all the extra goodies.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK for the price", "Author": "JBRITTIN", "ReviewID": "R3BCBE2VAWFAFT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was ok for the price but screen was too small to be touch screen.

I've dropped it, kicked it, and splashed it with a bottle of water.  I have fat fingers so I love the QWERTY instead of the touch screen keypad.  I dread knowing that almost all smartphones have gone to touchscreen only.  I was disappointed in knowing that it doesn't have a spell check and yes I've checked and called Samsung.  I just had to make sure of what I had typed out before hitting send.  The original battery finally died and wont hold a charge for longer then a few hours this last week.  I'll be replacing the battery instead of replacing the phone.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "LUIS GUTIERREZ", "ReviewID": "R1A3AD0IH17RA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very good phone, simple but efficient. very fluid touch screen. also has QWERTY keyboard for more comfortable writing. android version 2.2 froyo kies not upgradable", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST TOUGHTSCREEN + KEYBOARD", "Author": "wojciech galazka", "ReviewID": "RHI071N2N31Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this samsung phone because i needed an toughtscreen phone with keyboard. this two element increase the comfort when you are writing messages o mails or when you surf the net. i can add that the price was the best. i think that this phone has the best relation between price/size/software caracteristics. i recommedn it.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0050J7ZMM"}}
