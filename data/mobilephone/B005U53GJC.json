{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome phone!", "Author": "eric", "ReviewID": "R3OAD2MFF2HULA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone. Amazing features, screen quality, size, and durability (had it over 1.5 years and it's really handled the beating I've given it well). It also seems to handle moisture and impacts well. This is purely cosmetic, but the clear coat on the kickstand WILL all come off, and it looks bad. If this bothers you... well I'm sorry, you'll have to deal.I am an avid android developer and I love this thing. It's the first smart phone I've ever had and it got me into them big time. This phone's battery life improves greatly with a solid undervolted kernel. I feel like the battery life qualms with this phone are almost completely as a result of the software and not hardware. I am not sure of this as I only had the phone for a couple weeks before rooting, upgrading the radio software and designing my own kernel. My battery life is fine, at least a whole day and the next night.As far as a blank, open device for use with custom software, it doesn't get much better than this phone, and there is almost nothing of any real value that newer devices can bring to the table that this phone can't already accomplish with a little research on part of its owner. If only it had MHL or a HDMI port, it could duke it out with the best smart phones of today. Cyanogenmod ROMs work great on this phone, and the interface is sleek, snappy, and very modern.It is a bit heavy which leads me to believe that if you drop it frequently, you might have trouble after a couple of years or so. It also might interfere with car mounts due to its weight. Even with everything tweaked, the battery life is barely 17 hours with light - medium usage in an area with light cell signal. The camera is great outdoors. This is slightly diminished indoors and it's quite poor and grainy in low light. The front facing camera is useless, unfortunately, even in good light. It came with a 32G flash drive when I bought it which is amazing! I like that it supports free wifi tethering and AVRCP too, plus tends to handle medium-high resolution vids well. It will NOT play 1080P video smoothly, no matter what you do. It works well for gaming and the touch screen is as responsive as you'd expect. It also multitasks well. I have had navi shouting commands through BT, music streaming, wifi tethering active with 2 laptops connected, and somebody playing temple run on this phone all simultaneously. It did get kind of hot though doing all of this, but not alarmingly so, and battery lasted for almost 3 hours under these conditions.All in all, I love this phone, and when the time comes, I'll be going with another HTC device and likely pimping it out just as hard as the thunderbolt that started it all. I deducted a star for battery life, front camera, and the heavier than necessary (in my opinion) weight.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall unreliable device", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RLZJJK5OHTH1T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am on my second thunderbolt and can't wait for my upgrade date so I can pitch it. The first would kill the battery when I hooked it up to charge. The service was unreliable and I had nothing but trouble with the phone shutting down in the middle of making calls and utilizing applications. HTC was no help and would only recommend a hard reboot of the phone, which would wipe all of the data, contacts, pictures, etc.The second was a replacement for the first when I finally broke it. Initially it appeared the phone would work well. The speed of the second device was exceptional. It appeared they worked out the bugs. Then we got 4G. The battery dies in 4 hours when in 4G under moderate usage. If the phone ever searches for wifi I may get up to 4 hours but probably not. I have to immediately log into to wifi and run off of that signal to get the battery to last 8-10 hours. I do not EVER get more than 12 hours on a single charge. If you buy this phone, get extra chargers for the car and an wall outlets so you can plug up when needed.Now that I have had the replacement for about six months it is starting to act up. The phone restarts on its own at times (though not as often as the first one by no means). the service has become patchy and it drops calls where I could talk several months ago. The phone won't ring indoors (but this may be a characteristic of the building I am in). I am completely dissatisfied with the lifespan of the device. If I could upgrade every 6 months then it would not be a problem but the plans are not structured that way. I just have to suffer for 6 MORE MONTHS before I can switch up. Be advised, consider this phone seriously before you buy it. Two years is a long time to be stuck with an unreliable device.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my Thunderbolt. But it's a blast from the past now", "Author": "robertjm", "ReviewID": "R8654C2WWOATH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Today I was looking over phones offered on Amazon and ran into the Thunderbolt under non-contract for $399.Let me preface all this by saying that I love my Thunderbolt and I was an early adopter, ordering it within hours of it becoming available.With that said, anybody who spends $399 so they can get an unlocked Verizon Thunderbolt has to be out of their mind!! They are available on EBAY for less than $50 easily.As for the phone? It's a single core phone so it's not the fastest out there today. Updates are few and far between, which was the biggest complaint people had when it was the Verizon flagship phone. I ended up rooting mine and installing an ICS ROM so that I could have the latest O/S, which has worked great so far. But, it looks like Jelly Bean and KitKat are out of the question. Either that, or people are no longer developing for it!Contrary to many of the people commenting on the web, I actually like the Sense UI interface. True, it's not stock android. But, it's a heck of a lot better than TouchWiz, and other interfaces offered at that time.There's a ton of memory on this phone AND it offers a microSD card slot, which seems to be going the way of the dinosaur in favor of cloud storage (Now how can someone use cloud storage if you cannot connect to the cloud out in the boondocks, is always my question).The build quality of the HTC handsets are always great. I like the feel of my Thunderbolt in my hand. It's solid feeling. As much as I like the HTC One, it almost feels too light in my hand. Not to mention the fact, it's an oddball feeling being that it's a lot longer due to the Beats Audio speakers built-in.All in all, it's a great phone, providing you can get one at a fairly inexpensive price. However, nobody should be paying $399 for this phone, lest they're Donald Trump and wouldn't be missing the extra couple hundred Washingtons!", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad phone", "Author": "john conder", "ReviewID": "R21NFPIRFKCY4A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "so i ordered the thunderbolt because my droid razor maxx was stolen. the phone came in good timing, right when they said it would but it has some kind of problem i wasnt made aware of upon buying it. when i click on text messages it will start to pop up then go back to the home screen, it does this 5-6 times before it will finially work right, then when i click on apps it starts to go to them then it pauses before going for about 2 mins until it will go to the app or do anything, just alot of problems with this phone and it was listed as used almost like new..", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Roxanne Pearson", "ReviewID": "R3IIU1RJP9W0LI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HTC Thunderbolt is a terrible phone.  Sure, it does a lot.  That part is great.  However, the battery life is the worst of all the smartphones (that is according to me AND a Verizon Wireless rep).  Go to any HTC Thunderbolt forum and you'll see what I'm talking about.  The battery that came with my phone stopped holding a charge.  Since my phone was still under warranty, HTC replaced my battery with an extended battery.  The extended battery will hold a charge for about 30 minutes before it goes dead.  It never fully charges.  It's not a battery issue, though, it's a device issue.  Every Thunderbolt owner that I know has had problems with their phone at some point.  This phone is not worth any money at all, so don't waste any of yours on it.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "it works", "Author": "Quentin Tubbs", "ReviewID": "R3OIM6KRQ6JIA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No issues with this guy.

I picked it up as a replacement to my HTC Incredibel 2 (which I loved) and this I find to be a lesser product in their line up.  I like HTC, just no the Thudnerbolt.  Consider your options, but it will suffice if need be.  Just keep a charger on you always.
