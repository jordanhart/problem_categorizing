{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review the Official Specs", "Author": "David Munoz", "ReviewID": "R2358CBLP92Z4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While the phone is a good deal for the price, the listed specs are (currently) not correct. The screen is 854x480, not the qHD screen (960x540) that it states. (Amazon has since fixed this issue)Also, T-Mobile will only be 4G in certain areas with this phone, while AT&T; should be 3G in all areas.Lastly, Blu isn't exactly known for keeping its phones upgraded to the latest Android version. It is current now, but don't expect updates.Overall 4 Stars!Update 7/15: A few more details. The screen produces some great colors, but the viewing angles are pretty bad. The vertical viewing angles are fine, with just some lightening in color, but viewing in horizontal can make the screen go almost white.The whole phone zips along with whatever you need. Quadrant is just under 4K and Antutu is just under 14K. Memory just limits the multitasking, with apps closing if you keep opening new ones or switching between them.The speaker is decent sounding, but it could be louder. The vibrate is pretty tiny and near the bottom of the phone. The phone box is nice and comes with a screen protector, but it isn't installed already and mine came with lint on the sticky side... YMMV. I still can't get all the bubbles out of the protector either.The camera is rubbish. You'll need very good lighting if you want to get anything that doesn't look like a VGA webcam.The back is a nice matte plastic with a slight rubber texture (except for the top which is glossy), but the edges come to a point and that makes it harder to grip and the bottom point isn't comfortable to hold. It doesn't feel like it will break with one drop, though.Update 7/16: The TTS (text-to-speech) engine is Pico, not the Google TTS that normally comes with 4.2. This means the GPS voice sounds like it did back in Gingerbread, not the nicer one that replaced it. I installed the IVONA beta and that will do, but it's silly that it still uses Pico.Root is super easy. There is a MKT6589 one-click root you can download and it works like a charm. This means, with some know-how, you can fix most issues.More info on the screen. It is locked at 48hz, not the 60hz of most everything else. This means nothing will ever go faster than 48 FPS unless someone can change that. Not too big of an issue, but this does limit the benchmark scores.Update 7/19- after taking the back cover off the phone a few times the phone now squeaks when squeezed. A little disheartening, but for the price I still vote 4 stars.Update 7/30- One thing I should mention. Putting the sim cards in the phone is rather different than most phones. Since there is two, and since the phone isn't very wide, they actually slide in sideways on top of each other. This was very weird for me the first time as it seems like I am shoving them into the cavity and not the slot for them. There is a thin piece of metal that separates the two slots, but it feels like you could lose the sim inside (especially if you use a nano sim in an adapter like I do). No harm done after putting one in and taking it out, although it was rather difficult to take out.I'll update this if I find something else!", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLU 4.5 Dash", "Author": "Amateur Geek \"AmateurGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R35WMGHE5UHC97", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not a verified purchase because a friend bought it from Amazon, then figured out she could use her unlocked old iphone 4 for international travel. So I bought it from her at a discount. This is a great value. I put in a Straight talk ATT sim in the deep slot (this one does HSPA+) and a T Mobile Walmart $30 sim in the shallow slot (only does 2G)  and booted it up. The ATT ST sim imported the old ST APN and could not connect. I input the newer ST ATT APN settings and it worked fine. T Mo settings were loaded perfectly. It is very easy to switch phone, SMS, or data between sims and mix and match with the sim management button.We live in a major city on the 25th floor downtown. My wife has a google nexus 4 with a HSPA+ ATT prepaid sim. Side by side with speedtest, the nexus 4 was Ping-376, down-1.67 Mbps, up-1.06 Mbps. The Dash blu 4.5 on ST ATT was ping-115, down- 2.13 Mbps, up- 1 Mbps. I got about the same speed on the Dash with the T MO sim in the deep slot. Fast enough but not LTE as expected. the feel was very nice. Actually better than my old google nexus. the screen display was as good as the nexus 4 to me. checking speeds on the home wifi the nexus 4 and dash blu were virtually identical. There is a micro sd slot. After I got my essential apps loaded, you can select your default write disk under storage. My \"total space\" says .98 GB. My Phone storage says \"Total space\" 1.80 GB. My SD says 2.95 GB available. I am using a Walmart generic leather holder for this that cost $8. Call volume and clarity and very good.Edit- You need to enable all the extra stuff for GPS to work well. Long press GPS and click all the buttons. After that GPS boots up as fast as the Google nexus 4, using Google maps, and Waze.Edit 21 days later- Still working well and the shell compares well to my G note 2 and my wifes Nexus 4. GPS boots a tiny bit slower. You can change the battery.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, and I mean great, phone for the price!", "Author": "bdozer", "ReviewID": "R2E1FNN6Q9YZ7J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only been using for 1 day, so this is more of first impressions at this point.  I will update with more information as needed.Came with wall charger, screen protector, headphones, and a separate package including a USB car charger and cable (unexpected).  Overall impressions are very positive so far.  Screen looks pretty good.  Access to micro-sd without removing the battery.  Very fast boot time.  Nice feel and weight.  Almost NO crapware pre-installed.  Dual-SIM is really awesome (I will spend some more time on that later).  Call quality seems fine, maybe a little quiet hearing the other party, but average.  Haven't found a way to keep the capacitive buttons illuminated, but I'm trying to fix that with 3rd party app now.  Camera isn't the best, especially in low light.  I think this is party due to a pretty weak flash.  Battery life isn't too great, but I think that's because I haven't really put it down yet.I will go into detail on a few features I think are significant below:Dual-SIM.  This is the first dual-sim phone I've had, so I'm not sure if these features are stock android or added in by BLU.  Very nice feature.  Only one will support WCDMA/GSM the 2nd is GSM only.  You can decide which SIM to use for the three functions (voice, text, data) or you can have it ask you each time.  So when I go to make a call, it will ask me which sim to use (which is essentially which number you want the other person to see).  This is really cool.  I have a feeling this may be impacting my battery life, as it is running 2 radio simultaneously.  Very cool for people who currently have a work and a personal phone, and would like to consolidate.Network Speeds:  I use AT&T;, and it seems they don't give much love to data speeds on their HSPDA network.  With full signal, I am only getting 1Mb/500Kb speeds.  Not a huge deal, but it is noticeable coming from their LTE network.  I have a feeling the T-Mobile speeds will be much, much better.  Maybe a work AT&T; SIM for voice/text and a T-Mobile SIM to use for data with the 30/month package they have would be almost perfect.Settings:  It seems there isn't as much flexibility in the settings.  This could change as I continue using it, but here are a couple of examples of things I was looking for and couldn't find.  Capacitive touch buttons light timeout (it seems really short, and I almost never see them lit).  Notification options on home screen - there are the jelly bean notification widgets available, but I was looking for a little more.  Quick unlock to apps - looks like it wants to let me add things to unlock and go directly into, but I can't figure out how to add them.  Wifi Tethering - It works great, and is easily configurable.So all in all, I have to give it 4 stars (for now).  You are getting a whole lot for the price.  The dual-sim is new (to me) and a very nice feature.I will update if I find anything else of note, or an app to get around some things.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great but be careful", "Author": "Jpetcare", "ReviewID": "R2W2977CP62JMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone itself is great.

You choose which carrier is the best, you choose the carrier that gives you the best service. The carrier works hard to make sure you get the best service and bandwidth.The BluDash 4.5 packs more power and features than most high end phones in the market today. This phone performs like a Pro.

I've been on Android for a couple of years now, and I've owned mostly high end samsung phones like the galaxy note 1 and 2, the galaxy S3 and currently I have the Galaxy S4. But since I have an only data sim card and a second sim card from another operator, I needed a two sim phone so I could use both and this little phone does the job greatly. The only con I've found so far is that it has a very poor memory storage but since I only use it as a mobile hotspot I couldn't care less.

It feels a little cheap in the hand, but the case makes it feel a bit more solid.  The camera is fine outside in daylight, but I agree with the other reviews about the terrible low light performance.  Still, not bad for the price.The stock Jelly Bean is a bonus.  I have been using JB for over a year now, and moving to the phone was easy.  It is zippy with no lag.  Of course I'm using it as a PHONE.  I have a tablet that I use for other things.  I'm not holding my breath, but it would be nice if Blu pushes out an update to Kitkat.  I've read a couple of things that make it sound like the new Android will be optimized for 512mb of RAM.

Even though the software is a factor in the overall experience, I think it best I weigh the software at only 5% of this review.An unlocked Dual SIM GSM phone, with Quad core processor, decent enough RAM and storage. Add a 5MP camera and 4G for under $150. WOW. That is really something. It makes you wonder if you are paying for the name when you buy other phones. The build quality is excellent. A rubber case, earbuds and screen protector came in the box. The overall electronics makes for a fast, smooth experience with the user interface. The only thing slightly below par is battery life (1 day) and the camera. You will need a well lit subject and steady hands to get the best out of this as the flash is limited as it is with most phones.It's nice that I don't have to cut the SIM cards and that it accommodates two (no longer need two phones for work and personal use). I was torn between a 4\" and a 4.5\" display and am happy I went with the 4.5\" as it has enough real estate to view everything well and still fit comfortably in my hand. The display is very clear even in direct sunlight (using auto adjust), and the audio is very clear with phone calls. The proximity sensor is also an excellent addition so that you don't get \"key presses\" with your cheek while on a call.There's probably a law against asking for more at this price point.Update: 27 Feb 2014: The battery life with normal use is about 2 days. When I just received the phone I was installing apps etc therefore the battery only lasted one day. Also, beware two things ...[] With my purchase, the screen protector is an extra one. My phone came with a screen protector already attached to the phone.[] On my phone, the rubber case causes the screen protector to lift.

I ONLY wanted an unlocked phone.  I choose this phone over the nexus 4 because the Nexus' successor was slated to come out in the fall. (It should be out by the end of October '13.)  So this phone was 130 dollars vs. the 300 plus shipping and sales tax from Google.  I've got pros and cons, so might as well start with the good:Pros:1. From the outside it looks like a much more expensive phone.2. I can make calls, texts, and use the internet easily with my gosmart mobile plan.  I needed an unlocked phone.3. There is an SD slot.4. There is an FM radio chip.5. There is a GPS chip.6. The display seems good when you use it. (When compared to my Nexus 7, it's lacking)7. I didn't break the bank to buy it, and when the Nexus 5 comes out in 2 weeks, I won't feel bad about buying it.8. Good battery - I can normally use it for two days without a charge.Cons:1. Cheap feeling back cover and screen.  The screen is plastic, and you can tell.2. GPS takes quite some time to get a fix on your location, and DOES NOT WORK INSIDE AT ALL. This is probably my biggest issue with this phone, since I use gps often.3. No proximity sensor, only ambient light.  This phone uses ambient light to determine if your face is against the phone.  If it's sunny outside, you run the risk of the screen turning on and pushing buttons with your face, and disrupting the call.  Very annoying.4. Small amount of memory.  The processor is fast, but running too many things at once will bog it down very quickly.5. Un-reliable battery percentage.  If you are at 20%, it can charge to 80% in about 10 mins.  The lower and upper 20 percents seem weighted heavily, and I don't really trust the battery percentage.Overall - If you're looking for a low cost unlocked phone, this is a good choice.  It will not rival any other new phone on the market - be prepared for that.  That being said, the lack of proximity sensor is a real pain in the neck.

The first difference that I've noticed was the chat interface has slightly changed and some slight changes in the menus.It is light and comfortable in one's palm. One reviewer has mentioned \"sharp edges\". I have not found any.The only trouble that we've discovered was the advertising sticker that is adhered on the top of the thin screen protector on the phone's screen. That screen protector, that comes by default attached on the screen is thinner than the screen protector that we've received bundled by the seller (Breed). So, while removing the advertising label, unfortunately the thin (default) screen protector has been lifted off and it led to spending time and some frustration afterwards. If one is aware about this potentially problematic situation and is prepared to it, one will remove the sticker in a different fashion and will avoid this frustration.

Got it set up in an hour or two on ATT. Connected download my usual apps and off I go. Calls work better than my old phone (samsung GII skyrocket) no problems with processor speed or RAM issues. Used GPS while streaming Pandora and no lock ups. Runs Android  well and no bloat wear from the big phone companies installed, just pure Android which was nice. Camera...well not bad in daylight and screen camera ..well vga so kinda grainy which I could care less not into self portraits or making movies with the front camera. Soooo....two days after that I notice dust between the outer screen and lcd. Visible only when screen is off. OK no biggie not expecting a super phone for the price but i have a 4 year old Motorola smart-phone that is my fall-back phone with no dust or boogers under screen. Looks like lint from being in my pocket. So that means the lcd and digitizer are not sealed very well. Which can later introduce moisture and other crap. Again no biggie so far. Next the audio is horrific through the headphone jack....yes i tried several head phones include a brand new name brand and it sound like there is a hall effect on the sound...i adjusted the equalizer....the sound  was just .....trust me....... terrible. A simple thing to listen to music or use headphones for a phone call would not work. But....when streamed through blue tooth sounded fine...so most likely the amp circuit or possibly the head phone jack is crap.....I so much wanted to like this phone but now just over two weeks the lower right screen does not respond. It starts to select things on its own and i cannot unlock it because screen is not responsive. Reboot several times, there is just something wrong with either the digitizer or the CPU randomly choosing things. I read this problem in other reviews but shrugged it off.  Look 100-120 dollar is not going to run like a 300-400 phone i get it but this phone died too soon with too many simple problems. I was going to purchase possibly a more expensive BLU phone if this held up. After two weeks its not working but I'm sorry to say I cant recommend this phone. If 100-120 dollars is no big deal to you then by all means throw it away but please don't say you were not warned.

Like most, I was skeptical of the 512MB RAM but so far it hasn't been an issue.  Also, I'm not a gamer or video watcher on my phone so that may make a difference.  It connects to At&t;'s (via Net10) hspa+ network and is quite fast.  Also, it has a tethering/mobile hotspot feature that I didn't know about, and it works.  The screen does have a bit of a blue/cool tint to it.  Also, I haven't really figured out the camera yet.  Some pictures are good and some aren't, and I don't really know how to make it focus.  The only issue I'm having so far is with the GPS.  I don't know if it is something wrong with the phone or outside circumstances, but I haven't been able to get it to work.  For that reason, I may be returning it and getting a new one.Overall, for the cheap price and the cheap service through Net10, this is a great phone!

Seemingly, ATT has unified their APN settings for 4LTE/HSDPA+ a while back and the default APN settings for this phone (maybe SIM?) is out of sync.  Had to create a new APN which follows the current ATT protocol (just do a web search to get the proper settings - this would also apply for T-Mobile and MVNOs).

I know the phone battery is new, but my last phone's (which I got just one year ago) battery was terrible. I didn't even use the wifi and I'd need to charge it every other day. So anyway, this phone looks very similar to many of the smartphones out there right now. It is slick.

I have been using just wifi at the moment, until I get the data plan, but it works great with my wifi at home and work!So again, first impressions: not your average \"cheap\" smartphone, it's actually very nice. My last smartphone was thick and bulky and the touch was not that great, but it was cheaper so I thought it would work out. This phone was only $30 more than that and it's way better. Nice and thin and a larger screen, and again, looks like your more expensive smartphones.
