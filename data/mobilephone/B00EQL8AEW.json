{"Reviews": [{"Title": "ZTE Open Firefox", "Author": "Jack Halem", "ReviewID": "R3EJGP2EUSJX6M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my Firefox ZTE open phone early in October.  On October 15th I got it activated on T-Mobile in Long Beach, CA.  I didn't realize it is only 3G.  The speed is OK, just that I should have purchased the $50 and not the $60 plan that included a lot of  4G data.  If you are like me, and not familiar with the Apple phones the learning curve may be a little slow.  This is a fairly basic smart phone - however it meets my needs.  Once I mastered the phone, I realized it was very easy to use.  I would have given five stars if it contained a basic manual. Since it depends upon the Internet for most of its duties, it is supposed to never slow down - and from my experience - this seems to be true. Beware and shop around.  These phones sell from $80 to $220 for the exact same phone.  I paid $79.99 delivered, and had to purchase the small SD memory card separately.One has to be aware that this is a Mozilla Firefox phone.  Not Apple or Android.  It is new to the market place and has yet to be picked up by any national company in the USA.  First I \"Highly Recommend\" that you do your homework - or you may be disappointed.Find a carrier and I recommend T-Mobile or a Metro PCS dealer.  This is a GSM phone and not supported by Sprint, or Verison technologies.Hint:  Metro PCS has been purchased by T-Mobile and has GSM technology available.  Translation, unlimited everything for $40/month including taxes.  I plan to switch to Metro PCS myself in a few months.  $40/month for unlimited everything.In conclusion.This was a great idea for me.For yourself - only you can decide.Most of all plan ahead.Locate the service you want and at this juncture I HIGHLY recommend finding an agreeable Metro or T-Mobile dealer who wants your business and knows what they are doing.  I hand picked the technician who assisted me.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Firefox OS -- Developer model", "Author": "Valorphase", "ReviewID": "R3SEL37W866SWO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "BUYER NOTE: This is only intended to be a \"developer\" phone. As such, it lacks the fit/finish and polish that comes with consumer-grade electronics.The benefits of the Firefox OS is that EVERYTHING on this handset is open source, and the entire API stack leverages open-source technologies.Furthermore, this handset is NOT high-end hardware, as it's really intended for emerging markets. As others have noted, this handset isn't even \"4G\", but 3G only.If you want to write your own apps (especially if you are a web developer familiar with HTML5), this is a great platform. If you're a consumer, this is probably not going to make you happy as an everyday handset.There is some rumors that Sony is planning to release an Xperia model on the Firefox platform in 2014. If you're a consumer, I'd wait until there's a consumer-grade handset available from a major carrier.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truely one of a kind (in the worst way possible)", "Author": "Zachary Klosko", "ReviewID": "ROV82DYMOUPK3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Keep in mind this phone is at the \"developer\" level and the operating system is still in its beginning stages. There is a developer's note at the bottom of the review.The phone itself wasn't very good. It runs Firefox OS version 1.0.1; 1.1.0 has been released, but ZTE has not made any plans to send out an update. Wi-Fi won't connect to all networks (I think it won't connect to networks that require you to sign in or accept terms via. a web page). Very little onboard storage, which is used for apps and app data only; all music, photos, and videos are stored on a microSD card, which you will need to buy if you don't have one already. The phone's speaker is very soft, including speakerphone (setting the volume at 100% is as loud as two people talking in a library). The FM Radio, however, is very loud. The apps run slowly, which is odd, since they are built using HTML. After inserting the microSD card, an \".androidsomething\" folder shows up, so I think the OS is built using Android. For the \"First open web OS\", that really sucks and I didn't think the open source community, let alone Mozilla, would do that to us. And there actually is bloatware on the phone: the Nokia Maps app cannot be uninstalled.A plus for the operating system: it includes multitasking and app switching in its first release. I believe that is a first for smartphone operating systems. However, the phone is missing things like SIM card management, which should be included on all phones. (This is also a first for smartphone operating systems.)If you really want Firefox OS, wait until Mozilla releases version 2.0. The first iPhone wasn't very good either.The hardware in general is nice for the price. The orange part on the front feels a little rubbery. The buttons are made with a slick, glossy plastic, which makes them hard to keep your fingers on if you sweat a lot. And everything CNET says about the camera is true: it completely sucks.Keep in mind this phone was created to be marketed in Europe and Asia, and wasn't necessarily designed for the United State's high expectations when it comes to the mobile market. If you really want a phone with Firefox OS, consider the Peak+ from Geeksphone. It's rather large, with a screen size of 4.1\", which is a problem for me since I tend to keep my phone in my jeans pocket. The specs were much, much, much better, with 1 GB of onboard storage instead of the ZTE Open's 170 MB.Last but not least, if you are sensitive to the radiation given off by cell phones (don't pretend you don't know it doesn't exist), do not leave it in your pockets! Keep it in a backpack or a purse. The radiation from the cell antenna made my left leg muscles tighten uncontrollably. Sorry ZTE, but health concerns equal 1 star reviews.Developers: as long as you don't plan to have this be your primary phone, it's a cheap buy and I'm sure it will be beneficial in testing your apps.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy", "Author": "slapstick savior", "ReviewID": "RVEXX8H2I0WXN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone in and of itself is kind of alright outside of the slow, unresponsive UI and the lack of features such as MMS. There is no support for this device however. You will not see a single update and if you want to install them yourself, good luck.
