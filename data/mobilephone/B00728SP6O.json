I'm also very shocked that it didn't come with any type of charger. Nothing I can find in the listing says anything about it not coming with one. Thankfully I found a charger to purchase for less than five dollars but I would be more cautious the next time I'm looking to buy a phone for my mother.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Rosa Valle", "ReviewID": "RRH89T9A741CN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought a simple and easy phone for my dad, and searched and searched till I found this phone.
