Luckily, I was late to the party when it came to tablet-phones so most of the learning curve (how to fix the strange black-screen issue when answering phone-calls, for example) had already been troubleshot by the internet, so a quick google search fixed that little problem. If only the rest could be so easily remedied.Unfortunately, I didn't get much use out of this phone before I was forced to return it. Here's a quick breakdown of everything you can expect to find wrong with your phone, before I explain why I ended up returning mine after less than 24 hours:- Nowhere in the manual or on the internet can you find the basic instructions on HOW TO OPEN THE BACK OF YOUR PHONE.- This product was described as brand new, but the screen cover it came with had particles and FINGERPRINTS under it. Also, the silver paint/coating on the 'speaker' near the top of the chassis had a worn edge that showed black where the silver had been either buffed or scraped away. The phone was internally clean, but those two issues told me I shouldn't have been so surprised to find as many things wrong with the phone as I did - this was NOT brand new. And if it was, that implies all sorts of things doesn't it?- Rebooting the phone doesn't reboot it. It just turns the phone off, and then you have to hit the power button several times before it will respond and turn itself back on. That's worrisome. Also the power button is THE one and only way to wake the phone up from sleep mode. No other buttons, including the home button, will do that. If the power button is already semi-unresponsive, being the only way to turn on the screen, that's alarming re: long-term use.- The mini usb cable has to be forced into the charger slot. As in, it will not fit, and you will have to work it back and forth and WEDGE it in, which is terrifying since from what I could tell from eyeballing the hardware is it wouldn't take much to break that little charge-port, seeing how it's attached to the innards of your phone. As there's no gentle way to ease that in, I was immediately concerned that it was just a matter of time before the inevitable happened and the port either came loose and would not hold a charge, or worse. Not a good feeling for a piece of expensive equipment right out of the box.- Also, a mini-usb to usb cable doesn't work for sync'ing this phone with your PC. The cable provided in the box will work, but your own will not. This was baffling for me, since it's a problem I have NEVER run into before. I tried multiple different cables, and the one provided with the phone is the ONLY one that the phone would recognize as being anything more than 'charging battery' when connected to 4 separate computers. Beats me! Expect, also, to have to hunt down the drivers to get your computer to recognize this device so you can sync it. Windows 7, in particular, doesn't want to admit that it even exists until you do all the legwork yourself, so in order to get plug-n-play capability, expect to do all the groundwork before-hand. (No, the manual says nothing at all about this. You'll have to search for the drivers yourself and hope its the right ones, and that you can find a reputable place to download it from.)- The headphone jack will not accept normal headphones. The one provided for you is much longer than standard headphones, which is not only bizarre, but worrisome.- GPS will not recognize. Out in the open, no roof overhead, in the middle of a bustling city with a clear view of the sky, and it couldn't 'locate' me. Bluetooth also refused to recognize. I tried both T-Mobile and AT&T; sim cards, with no luck on either. My other phone immediately found GPS with no problem, bluetooth also, with both those sim cards. Interesting, isn't it? By this point, however, I was too disillusioned with the phone to try and research a way around that to 'fix' it. In my most humble of opinion, if you're spending just shy of 200 bucks on a product, you shouldn't have to waste hours of your own time 'fixing' the stuff thats wrong when that product arrives, brand new, fresh out of the box. It should work as described.- Vibration might as well not have worked. It barely vibrated at all. I placed it on a hard surface and called my phone from another line, and it barely buzzed loudly enough for me to hear it all of 5 feet away. Since this thing is way too large to carry around in your pocket, a super-quiet vibe that can be 'felt' more than 'heard' is NOT a selling point as it might be with a smaller device.All of those problems were troublesome enough without ALSO finding issues with the screen, but the main reason I ended up returning this phone was issues with the display itself. I inserted the battery, turned it on, and immediately noticed a small snow-flurry of broken red pixels across the display, and a very noticeable yellowish/orangeish overcast to everything. (This includes the loading 'splash' screen with the android robot.)The screen wouldn't recognize lighter shades of grey either. I initially thought this might have been a calibration problem, but after checking all the settings and hard resetting the phone, the problem persisted. Keep in mind this was before I ever downloaded anything onto the phone. Right out of the box, it was doing that. Bummer.I don't know if I just got a lemon, or if this is the manufacturing standard, but I'm glad I purchased mine through amazon prime. Makes returning this much easier than some of the reviews I've seen where you're dealing directly with an out-of-country seller. Hopefully the return will go smoothly and I can turn my sights elsewhere to find a good tab-phone of a different brand than this one.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "3G", "Author": "J.
