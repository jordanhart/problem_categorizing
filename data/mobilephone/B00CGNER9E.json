It takes  away the worries of taking care of the phone as it takes care of itself lol...Tested with a few drops , in some ice chest and it's a nice music player for under the shower with wet finger tracking ( yup... you can use your phone while wet)The fact of having a dual core cpu and 512Mb of Ram do not affect the performance of the phone with the use i give it  and as Jelly Bean manages very well resources as long as you do not download overload it with applications ( specially the  useless ones ).The battery is a winner , 18 hours with a moderate 3g/Wifi use .No LTE, no HD display , Poor GPU ,Accelaration and no Flash .For that I have a gaming PC and a Sony camera.

Dropped it half a dozen times on New York City sidewalks without any sign of damage.  The waterproofing makes the on-off switch something that must be gotten used to, but used several times in the rain just fine.Cons:  Warranty service execrable.  One of the quintessential American companies should have parts and service available in America, right? I mean the warranty phone number is in New York, and I work in Manhattan.  Easy!Parts and service (which are not separable) are available from one, count it, ONE service center in the Czech Republic. USPS won't take it (Lithium Ion Battery, $23-) and UPS store wants $216-.When I asked warranty about a customs form she sent me a UPS label.  I did what I do with Lenovo, packed it and put the label in a zip-lock on the outside, dropped it with UPS.  Which got it shipped back to my home in New Jersey.  They need a customs form.The people I've dealt with have been are very nice customer service people.  They are in a system that is, to look at it generously, not well designed.  None are native English speakers, and the Czechs don't even have phone number to call (not that I'd want to go through the whole phone card routine for warranty).As it stands now it's a writeoff- parts unobtainable.  Got four months out of it.Update: Well there I was with a cracked screen.  What do I do with it? Contrary to instruction I stripped it (door, battery, everything) and shipped it, priority mail, no tracking, $22-.  Got an e-mail from someone else, turned it over to a tech, who also e-mailed me for a return address.  Got it back in about a month.  Works great.Customer service on warranty Grade \"F\".  Technical service Grade \"A\".I think this is aiming a US brand at a foreign market, where a retailer customarily supports the phone.  If you buy it from an American dealer that doesn't brag about warranty service (and this review is going up on Amazon, so expect to save $200- over such an operation) you'll have to figure it out.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "really good phone", "Author": "Freddy Silva", "ReviewID": "R1KF07ZA2Z341C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It a very good phone, using it in Venezuela, so I would say YES it works perfectly...Yes, it's an international unlocked phone.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "mine supervisor this is your product", "Author": "Jorge Luis Barcasnegras \"BARCAS\"", "ReviewID": "R3JHT4YMRZ5I7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am working for one of the biggest mine coal in america. my job is 50-60% in the field.
