{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great voice quality. good phone. ok touch screen", "Author": "novice", "ReviewID": "RVW3LQ35SHL9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Many people have commented on the good quality of the sound of this phone. (which was the main reason I purchased it)Its size and keypad design are good for normal use. ( I have large hands and find it not difficult) I find myself searching for the 0 though, but I still like the design.The overall feel and design of the phone are very impressive. It doesnt look cheap.The camera is better than I expected (I wasnt expecting much).The touch screen is ok. It is a little tough to get used to. Initially I turned off the haptic feedback vibration in hopes to preserve battery, but I found that it helps with navigating the touch screen. Though the proximity sensor doesn't always work when making a call, so my ear will set off the screen and get a vibration sometimes.Battery life is pretty good (I charge maybe once a week with moderate use).I use this phone as pay-per-use, and for that I would say it is excellent.If you are expecting this to be a smartphone, you will be thoroughly disappointed.However, if you want a relatively cheap high quality unlocked phone to use as a 'phone', I would highly recommend this.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Oh how I've missed a Nokia phone!", "Author": "Dana B.", "ReviewID": "R2LSIKPNGB44LM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is WONDERFUL! I have missed Nokia! At&t; (especially where I live in central WI, USA) has not carried Nokia for a long while. This particular phone is European, even comes with a European wall charger - this fact would have been useful to know.  You can however buy an adapter or use the small USB port to charge it. You have to do some \"hacking\" to turn on your picture messaging and internet data - At&t; will more-than-likely not help you with this.  It took some google searching and lots of setting changes to get all the functions to properly work for this \"unlocked\" phone.  You will also notice European settings, word spellings are different, calendar format is different than the US, but most of these features are of course changeable.  Has great sound quality and radio feature. Battery life is about 3 days with my occasional usage. It lasts almost an entire day in the \"battery low\" feature - so I would say it has great battery life.  The internet searching can get messing sliding all around, but I was just glad when I could turn the internet feature on.All in all, this is a sturdy little phone. love the sleek slim design and small nature of the phone. Buttons require a firmer push to operate - but this may cut down on the butt dialing :) I am in love! Thanks Nokia!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so great", "Author": "joyqueen02", "ReviewID": "R3T8RIN1556O2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first Nokia broke when it vibrated off my kitchen counter but I had to replace it because I LOVE this phone. It survived several falls before that with ease, has a great camera and has both great touchscreen technology and buttons to push. The nice perk is that I can operate the touchscreen with my gloves on. I also like that I'm not locked into a data plan like with smartphones.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, not Great", "Author": "J.

Bayona", "ReviewID": "RAP4D064CU1F3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The quality of the phone sub-par. The screen was permanently scratched after being in my bag for two days. The phone periodically freezes so you have to take out the battery to restart it. The acoustics are very bad; it feels like someone's talking across the room. The camera is also pretty bad as well.I've used it for a few years. It's fast to type on and has an FM radio which is nice. Other than that, it's not very feature-rich, and I'm very close to buying another phone.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Thea", "ReviewID": "RSNY27W8W5Z80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son, who is throughly enjoying it.Works like a charm the first time I placed in my sim card.He loves the music most of all.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "frank", "ReviewID": "R2FOWQBWG1DM8L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "if I feel disappointed because you buy this product with great pleasure and I waited with eager, but then it came and I went to use my surprise is that the phone does not have a Spanish option, and therefore must change the solfware . so I suggest you send phone with Spanish, not to spend additional money.Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective phone", "Author": "Ellie", "ReviewID": "R2WXG69ZF2UE48", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just received the phone i ordered at first look i really like it.

And because I used Nokia before and this one was the only good looking cell phone that has a key pad (and WiFi, but thats not too important) I finally bought this one.I had a Nokia 6303i classic before and I would still prefer my old cell phone, but it had problem with the battery after a while and turned itself off for no reason.What you have to know about the X3-02:- Its pretty slim and small- They keys are good to write messages, what was the main thing why I need those keys- It has an interchangable memory card- You can use WiFi and download opera mini browser in the app store if you want- You can modify your start screen with a few things like showing your contact favorits, your calendar, notes, time, shortcuts to programs, but nothing special- I would say the call quality is pretty good, at least for me. Don't know how people hear me- It's nice that you have a little button on the side of your phone to lock your screen. If you want that nobody has access to your phone then, you need to apply your PIN code to the screen locker. There is no app that allows you just to draw a special pattern to unlock your phone.- I don't see that the battery lasts for too long. I hardly use it and it maybe lasts for a few days. But it's nice that the USB port and the port for charging battery and for speakers are all on the top of the cell phone and not on the bottom or the side- The Nokia ovi app store is propably the worst thing on this phone. Don't think just because it has a touchscreen that you can play games you could play on your Android. There is hardly any app for free in this app store. Sometimes it is also just a demo when you find something for free. And if it really is for free then you need Internet access everytime you want to play that game, because it shows a short ad everytime it starts- Also the rest of the phone's menu and style looks pretty much the same as it is with all Nokia phones. Pretty old style and hardly anything to modify (you can use your own ring and message tone), but therefore you have a phone that will be fast no matter what and can use WiFi", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia X3-02 cell phone", "Author": "Phillip G. Mullins", "ReviewID": "R1TXGWME99PCNZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The chargers are European with a US electrical adapter.  Unfortunately the one included with my phone did not work so I called for a replacement.  They responded however the replacement adapters consisting of two components fit so loosely that you have to put them in some sort of a self designed fixture to assure a good connection between the pieces and a successful charge.I asked for just a US charger but received the European adapters. Maybe Nokia does not offer this phone in the US and therefore no US charger??", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone but low voice volume.", "Author": "T.
