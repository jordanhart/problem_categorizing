This phone boasts some of my favorite necessities: 600 phone number storage capacity, GPS, and a color display, voice activation, and speaker phone.  I also enjoy the name specific ring tones and color flashes it comes standard with.I read through some of the feedback on this phone and was wanting to clarify some of the ignorance that is being stated.1)  The battery life is typical that of the other Nextel phones.  Not better and not worse.  Charge it every night and you'll be fine (and I talk 4000 minutes a month).  A Nextel phone uses more juice because the phones are setup to \"actively seek out a signal.\"  Other carrier's phones are programmed to sit in a dormant state until the signal \"comes to them.\"  I'm sure you can figure out these advantages on your own...2)  The games are decent at best that come with the phone.  What's important is that you can buy or \"obtain\" hundreds of games because the phone is java enabled.  A key thing to note is that Nextel's are buisness tools in nature.  Hence, you can note the focus of buisness tools on the phone.  If you're looking for some cheap play toy, you're looking at the wrong carrier.  If you're looking for a status symbol, read on...3)The \"No Alarm Clock\" feature that I've seen posted is not true.  Think outside the box.  The useful organizer/date book that is included in the phone is there for a reason.  Set an appointment in it for when you want to wake up...4)An account setup fee is typical.  A first month proration fee is also typical among cell companies.  Also, taxes are taxes--you pay the same high percentage no matter who you have.5)Coverage, it depends where you are located.  I'm guessing in the deserts of Arizona you'd have bad coverage.  However, of the 20 or so states I've visited, Nextel has had SUPER coverage.  Just recently I can vouch for about ever Vegas Casino ;D.  Oh, did I mention there is never roaming charges with any plan?6)If you have a tendancy to hit the Walkie Talkie button while it's on your side/in your purse, hit 'menu' then 'star' and lock lock the keypad.  Don't worry, it unlocks auto when someone calls.  Nuff said.7)There is a Vibe/Ring Feature.  Vibe 3 times then ring 3 times.8)The Sprint/Verizon Walkie Talkie's suck.  If you don't believe me try them.  Nextel uses 2 systems in their towers (a duplex and a simplex-one for voice one for 2way).  On a user end, a person 2waying from Florida to Hawaii will note instant connection.  Verizon/Sprint only have 1 system in their towers.  The way they 2way is using 'packets' from the cellular.  What is unavoidable is the packets having to go through the landline telephone network.  Put it this way, make a call and see how long it connects.  Umm, average 5.7 seconds (according to the studies I've read).  Now picture hitting a walkie talkie button and waiting 5.7 seconds for each response.  Again, nuff said.9)Telenav TRACK is incredible and DOES work.  Ask to get a demo and use it like I did.  It talks to you telling you where to turn and even recalcules directions on the fly if you miss an exit.  A+++Well, there was my 2 cents.  If you're curious as to how I know all this stuff, I'm an electrical engineer and like to know everything about the toys I buy...", "Date": "May 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Phone with just a few minor exceptions", "Author": "\"get2suzy\"", "ReviewID": "R3KUBBUX0SOLTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have previously owned a Nextel i550, i90 and an i95cl. I just upgraded to the new i730 mainly because of the size factor. Second, Nextel is phasing out the i90 and i95 so I like to make sure I am staying up with the technology as it expands. I use this phone a LOT, mostly for work, but also for personal use.  My only main issues with this phone are the battery life and the size of the screen. I was used to the huge screen of the i95, but I have to admit the color is MUCH better with the 64k color screen of the i730. Battery life seems to be an ongoing issue with Nextel phones, but with all this phone does, I guess it is to be expected. It is odd that Nextel finally switched the \"make call\" and \"end call\" button positions on this phone. My guess is that it was in an attempt to make their positions on the keypad standard with the other cell phones on the market. Before this phone, they were always backwards compared with other cell phones. I do miss the \"service indicator\" light, but it isn't a major issue. The buttons are set up a bit different than my previous Nextel phones, but like with anything else, you get used to it pretty quick. One thing Nextel got away from was the ability to use a home charger and car changer from the old phone, with the new one. They changed the ends so you cannot use the I90 or I95 powercords with the new i730. They do include a home charger with the phone, but be prepared to buy a new car charger when getting this phone.  I like the sleek feel of the case, the thinner profile, the color screen, the ability to (finally) assign ringtones to each caller and the GPS service. A nice touch is the cover that flips over the bottom of the phone where you insert the charger. It may seem a silly touch to most people, but I work outside for my job and I was always concerned with water or dirt getting into the phone and causing damage to the circuit board.  All in all, if you can afford to get this phone, BUY IT! Nextel service, like everyone elses, has their good and bad points but I will stay with them for the long haul. I have had Sprint, Verizon, Blackberry and still currently carry T-Mobile in addition to this Nextel. (only because my company is cheap with their anytime minute allocation! *lol*) If they turned Nextel service off tomorrow, I would immediately go back to a Nextel office to set it right back up! The direct connect feature is addicting and doesn't take away from your cellular minutes. Don't waste time with Verizon's pseudo direct connect. Go with the people that invented the technology...Nextel!

In the surrounding suburbs, it worked once about 30 miles north of Chicago, so I know it's not broken, unfortunately. TeleNav, the company that sells the GPS mapping service for Nextel phones, will charge you by the kilobyte, which is very mysterious, but comes out to about twenty-bucks a month, in addition to a \"total connect\" service that Nextel will need to add (for GPS to function), for another ten-bucks monthly. The kicker is when you figure out that your GPS hardly works at all, and you have already signed up for a year's Telenav service, TELENAV WON'T REFUND YOU A SINGLE DIME. \"Too bad for you\" it didn't work in YOUR area. The Nextel tech that I spoke to (in cancelling \"total connect\") said TeleNav told them that they should not gaurantee TeleNav to ever function. \"There are not enough satelllites at this time\". What a bunch of fargin iceholes.Otherwise, it must be stated that I do like Nextel service and the web browser is the best of it's kind. You'll never call info with a \"People-Finder\", equivalent to White Pages and also a \"Business-Finder\".

It's thin! Much improved over my old phone. Looks good, and feels light. And improvements in size and weight haven't been made at the expense of features. The color display is jaw-dropping, very bright and clear. And I love the GPS. I know this has practical benefits, and I appreciate that, but right now I like this feature because it's cool and fun. Did I really need the GPS satellites to locate my position on Earth while I was at lunch today? No, but I did it anyway, and my lunch-mates were impressed.One of the features the Nextel sales guy pushed was the fact that this phone has the latest Java technology. I haven't fully explored, but look forward to checking it out on my next flight. There are all sorts of productivity helpers and games to check out. And, this phone has \"airplane mode\" like my Blackberry, which lets you turn off the wireless part, while still being able to play games or run other java tools -- perfect for killing time while in-flight. Also on my list to do when I have a minute is to assign unique rings to a few people in my phone book -- that way I don't have to look at the screen to know if it's someone I need to talk to or not.I've owned this phone for less than a month, and love it. I've been happy with Nextel, after having been with other carriers, none of them have the combination of service and features that Nextel offers. Nextel's walkie-talkie service is amazing -- fast, clear, and, again, very cool. Great service, and now a great phone -- I'm definitely a happy customer. 5 stars for this one.", "Date": "November 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "i730", "Author": "BrOoKLyN BeLLa", "ReviewID": "R18K7SV97FJKKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the new i730 as a gift for Christmas, one of my many impulse wants :). LOL I have to say the phone is GREAT, I LOVE IT!!! It has many cool features, like GPS, assigned ringtones, light up front and much more. Another thing I noticed is that the speakers are a lot louder compared to the other phones. I also feel like I get better reception with this phone opposed to my i90. There's nothing really bad to say about this phone. If you are a nextel user I'm sure you can agree it is much better than the i90 and the i95. The only thing that I dislike is the way nextel runs business. I think it is ridiculous that they will not cut an existing user the same deal as they would a new user when purchasing the phone. Any other company you go to will honor the same price for an upgrade as they would for a new contract. Instead they think that they are giving you a deal by making you sign another 2 or 1 year contract, and you'll receieve the phone for $250-300 instead of $400 with no contract. It's just something you have to deal with if you want to upgrade the phone and stay with the service. Just something to prepare those who are thinking about signing up with Nextel.As for the service itself, it's pretty good, I never really had a problem with it except when in wooded areas. A plus to this service is also the nationwide direct connect. You can get chirped(walkie talkie) from someone a different state.

It has a ton of great features for those who are like me and love to fool around with all the extras on any electronic gizmo that I get my hands on.  I do have some getting used to as I was a 2nd generation Nokia user, but the fact that I can actually make a phone call on the i730 makes up for everything else it may lack.  Yeah, there are many other cell phones out there that have cameras, PDA's, MP3 players, portable game consoles and whatever else they want to throw in but what it all boils down to is whether you want a Digital camera with PDA functionality or a phone.  Me, I chose to have a phone because I don't want to pay $50+ a month so I can make calls in the corner of my house standing on one leg carrying a re-shaped wire clothes hanger just to get enough reception to make a phone call on a nifty game-console/mp3-player/pda/digicam/mediocre-phone.Bottom line, when you're done fooling around with all the latest \"toys\" that Nokia and everyone else is putting out there and are ready to actually make wireless phone calls again, the i730 is what you're looking for.", "Date": "January 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "The i730 RULES!", "Author": "Modbeat1964", "ReviewID": "R1MCC8787Q4FOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had 5 cell phones in the past 10 years, starting with the original MOTOROLA FLIP-PHONE.  Then I moved over to a NOKIA phone, which was okay, but I was not satisfied.  I moved over to the NEXTEL phone service for my next phone, which was the MOTOROLA i1000 and a couple of years later I bought the i90, which was the phone I have been using until I recently upgraded to the i730.  I have been with NEXTEL for the last 5 years and I am completely satisfied with their professionalism and outstanding service.  The trade-in/buy-back program is wonderful and it definitely the best way to upgrade your phone.  NOW........on to the i730.......WOW..........what an awesome phone!!!!!!!!!  I can't begin to tell you that NEXTEL offers the best MOTOROLA phones then any other carrier.  I have looked at other phones from other carriers and none compare to the i730.  If this is your 1st MOTOROLA phone purchase, you are in for a real treat.  The instructions are well-documented and it doesn't take rocket-science to navigate through the i730 software.  The biggest treat for me is the COLOR screen, the sleek-ness of the phone and it's overall aesthetic beauty.  So if want to be the envy of all your friends, please do yourself a favor and pick up this phone.  Also, once you experience the NEXTEL service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.

So far I love it almost as much as my old i90.The design itself is excellent, very sleek looking. It's alot easier to \"personalize\" this phone because you can replace the little front cover thing for fairly cheap (I changed mine to a NY Yankees symbol for only $5) instead of changing the whole case, which you can also do. You can change the background, get real songs as ringtones, etc. I also love the mucical light around the front speaker (wish it played with actual song ringtones instead of just normal musical ringtones). The only complaint I have is that it can be exetremely loud when it rings, even on a lower setting.My reception is fairly good with this phone, not as good as my i90 but much better than my old Nokia. I have heard that you can get a patch for the i730 that helps with the reception. The only times I don't have good reception is in some of the classrooms at my school and in the back rooms of my dorm (all of which are 2/3 concrete). I also don't get much signal out in the boonies but that's to be expected.The software on it is great. You have more than enough space for all your contacts, 600 or so. All the programs are great, the calculator is as quick anymore, you actually have to select what you want to do (+,-,*,/) instead of using the scroll buttons, but that's superficial. You also don't get any full games, only demos but I don't think your going to buy a phone based on the games you get.The battery life is the only real problem I have with the phone. I can only go for about 2 days without charging and that's if I don't make any calls or use it at all. The charging is really fast though, usually under 2 hours for me. The only other complaint is that the call buttons are reversed from the i90's so that took a little getting used too.Sorry if this is long but I think its a good phone in general. The only reason it got 4 out of 5 from me is the reception and the battery issues. Hope this helps.", "Date": "October 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "This phone rocks.", "Author": "Adam D.

It's great; perfect coverage and the phone is worth whatever you pay for it.  It's less than my first Startac ($399 vs $499) and I am very happy with my Nextel Service (much more clear than Sprint).  A definate recommend for those who require a quality phone rather than something made by Samsung, LG, or Sanyo.  If I could change one thing it would be the battery life, if I forget to charge it at night and I am talking quite a bit I may get a low battery the next day.

I bought the phone from Amazon and it works great.  The My-Cast service is great, although a little bit more expensive, but provides GREAT weather including full motion color radar for people on the go.  The GPS works great.  Tele-nav has a free compass feature, and if you want maps and full spoken driving directions they offer that for a little bit more cash.  To the person who said no text messaging? That is a service issue and not a phone issue.  I guarantee this (and every other nextel phone I've used) is THE BEST for text messaging.  It just depends on the type of online service you get.  If you get the messaging package, it's $10 a month which gives you unlimited AIM, and unlimited text messages (to and from).  I use the text messages mainly for forwarding important emails to my phone, in addition nextel also offers Mobile Email which allows you to connect to other mailboxes.  As a third option there are java applets that let you browse any page, including SSL pages, and let you connect to any email server, IMAP, POP, etc... but those require a \"total connect\" (which allows java applets to use the internet) plan.If you like games, the best I've found for this phone are Tetris Deluxe and Pitfall (yes, the same one I played on my atari 2600, full sounds and all).In short this phone does everything you need and probably a whole bunch you don't.

Im", "ReviewID": "R3UPSK9XIZMGWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know why so many reviewers here are complaining about the Nextel service, when in fact, service bars hardly vary from phone to phone. I've had my i730 from when it first came out and it was my first Nextel phone but I've switched my SIM card into other Nextel phones (a convenient feature of Motorola cells) and didn't see much of a significant difference in service. And granted, there might be a geographical difference in the overal Nextel service, but where I am in the city, I hardly have any complaints with either the call service or the Direct Connect availability.Onto the phone itself. It comes with a pretty durable looking steel cover and although I switched my faceplates almost immediately for a white cover (the plain silver was a little blah for me), I was never really too disappointed with its look and feel. The front screen is only a one-liner, but shows all the necessary information - time, service bars, date, and battery life. There are the standard Push-to-talk and volume buttons on the side and two buttons on the top of the mobile which can be used to make a call through speakerphone without flipping the phone open. It's a nice feature, though I haven't really used it too much.Perhaps what's most distinctive of the i730 out of all the other Nextel models is what they call the disco light, which is a circular light-up feature that flashes different colors according to whatever ringtone you use. It's nice to look at and would be more attention-getting, were it not for the fact that so many people have the phone, making it somewhat played out.Overall, the phone has decent battery life and I admit, I've been impressed at how sturdy it's been. I'm a pretty clumsy person and any phone I have tends to be put through some rough conditions (for instance, accidentally stomping on my phone with boots - don't ask), but the i730 has lived up to it pretty bravely. There are a few cons to it though. Depending on how heavy a talker you are, the battery life isn't so great. I have the 1000 minutes a month plan, which allows me to talk for a long enough time but my battery life usually can't survive the hours of talking I can do sometimes. Because I'm on the heavy-user side, though, I'm sure this won't be a problem for the average talker.Another downside I've found with both my phone and others who have bought the i730 is that the paint on the sides of the screen inside the phone will eventually wear and scratch away, leaving some unglamarous spots where you can see what lies underneath. It's probably a cheap paint job on the part of Nextel, but it's nothing a nice makeover can't fix. The i730 is pretty customizable because it's so heavily purchased, and you'll find a lot of places that sell and install whole new housings for you.Since Nextel has been coming out with a whole range of newer and shinier phones, I have recently decided to upgrade to the brand new i870 which just came out but the i730 has served me well.

Looking at the front, you will first you notice the motorola emblem, which lights up like a disco light when you assign musical ringtones to it.  I would have preferred a status light instead.  The front LCD display can be perfectly seen and isnt too small or too large.  When you open the phone, you notice how much more sleeker it is than nextels last flagship phone, the i95.  It weighs a mere few ounces and feels great to carry around.  The 65k lcd display delivers crisp color and is very bright.  I wish it was bigger though.  The keypad is backlighted with a sensor and a very nice blue hue which is pleasant to view at night.  The button arrangement is good, no problems here.  The back of the phone has the speaker on it.  People find it annoying that the speaker is located in the back but I understand why Motorola did it.  Now I can finally hear my phone ring when it's on my clip!  On the side of the phone you have the usual PTT buttons which are black and a black antenna.  The phone can hold upto 600 contacts, which is more than enough for anyone.

Rarely have had to go to a 2nd battery in the same day.Physically it has tremendous appeal.  I think it is really sharp. Operationally, it has a lot of terrific features and is easy to use.

I used an i1000 for 5 years and had to trade in a damaged phone or two but had superior service as far as connections go.  This phone drops call, fades in and out, more dead spots and rough direct connect spots.Also, structurually, this phone is more fragile.

I will probably have to trade it in soon.In April, my 3rd or 4th i1000 cratered again and the Nextel rep I use felt that I would have to upgrade that phone because I had been traded a re-built i1000 just a few months earlier. Since the i1000 was out of production, even the re-builts would not survive much longer.So, after 5 months' use, while I love the genius of this phone, the look and feel, etc. I would have to rate it a 3 star for reliability and durability.Our Nextel rep is good technically with the phones, but the floor people are not real familiar with what to recommend to people so I hope you can pass this along and maybe find out if Motorola has a Nextel phone that might address the problems I am experiencing with it.Thank you for your time.Bonnie Black (Virginia B.)Multimillion Dollar Producer with Re/max at the Beach in Calabash, NC", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Still room for improvement", "Author": "T.

First is the poor battery life that other reviewers have mentioned. Even when I haven't made any calls, it still drains about fifty percent daily. Secondly, it doesn't seem to be as well made and as sturdy as my old Samsung 850 phone. For the price, Motorola should have a product that is not so flimsy.But that being said, I still like the phone. The display is bright and clear; and it performs better than my previous phone. So if you're considering buying one, make sure you buy a spare battery and extra battery charger. You'll need it. And if you need a phone that can take abuse, I would look at the i530 with the rubberized exterior.

The i90c was a fine phone, a bit bulky and the batter life was terrible (even with an upgraded 750mAh battery), but it's incredible call clarity and loud speakerphone was enough to make me overlook its shortcomings.  So, I figured the i730 would only be better than i90c, right?  Not necessarily.My biggest complaint with the i90c was battery life, and sadly, Motorola still hasn't solved the problem.  The i730 is a slight improvement, but if you use the phone a lot like I do, be prepared with car chargers and backup batteries.  The i90c was also bulky as it had a hump on the back to accomodate the battery.  While the 730 is sleek (no hump), it still is essentially the same size and thickness as the i90.  Weight is nearly identical.  Call clarity with the i730 is comparable to the i90c, which is good.Speakerphone, here's my biggest complaint.  With the i730, Motorola moved the speakerphone to the back of the phone (it faced the front on the i90c).  This makes no sense to me.  Others have said they like this design because they can hear people when the phone is clipped to their belt, but when I use the speakerphone, I generally place the phone down on a surface.  As a result, the sound is muffled coming from the speakerphone.Another complaint is the location of the buttons.  First, the power button is nestled between other important buttons and is not easily found in the dark (unlike the i90c).  Call and end buttons are also reversed from the i90c.  While I'm sure with enough use I'll get familiar with the location, the reversal of buttons from the 90/95 models has me frustrated.There are good things I like about the i730, such as the flip activation control, which allows me to place a call on speakerphone and close the phone without disconnecting.  I also like the clean appearance (silver), and the blue backlight makes using it at night easy.  In sum, it's a decent phone, but coming from the i90c, I expected better considering the hefty price tag.", "Date": "November 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "excellent nextel phone", "Author": "Athynz \"athynz\"", "ReviewID": "R6LQK1A17P8OF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are in the market for a nextel, this is the one to get - it has just about everything.

I like the service, but inability to roam can be bothersome when traveling. For emergencies, I remedied this with a tracfone(.com) and just buy a 1 year card each year.Now, for the phone....It's got close to as sensitive reception as my old i1000 plus, which had AWESOME reception. The speakerphone on this model is EXCELLENT, definitely an improvement over the other Nextel models. Battery life is STILL on the \"fairly horrible\" end of things...charge it every night or you'll run out in the middle of your workday on the 2nd day, especially if you use data features a lot like I do. Luckily, recharge time is VERY quick (under 2 hours with mine) with included rapid charger.As a delivery driver in Michigan, I'm out in all types of weather, no problems yet with this phone, but I wouldn't suggest using in a downpour! (Nextel does have models specifically for those types of conditions...)The screen tends to be too dim to read in bright, direct sunlight, and the light \"sensor\" seems to add to the problem. A non-reflective coating would have been nice on the display. Very useful 600 entry contact list, which can store ALL of a contact's info (home#, work#, cell#, fax#, email, etc.) Phone has a handy notepad and will take vocal notes, also. Calculator, games, etc are included on phone. Wish it had an alarm clock (if it does, I haven't found it yet..I'll keep looking) for those long drives. The little disco light is kind of funny, too (almost a disco party in your pocket!).Interface is maddening to get used to, if only because it's similar enough to the i1000+ (which I had for three years) that it can get confusing, as it's not the same. Color display is sharp. All volume levels can be set from whisper quiet to LOUD LOUD!Minor gripe: waaay too easy to hit the direct connect button in its holster...make sure you've switched \"one touch direct connect\" OFF if you're moving around a lot, and once you've finished using DC, hit the STOP button (on top in the middle) to get it back to phone-mode, or you'll have to be apologizing all the time for accidentally two-waying somebody!EXTREMELY handy is the \"profiles\", which allow individual volume, behavior and wallpaper settings for different situations, i.e., \"Truck\" \"Work\" \"Meeting\" \"Movie\" or what have you.All in all, a very good phone, especially with all the customization you're able to do with the feature settings.ADDENDUM: another minor gripe: the \"stop\" button in the center top position of the phone is too easy to bump when removing the phone from its holster-I've accidentally ended several incoming calls this way.**********NOTE: instead of always buying a new car charger for your latest, greatest cell phone and adapters for your newest laptop, simply buy a power inverter which plugs straight into your vehicle's cigarette lighter. Make sure it has a built-in surge protector. Voila! Vehicular power utilizing your \"home\" charger (cell) or plug (laptop). The best plug directly into the cigarette lighter socket without a cord (the units can get hot, a cord can allow the unit to move all over in the car.) Can power many other things, too...can't find one labeled \"surge protector\" on amazon, but BB sells them.", "Date": "February 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Poor User Interface and High Electronic Interference", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IWME3NRCP8S3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I've had my new I730 for a month or so now, and here's the GOOD and the BAD about this phone.The Good1. Best of the Nextel phones.  A lot of Nextel's phones are clunky and have bad form factors.2. Backgrounds.  There are a number of appealing backgrounds such as a sailboat and sunflower that are quite nice.3. This phone is tough and feels well-constructed.  I feel like I could drop it on cement and nothing would happen.4. Speaker-phone.  The speaker-phone is loud and clear.  Direct Connect (Push to Talk) is great too.The Bad1. Poor user-interface.  Motorola has a long way to go before they can match up to the usability of Nokia's.  Also, the icons are small, poorly drawn, and have no labels until highlighted so you can't quickly scroll to the needed icon.  So, you waste time trying to get to what you need to use.2. Doesn't recognize shortened numbers with Caller ID.  My previous phones would recognize numbers even if they had missing area codes or, a calling card sequence before it, but this phone cannot do this.  The solution to this is to record all number combinations under the same name, but this is tedious.3. Limited ringtones.  Motorola really needed to put in some better sounding ones in their phones.  Just because you can dowload more doesn't mean that they shouldn't have done a better job of the initial ones.  They sound just plain horrible.4. Small screen.  I think I was spoiled because my previous cell phone had a large screen and clear fonts.  This Motorola has a tiny screen.  Granted, other cell phones also have small screens, but the phone doesn't make use of the full potential viewable screen space on the front part of the flip.5. Lots of interference.  When I use the phone in front of my computer.  The screen begins to get all flickery and the speakers begin to do strange drumbeat sounds.  I wouldn't be surprised if this phone has higher radiation than other phones.  My previous cell phones never did this.

I have been told people have been trying to call me all day but my phone hasnt rang.(mind u I have full signal strength during this time)I then would take my Verizon phone, and with my nextel sitting right by me, call my nextel and the darn phone didnt even ring.And then I would get many, many dropped calls becuase I didnt have the signal strength. I am constantly getting a call failed error message that says 341 or something, (whatever that means) And when I tried to use my call switch, to go from one call to another the phone wouldnt let me switch in between calls or go back to the first line call. Again, there goes that error message again.  Very frustrating!!! And I like to see how long I have been on a call sometimes, and with the i730, you cannot do that (at least I have been told by technical support that u cant) i know thats a pretty small complaint, but hey sometimes its the little stuff that counts. Now mind u I have switched this particular model phone out 3 times and I still am experiencing the same problems.**Note, I have found that if u power your phone off and wait about 5 minutes or so and then turn it back on, you may start to be able to get calls again or make calls if u were having those problems.As far as battery life, not really a problem for me since I charge my phone every night anyway. I mean I talk, when the phone works, very much and as long as i cahrge it at night, I dont even have a need for the car charger.The only reason i gave this phone 1 star is because the design is fine and as far as the options, those are ok to. I wish u could download better ringtones, the ones i downloaded suck. They dont even sound like the real music from the songs. But thats more Nextel and not the actual phone.

The phone comes with four demo games, and an awesome calculator.  Also for an extra $10.00/month you receive unlimited text messaging, website access, and AIM.  Web access is great for situations when you need to know the weather, movie times, news, or even if you just like to chat through messaging.The design of the i730 is very unique.  I think the i730 is Nextel's best looking phone.  There is a very modern look to this phone.  When you receive an incoming call the circle around the speaker will flash different colors such as red and blue.  The i730 has a full clear color screen with different wall papers you can chose from, or if there isn't any you like you can download one off of Nextel's website or from your phone.I get excellent reception with my Nextel.  I travel all over the Michigan area and haven't had any problems with reception, I always have a connection.  My battery life is also very good.  I always have my phone on and I can go about three days without charging my battery.  Although, when I do have to charge I can get a full battery in less than two hours.I strongly recommend this phone whether you're using the i730 for business or personal use.  Nextel also offers really great rate plans.  With the plan I have I get 1000 whenever minutes, unlimited direct connect, and free nights (after 9 p.m.) and weekends for $55.99 which I think is a really good deal.  Again, if you're looking for a durable nice phone with all of the features you need chose Nextel's i730.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "nextel updates for i730", "Author": "Weirdo", "ReviewID": "R3TRN0II1QZU1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live around Jacksonville, FL.  I get about the same coverage i got when i had at&t.;  I've had my i730 since April of this year.  I used to have a lot of problems with the phone dropping calls, but over the past couple of months, it has improved substantially.I would recommend to everyone to go to nextel.com, type in gps in the search area on the homepage, and see if your phone meets the criteria for a software upgrade.  Through this, you can also get motorola to send you a free data cable.  I took my phone to the nextel service center and not only did they put the new software on it, they also placed a grounding disc inside the phone.  Although, i get a little more feedback, the speaker is louder, and my reception has improved.  GOing to work out in the boondocks at Raiford, I used to have three or so dead spots, but now i only have one.  also, with the new software, the i730 is now capable of ringing and vibrating at the same time.  i found that out on accident playing with the ring tones.for the people out there that complain about having to sign a one or two year service contract, keep in mind that the companies are in business to make a profit.  if you don't like signing a contract, get a pay per use cell phone.also, you can use telenav for free, w/o it giving you directions.  just unzip it (it should already be on your phone) and just use the basic compass.  It will tell you how fast you are driving, where you are, and what direction you are going.  it was also tell you how many satellites you are using too.I also enjoy paying only $3.50 to access about 80+ sites on the wireless internet on this phone.  that is unlimited access.  My friend has Mmode, and he has to pay per kb used.  Also, i pay $59.99 for unlimited incoming calls, and 400 anytime minutes.  that is a lot cheaper than when i had at & t and they charged me a lot for going over my minutes.  So, to sum it up, it's easier to pay ten dollars, for the free incoming than it is to pay one hundred dollars going over your minutes paying for incoming and outgoing calls.", "Date": "October 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Quality", "Author": "Dtho", "ReviewID": "R2B26ZDMZDABG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.

The speaker is real loud-much louder than my boyfriends i95cl, and I can honestly say the earpiece has better reception (RF). Also the telenav feature is a very nice touch,I recently moved to Seattle and its helped me out tremendously.

I have had the phone for about two weeks now.  As a concerned buyer I was a little leery about purchasing a phone online, but I could not be happier with my new phone.  I have had many phones in my short life span of 18 years, and let me tell you I know a good phone when I see one.  I usually do not buy phones that are made by the Motorola company, but this one is different.  This phone will fit the needs of all consumers  no matter what they need it for.  It is one of the best out there in terms of style, features and ease of use.  When I first took the phone out of it's packaging I could not help but to take a double look at its sharp, glossy, and  silver appearance.  As my fingers grazed the slender surface of the phone my eyes went in for a closer examination.  I first turned the phone on its side where I immediately noticed the slim design, which is a step up from the bulkier i95cl phone.  My fingers then slid over the buttons on the side and top of the phone, which are standard for all Nextel phones.  Once I reached the bottom of the phone I saw a flip, which I opened only to see more unique designs.  I first noticed the crystal clear color screen once the flip was opened.  I then slid my fingers down the sides of the screen to where all the buttons were held.  I then mentally noted the beautiful blue illuminating glow of the key pad, which will turn any head at night.  The buttons on the i730 are ordered very simplistically.  All the important buttons can be accessed at the top of the key pad in an oval shape, while the simple ones only used to dial numbers are below.  The positioning of these buttons are essential for all good phones.  A phones set up can be one of the most important selling point of it.  The same applies for the i730.  I know when I personally search for a phone I not only buy for style, but also for overall set up and ease of the phone.  I personally believe that the set up of  buttons on a phone are a very important part to any phone.  Whenever I'm driving in my car I know for a fact that I do not look down and find the button before I press it, but rather I usually find it through feel and general knowledge of where the button is located.  Especially if I'm driving on the expressway where one false glance away from the road can cause a fatal accident.  For this reason I shop for phones where the buttons are easy to find and push, such as the i730.  When I get a call on the expressway all I do is open the flip and push the talk button, which is very easily accessible right on the upper left hand side of the phone.  I'm sure a lot of people with cell phones go about finding buttons the same way as I do while driving.  So naturally it helps to have important buttons such as Talk, End, Menu and the power button in a central location in an attempt to minimize the search for a button through touch.  The i730 is a big step up from its predecessor the i90c in terms of features and overall style.  The i90c is a good phone, but it had issues that needed to be improved.  When the i90c is on the belt clip the sound gets muffled and is hard to hear.  The i730 improved on this problem by creating a not only a speaker on the front of the phone, but one on the back as well, so that the sound will no longer be muffled.  The speaker on the front of the phone even has a hole so the customer is able to talk to another person, while the clip is still attached to the phone.  That is what I call convenience.  The i90c also had a very common outside color too it, while the i730 has a new glossy silver coat.  By far the biggest difference between these two phones is not the color or the placement of the speakers it is the vast features.  The i730 is Nextel's first phone with the amazing Global Positioning System or (GPS).  This system uses satellites orbiting the Earth to determine the approximate geographical location of the phone.  To some this may be a very high tech and pointless feature, but it is actually very easy to use and if a person travels a lot it could really come in handy if they get lost.  The phone book of the i90c is a mere 250 capacity, while the i730 holds up too 600 entries!  The i730 also has  flip activation, which means you can answer a call when the flip goes up.  The ability is also there to shut off flip activation so you can call someone and close the flip without disconnecting the call.  The feature I like the most that the i90c did not have is the voice activated dialing.  This can really come in handy when driving and not being able to select the person from the phone book.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone.  It is not only one of the newest out there it is one of the best out there.  It is one of the most well rounded phones and so far it has worked perfectly for me and I'm sure that it will do the same for you!", "Date": "December 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nextel call quality is tops", "Author": "eee", "ReviewID": "ROQQQ8JVQEZ0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nextel and Motorola have developed the ultimate \"ultra cool, super sleek,great phone w/the i730.

The speaker turns off, you hold the phone to your ear, you scroll to the name of the bud you wish to contact, you push the button to talk and release it to listen and NO ONE has to hear your fast Direct Connect conversation.

The buttons are a bit recessed, but I haven't found that to be a problem. I've seen complaints about getting the battery cover on/off, and plugging it in to the charger - I've had no problems.As for the GPS, even professional units (I do this as part of my job) do not always get a good signal, cannot work from inside, and sometimes take a half an hour for the satellites to be high enough in the horizon to be of use. It changes day to day - there's a website you can go to that will tell you when the best PDOP (good satellite coverage) will be. The more satellites there are, the more accurate your locations will be.My only complaint was that the day after I bought my phone, a tower was down, which meant I wasn't able to make any calls for a couple of days. Very frustrating, but it was over a holiday weekend (I called on the Saturday before Labor Day), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.All in all, I've been happy with the purchase so far - it's NOT that heavy, the battery lasts 2-3 times longer than my old phone...

Everything from making phone calls, to sending a text message, to checking the sports scores or weather, is run from a Java program. This means that sending of commands from the buttons to the application is extremely delayed. This delay only gets worse as the day goes on, and I am usually forced to restart the phone 2 or 3 times a day.The phone constantly freezes when I am writing a text message or email, and the only way to fix this is to pull the battery out. I have tried all of the master reset and browser restart processes, and I have even had my SIM card changed out from Nextel. Still I have trouble just switching between two calls, because of the delay of the buttons.At least 3 times a day, a call is mysteriously canceled by my phone. Normally when a call is dropped I will get a randomly generated error message, i.e. A56 try again, C885 call failed, R23 Service unavailable. However, on the mysterious canceled calls, my phone just returns to the status screen as if I had terminated the call. This happens with calls to other Nextel customers, many other cellular carriers, and land line calls. The phone does not lose service, as I have watched the service status remain constant at 3/5 bars when a call is canceled by the phone.There are 3 different types of i730 handset, which can be seen on [...] The t model that I have does not have any available updates for the firmware or software of the phone. The software my phone is running is dated back in January of 2002. So there have been no updates or improvements for the phone from the first day they manufactured it.The problems I have had with this phone occur indoors and outdoors, with full signal or less than half signal. There is no geographical constant, as I have had every one of these problems at home, at work, at friends houses, or on the road. Other users I know on the Nextel network chose this phone and have had similar problems with dropped calls and the phone freezing when using the web utilities.The only good feature about this phone is I can plug it into my computer and create my own ring tones from any audio file I have.

Sure its about time they make a phone with a color screen to keep up with everyone else, and the new features are handy. But tell me.... What use are they if you cannot use the phone???? Every other call is a dropped call. And its annoying and embarrassing especially if you take business calls on them. Within about 8 months I went through about 9 phones. Their service department is pretty cool and is aware of the issue so they gave me no problems switching out the phone, they just never had any in stock! For those out there that are experiencing dropped calls, take it into a service center and let them put in a internal antenna they had to make for these units. It does help a little, any less dropped calls is an improvement.The Worst parts are of the phone:Is never having a signal, I can't even use the phone in my house anymore! Not at work and I am on the 15th floor, I have to stand on 1 baby toe to get 3 bars.The speaker phone blows out. When you download ring tones, they are too loud even on the lowest volume level. And when you use the speaker, it cuts in and out.Each time you download something, since the phones are so crappie, you have to keep getting replacements. They don't save your ring tones or anything you downloaded from IDEN. SO now I am just out of luck on the money I have spent on the past. Although they don't use IDEN anymore, I still was cheated!!The screen gets jammed sometimes. Very rare but true. I have to close the flip and re-open it.How about the phone just cuts itself off. Power Zero! Battery fully charged. Do warning or nothing.It ruins the Jarba earbuds. I have had to buy 2 of them because whatever is the problem, when you plug in the ear piece, it zaps it and the earpiece will no longer work. And you can't return those! So you are just our of $40+They refuse to recall the phone. The customer service reps, the service centers,managers, you name it from Nextel themselves has said they phone is \"No Good\" that \"Everyone is having the same problem\" and there is nothing they can do. When I disconnected my service the department that handles that offered to take $150 off the price for the i830 but I heard the reception on those were worse.Customer service doesn't know what the error codes are. If you call and report back to back dropped calls and tell them the code... They don't even have the reference guides to tell you what the code means.Oh and be careful when you change your package!! If you Upgrade or Downgrade it signs you up for another year to your contract. Don't do it. Stay where you are so you can get out.One positive thing I will say is that the rate plans are good depending on how much you use your phone and even though customer service is terrible, they don't say no. You just have to be patient over and over again until they fix it. Also be prepared to call at least 3 times back to back to make sure they handle the issue, that they did make the adjustment/credit. Each representative will tell you something different I promise you. They don't know the system, they don't notate accounts properly, and their knowledge is very minimal. I want a Pro on the phone I can look in the users guide myself. So get yourself a good book and prepare to wait.Myself, I have left Nextel for good. I was looking into Sprint but now since they merged.... I am sticking to plan A to the Verizon Wireless.

No real need in the phone being that large-Small screen compared with most of todays phones-Must go online for text messaging-Metal piece covering ear speaker falls off constantly-Poor reception inside any building and around tall structures-From time to time the phone will randomly shut itself off.

To be honest the phone is a easy phone to get attached to. But recently i upgrade to the i850 and iam very very happy i did. The i730 is a phone / radio. The color screen is on par with all other free phones that are usually FREE. So basicly the screen is not impressive at all. The phone comes with features, but to be honest it took me about 2 months to figure out how to use all of them on,( NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL) and by that time i had lost faith in the phone itself. It's heavy, very heavy, and thick. On the good side, it' sorta stylish and its very durable, this is what i loved about it. I dropped the phone so many times and it has very little exterior damage. I look at this phone like, a army tank, versus my newer i850 which i just upgraded to, and thats more like a convertable BMW. The i850 is a phone that you just have to have a leather case on it, because it looks so good, that you dont wanna risk it gettings scratched, this on the other hand, there's no need to case it, because the exterior is that solid. I'm a 23 year old male out of atlanta ga. As far as reception, the calls on the i730 are very clear, the speaker phone is awesome, you can almost set the phone in one room and talk at a leisure tone on the other side of the room and the caller will hear you fine, which is cool. But to be honest i can only say this phone would fit someone who is not looking for alot bells and whistles, Not a person between the ages of 16-21, bad idea. This phone is for people who want a phone that can handle just about anything, ie construction worker. Another good thing about this phone is it'is nearly impossible to lose, due to its weight. When you have the i730 on the hip swivle thing, it feels like you've got a gun on ur hip, or a flash light, its that heavy. Plus with it being 2006 and all, this phone is getting very dated, by the end of the year this phone is going to be classified as a dinosaur. If you can get it for free, go for it, but if your paying money, trust me, dish out a few extra bucks and go with the i850, the i850 is the honest to god best cell phone ive ever owned, and ive had 15+ cells.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nextel i730 - Great Phone", "Author": "ALH", "ReviewID": "R2CXZ487XVM22V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone.

Buttons had fallen off of two of them, and the third one had a defective screen.  After gettign a run around from Nextel about the warranty on the phones, we decided to just deal with half operable phones until our contract expired.  Just for your information, if you buy a Nextel phone and it breaks, they won't do much to help you.  They told me I should mail the phone back to Motorola and they would repair it and mail it back within 10 business days.  Notice that Nextel offered me no replacement phone, so I would be phoneless for 10 days.  Also, they said the only way they would repair it was if I purchased their service plan for 5.99 a month.  Just on principle I refused.  They sold me a defective product, just as they had two of my friends, and then wanted me to pay them money to make the product good.I will never own another Nextel product, and I would strongly advise any of you who are thinking about purchasing it not to.

I used an analog phone at the time and then switched to PrimeCo (before they became Verizon Wirless) and then SprintPCS. Up to that point I had no complaints about phones -- some had a better UI than others, but they pretty much did the same thing.I then switched to Voicestrea(before they became T-Mobile!) because I needed the international roaming feature, and they had the best rates on the market, and I could use the same handset, wereas with the CDMA providers I would have to pay for an additional service. This is were my cell-phone fun began. T-Mobile service was not bad at all, but I don't think that in the 2 or 3 years I was with them I was ever satisfied with my phone -- the volume was too low, the speakerphone was a joke, the phone was too big, reception was horrible, it kept on dying, etc, etc.I then switched to Nextel because I was tired of the billing errors involved with handsent replaments (out of warranty fees -- when the phone wasn't even 3 months old, re-stocking fees for phones I \"didnt return\" according to T-Mobile, etc, etc). I have been using this phone since late October or early November 2004 and I am glad to say I have had no major problems. The reception is great no matter where I go (I travel incredible distances in the state of Florida alone -- 15,000 miles since January, and that's just by car), the speaker and speakerphone are loud enough, and the phone is a decent size. In addition I can take the SIM card out of the i730 and place it in my GSM world phone for my trips to Europe, although the Nextel rates are a bit higher, they are about the same as what AT&T; used to charge, and what Cingular charges today.Another great feature on this phone (and all the Nextel Java-enabled phones if I am not mistaken) is the navigation function provided by TeleNav. Not only can it tell me how to get to point B, it also has a business finder, based on my current location as determined by the GPS reciever that is built into the phone, but it even has a handy \"Gas by Price\" function, although it only can sort the listing by lowest prices on regular or 87 octane gas, which I cannot use in my vehicle, it will display the prices for premium or 93/91 octane gas as well.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not as Bad As You Read!!", "Author": "Leigh E.

The customer service, although not the fastest is very efficient and open until 1am EST.As for the i730, this phone was recommended to me by numerous friends/coworkers who own it when the antenna broke on my i60, after three years of use with little problems.

The ringtones/wallpapers are easy to download from Nextel.com, although I wish Nextel offered more options.Most of the complaints I read regarding this phone seem to be from people who are either too clueless, too into having a trendy phone, or too into the tech stuff and need their cell to mimic their home PC.  My only complaint is that sometimes I hear myself echo through the earpiece even when I have full signal, but this occurs so rarely that it doesn't really annoy me.

Nextel has been GREAT!!! Just before Nextel, I was with Alltell. Their customer service at the local level was HORRID to put it mildly! It was so terrible, that I paid the $200.00 early termination fee after only 6 months. In a two year agreement, I would have paid out more than $1800.00 over the next 18 months for customer service that was frankly non-existent. You do the math. The carriers count on you not switching until your contract expires, but do not let them railroad you into believing that you have no choice but to \"take what they give you\"!With that said, on to the phone. I initiated service with Nextel over a year ago. I wanted the i95cl, but was told that it was discontinued and that the i730 had replaced it.At first glance and with little knowledge, it seemed to make sense. It's smaller, shinier, has more capacity with respect to contacts (600 instead of 250) and Java apps, it can hold longer names, has more screen resolution, and I could go on. BUT, after only two weeks to a month of use, other people began asking me to repeat myself while on the phone with me. They would tell me that I was \"breaking up\" while I was talking. Although I could hear them fine most of the time, this was almost always the case for the other party. Then, I began to notice that my signal strength was almost never constant, but often fluctuated - even standing still in the same spot. I took it in to service centers for software and firmware updates, I had microphones replaced, the unit replaced, etc., but to no availle. Nothing really ever solved the problem. There were also some quirks with the internet.I would also like to mention that the battery didn't last a full day on most days. In all fairness though, I do contracting and maintenance work and I do talk alot, but my  Motorloa v60 with Suncom lasted two(2) full days with the same amount of talking.Finally one day about 2-3 months ago, an associate gave me an i90 that he no longer wanted. He had purchased an i830 and had no use for the i90. I was told that the i90's and i95's were the \"work horses\" before they were pulled, so I decided to use th i90 instead of the i730. IT WORKED!!!! I had absolutely NONE of the problems that I had with the i730!! Of course, like any cell phone, there are a few problems here and there, but they are ABSOLUTELY MINIMAL compared to the i730.So began my journey for the i95cl. After some trial and error I quickly became an expert on ebay. I now have four (4) i95's in almost new condition. Two of these I traded my i730 for. With the exception of a few features and size, the i95cl is everything the i730 is and more. I still get the web, check the news, email, etc. with no problems at all.For the average consumer wanting Nextel, the i730 is packed with everything you could ask for - without being a camera phone.

The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.

Very annoying...Initial Setup: This is where it started getting awkward. I charged both phones overnight and unplugged both of them next morning. They were both fully charged. During the charge, they display \"Device Attached\" sign. When it was first turned on, searched for the service but since they were not activated, couldn't find the service but dismissing the tab shaped logo covering entire display took some effort to figure out to be able to change settings etc.One of the phones completely drained in less than six hours with no use what so ever. I plugged in to recharge but phone starting it's funky light dance and finally after several plug/unplugs recognized the charger. Called the tech support, they said it was faulty. In order to get the replacement, I had to be charged for the replacement, call the finance office of Nextel to dispute the charge once I send in the non-working one. Otherwise it takes two months credit to be given back to my account. That's more than annoying!!!Then next day, when I was ready to activate my wife's phone (once she came back from out of town), I discovered that that phone went crazy as well. Dancing lights and turnig on/off by itself and finally \"Incompatible device\" sign for the charger.That was it for me. I decided to return both and be over with it. It is going to be a painfull experience to sort out billing problems I fear.Overall, i730 fells like, looks like and acts like a cheap version of i90c with color screen and shinny skin!

I purchased an i730 in April, 2004, because they told me my i1000plus was wearing out (i was having trouble with disconnects, etc.).  Just prior to the one-year warranty being up I took the phone to the service center with the problem of calls going into voice mail instead of ringing, not able to call out, etc.  They did some stuff to it at the service center and sent me on my way.  A few weeks later I was back to the same problems, so they took it apart, checked it out, and told me they were going to \"swap\" it out.  I had to go to another location for the sway - my understanding was that they were going to take my phone and give me a new phone.  When I went to the \"swap\" place, the lady told me my phone had gotten wet and they would not swap it out.  I explained that the service center had taken it all apart and the service center didn't say anything about it being wet.  Additionally, I have the phone with me all the time and I DID NOT GET IT WET.  After that episode, they replaced my phone with the insurance program that we pay 6 dollars a month for.  Soon after I got the \"new\" phone I was having problems with it - mainly my car charger had quit working, I was getting calls going into voice mail, and the phone wouldn't hold a charge.  I took it to the service center only to find out that I had my new phone replaced with a refurbished phone and with an AFTERMARKET battery.  The battery was no good and the guy at the service center told me the aftermarket battery ruined my car charger (which had cost 38 dollars).  When I called the insurance company to find out why they replaced my phone with a used phone and an aftermarket battery that didn't work, they, in so many words, told me it was too bad - that is what they do.  I purchased a new motorola battery (Nextel did give me a $55 credit on my phone bill to purchase the new battery).  I continue to have ongoing problems with the phone I have - it goes into voice mail, calls cut off, it won't work when my husband's nextel phone works in the same location, I have to wave it around to get a signal half of the time.  I am thoroughly disgusted with this whole process.  I have had this same nextel phone number for at least 5 years, all my business cards, letterhead, etc. has this number on it.  It would be a disaster for me to switch phone numbers.  I feel like I have nowhere to go, but to continue to pay $199/month for the service, $3.95 for repair, and $5.95 for insurance.  I cannot believe there are no federal or state laws to address this total ripoff.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Warning! 3 month rule!", "Author": "kcigga", "ReviewID": "RHVT3010RXG49", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will keep it simple!

When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing.
