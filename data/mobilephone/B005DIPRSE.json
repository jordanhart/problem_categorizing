No green android figures here, UI is aesthetically very mature, good for business environment. Looks like Sony borrowed UI elements from CM7. (Update: Lockscreen has limited options, cannot launch apps unlike Sense 3.0 and cannot control default music player from lock screen - possible to control music player from lock screen for replacement music apps like 'Cubed')The keyboard has a nice feel to it - the space between the qwerty keys is adequate with just the right amount of travel (press feedback).(Update: Hardware keypad is backlit which switches off even if open after some time of inactivity to save battery)the body is plastic - which Sony rates as scratch resistant, but its a 'fingerprint magnet'; screen is good.One very nice thing - hardware buttons in the front - which is gradually disappearing from all touchscreen models. So it helps when you got water on your fingers.the 'contacts' app list supports full integration with Facebook. overall nicely done. Default number option for a contact is not present.The battery should be good for an android device(1500 mAh), i have not tested it fully yet. looks like it should hold up full charge for 35-45 hours or so. showing 76% left after 11hours of heavy use (lots of calls mostly, surfing on WiFi if required) - have to test on weekday for realistic figures. (Update: My office desk is at basement so VERY poor reception, the battery lasted about 33 hours with heavy usage)Performance is good, could work with GPS (Google navigation) while playing music. Office editor , virus scanner, pre-installed. Swype can be installed and works just fine. (Update: Quadrant Score of 1447)Loudspeaker is good (loud too). Music (Sound reproduction) is quite good. (Update: Music player has some limitations (like no repeat option - or may be i could not find it; can be replaced by any other android music app)(Update: Storage- Comes wth 8GB Class 2 MicroSD card)Skype has the potential to utilize video calls - it starts up but closes when Skype detects that device is not officially supported (i guess software restriction) - front camera resolution is ok.Primary Camera - tested only in low light - its good - day photos should be better, (8MP, HD video).Curious thing - Headset provided looks like Sony proprietary. It did not support my other Phone's headset (Palm Pre)Customization - Supports custom ringtones. did not root it yet (as the phone's for wife).Rest all features are android standard, android version - Gingerbread 2.3.3.Apps suggested to make the phone complete - Extended Controls, QQPlayer, Root Explorer, Swype, Lookout, Dolphin Browser, EasyTube, Skype etc.Did not test DLNA, only some of the Sony bloatwares can be uninstalled.Overall verdict -'must buy' if need unlocked, no contract, android with hardware keyboard with AT&T; 3G frequencies.

Currently I love this phone becouse the QWERTY keyboard and because the speed with Gingerbread 2.3.4. With ICS the phone ran very slow even when I rooted the phone and used Titanium Backup to remove some of the sofware that came with the phone (e.g. Let's Golf).Because of the tethering issue on ICS I decided downgrade to Gingerbread 2.3.4, and found that the 4.0.2.A.0.42 build have an exploit that makes it possible root the phone with that version.Now the phone is running like a charm, very fast and all is working fine.The screen of this phone isn't as good as the Samsung's but it's ok.Other thing that I realized is that it doesn't have sensor light to automatically adjust the screen brightness.Overall this phone in good hands is an amazing phone for less than $300.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson Xperia pro Exceeded My Expectations!", "Author": "Louis A.

Front buttons are a great pro also. The sound is great, even with some cheap headphones you get excellent quality. Nice camera, with dedicated button placed in the right place. Didn't try HDMI yet. Battery life it's fine (for an Android device of course).Three little things I don't like about the design:1-the white backlight that came through the front buttons: it's not like you'll get blinded with it, but can be kind of annoying if you're using the phone in a place with little light2-LED on a side: maybe it's just because I'm not use to it yet, but I prefer the LED to be in the front. It seems like they forgot to place the LED while designing the phone, and the only space available when they figure it out was the side of the phone, right besides the HDMI port. At least they could put it besides the power button...3-power button: once again, on one side of the phone (the left one). It's kind of small, so depending on how you hold the phone with your hand it's how long it takes to you to press it right. BUT if you want to wake up the display it's not necessary to press this button, you may also use the home button in front of the phone, so in the end it's not THAT terrible. The rest of the phone it's really really nice.Currently I'm using the phone in Argentina with a Personal chip and everything worked just fine (line-Wi-FI and 3g) so it's truly full unlocked.I strongly recommend it if you're looking for a \"real\" qwerty keyboard phone with a lovely design and smoothly performance", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "El Duderino \"tech guy\"", "ReviewID": "RNAGW4HX5C3A9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is perfect.

I ordered it with plans to move to T-Mobile's $30 per month prepaid voice (100 minutes)/unlimited text/unlimited (5 Gigs) data plan.  Both the phone and the TMo plan are great deals, but this phone doesn't support high-speed data on T-Mobile's (USA) network.  Because it doesn't support UMTS band IV, it can only run at slow EDGE data rates on T-Mobile.  I decided I couldn't live with that and sadly returned the phone.  If you use it on AT&T;, it WILL support 3G, but AT&T;'s prepaid plans are no great deal.  For a few bucks more per month, you can get a regular plan on AT&T; and a subsidized or free smartphone.  Of course, if you travel overseas regularly, this unlocked phone is an excellent choice, but for an infrequent international traveler like me, it did not make sense.  I didn't want to suffer EDGE data rates every day for the occasional convenience when traveling abroad.  Last trip (Italy), I bought a small MiFi type device and used it along with my Android tablet for both VOIP phone and data; worked great.I guess the moral of this story is that I did not do enough homework on SIM card (aka 'GSM) carrier bands and compatibilities.

The Xperia pro boasts an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. Much like the Xperia ray, arc and arc S, the Xperia pro uses an backlit Exmor R sensor, which promises improved low-light performance. Our experience with these sort of sensors is that they indeed offer lowered noise levels but the improvement is nothing that major. The design of Sony Ericsson Xperia pro mixes Xperia neo and Xperia arc. Looked from the front, the Neo and the Pro are almost impossible to tell apart. The back has a similar inward curve as the two Xperia Arcs, slightly less prominent perhaps as the Pro is obviously not as tall.So, it's a familiar look and the styling lacks any kind of ornaments. We like the strip of silver that frames the phone's body asymmetrically - thin on the sides, wider at the top and bottom. Our review unit is the red flavor. It wouldn't have been our first choice but it has a serious advantage over the black unit.The Xperia pro finish is heavy on gloss and gets covered in grease in no time.

The product gets 4.5 stars but i am so disappointed with Sony's support that I will never purchase a product from them ever again. I live in Zambia (which has no service center) so I opted to contact their South Africa one - which is the wrong number. Sent it to their Holland service center, they say they can't fix it there. I understand that these kinds of products malfunction but the apathy fro Sony mobile is what irks me the most. $300 down the drain - rest assured, the rest of my $ will not find itself in Sonys pockets.The take-away here is that despite the product being excellent, Sony will screw you over with poor support leading to loss of your hard earned money.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "All in one place", "Author": "Mari\u00ada de los Angeles Azuaje", "ReviewID": "R10AWFQ6GEGE58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a smart phone where I can have access to all email and social networks in one place and keep me informed.Call quality is good, especially the speaker phone.The keyboard is very convenient since the touchpad is sometimes difficult to handle at the touch screen sencibleThe camera takes excellent photos and applications load faster.All I can object to is the battery, which runs relatively fast.

I recently purchased an LG running Froyo 2.2. OS before this one but the sd card slot was faulty right out of the box. I had to ship it back the very next day which was a good thing because this phone is much better than the one I had shipped back.Yeah, this phone is completely unlocked and I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.  I've had this phone for several weeks now and I simply love it.  If you need this phone to use on T Mobile network, forget out it because it will run on 3G but slower EDGE.  This phone works perfectly on the AT&T; network and I do have 3G speeds.  No lag - no problems with the network! The only issue I had was with the AT&T; SIM card that I had.  My sim card was one of those old time micro sim cards and the phone's slot was made for the macro ones.  It took me at least 20 min. to position the card inside the slot for the phone to recognize a card was in the slot as I had to continuously turn off the phone and reboot it. (PS you are not supposed to insert SD or sim cards while the phone is one as it may damage your phone). Once my phone recognized the card, I registered with AT&T;, got a $25 pay as you go plan and was on my way. I don't need a data plan because I use my wifi at home and I have full use of the Internet when I go to work. This plan only has 250 min a month w/ unlimited texts. This is fine for me because I only use my cell for emergencies and the min. I don't use I get to roll them over. This is perfect.The same day I downloaded the Sony updater and downloaded the latest firmware to my phone (Ice Cream Sandwich).  No problems. I purchased 32 gig sd card and now I have tons of room for great apps.  I downloaded nice utilities to make my phone run smoothly and I'm having fun just figuring out how to use this phone and the apps. It will probably take me a few more weeks to really tap into all of the neat stuff this phone does - on the personal and business levels.The touchscreen is pretty responsively.  I've experienced some lagging issues where I had to tap on a particular app several times to get it to respond but it isn't a major deal.  Since I'm a texter, I love the Qwerty keyboard.  I like it better than the touchscreen one because it's more accurate.(If there are any issues in the future with this phone I will surely add to this review).", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "wawa", "ReviewID": "R9WMSDEO4EXRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "lately i have not been very pleased with amazon because they have been allowing certain sellers to rip off the customers.But this phone is really great.At first i was a little skeptical, then i decided to give it a try, which i dont regret.The phone is completly unlocked and i'm able to use the apps.unlike certain phones that are manufactured for a specific company, but avertised as unlocked with useless apps, this phone is really unlocked and allows me to use the apps on the phone ect....I'm not an apple's lover but when it comes to luxurious electronic gadgets i admit they have the best products in the market.
