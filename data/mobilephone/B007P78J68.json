I went to the closest AT&T; store and i had to purchase another sims card. once it was in the phone continued to say that it was not registered to the network. The clerk at the store told me to send it back to the sender & i refused to at first so i calld AT&T; and they told me the same thing that it was defective. So I emailed the company and they were very rude saying that they tried it with several sims cards before they shipped it. Then i recieved an email stating that would be getting my money back of 348.00 but the phone was 355.00 and 360.00 with s&h; but they said not so..I still have my invoice and would gladly send it to them. I would not recommend this company to anyone..still searching for a great galaxy s2 skyrocket phone from AT&T;", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone would not connect to the internet", "Author": "K.
