{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great basic phone with really good Bluetooth support", "Author": "J. Moran \"aralim\"", "ReviewID": "R3ULHZBCWQXATB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a Bluetooth phone for over two years now. I've never bought one before because they were always high-end phones with more features than I would ever care about using. I'd been following the Sony-Ericsson phones, but they were always expensive when new and followed the same pattern of featuritis.I just found this phone last week, and I bought it on the spot. It is exactly what I have been looking for -- a good phone with some very useful features, plus a few gimmicks for the young and hip (or young at heart and hipless). Among the more important features for me, mainly from a practicality / safety standpoint:- Voice-activated dialing (super-easy to set up, and it even recognizes partial commands -- I'd set up my home number as \"Call home\", but it worked just fine when I only said \"Home\")- Speakerphone function (a little fuzzy, but serviceable as long as you're not in a moving car)- (Brightly!) Backlit, reasonably large keys- Lightweight- Small, but not too small to hold comfortably (I'm 6' 3\" with large hands, and I have no problems holding or dialing)- Caller-specific ring tones to spare me from reading the display (my wedding song's playing? Must be my wife calling)- Very good signal reception (I generally get 4 or 5 bars in my home, where I used to get 1 or 2 with my old Nokia [both on Cingular])- Good sound quality, almost as good as a land lineBut for me, the most important feature in a cell phone has long been Bluetooth. I really think this is the best technology to come to mobile phones, and Cingular (unlike some other cell service providers ::cough::VERIZON::cough::) doesn't cripple or limit what it can do. Without reading the manual, I quickly navigated to the phone's Connectivity menu, turned on Bluetooth, and told it to find local devices. My Apple PowerBook was right there and turned on, and the phone found it almost instantly. It paired up without any hassle (the PowerBook notified me right away when I needed to enter the passcode for a permanent pairing), and a few seconds later I was using iSync to send over my contacts, saving me a good hour of time vs having to manually key them all in. iSync recognized the phone with no issues and configuration of sync options was a breeze.I was also able to send an MP3 file from iTunes via Bluetooth (after first pulling out the bit I wanted to use as the ring tone through QuickTime). The phone took the file without any additional software -- I just used the Bluetooth File Transfer utility that came bundled with the PowerBook. The phone automatically recognized it as a sound file, put in the right place, and made it immediately available as a ring tone.I plan on purchasing the S-E Bluetooth car kit (HCB-700) and possibly the advanced music mute to route the sound through my car's speakers instead of using the kit's speaker. Then I'll have a perfect wireless hands-free setup!", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "A quad-band phone from Sony Ericsson at last", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3O1FDYKO7DPOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you travel overseas, you want a quad band phone. However, until recently that pretty much restricted you to Motorola. I've had three Motorola phones, and they all fell apart within a year, so I wasn't about to buy another one. In addition, I find the current Motorola user interface (on the RAZR) ugly and hard to use.So, I was delighted when Sony Ericsson finally released a quad band phone in the USA, and Cingular picked it up. The Z520a is a phone for people who want a phone. It's small, robustly built, and has all the features you could reasonably want for telephony. The flashing lights are a gimmick, but a gimmick that can be useful in noisy environments.If you want to use high speed data services, this phone is not for you, as it lacks EDGE support. If you want to browse the web, this phone is probably not for you--it has a web browser, but the screen is small. If you want to listen to music, get an iPod--this phone only has 17MB free when you get it, and there's no headphone jack. If you want to take 4x6 photos, again, this isn't the phone you want--the 640x480 resolution is good for e-mailing fun web snapshots, but that's about it.But as I say, it's a phone. It's small enough to fit in the pocket of your jeans. It'll pair with a Toyota Prius via Bluetooth for hands free use. It'll pair with a Mac and sync your contacts and calendars via iSync. It'll play your choice of MIDI files or MP3s sent from your computer as ringtones, so you don't have to pay for overpriced downloads. For my phone at least, Cingular didn't lock down the Bluetooth or otherwise cripple the phone's functionality.I had a Sony Ericsson T68i, which was incredibly slow. I'm happy to report that this phone is lightning fast by comparison--no noticable lag in the user interface. Java applications take a while to start up, but run fine once they're up.Why not 5 stars? Well, the inner screen is absurdly easy to scratch--you'll want a screen protector. Also, the arrow keys are a bit fiddly to press; a scroll wheel or joystick would have been very welcome.", "Date": "November 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "A very good cell phone, but...", "Author": "Donni Subagia", "ReviewID": "R2BIR9CJLX3IP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good cell phone and Amazon.com gives the best deal.

COmpared it side by side against the Razr.After about 2 weeks of intensive use, we like this phone better than the Razr in everything area except for two things: reception sensitivity and screen size.Pros:Lighter, smaller, slightly more tactile key, and most importantly - more analog sound both in the earpiece and transmitting than the Razr. It simply sounds more natural.  Also, having a synthetic body (some kind of plastic) along with its lightweight, should be more durable than the Razr.  GREAT talk time compared to the razr etc.  Bluetooth with plantronics works just fine. Zero problems there.  Finally, the speaker phone is quite usable and noticeably better on both the transmitting and receiving end compared to the Razr.  Also, very consistent quality - all three of our phones work identically in reception strength and sound quality.  Kudos there.Cons:Razr has better reception. This is a big one.  Our home is in the fringe area of reception in the mountains. Decending to the 'basement', we have very very fringe reception.  Barely 1 bar at times.  Razr takes the call no problem and maintains rock solid connection. The Sony would make the call maybe once out of five times, and then drop it repeatedly after seconds.  Basically not usable in this very fringe environment.  We continue to drop calls with CIngular often even with 3 bars in different environments.  Not sure if it is the phone or Cingular.Also, Razr does have a bigger screen that is just more of a pleasure to see.  This is minor for us.Currently, we are keeping the Z520 but the weaker reception than the Razr and dropped calls on all three Z520 is driving us a bit 'nuts'.  We have 30 days to decide whether to keep it and are still evaluating.Hope this helps.Addendum after 3 weeks:I would not give it 1 or 2 stars if I could.  Called Cingular multiple times to resolve our problems to no avail and received some erroneous information.  With all three phones, we would regularly drop calls even with 3 or 4 bars showing.  Further, just sitting on our desk, the phone would bounce from 1 to 4 bar and back in seconds.  Something is wrong with the internal algorithm.  It is possible that the phone is searching for alternate bands?  Can't set the band manually.  VERY frustrating and poor performance after extensive testing with 3 phones.Final update:We traded all 3 for Razrs and the difference is remarkable.  The Razr exhibited NONE of the problems of the Z520 with the many dropped calls.  Simply blows the Z520 away.  We tried our best to  like the Z520 but am very happy with the Razr.  Also, we racked up a bunch of unintentional charges with the Z520 as you can push many additional $$ services inadvertantly with just ONE button.  THis happened on ALL three Z520s and was very irritating.  We never saw this coming until the bill showed up.  Cingular charge $20 for games which we never intentionally loaded.  They did reverse charges though when we challenged it. In all, one star phone.", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cingular has finally pulled this phone!", "Author": "B. Spoon", "ReviewID": "R1M4D0WQE5HHYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We upgraded our phones right after Christmas and bought 2 RAZR's and 2 SE z520a's.  My sons love their phones.  My daughter and I loved ours, too, for about 2 weeks!As much as we hate to, we've boxed them up to send back to Cingular.  They are great phones as long as long as they are working.  My daughter first noticed she was missing calls.  She said the phone would vibrate without ringing and when she tried to answer it she could not hear nor be heard.  Since it only happened a couple of times and this phone had good reviews, I didn't worry about it.  Then I noticed there were times I would be talking to someone and then couldn't hear them, although the call timer was still running.  I wanted to believe that Cingular was having some service problems and then it happened.  I noticed my phone with it's cool lights dancing and realized that I didn't hear a ring.  I popped it open to answer and got dead air.  Isn't it funny how it's always worse when it happens to you?  Well, this was serious.I immediately went to the Cingular forums and found lots of frustrated people wanting help with these phones, most having the same problems with them.  Those complaints weren't there when I ordered our phones.  I saw today that Cingular has pulled the z520a from their sales site.Some people believe that a memory leak is the cause.  They have suggested powering down the phones each day.  That didn't work for us.  We put the call into Cingular, boxed up our really cute phones and are now waiting for the labels to ship them back.  The new sim cards work great in our old phones.  They will just have to do until Cingular puts an improved version of the Z520a or something equally cool up for sale.  Something that will match the functions of the RAZR without the blocky width and it needs lights that help you find it in the bottom of a purse.

I used to not be able to pick up  my phone at all on the first floor. now i have no problem.-i was used to a candy bar phone before so i'm getting used to the whole flip phone thing.-vibrate isn't as loud as my old phone (i used to be able to hear my old phone rattle in my backback or my purse. can't hear this phone)-battery life is not as long as they advertise, but it's longer than my old phone. i lasted 4 days on my last charge with heavy use. i talk at least an hour a day and i was learning the phone so i was playing with all the features.overall, great phone. haven't had any technical problems with the phone. i had one of the boxes with the little yellow dot so that means the firmware was upgraded. very happy with my purchase! the only other phones i would rather have cost hundreds more. i'll be upgrading in 2007 when i can afford to pay more (i'm in grad school right now). in 2007 they will be much smaller (less # parts) and have many more features.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice Technology - Poor Execution", "Author": "rwraysmith \"rwraysmith\"", "ReviewID": "R2QVLOLH7UVNB2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this phone and have only had it for a couple of weeks but am already thinking about exchanging it.  I was attracted by the quad band technology and outstanding talk and standby times.  I'm not the type who's swayed by Bluetooth, downloadble sounds and all that.  At the end of the day a cellular phone is still a phone, first and foremost.  While I sort of like the overall design, this phone has some nagging problems which should never have slipped through Sony Ericsson's design team.  For one, the keypad is too cramped and navigating through menus and icons requires too much attention.  You think you're pressing an arrow key and you end up making a phone call.  The buttons are too small.  There's no room on this phone for someone with large hands/fingers, and forget using this phone if you're elderly or unfamiliar with technology in general.  But... the MOST nagging problem of all is the large, sensitive camera button.  It is almost impossible to hold this phone without taking a picture accidentally.  My son-in-law has the Z500a and though it's really close in design, that phone is larger, has more room for fingers, and a much less sensitive phone button.  You'll be holding the phone, thinking you're checking your voicemail, or making a call, and suddenly you hear the shudder click!  It's absolutely maddening, and there's no way to disable the camera!  I'll try it for another week and then I may return it.  Until then, I can not in good conscience recommend this phone.

I have to say that the contact synchronization and full featured Bluetooth features are awesome.  It's also nice to have an infrared port, and a speakerphone all packaged in such a small form-factor.  However!  Yes, there is a however, all these features don't mean a thing if the phone doesn't work correctly.  First and foremost this is a phone and it should act like one!Right off the bat, we had problems with both phones where without warning, they would cease to ring and would only vibrate.  Just out the blue the ringer would get turned off and no amount of fiddling with the settings could make the ringer come back.  The only solution was to remove the battery and reboot the phone.  Not good!We also experienced problems with the \"Theme\" setting.  The color-scheme and wallpaper would randomly go back to the default blue.  Again, the only way to remedy that was to remove the battery.One of the phones had a faulty outside LCD screen.  The top area of the screen was so washed out, that it was impossible to see the Voicemail or Message icons as well as the battery status icon.  Changing the screen's brightness made no difference at all.  The other phone made a high pitched noise when charging.  This was so bad that we could only charge the phone in another room at nights, so as to not hear the buzzing it made.  Not good again!Lastly, and probably the most disappointing problem with this phone is that during some calls, we could hear a pattern of clicks every 2 seconds or so.  During the clicks (very faint), the transmission would be interrupted and neither you nor the other person on the line could be hear.  The effect of this is that in sounded like the call was being dropped or like we had bad reception.  We determined that this was not caused by network issues because a person standing next to us (also with a full signal) was able to make and receive crystal clear calls while we experienced these interruptions in the conversation.The saddest part of this is that in my opinion the phone is perfectly fine and the problems ALL stem from Cingular's firmware (software) on the phone.  A good friend of mine has the European version of this phone (z520 - no \"a\") and he does not experience ANY of these problems even though he too has Cingular's service.Given all of this, it's hard to rate the phone so poorly knowing that the software is the problem, but unless Cingular fixes it soon, this phone is not worth the trouble.

The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.

On my phone, the SLIGHTEST touch, will enable the phone's camera, and it will take pictures. My phone has taken well over 120 photos of my pocket, my fingers, blurred scenes and random unintended places. When you answer a call or dial a call, your finger naturally lands near the vicinity of the Camera/Video button. The camera can be enabled DURING a phone conversation, thus it will take pictures after repeated accidental presses on the button.Basically, I would be walking around the house, with the phone in my pocket, and I would hear this shutter noise. Then another, then another, then another. I take out the phone from my pocket, and see the camera enabled. But it was just in my pocket! Solution? Don't touch the button.

Goodall \"Designated import\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q0XJPB540QIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I did some online checking before we bought our Sony Ericsson Z520a phones from Cingular. It turns out that we were lucky when we bought them, because we received the phones with the latest firmware upgrade. If you buy this phone and have problems, you need to contact customer service. They will replace your phone.The biggest negative is the camera button. It is very sensitive. A lot of people have complained about it. Apparently there's either a new version, or an international version, that has a spring inside the button that requires a harder press. A firmware upgrade could fix this (require the case to be open, for instance). I'm hoping for this. It doesn't help that the button is positioned so my thumb always wants to push it.On the positive side, it's a light phone with good quality sound. It's sensitive to the direction you point it. I talked to my wife yesterday and the phone cut out a couple of times. On the other hand, the signal quality in our apartment is good, whereas our old Nokia's would cut out entirely. So sometimes the sound cuts out, but in general you have better reception. It plays polyphonic ringtones and MP3s as ringtones. You can get quite a lot of volume out of the ringtones, which is good as our old phones were too quiet (often couldn't hear them ring in another room).The battery life is excellent; the batteries are not. If you use it just as a phone, you should get something close to 10 days on standby. I'm not sure how much time, maximum, you get from talking. The literature says 5 hours, and some reviews have suggested that it's closer to the truth than most companies' marketing information. Unfortunately, the batteries aren't well made. We've had ours replaced twice, each, in two years.The sync cable doesn't come with the device, and it's pretty pricey at $24.95. The software for syncing the phone is free online. I downloaded it, installed it, and within half an hour I was putting MP3s on my phone to use as ringtones without haveing to connect to the internet! When I bought a new laptop with Bluetooth I didn't need the cable anymore.Sony Ericsson also gives you free software for creating your own themes. It takes a little getting used to and lots of trial and error, but in a couple of nights I put together a pretty decent little \"Invader Zim\" theme on the phone. I have little graphics from the show for everyone on my contacts list.The menu system is easy to use. You can define hotkeys for the four directions of the \"browser ring\", which is nice.The phones were okay for what we paid, but I'm less than happy with the batteries. Recently my phone has been powering down for no reason, and I can't start it back up until I pull the battery. I suspect that the battery is dying again.

Being a Motorola user for the past 2 years, I preferred this phone over the Motorola V3 black since now everybody has the V3. At every corner you see someone using it, whereas the Z520a is not even being sold here in my country... that, and a 60$ difference when I bought it. Also, the fact that the Z520a came with over 17 MB of internal memory and the V3 only has like 6 MB.Now, the Pros: Nice design, sturdy construction, its small, better user interface than Motorolas, 17 MB memory for storing lots of pics, vids, themes, games, and of course, mp3 ringtones. Useful external screen, the battery last almost a week without charging. I like the file manager, it sorts files by type and gives access to the entire flash memory and the address book is very accesible, displays useful information and it's neatly organized. The external speaker plays mp3s loud and clear enough. The option for taking self portraits with the help of the external LCD is great. And the side lights are a nice add-on to show to your friends (look: shiny lights!!).The Cons: Well, first, I would have given 5 stars to this phone if it came with any type of slot for additional storage (My kingdom for a transflash slot!)... second, both LCD screens are hard to see on a sunny day. It's difficult to open the phone with one hand (something I could do easily with my old V-551). The speakerphone is not so loud when you are in a conversation even if the volume is all the way up. Finally, I have a Motorola HS-820 bluetooth headset that I used with my last phone, but it seems the Z520a doesn't likes this headset. I cannot voice dial and if you make a call using the phone's keypad you have to keep the phone open, or it will hang the call, which is not very pleasant. Maybe its a configuration setting I'm not making but who knows. On the other hand, the wired hands-free that comes with the phone is very nice.

The next morning I tried in my cubicle, where Z520a had 4 signal bars! (My old Nokia only said 1 bar so I had to walk to the window side.) But there always were those annoying cut-outs that made me randomly ask my friends repeat their words. :(  Then tried listening to some computer-generated voice message systems, sometimes \"customer\" became \"chi-stomer\", \"technology\" became \"tech-piu-gy\", or phone number \"1234567890\" became \"1234-kee-67890\", I could't even go through a menu because a few menu items were \"pronounced\" to be not understandable! That's really unacceptable.Then in the evening of 12/5/2005 I visited the dealer office and showed them the cut-outs. In their office I tried another Z520a, to my surprise, the 2nd one was even worse with much more cut-outs, more than that, it could't even end a call maybe because its software/firmware was hanging somewhere and refused to respond. :(Well, I had to say bye-bye to the beautiful and cute Z520a although it's quad-band.

It is not as customizable as the V551 nor is it as straightforward to use.Plus Points of the Z520a include:- Sleek design with a the antenna made to look like a little handle on top.  It is also far lighter and more compact than the Motorla v551- True quadband phone so it will work anywhere in the world (once you unlock it)- External color display that can be used to view picture caller ID or as a viewfinder for the camera.  It can also display appointment information or phone information.- Bluetooth is easy to use and setup- Cool looking glowing lights around the keypad that light up in different ways when you receive a call.- It has great battery life (far better than the V551) and the charger is a lot more straightforward to use (the v551 requires jiggling and finessing to get it to work).- Some nice game demos are included although they are VERY short and the full version will cost you $7 bucks extra!!**** Negative Points of the z520a include  ****- The external screen has poor resolution (it is not a TFT screen so it is not really usable in direct light or at different angles).- Also the font on the external screen is very small so it is hard to read without concentrating on it.  And the external clock is TOTALLY useless because you cannot read the small font when it is not backlit- The camera button on the side of the phone is EXTREMELY sensitive so you will accidentally push it all the time.  This means that you will have a lot of accidental pictures.- The internal screen is nice but is not as large or as crisp as the screen on the V551 and it has lower resolution than the v551.- The camera is not very straightforward to use.  You have to use the 5 way pad to zoom and the side conrols to adjust brightness.  Plus there are all kinds of other controls like Night mode etc. that are accessed by pushing various numbers on the keypad.  Not very easy to remember at all.- The camera makes a very loud shutter noise when you take a picture and unlike the V551 you cannot turn off this noise or change it.- There are NO dedicated buttons to send or receive (answer or hang up) a call.  You do this by using the multifunction buttons when the option comes up on the screen over the corresponding button.  Also the keypad buttons are all backlit with the same blue color so it is hard to distinguish buttons in a hurry without concentrating on the phone.- There is no way to lock out some of the features you do not use.  For example you cannot lock out the internet or ringtone/game shopping features so if you accidentally push the wrong buttons you will be charged!!  The Motorola gives you full customizability on what features you want to lock out as well as full control over the interface.- The construction seems like it has a bit too much plastic so it might not hold up very well to abuse.- occasionally the phone software gets buggy and the screen blanks out for a few secondsOverall this is not a bad phone but if you really want a phone you can customize to your needs then this is not for you.  It seems like it is geared more for the college age and teenage crowd who value the cool factor over true functionality.

If you take your phone to Cingular they can update the phones with the older software to the newest version.Now, with that said, I have been pleased with the Z520a. It is built solidly, has some good features (Bluetooth, dual color displays, camera) for a very pleasing price. I got the Z520a as kind of a second phone (my main phone is the Nokia 8801) but I have played around with the Z520a for about 2 weeks just to get an impression of it.First, this phone has great reception! Previous Sony Ericssons have had pretty average to poor reception; this one however, even beats out my Nokia! That's very impressive. Call quality is also very good, both using the earpiece and the speakerphone, which has a very large speaker for a cell phone, and that keeps calls (and ring tones) very clear even at maximum volume; there is no distortion.The user interface is among the best I have used, and it's very stable. I will never buy or recommend a Motorola again until they have released their new operating system for phones, as their current OS is terrible and buggy. The Z520a, from Sony Ericsson, however, does not suffer from this, and is very solid and easy to navigate. The internal screen is also easy to read and fairly bright and sharp. It's not the best screen, but it is perfectly acceptable for the price of the phone, and it is an active matrix display, which helps keep it from washing out as much. The external display, though a passive matrix type display, is pretty good and serves its purpose well.Battery life is pretty good, and when you press the up key on the side of the phone, in the run down of details about your phone, it has a battery life percentage as well, so instead of having 1 2 or 3 blocks for judging battery life, you also have an actual percentage, which is nice.Bluetooth works very well, it is easy to use and pair with other devices, and it a fairly advanced implementation, especially for this class of phone, even offering remote control of a computer (when paired to do so). It is also possible to synchronize with Microsoft Outlook on a computer without any special software, just using the standard Bluetooth synch system.Pictures from the built in camera are decent for a camera phone, but overall, they are still pretty poor (as pretty much any camera phone pictures are outside of Asia).There is only one notable fault I could find with the phone, and that is the camera button located on the side of the phone. It is very easy to accidentally press. You do have to press and hold in order to activate it, however, if it's in a pocket or something, that's not necessarily hard to do, so you end up snapping pictures of the black abyss of the inside of your jeans.Otherwise, for the average cell phone user, whose main intent is to make calls, this Z520a is a perfectly wonderful device.", "Date": "February 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "really cute but not practical", "Author": "k.h.", "ReviewID": "R3ABS90TN50WGU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i chose this cute little phone because it had alot of extras BUT this phone just couldn't keep a strong signal.

It's OK to take simple pictures of stationary objects, but pictures are very blurry if there is any movement at all.The PIM features are excellent, and there is 16 Meg of memory.  It's not a lot compared to a smart phone but it's still large enough for all my information.  I wanted a phone that could replace my old Palm Vx and work as a basic PIM.  Many of the phones I saw had contacts and calendar, but not many had a separate To Do list feature, which I wanted.The only major complaint is that I can't get it to sync with Yahoo's Contacts Backup service.  This is a relatively new feature that allows you to backup your contacts, calendar, etc to SyncML phones.  I've gotten different information about whether this should work.  Some of Yahoo's pages say that the Z500 is supported.  The Z520a is a newer version of Z500 that should be supported, but I can't get synch to work.  This syncs just fine with Outlook except that long notes fields on contacts get truncated.PROS:* Very light weight, easy to fit in pocket* Has bluetooth and infrared* Has contacts, to-do list, calendar, etc.  Allowed me to replace my Palm Vx.* Great menu system which is easy to useCONS:* Uses a special headphone connector instead of standard 1/8\" jack* Signal sometimes cuts out and I get static or interference on some calls (but still relatively good)* Camera button is too easy to activate!!!* No high speed EDGE, just slower GPRS* USB charge/sync cable is extra* Sync software doesn't allow you to map fields or exclude fields.  All you can choose is whether or not to sync Contacts, Calendar, To-do list, and Notes* Long notes fields on Contacts get truncated after about 40 characters, even when there is free memoryAll things considered, this phone has been better than I hoped for.  I used to hate carrying my old cell phone around, and friends could never call me.  Now I carry this Z520a around all the time and I actually like using it.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Buggy software - crashes a lot", "Author": "Mitch Haile", "ReviewID": "RYJ7CRLRVIOJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone crashes a lot.

A power cycle occurs when you turn off andturn on the phone, remove and reinsert the battery or the battery goesdead and complete a recharge and power on.What a crock.

I would rather hit a camera button then an internet button or other paid feature on accident like you can on some other cell phones. You do have the option of telling the phone to answer the call when you open the phone so you do not have to worry about missing any calls.The battery life is great, I can talk a lot and do not need to charge it every night.

Wang", "ReviewID": "RZQI8QPWO2KQ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've always been a big fan of the Japanese phones. They got cool designs and better functionality over other brands (including nokia). I ordered a SE W600 along with a Z520a in mid April. This phone appears pale when compared with the W600. The first thing I noticed is the screen resolution. It's not very sharp, which reminds me of my old nokia 6820. Images are kinda pixelated. The camera is a typical vga with 4x digital zoom. You can't expect much from this mediocre phone. But the camera is packed with many cool features. I enjoy the \"frame feature\", pretty funny. I like the external screen a lot, you can even change its wall paper. The menu interfaces are very user-friendly -- another amenity of sony ericsson. There are plenty of shortcuts in the \"more\" menu, so you don't have to exit to the menu and re-access whatever.I find some little flaws on the design. For my phone, it takes me both hands to open the clamshell. I cannot just use my thumb to flip it open like I did with my samsung phone. When you entirely flip it open, there is a click sound. Also, PROTECT THE INTERNAL SCREEN. Use some kind of screen protector or simply plastic foils to cover the screen up. Of course it wouldn't matter for those people who don't care about the phone's appearance. I wonder what they made the screen with, it's absolutely unavoidable to scratch its surface. (BTW, I heard you can make the scratches disappear if you rub it with toothpaste) Also, the screen is hard to see under outdoor light. You have to turn the screen brightness to max to get a good view. The external screen is more durable than the internal one. I haven't found a single scratch on it yet. There is also no cover at all for the outside camera. So dirt and residue can easily build up. I've gotta nothing to say about the loop antenna. It doesn't bother me, kinda stylish actually, though some said it's bulky. I don't know if this design actually boosts the reception, but I used a different phone on cingular a year ago, and it had 4 bars. Now there are 5 bars on this phone with cingular.There are plenty of features on this phone; many unnecessary ones, but still nice to have them. You can use infrared port and blue tooth to connect with other devices. The phone book contains slots for many information of your contacts. Beside adding personal picture and ringtone, you can also add a different light effect. The edges of phone light up by different sequences. The entertainment department is overloaded with many unnecessary applications -- video, music, and photo DJ. I don't even use them on my w600, what can you do when the z520a only has 14 usable memory? (But 16mb internal memory is pretty large among the same rank phones) The games on the phone are very enjoyable. However, everything gets cutback when they are all demo version. A courtesy to Cingular. But that doesn't really bother me, I can find any game I want on google. (You MIGHT wonder how I transfer the games onto the phone. Well, I'm not rich enough to pay for the unlimited internet subscription, so I just downloaded the games onto the computer and transfer it onto my w600 and then onto the z520a through bluetooth.) The phone does play videos and mp3. But once again, what can you do with 14mb memory anyway? The internet button is very accessible, almost too accessible. You can accidentally press it and waste some data usage. For cingular, it's $0.01/kb. There are three IM softwares installed: AIM, Yahoo!, and ICQ. I don't ever use them, so I don't care. The organizer is packed with many tools: alarms, world clock, calendar, tasks, notes, synchronization, timer, stopwatch, calculator, and code demo.Comparing with Nokia 6102, this phone far exceeds its competitor functionality and price. But I don't know about the durability. Though Nokia phones are known for its durability, but my previous 6280's keypad stop functioning after a year.Another to mention is regarding the health issue. I consider the SAR value of z520a to be very high. \"The highest SAR value as reported to the authorities for this phone model when tested for use by the ear is 1.47W/kg, and when worn on the body is 0.695W/kg. In Canada and the US, the SAR limit for mobile phones used by the public is 1.6w/kg.\" I suggest turning on the speaker or use a handfree/bluetooth to get the phone away from your body as far as possible.Okay, that's all I could think of right now.

Some say the camera on the Nokia is terrible indoors. This is true if you have low light. With enough light and outdoor pictures I can actually use the picture on my laptop.

There are nice features that are fun to use and handy when they work right. Both my husband and myself have these phones and they both have different quirks that should not happen on a phone we paid this much money for.First of all, the phone fails to ring DAILY. I've read that you have to shut down and restart the phone every day or two to prevent this. This is ridiculous to have to do. No, it's not hard, but when you pay a lot for a cell phone, you shouldn't have to be inconvenienced like that. I don't use my phone as much as a lot of people I know. I forget about it in my purse, often to find out hours or a day or two later that I missed a call.As others have said, the camera button is in a bad place and is too sensitive. One review suggested to buy a case, but as I keep my phone in my purse and will not use a belt clip (maternity clothes don't really have any good places for a clip), I would miss just as many calls trying to get to my phone and get it out of the case as I do when it fails to ring. It would be nice if they had an option to turn the button off completely and manually turn it on when needed. I've lost count of how many pictures have been taken of the inside of my purse or my husband's pocket.The other problems I've had were having the pictures I took show up blank in the pictures folder until I restarted the phone. I deleted several I shouldn't have because I thought they were random shots of the inside of my purse... completely black. Also, every now and then the phone completely freezes and the only button that ends up working is the power button. Everything seems to work ok after it restarts, but it happens even when the battery's fully charged. Once again, it's silly to have to do this over and over again to keep the phone in good working order.My husband's phone has a problem with the battery coming loose every now and then and, of course, the phone won't even start until he tightens the battery. I haven't read this being a vast problem with the phone, so it might be because he carries his around in his pocket... I'm not sure.I have a feeling we will be returning these phones soon to make sure we have the upgraded ones. I like the overall concept and mainly if I could get the phone to work without having to restart, I'd love to keep it. That's my main problem with it.

I've had my Sony Ericsson Z520a phone since early Dec and have noticed that, when it's closed, it feels like it is loose; if I 'wiggle' the top & bottom, there is definitely some kind of loose movement going on, almost like there's a screw loose somewhere. That's something I've never had happen with the Motorolas I've used (V600, V180).As for the camera: first of all, the side button is irritating as heck! I don't know how many times I've accidentally taken a picture of the inside of my holster (case) when removing it! (And as far as I know, I can't reassign the thing!)  Pic quality is ok, nothing to write home about (now, my son has the Nokia 6102..he sent me some really GREAT pictures last week when he was in NY from that one). I do like the photo-assign feature (nothing new there, I had it with the V600) and being able to assign different ring tones to callers in my address book (ditto the V600) Video feature..fuzzy at best.Ringtones -- I don't even use the ones that came with the phone. I paid a charge of just under $8 over at freeringers.net & get unlimited ringtones, wallpaper, etc...it comes with a nifty converter that lets you make/rip any song on your computer - or a cd - into a ringtone -- not bad for a one-time charge of, again I say...under 8 bucks. When I change the phone -- and trust me, I will as soon as I decide which Motorola to go with --all I have to do is change the phone type I currently have to the new phone type. It's the first time I've found a 'free' ringtone service that means what they say! They offer 4 slots so you can share the service with your friends/family. The only downside is that if you screw up a number, you can't delete it, so definitely be careful with that! They also don't bug you with annoying emails, etc. (one service I tried keeps sending me text msgs reminding me of my login info! They were supposed to be 'free for life' at $29.95 but changed hands..guess what..the new folks are not honoring that free for life motto!)okay, back to my review: Bluetooth - any camera I own now must have Bluetooth technology.

After one days use, I went home, put it in the box, called cingular to tell them I was returning it and haven't regreted it since.  I kept hitting the camera button, it did not feel comfortable on my face when I was talking on the phone and the 'new age' antenna is a load of you know what.  After I got it in the mail, I realized how ugly of a phone it was and the technology aspect never really won me over.  Sony needs to reconsider how they make phones for this one was more a pain in the rear to use than anything else.  I have ordered what I originally wanted which was the motorola v557 and can't wait to get it for I truly miss my moto!", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "dont buy because you are getting rebate", "Author": "Prafull Kore", "ReviewID": "R2RESXEMUM9R3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i thing i made a biggest mistake by purchasing this phone for rebate. it has already been more that three months and i havent got anything from these peoples and in customor service too i get the differnt reply each time i called them and they dont know how system of rebate work, its rediculous!.the phone is ok but i am using my old phone instead.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Cool phone, hard flip", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RXALJA9RN91VD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for Christmas and it was so awesome.
