I had no problem listening to people through the phone and others could hear me clearly as well.the camera on the phone I got works great for a camera phone.I don't know why others have had issues with the camera. Have been able to take better photos with this phone that with other phones here in the states including the iphone, the motorola droid and the samsung omnia just to name a few.like the touch screens and that it comes with a stylus as well.the vertual keyboard is easy to use even with chunky thumbs.haven't tried the web browsing capabilities on the phone but didn't buy the phone for that feature.all in all very happy with the purchase", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a GREAT phone for 100 $", "Author": "Marian R.

Also that goes for internet but to use these you have to in the first place have it in your contract with your Mobile carrier.  I use Tmobile and it works fine.The one CON I would say is that texting can be a little hard if your not used to texting or the touch screen.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "I am quite happy with my purchase", "Author": "Charles Allen", "ReviewID": "R3BOBMOK8VW8BN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a graphic designer/photographer looking for a phone that would allow me to read my mail, download and read attachments and browse the internet while I am on the road.The LG 500kp fulfilled my expectations and more.The different functions of the phone is easy to learn. It is small sleek looking and handy.In my down time I can entertain myself with games or music, or watch a movie.My only concern is it seems it is not sturdy enough to withstand the shock if it falls to the ground. I intend to buy a protective case.I certainly would recommend this low priced phone with high end functions.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone for less than $200", "Author": "FJ Martinez \"FJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1LZEPNCJTKU6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to all the good reviews this phones has, I decided to buy it to be used in Costa Rica. After a couple of weeks, I can only say that the phone has worked perfectly.  The software is quite easy to use and the touchscreen sensitivity is the right one, you don't have to push to hard to get it to respond.  Power saver helps and lot and battery life is improved when the feature is enabled.  The only thing that's somewhat disappointing is the PC Suite software since I haven't been able to figure out if there is way to update it or the phone's software automatically.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Owner's Manual", "Author": "A.

I sold the HTC and decided to purchase this LG KP500.  So far I have no regrets.  The touchscreen is extremely responsive, especially when using the stylus (which I lost).  If you have big fingers then u may have a hard time accessing various features without the stylus. The phone comes fully loaded with features except for Wi-fi connectivity which would have been nice, but I can't complain because of the awesome price which I paid for it.  Compared to other phones this LG is extremely light.  Sometimes it's in my pocket and I forget it's there.  I consider this phone to be a bargain since it gives so much for so little.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Definately what they say it is", "Author": "Cookie", "ReviewID": "R2BZI7UWLFFGPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow, what a great product for the priceI purchased this phone for $109.78 and i have to say, that was the best $109.78 I have ever spent.Its not quite a smart phone, but hey, thats why I got it at such a great price. It is everything that it was said to be and did everything that it was said to do. The camera was great and user interface was top notch. The only crib I have is the difficulty in typing without the stylus on the QWERTY keypad. Its a little difficult no matter how small your fingers are.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "the envy of my office.", "Author": "Bo Peep", "ReviewID": "RT1TTR4NS2LQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My office mates were drooling when I showed them the phone and the price I paid. Especially considering the costs of unlocked phones. But lets get to the nitty gritty.The Pros. Works great with TMobile in the USA. I inserted the SIM card an viola, I was up and running  I have not had any problems with reception and the call quality is good. Screen is very visible. No more squinting to see the numbers or letters,and it can be adjusted. Battery life is terrific, and it didnt take long to charge up initially. The interface is intuitive, figured it out without the manual.Cons: Touch screen is exactly that. Make sure your speed dials arent on the first screen, unless you dont mind calling them accidentally.  There may be too many options for some people. Scroll bar can be difficult. Best to use the stylus with that one.Great value.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "J.

The phone overall is okay.I read somewhere that this phone wouldn't work with the AT&T; 3G sim card but I have the 3g sim card and it works just fine.The only complaint I have for this phone is that texting is somewhat difficult because the screen size is so small it makes it so easy to press the wrong letter...it gets kind of annoying.I'm and considering sending this phone back...we'll see. I don't know yet...I do like the fact that it receives awesome signal! I had a sony erricson w518a and i couldn't even get signal in the grocery store but this phone is always at the highest bars.overall okay. would not recommend if you're a big texting person like me tho :)", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not user friendly", "Author": "D.
