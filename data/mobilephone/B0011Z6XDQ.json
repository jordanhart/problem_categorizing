Though stated by the seller as unlocked/international version it came as a branded AT&T; phone with proprietary buttons and AT&T; software/splash screen.  It still works with T-Mobile.  It was also REFURBISHED as I found out when I opened the package, the phone did not align properly without correction and was a bit loose in the hingers,  there were also well over 100 numbers stored to the phone memory that was not deleted before it was sent to me.  I chose to keep it anyway because my older phone was broke and I really needed another phone.  Overall a good phone but not really worth the price for a branded refurb.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy a very extended warranty", "Author": "Azathothian", "ReviewID": "R2U6638BXAHSQW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I experienced the same problems mentioned above.Cover is extremely delicate and will crack with surprising ease. Surprising = one day you take it out of your purse and it's cracked?!Keypad malfunctioning. One day, it just stops working. I replaced the phone due to this problem very early into my purchase. Today, same thing happened, but it happened 2 months after my 1-year warranty expired.Skip this one or buy a 3-year warranty.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "They don't last long", "Author": "N. Marinas", "ReviewID": "R22YPH25RMWDBP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really liked this phone when I first got it, but I find it is too delicate. The first time I dropped the phone, the cover cracked. The phone still worked without any trouble so I was happy with it. After a few months, the keypad stopped working. I had to send the phone to Motorola for repair, which took a while. The phone was working when I received it, but a few weeks later I had the same problem. This time I was told the phone had water damage. They explained that just by using the phone out in the rain or while exercising and sweating, the moisture could get inside the phone and turn the white sticker under the back cover red. Since this is all they look at for water damage, they are not repairing the phone again. If someone is going to buy this phone, I recommend getting full coverage that would include accidents and water damage.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!", "Author": "Janice Aube Titus \"godessofcraft\"", "ReviewID": "R1CR818WTOIGTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely WONDERFUL product!
