I wanted something current, with good specs and if possible with a keyboard. I have to say that this cell is just what I wanted. I haven't seen it lag in any way, the screen is gorgeous (even if it's only a super amoled, not an amoled plus like some sources say) and it runs many games and emulators without a hitch. The keyboard is nice to have although It takes some time to get used to it. The camera is great, to the point that I don't take my standalone digital camera anywhere anymore. The battery is just good, It lasts a day with normal to heavy usage, but just that, you may want to invest in a car or portable charger if you use it heavily all time. I highly recommend this cell for anyone that wants a QWERTY smartphone, I couldn't be more happy with it.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "the i927", "Author": "Charles W.

I changed phones infrequently to avoid being locked into the big cell company's contracts. I was very happy with my flip phones but finally needed internet access on the go while traveling and also at a second home where I did not want to subscribe to local carrier services. So my 4th phone was what's known as a full feature phone, it was inadequate for my purposes but helped me learn what I wanted...and actually needed.The Samsung Captivate Glide is almost exactly what I wanted...it does fit my needs. It has a very fast processor with no lag. It's Android so I don't have to pay for the big markup of an iPhone. It can be unlocked so I'm not chained to any carrier. I use Straight Talk and pay upfront for unlimited no long term contract service each month, cheap compared to the big guys. It has a nice physical qwerty keyboard, although the keys are flat and it would be nicer if they were slightly raised like on the feature phone I had. The screen is reasonably sized but I would like this phone even more if it was a bit larger, say 4.5 to 5.0 inches in size. Battery life is average for a smartphone. Most of the time I can go a full day without running outta juice. I do carry a spare charged battery just in case, cuz they're cheap and small and not too hard to change out. I do miss my flip phone days when I could sometimes go a week without recharging...plus those flip phones were inexpensive and bullet proof compared to today's smartphones, but whaddya gonna do.Hopefully Samsung keeps improving the glide keyboard line but the trend seems to be away from this format. If a physical keyboard smartphone is what you're looking for you'll be hard pressed to find one better than this Captivate Glide. I give it five stars despite some small shortcomings (un-raised keyboard, wished it had bigger screen, average battery life) because it's the best in it's unique class (tactile keyboard) smartphone. BTW, Android 4.0 is now available for this phone.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing phone", "Author": "Antoun Toubia \"Antonio Toubia\"", "ReviewID": "R1160Y32WOMU4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was searching for a phone that has a keyboard that won't eat the screen size, nad has all the features in the other phones, i couldn't find one from samsung other than this one which only can be taken from at&t; and i do not live in Usa to take it, but this company has it unlocked now after i received it, the usage is so amazing, i can't believe that this phoen is so fast and heavy duty, so many features and additionally it has android, great phone from samsung really, other phones has big screens but when you want to type the keyboard takes half of the screen, but with this sliding keyboard feature that this phone has, i can enjoy always the big screen. thank you.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is unlocked through Rogers!", "Author": "ididntdoit \"for real\"", "ReviewID": "RU91G4O597NJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Make sure you get the original at and t version.

Other than the minor annoyance of Roger's specific apps (probably less than what AT&T; would have loaded) and the little configurations for Canada (default settings to metric, Canadian searches, etc), it seemed to be working fine with my AT&T; SIM card and I was fairly happy with it. The keyboard is a far cry from Blackberry's in terms of ease and comfort of use, but was one of the few nice phones I found with a physical keyboard so was willing to live with it. Was planning to try it on an upcoming trip to Europe with a European SIM card, but after 3.5 weeks the phone inexplicably turned off and will not power on past the Rogers start-up screen. Tablet Distributors was very responsive in trying to get a positive review from me, but went radio silent when I emailed them about my problem and asked for a replacement. The phone number listed for them on the Amazon website also does not work.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Nice Photo, Substandard Keyboard", "Author": "JFC", "ReviewID": "R1ZPVO2L3BYW1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a new Android photo with a larger screen AND a keyboard, to replace the smaller Sony Xperia MiniPro that I had been using. Needless to say, there aren't many newer version Android GSM smartphone models that also come with a full hardware QWERTY keyboard. But after doing a lot of research and specs and review reading, I settled on this AT&T; version of the Samsung Captivate Glide from Wireless Experts, sold as \"like new\" for about $140.I've now been using the phone for a couple months, and I really like the phone both in its operation and hardware. One of the first things I did, and an important reason for choosing it, was that an OS upgrade from Samsung to Ice Cream Sandwich was already available at the time of my purchase, so I knew I wasn't going to be left behind with a decent, but increasingly out of date Gingerbread phone or left wondering when/if the manufacturer would release an update.Overall, what's not to like about this phone: dual core processor, great and responsive and good sized screen (4 in Super AMOLED 16M colors), good 8 MP camera with flash and autofocus, microUSB charging, microSD slot for additional storage beyond the phone's built in 8 GB, sufficient RAM at 1 GB, N wifi, HSDPA+ 3G data speeds up to 21 Mbps, stereo Bluetooth, dual front and rear cameras for video calls/conferencing, full support for Flash video, and a removable battery.In reading some review comments, some people had problems with a) getting a Rogers phone from Canada that had locking problems and b) short battery life times. The phone I purchased was/is clearly an AT&T; phone with the AT&T; logo on the front, so no problem there. As for battery times, mine lasts a full day with my regular light use, a few phone calls, a little checking email, some web browsing, and wifi on all day at home or work. But I also carry an add-on microUSB plug-in battery pack just in case I ever need some extra juice.The only negative thing I have to say about this phone is the keyboard... Yikes!!! What was Samsung thinking? They create one of their few modern smartphone models with a hardware slid-out keyboard (which clearly would be aimed at users such as myself who REALLY want a smartphone with a keyboard) and then they create a pretty crappy one. Don't get me wrong -- the keyboard is functional and does work. But as others have noted, the flat keypad surfaces aren't particularly tactile and the key-press on the keys is BAD... When typing but not looking, sometimes you press a key and it doesn't register at all. Then you go back and press again, and sometimes it registers multiple presses. It really slows down your ability to type as quickly as a hardware keypad ought to allow.So what I've found is...for a lot of the instant/chat messaging I do, I end up using the on-screen keyboard, which is very responsive and the keys are large enough on-screen to fit with my fingers thanks to the Glide's 4 inch screen. But for emails and longer things, I still end up using the hardware keyboard. The more you use it, the more accustomed you'll get to its limitations and key press style. But Samsung REALLY could and should have done better.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone freezes during startup", "Author": "Melissa G.", "ReviewID": "R2JWSI79HKNV0V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the second phone thru this seller.

I got this phone from the seller CellPhonesCheap.  This phone is exactly what I was looking for in a phone and I mean EXACTLY. I love the phone and all its features. It takes awesome pictures! Love the slide keyboard! Tons of storage space. I was able to download educational apps for my child and I to play together. I could rave on and on! Unfortunately, the seller sold me a phone that I honestly feel was a lemon and/or a poorly refurbished device. The screen constantly had glitches running through it. It would lock up several times per day to the point where I would have to take the protective casing off, then the back, then take battery out! It also had other strange little glitches.I tried to give the phone a chance and hoped that I could learn to live with the kinks, but why should I do that when I paid good hard earned money? I should get what I was told I would be getting!  I properly went through amazon to contact the seller. I gave extreme details as to what the problem was. Every answer I received took 24-48 hours. The responses were maximum 2 sentences and very vague! I explained that I liked the phone and asked if I got them to send me another one would I get the thirty day return period again. I got a yes. Now, I was told that I had TWO days to send that phone back in order to stay within my 30 day return period. It cost me almost 10 bucks at the post office to ensure it got there on time. Do you think they showed me the same respect in returning my money or sending me a new phone or even an email saying they got the phone? NOPE. I waited two weeks to get my refund or a box at my door with a new product. I corresponded again asking if I was going to get a refund or a new phone. A day later I was asked, \"Well which do you prefer?\"  Hello, I already answered that!  I politely sent a response giving them positive criticism on proper customer service and how I feel that they have not been respectful to me as a customer even though I had been so easy going to them. I told them that I had paid extra to make sure the product was there at their demanded date and asked if they could show the same respect in returning my money so I could get a reliable phone! I get a response with a half-baked apology then asking me if I returned the phone! Also asked for tracking number.REALLY? Can they be anymore obvious that they are stalling returning my money!?!  I had already complained about the defective product to Amazon since they did not respond to any of my initial contacts. I called amazon again to complain about this run around nonsense. The rep could see all the correspondence between CellPhonesCheap and me. He said that I definitely did everything correctly and that all criteria was met to file a claim against the seller!My recommendation before buying this product or any other product on amazon is to pay attention to seller reviews. Take notice of how many customers actually rated them. Read seller reviews!  Sometimes you may have to pay a few extra bucks for a seller with tons of great reviews!  If you don't want a defective product and the completely frustrating and obvious run around from a seller, put CellPhonesCheap on your DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER list!", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone locked to Rogers", "Author": "Susan Jung Choi", "ReviewID": "R5T1YM4T345SV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is sold as unlocked but is actually locked.

I mainly wanted my new phone to be able to use the internet and access my e-mail, so my AT&T; salesman suggested I buy a smartphone.  I selected this phone mainly because it was the only smartphone in the store that came with a QWERTY button keyboard. I didn't like the idea of typing on a screen, so I wanted to make sure I would still have some feel of my older phone. However, I NEVER use the slide-out button keyboard. I just find it easier to type on-screen.  I also was fearful that it would be difficult for me to understand how to navigate through and use the phone, but within the first 2 days, I had completely gotten used to it.Overall, I think it is a pretty good phone that does the jobs that I want it to. I would recommend it especially for someone who has not had a smartphone before and/or doesn't want an extremely expensive/fancy phone.Pros: The phone is easily navigable, has decent storage, works/loads quickly, and is a good size (fits easily in my hand). The camera quality is also great (you won't need your digital camera anymore because you can just use the phone.) You can easily share pictures you take through messaging, e-mail, social media sites, etc.Cons: The one major con is the battery life. Even if I use the phone moderately, sometimes I still need to use my car charger during the day. Other minor cons are that you can't delete some of the pre-installed apps, and if you don't buy a case for it, it will get scratched up pretty quickly.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Testing", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R1FVLNYGLVY3R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its actually a good phone, I thought it wouldn't.

Baz", "ReviewID": "RKFFMXT1XAWM9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I figured I'd wait to write a review because I'm sure the product works wonderfully when you've had it for a week, which I believe is where I went wrong with this phone.  I read the reviews from people that had it for a week or less and went on that.I purchased this Samsung because my last phone was a Samsung, which I really liked, and I wanted an Android phone that still had a slide-out keyboard.  This is my first touch-screen phone, and I was very hesitant to make the switch, but if I was going to be locked into a two-year contract I wanted to have something current.  (I don't trade phones in - I buy them and use them until my contract expires.)I'm impressed with the features on the phone - being able to download a huge variety of apps (for free!) is awesome.  I have several that I use daily, and the phone loads pages and content quickly.  With that being said, because this is my first \"fancy phone\", I find a lot of the minor details irritating.  For example, if I use the camera to take a self-portrait and don't use the lesser-quality front-facing camera, it's very easy to bump the \"home\" button when trying to simply take a picture.  The phone will also randomly shut off.  I've had several instances where I have absolutely no connection at all for no reason, so I have to power down the phone, remove the battery and SIM cards, restart the phone, and sometimes have to repeat the process to finally be able to text.While the texting function is fairly easy to use, the phone will randomly perform functions (such as going into a calendar I've never seen before) during texting when you make certain keystrokes.  This is, by far, the most annoying thing the phone does.  I have to power it down and restart it or else it will continue do the same thing, although I've found if I use the touch-screen keypad it will stop.  (I bought the phone for the slide-out keyboard.  I hate using the touch-screen keypad.)I suppose I'm happy with it, but I do miss my old Samsung.  Although the technology is wonderful, it's a pain sometimes when I want to do something quickly.  I'm also discovering new functions all the time, which is cool.  Would I recommend it?  If you're like me and still want a normal keyboard, yes, as long as you can be patient.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad exp", "Author": "vik", "ReviewID": "R1OTKFNQB4YK2X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not able to update this device to jelly beans because still its searching for update in att i hate because it's jail broken not factory unlocked", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was not happy at all!!!!", "Author": "Rita miranda", "ReviewID": "R1GXMMCN2WM6H0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had to pay over $50.00 to get it unlocked and that is just not right specially how it read unlocked for any GSM carrier  well it was a lie and I bought it from PORTABLE GUY and paying that much money for it yep I was mad.

It sadly stopped working due to one of my own personal errors.So i looked and looked, and i found this as its replacement! I ABSOLUTELY have no complaints about the phone in general.. here are some of the problems I faced when getting this phone.I ordered it on july 3rd, 2012, paid for express delivery shipping, the seller shipped it after three days and an e-mail explaining i was buying it as a birthday present, she shipped it that very night at 6pm. The phone is exactly the shape she said it would be and i am pleased with the screen, normally used phones have scratches if even minor, and it does not have a scratch in the screen at all. Overall, i would buy from the seller again, only thing is she listed it in an unlocked phone placement, not a big deal considering I can do that myself anyway... HOWEVER...It took The USPS 14 days to get it right, i filed a claim against them because i was tired of waiting for the phone!  I paid a lot of money for it. I Would rather have my packages shipped to me via another means like fedex or UPS. This was a joke and currently i feel the postal service should repay me the $33.67 it cost to get the express 2nd business day shipping, back to my account as I feel lied to and believe that they should have to pay for their own mistake..Other than that, i can't say much yet about the phone in general, i just got it today and will come update my review for it as soon as i get to test it out a while.Thanks for reading, stay tuned for updates!", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "New Samsung Captivate glide i927\nphysical slideout keyboard android\n8 mega pixel camera\nupgradable to ice cream sandwich 4.0\nwifi gps bluetooth light weighted", "Name": "Samsung I927 Captivate Glide AT&T 3G 4G Unlocked for Any GSM Carrier Touchscreen and QWERTY", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHeTiJd2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007BIJJRO"}}
