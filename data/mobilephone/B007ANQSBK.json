Its small compact and does what I want it to do , make and receive phone calls period. I was looking for a better camera, I think it has a 1.3 mega pixel, which is poor. The sound quality is fine but the biggest disappointment is the battery life. My old phone would last a week on stand by, this one only 2-3 days. I bought a new battery for it so maybe this will change, for now I just turn it off. THe one real positive was the condition of the phone , no scratches clean through and through.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
