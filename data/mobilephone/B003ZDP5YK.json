Very fast and the applications shipped with are great specially Ultra Sense.the only two not very good areas are:* the cover for the sim card and for the battery are very thing and delicate.* the battery may drain off very fast on heavy usage. If you have more than 2 bateries the problem with the covers arises as you have to change the battery constantly.* I could not find external chargers for additional batteries.Besides that is even better than an iPhone 4.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wife loves it.", "Author": "Travelling Guy", "ReviewID": "R1QCYPVUADVV5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently live overseas and cell phones can be quite expensive.  Since I am in the military, the contract route wasn't an option and they don't exactly have \"military clauses\" on the contracts here in Europe for us.  The wife was really wanting an iPhone 4, but I couldn't see spending $900 or so for a phone.  However, we did stumble across an HTC phone display here and I really liked what I saw when we picked up the HTC Desire HD.  I spent a lot of time comparing between this and the Samsung Galaxy.  The Galaxy was similiary priced at the time and had a beautiful display, but felt cheap when compared to the solidily designed Desire HD.I personally haven't used the phone much, but the wife absolutely loves it.I do have one complaint about the phone.  The battery cover doesn't seem to slide back on right after you intially install the battery.  The factor condition of the phone can't be replicated when you reinsert the cover.  It's no biggie, since we have it in a cover.  However, it was one of those things that irked me considering how much money we spent on it.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "HTC DESIRE HD JUST STICKS TO EDGE", "Author": "Samson Keenja", "ReviewID": "R33WZ4GE0PX3XZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just received my HTC Desire HD, this is my third phone from HTC the last being HTC HD7. From its description the desire seemed to be another great phone from HTC however after two days of using it, I have different opinion because it constantly sticks to edge network even in areas with 3G network. As a result internet connection is painfully slow, while viewing internet videos is almost impossible (unless you have nothing else to do apart from waiting).This phone ought be different, it should be able to automatically select the best available network.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nope.

A pleasant surprise, as always. It's a pretty quick phone, and since it's unlocked I got to teach myself how to mess with the APN settings. (I panicked at first, but it ended up not being a big deal.) Nice big screen, very responsive. The only issues I have is that I had no idea what color of this phone I was getting, they come in brown, and occasionally black. I couldn't find anywhere in the description what color I was getting! I didn't care one way or another about the color so it wasn't a big deal, but I still wouldn't have minded knowing. (It was brown, for the record.) My only other issue is that the dumb headset that comes with it is kind of.....broken. KIND OF. I have to twist the headset cord a certain way to get audio through both ear buds. I can replace the headset for not very much though, so not a big deal, but still kind of disappointing. Other than those two issues, I'm really enjoying my new toy!!", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Yll", "ReviewID": "R2IRN7UNGWLR4D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got exactly what I bought.

The only difference between a iPhone and this HTC is the warranty. I have a lot of things that is from apple. The warranty/customer support made the difference.
