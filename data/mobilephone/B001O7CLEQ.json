And in a household full of \"smart phones,\" mine is the only one that will reliably (1) make and receive calls, and (2) send and receive text messages. People make fun of me for using such an old-school phone, but I tell every single one of them, \"You will pry this phone from my cold dead fingers.\"Other perks: It's tiny -- even by flip-phone standards. It fits almost anywhere, and you can tuck it into your pocket without fear of breaking it or dropping it into the toilet. And when you're really mad, you can slam it closed for emphasis. Try doing that with a smart phone :)I've had great luck with accessories -- car charger, wall charger, hands-free unit, etc. Inevitably, the phone outlasts the accessories.

Holcombe", "ReviewID": "R18APS1WYUS8E6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is most likely suitable for the people who aren't tech-savvy, young kids as a first phone, or seniors. I had this phone as my first phone in 4th grade 3 years ago, and its features are very limited. The battery life isn't good, but it's probably because I texted a lot when I had it, averaging about 50-60 texts per day. I had mine on a post-paid account on a FamilyShare plan with my parents, who were not knowledgeable on the topic of phones at that time. They weren't into email on the phone, or the ability to access the Internet. They wanted to get me a cheap phone that was modeartely durable because I used to break a lot of electronics accidentally. Seeing as I was begging for a phone, and they saw it was free with a 2-yr contract, they bought 3 of then for the 3 of us. When my contract was up at the beginning of last year, I bought a Chocolate Touch, because the plain flip phone was kind of uncool. So, it's probably better for older people or young kids who don't use their phones a lot, because I used to use mine a lot, and it drained the battery pretty quickly. Many more parents are making kids get phones like this now, seeing as Verizon charges $9.99 or $29.99 for the data plan on most phones.
