Willard", "ReviewID": "RJZYTRD4FM2IM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will first admit that my review is a bit skewed since I have never had a smartphone. My cellphones have all been oldschool until now so having my first android phone is a new thing.That said:Quality of manufacturing - When I fist saw it, I thought it's smaller than I expected but, as for it's durability, I can give a fine example. I dropped it on accident last night from about 5 ft up as I took my coat off. It flew about 5-6 ft away from me and crashed to the ground on a stone floor. It broke into 3 pieces, phone, back plate and battery. Everyone gasped. I put it back together and inspected it. Not a scratch or dent on it. It turned back on and ran fine with no problems. I immediately texted a friend to test it out. Works.Ease of use - I have big hands so typing messages on the keypad is annoying but not difficult. The settings/options are different than my old Net10 phone but it just takes some maneuvering.The only negative other than having big hands and it's a small phone is, I can't get the internet to connect at all. That means no apps. It DOES have a very limited internal memory so the reviews saying it has no internal memory are false. I already put a 4gb microSD card in it and have a 16gb card on standby. I think it will hold up to 32gb cards.Not a bad phone and will be better once I get Net10 on the phone to activate my internet options.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever had!", "Author": "lldoyle", "ReviewID": "R1Q9G932XTNFNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this phone almost 2 years ago and am still using it today and I love it!!

At the current price, I no longer recommend it. I now recommend this nearly identical phone for $50: LG L35G Android Prepaid Phone (Net10)I tested the smartphone for very specific purpose: to see if it can help people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) or Fibromyalgia manage their health and improve their life (as I describe in this article on Health Rising: [...]Overall, I'm thrilled with how well this smartphone works to complete the basic tasks I tested it for. The following tasks worked well on it:* journaling using AK Notepad together with Google Speech recognition* taking notes with Evernote,* making calls using Skype over Wi-Fi // Update: I ran into trouble using Skype on this phone the other day. Restarting the phone and running only Skype, no other applications, fixed the issue. If you're on a budget, I still recommend this phone, but if you have $150 to spend, I'd buy a higher-end phone. Skype is an important app to work on your phone, and restarting your phone can be a bit of a hassle.* tracking one's sleep with Sleep as Android* track one's heart rate with the Endomondo app and the Zephyr HxM Bluetooth Wireless Heart Rate Sensor, an android-compatible heart-rate monitor.This said, there are also many thinks this phone can't do. I'm not holding this against it, as the phone does the things I asked of it really well. I still think you should know about the things it can't do, in case your budget is not as tight and you might want to have a phone that excells at everything.* The screen is probably the phone's weakest point. To read comfortably the journal entries in my AK Notepad app, I had to increase the font size. This was okay for what I wanted to do, but would definitely be a problem if you want to use the phone as a reading device. Also, the screen was not good enough to really enjoy watching YouTube videos.* The phone comes without a headset, so I recommend that you buy  - this $5 headset (Samsung Ehs44Assbe 3.5Mm Stereo Earbud Headset With Answer Button High Performance) and  - this headset clip (Bose\u00ae SIE2 Sport Headphones Clothing Clip - Dark Gray), to really enjoy listening to audiobooks or music on it.* The system memory of the device was full once I had installed all the application needed for managing chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. If you need the smartphone for purposes other than managing your health, the limited system memory will likely become a problem.Therefore, if you have sufficient funds , which many people with ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia don't, you might want to look into buying a brand-new smart phone that does not have these limitations. For example, you might want to look into the Samsung Galaxy S4, or as a happy medium, a second-hand Samsung galaxy S2. To to safely purchase a secondhand device, you might want to try doing it through the online service swappa.In summary, I will still rate this smart phone five stars, because it does the job I need it for really well: it provides all the functionality someone with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia needs to manage their health and life, and it does so at an incredibly affordable price.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it!!!", "Author": "Danielle", "ReviewID": "R15NFKLSY2O1WT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my phone for a couple months now and have had no problems with it. it is a really good phone to be cheap. anyone looking for a cover for your phone go to fatorder.com or look under the L3 E400, its a different name but same phone, anyways overall, this is a great phone and i would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a cheap smartphone.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good phone with one big limitation", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "R1CBSD2CQXRSWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned it for a few days now and here's what I like / don't like:it gets great reception, has a good battery, integrates well with other bluetooth devices, and overall works as expected.However, when I made the purchase, I bought three of them (for myself and family members) and two of them had bad sim cards. An easy and free fix but a bit of an annoyance.You should also be aware that the system memory is very low - like an unheard of 150mb.  All apps by default are placed in this memory and it fills up quick. You can manually move apps to the 1gb phone memory, but not all apps you download can be moved.  Increasing the size of the micro sd card has no effect on this limitation.I gave four stars because of this limitation, however if I had known I probably still would have made the purchase because of the price, size and weight.

Apps work well with it such as pandora, which is a great bonus. At first I thought the screen didn't move when turned sideways but that's only on the home screen. The internet feels like your old phone and not like what the newer smartphones or tablets would present to you. But its definitely a great phone if it's your first smartphone. Battery life isn't the best if heavly using like you would your older phones then it doesn't compare for battery life, probally because it is a smart phone, but if your more of a lighter user it last long enough to get you through the day. you have to download apps to put your own ringtones on the phone but it does work well with apps. will definitely enjoy this phone for a long time. they also throw in a surprise 4 gb micro sd card!Pros: compasitive touch feels like all other smartphones, great first smartphone, you get more than your moneys worth, comes with a 4gb micro sd card which is a great plus if you havn't purchased one yet, works great with apps, not too slow with normal service.

You have to punch it really hard to make it connect.The sound is pretty good on outgoing calls but not so hot on some of the incoming calls. The voice playback on voice mail is awful. It is a gravelly voice that is difficult to understand. Not on all calls but on automated calls. I got a rubbery cover with a small stylus and that has saved me from losing a call or dialing the correct number. It is hard to get your fingers directly over the number or letter. You have to aim for the upper part of the letter. Now that I am getting used to its idiosyncracies, it is getting easier to use. The battery life is not too bad for a phone like this and I like that there is an app that tells you where the battery is being used the most. Most of it is standby for me. I have to charge the phone every other day because when the battery starts going down, it goes fast. Part of my complaints may be because this is my first smart phone and I just am not used to the little nitty gritty details that go with a smart phone. I will post a better feedback in a few months after I have used it awhile.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's great", "Author": "K.Y.", "ReviewID": "R2TLPYQJ25KCIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a nice small prepaid touchscreen phone for the price. I really like the design and it's nice smooth feel ,and also the color, brand and carrier. I have never had any problems using net10. It has good coverage and your not locked into a contract. The phone is easy to use and works fine. You can upload pictures and websites in a decent amount of time . You can call, text, check your email, take pictures or open your browser from your home screen, and you can check which apps are running. The camera is decent and I believe you can upload your pictures to a computer using the usb cord , or send them by sharing.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome....", "Author": "Maribel", "ReviewID": "R2X2GYL7MX1QCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking at this phone for six months, and finally decided to buy it when I saw they had lowered it to $49.99.

I have loved the Android operating system since I got the first Droid phone through Verizon 3 years ago, but in recent times I needed a less expensive monthly bill. So I switched to net10 and have had no problems with their service, but in terms of this phone, you get what you pay for in terms of hardware...The pros about this phone are that it has excellent battery life, there are some days I don't even need to plug it in. Android runs smooth on it, the home screens flow nicely. Its pretty bare bones which is also nice, doesn't come pre loaded with junk apps like the phones from Verizon etc...Like I said, you get what you pay for with the hardware... the phone is plastic all the way around. Which isn't such a bad thing I guess... helps keep the price under $100, but also the processor is a bit slow, again probably doesn't matter since its running an older version of Android.What prompted me to write this review was the fact that I got a scratch on the screen, which I literally have no idea how it happened, seriously... I should also add that I am very kind to my devices, I'm never clumsy with them or drop them, I always keep them in good condition and have never needed to use screen protectors or cases or anything.The screens resolution is not good . I went from the Droid 3 to this though, so my eyes had to adjust, and they did, but this is the same resolution as the very first Androids on the market from 4 years ago. Again, reflected in the price of this phone...Overall, I would maybe this to someome new to smartphones, who is also on a budget and literally can't afford anything else.
