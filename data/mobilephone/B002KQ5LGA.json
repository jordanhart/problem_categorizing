So refrained from Iphones and vu/touch phones as one was mostly tied to a provider data plan or had to pay a premium for the phone itself.If you dont care about 3g (read data plan 29.99 a month) or GPS there cannot be a better phone at this price range. Solidly built, some reviews complained about back cover. I do see an issue there as it get on the phone with little notches on all sides. But how may times you open that. Specially when SIM/SDHC is accessible from outside. The only time you need to open the back cover is when you install a battery.What I love about this phone in order of preference.Form Factor (It looks like a phone and not a PDA)Not tied to a provider or unlocked so you dont have to be geeky searching for unlocking/jail breaking articles.Wifi 54G (email is good on the run)Quad Band GSM World PhoneMedia/Music playback is excellent.Can go upto 16GB Micro SDHC (plenty of music or videos) comes with 4Gig.Speaker phone and in general call quality for me increasd 3-5 times. (I used Razr before).Clear brilliant screenTouch pad responsive enoughPicture quality @3.2MP is good in daylight and flash comes in handy for pictures in lowlight (subject @2-4 ft).What I will look for in future revisions.USB Charging capabilityA little thinner (Not that is fat right now) but it would make it sweeter.Total Alloy body including back cover for a more solid feel.Maybe a more rugged look/feel (non piano black or non shiny finish for e.g Zune kind of finish or finish with more friction), I always get a feeling I am going to drop it.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "a great nokia touch phone", "Author": "Gnome your role", "ReviewID": "R2EL03TSEHTZ1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After carefully reading reviews on similar unlocked phones like the Cookie and even higher end Nokia models like the N97, I ultimately decided to go with the 5530 Xpressmusic. I was definitely in need of a new phone as I had basically a dinosaur for a cell phone. I wanted a few things from my new phone which were:1. a modern, sleek touchscreen design2. an unlocked phone compatible with my SIM3. a phone that works when it should and is easy to learn to useThe Nokia 5530 xpressmusic was all of this and so much more. I find it to be very functional - I have not had a dropped call or any problems with the interface itself. The touchscreen is very easy and fun to use. Once you get used to it, you will be able to navigate the phone very easily. I find the screen to be very responsive, although sometimes I do like to use the stylus. However, I must say it is important to follow the user guide - I have done that and the phone has been so much fun! It does not have GPS or 3G compatibility - however, I was not looking for these things. I can live with 2G and actually a recent firmware update has made the phone run even faster, even online. It comes with a 4GB memory card which can be upgraded to 16GB - so plenty of room to store things. The absolute best part of this phone, as the name suggests, is the music player. The quality of the sound is absolutely incredible and the phone was designed for music lovers in mind. In fact, one of pre-loaded videos even refers to the device as a \"music player that is also a phone!\". Music on this phone sounds better than many higher end models that my friends have. They are quite jealous! A set of headphones also come with the phone that I have found to be of average/slightly above average quality. The camera and video are also pretty impressive, not amazing, but still pretty good quality for this phone.The only reason I knocked a star off is the battery. Battery life seems to get depleted quickly , sometimes way too quickly, so the phone must be charged each night or you risk having a dead battery by noon the next day. I have tried all of the optimization tricks to get more life out of the battery and still it is rather short.So if you are looking for an affordable alternative touchscreen phone with some interesting features and easy interface, this phone has been a joy and is the way to go. An iphone killer? I wouldn't go that far at all, but with many similar features and similar touchscreen feel, it is a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to pay $400 for a phone.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "great phone + music player for the price", "Author": "V.A. \"i hate cell phone companies\"", "ReviewID": "R3OKLQZKTGKZ8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been playing with the phone for several days and I absolutely love it for the $199 I paid.  Of the features I was interested in, here are my opinions on them:0) very easy to setup this unlocked phone -- I took a SIM card from a Tmobile prepaid phone and inserted into this nokia and it self-configured everything for me (a relief for me as this was my first time buying an unlocked phone).  Now that I know the cell coverage is good in my brick-walled condo, I'll swap this SIM card for a cheap $30 Tmobile monthly plan SIM card, and fully expect this to be a quick swap1) perfect size -- fits in a shirt or pants pocket easily, is lightweight, and easy enough for my stubby fingers to hold and operate.  hard to operate this with gloves on though (e.g., on a ski slope)2) music player and FM player are *very high* fidelity, especially compared to other players out there.  A couple of caveats though -- the earphones that come with it are only average for sound quality, and I get much higher fidelity sound using my other set of compact Sony headphones.  Also, from what I can tell, the FM radio only works with headphones on -- you can't use the built-in speakers for radio.  The built-in speakers are a lot better in fidelity than other phones/players I've tried, but obviously this device is too small to accurately replicate bass using its built-in speakers.  Bass is fine with good headphones though.3) WLAN capability is fantastic.  With free WLAN everywhere, it's by far the cheapest way to access the net through the phone without a data plan (recall I'm doing this with a prepaid SIM card).  Note that the phone supports 2G (and not 3G), but with WLAN being much quicker downloads (e.g., 2-3 sec delay to start playing youtube videos) and usually free, I'm not interested in 3G.  video quality was surprisingly good for such a small device.  Reading email on yahoo was pretty easy, but required a few too many clicks too navigate within yahoo -- I wouldn't want to go through 40 email with this, but it's fine to scan my daily email and reply to just a few email.  I had been planning on buying a nettop and WLAN scanner as well, but this phone already does both of those functions well enough for me so I won't be buying either anymore.4) instruction guide that came with it could really use some work.  if you're new to Nokia (like me), it was tougher to figure out than other cell phones I've used (sony ericsson, motorola, and panasonic).  the back cover is annoyingly badly designed as others have remarked, and the instructions were nearly useless for getting that cover off and back on again.  i'll probably seek out google searches for this device before i use the instruction guide in the future.5) comes with 4G memory card, but the slot is in a bit of an odd place.  my other phones usually kept it in the back with the SIM card and battery, but this places it in the side.  it's really an odd design, but since I don't plan to swap memory cards all too often, not a huge issue for me.6) battery life is average.  my previous sony ericsson gave me a 10 hour talk time, and this phone probably gives about half that, and even less if you go crazy with WLAN, etc.  so i'll probably end up buying a second charger so I can keep one at work and home (I listen to music all day at work with it)7) phone lacks AM radio and GPS.  sports broadcasts are often on AM -- would have liked if they added that in.  GPS would have been nice, but alas, all these things would have probably raised the price toooverall, i'm really happy with this phone given its price -- it gives me all the features I really need without forcing me in to expensive cell phone data plans with the wireless companies.  its music player capabilities beat out even the $400 phones/players, and if you're willing to live without a few features, this is a great phone for the price -- plus you won't feel as bad if you damage it", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Concerning Battery Life", "Author": "J.

I had used it for three days without not much if hickups expect for some restarts which happened when i browse the web in my wifi. I will start with my feed back for the three days i used without much problem first.1 - The phone looks good for the price.2 - The v10 firmware is useless and its a must to upgrade the firware to v11 or v20 (latest) so that most of the things work smoothly.3 - The touch screen is quite responsive and the features provided are also good. We can add 20 contacts in the home screen for faster dialling( this feature was problematic in v10 firmware but once i upgraded to v20 its worked smoothly to perfection)4 - The music player is awesome. Mainly due to the excellent earphones. The music player also had problems in v10 but worked without any hiccups in v20.5- Battery life is not much and you will need to recharge it daily but the recharge time is really fast and the phone recharges within a hour to nearly full. (1 got only 16 hours - 8 hours in wifi and then 1 hour in game etc)6 - Connecting to wifi crashed in v10 of the firmware but worked fine even after long usage after i upgraded to v20.7 - Kinetic scrolling rocks. It much smoother once u upgrade.But after three days of usage the phone stopped been a phone i.e. the main use of a phone is to take calls and to dial others but whenever i take a call or try to call another no the phone just switches off. ya just like that. I tried resetting it to factory settings, i tried reinstalling the firmware , did everthin but the problem is still persisting. I came to know tht lot of people are facing such issues and mostly it seems its a hardware problem in which the speaker is earthing itself and the phone switches off. Its really diifcult when u come to know that the problem is hardware and nokia didnt take the care to check the quality of its product as lot of people are facing these issuesAnyway i have asked amazon for an exchange. Hope this new phone which comes is defect free.For anyone who is planning to buy this phone i wont recommend it now until nokia sloves all the problems but after tht this phone is definetly a buy.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I wanted to like this phone, really I did...", "Author": "Sergio R Schubert", "ReviewID": "R2XEH6C24N4RN6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I kept the phone about 20 days - but ultimately decided to send it back.1) The Symbian OS - it's dead, Nokia is switching to Maemo Linux and I fear that does not bode well for future app development, as it is - the selection of quality applications for SymbianS60v5Touch is pretty thin (though most of the basics are there)2) Buggy OS - would frequently get \"unknown error\" when trying to use the camera - I don't want to reboot my phone and wait 2 minutes+ to take a picture - this is likely to be addressed in a hopefully forthcoming OS update but I don't want to take that gamble3) Most of the OS is touch optimized, but like Windows Mobile (and perhaps exacerbated by my fat fingers and the phone's small screen size - sometimes you just MUST use the stylus.4) I HATE where the stylus is - I'm right handed - I hold the phone in my left. To get to the stylus I had to hold it in my right hand, pull part of the case off and work the stylus out from the phones lower left corner with my fingernail. The stylus doesn't \"auto home\" it's flatish not round, so unlike a palm, it won't rotate into place as you push it in - it needs to be oriented correctly then pushed in.5) the case back feels cheap, flimsy and prone to breakage - it's not a big deal - but is potentially an indicator that corners were cut in the industrial design - the phone was built to a price. If you keep it in a skin case - you'll never notice. Without a case - it creaks like cheap plastic when you grip the phone.6) the touchscreen is better than what was average a few years back - but it's still a resistive touchscreen - once you use a capacitive touchscreen, you'll realize how much resistive sucks as a technology. Often launched someones info card when trying to swipe across carousel.7) General OS weirdness - some installed apps cannot be removed to save space. The more you load onto main memory - even if the applications aren't running - the more the phone slows down, it went from feeling new and lithe to old an bloated within a week. As I deleted apps to prep it for sending back, it got more and more responsive again8) Leaves all your personal data on it when you \"reset to factory configuration\" Bad Form Nokia. Bad Form!9) USB charging - See \"designed to a price\" above - I hate that it came with a fiddly hard plastic latch over the USB port and with only a 4\" sync cable - but most of all that it won't charge over USB - in fact it drains power when hooked up to the USB but not the charger - so much so that it will be dead if you leave it hooked up overnight.10) Fiddly media player - sometimes you rip a movie and it plays - sometimes not with the exact same settings - too unpredictable11) Motion sensors are brain dead - you tilt your hand a bit and the screen rotates for no apparent reason.12) Nokia's OVI store - I won't get into specifics - but it sucks.My criticisms seem petty, I know. But it's the little things day in and day out that will eventually get on your nerves.Plusses:1) Fast USB2 implementation - songs and videos load really quick from computer2) surprisingly good headphones3) surprisingly good music player for a non iPod/Phone4) small - reasonably sturdy build construction5) Wi-Fi - though the implementation for selecting a base station is kinda suckky6) Camera is decent and the LED Flash is a nice touch[...] it's actually a pretty solid deal compared to the crap replacement phones T-Mobile and AT&T; will offer you if/when your's breaks.

There's no direct way to do it on the keypad without exiting and going to the 'insert symbol' tab and finding the symbol...very slow...also, names of people don't automatically get capitalized, neither does the word \"I\", so my messages look grammatically off every timefile manager:  still can't find where my photos are stored when I sync from my hard drive up to my phone.camera:  good, there's flash too which is nicewi-fi:  useful because I sync my calendar daily.  Now I don't have to use a separate organizer for my contacts and calendar.notes:  limited space, only allows a very short note to be inputtedalarm/screen/other features:  sometimes get stuck sideways and I have to restart the phone to get it back to normal, also, the alarm can't be turned off by just tapping the screen, it's pretty annoying in the morning when I have to restart the phone just to shut the alarm off.overall, the phone is functional and serves it's basic purpose as organizer/phone/camera, but because of the software issues such as inputting question marks, faulty alarm, stuck screen, I cannot give it 5 stars.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mediocre Defective product - Poor customer service", "Author": "Hari Gangadharan", "ReviewID": "R2XAXL12SHD37O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was a Nokia fan and always had Nokia phones - this phone disappointed me and I decided not to purchase anymore Nokia phones - Goodbye Nokia!My Problem with phone: The second week itself the headset stopped working. I should have returned my product right then. That was my mistake. Three months later, the phone started switching off whenever I make or receive a call. I sent it to the customer service paying the shipping charges and tracking options. The phone came back repaired. Even though I indicated that the headset is to be replaced or repaired, it came back as it is. Now I have a different complaint. The phone does not turn on! It freezes on the boot screen. I sent mails to Nokia through their website to which I get a reply that some one is looking into it and a manager would call me back but they never called. It is near impossible to escalate this issue. I do not see a point in spending more money shipping it back... Probably I will throw it and take that $250 loss. Nokia - listen -- You will never get any market share with this support.Now the review: The phone looks like a cheap Chineese knockoff. Looks so plasticky with a plastic flimsy screen.

I wanted a smallish phone with wifi connectivity and wanted to use it with my t-mobile sim.  I have had this phone for a couple of weeks.  It works great, call quality is better than my old phone, the web browsing works fine for lots of basic things.  I like it a lot.  Some problems with the phone:1.  Sometimes you tap once to do something, other times you need to tap twice.  I can't quite figure out the logic behind this, so I never really know.  Most of the time one tap is enough.  If it does not respond I tap again.  Sometimes you dont know if it really needs two taps or if the first tap was just not recognized by the phone.2.  This phone is not really mac compatible.  I was able to get my music onto it but it was much more labor intensive than syncing my iPod.Of these two, lack of mac compatibility is the most frustrating. I would love to plug my phone into my mac at night and have it sync everything up and charge the phone for me, ready for the next day.  Too bad.UPDATE 5/27/10Just wanted to update my review since I have gotten more used to using the phone.  I have become more acclimated to the phone and it's features and have basically gotten over the learning curve. I still really like the phone.  It really does everything I need.  I was not able to get the email function to work, but use the mobile yahoo mail via the web on the phone which works well, and have configured my work email to shoot a copy of everything to the yahoo account to easily navigate from wherever on my mobile.  Some issues:The phone froze on me once when I tried to end a call by sliding the key lock button instead of hitting the end call icon on the screen.The contacts view from the home screen disappears.  If I turn the phone off and on again it comes back, but a day or so later it will disappear again.  I dont make a lot of calls so this is not much of an issue.Transferring music is still a pain.  I ended up buying an extra charger to keep at work because the phone will kill its battery fairly quickly with regular use.I highly recommend this phone, and just ordered one for a relative.UPDATE 2, 9/1/10This phone got me totally hooked on owning a smartphone, but I kept running into walls.  I was never able to get the email app to work on  my phone, so I needed to check the yahoo mobile site to see if I had mail.  Push email is much better.  I was using the phone with a T-Mobile prepaid account, and they did not offer prepaid data, so I could only use several features if I was in a wifi hotspot.  Many of these are locked down and require you to register to use, which is a pain if you just want to check a movie time or your email.  I finally decided to get a 3g smartphone with a data plan to replace this device. I am a bit sad about that.  I was somewhat disappointed with the software on the 5530, the web browser would mysteriously crash for no reason, the phone would freeze up from time to time when completing a routine task, like ending a call.  I looked into all my options and ended up buying an iPhone 4 with an AT&T; plan.  I miss the calendar and to-do displays on the 5530.

The massive amount of applications that are available for nokia s60 v5 phones makes it awesome to use. Even stock this phone rules!! At first i was a little disappointed by the screen size. Having owned some touch screen phones. Samsung behold and samsung star. The screens of which are just a little bit wider. But after a couple of days i totally forgot about them. The wifi web surfing is awesome and even tho there is no 3g the edge connection is still actually quite fast. The fact that this phone has flash lite 3 installed while other newer  smart phones have still yet too is another point for nokia. Such as the mytouch or g1 which without completly hacking will not play flash videos on youtube. Of course flash videos over the stock web explorer take sometime to load unless your on wifi. Also the ability to install apps on the memory card instead of only on the phone is another point. :-) There are so many great features on this phone. Take the camera a 3.2 mp that completely destroys my samsungs 5 mp camera both for images and by far for videos. And for those who are social media addicts such as myself well your in luck with the apps available for facebook and twitter. Not to mention some that i don't use.  over all i would say anyone who is looking for a smart phone with a decent price should get this phone. I prefer nokia's os over windows samsung motorola or huwai. Those are all very disappointing compared to nokia's touch screen user interface.  on the downside...

However I had read many that said the phone's software had alot of problems, but I decided to give it a try anyways. It was fairly easy to use and I loved all the features it came with. The wifi was also very good and i enjoyed the fm radio and the headphones it came with.  Email setup was also really easy.  Unfortunately I soon found out that the software problems talked about on the discussions were not limited to a few phones as i'd hoped.Some things that bothered me were relatively insignificant like finding no way of adding my contacts from my sim card to the contacts bar unless i created a new contact, the build of the phone seemed a bit cheap, and the qwerty keyboard i found to be a bit too small for me even though i have skinny fingers.  Call quality was also not so great.  But what made it a dealbreaker for me was the several crashes, self reboots, and screen freezes it had...and that was only a week of fairly moderate to light usage.  At first i thought this might be due to a type of information overload thing as in maybe it only crashed while surfing the net or listening to music but not even, it crashed and restarted when i was doing something so basic as writing a text.  Specifically, going through Nokias Ovi store had a maximum of maybe 5 minutes if i was lucky, since it always crashed not too long after i entered the site. Not only did it crash and reboot several times, but the software was also really bug-y, for example when i went through my texts one by one the bar on the bottom would flicker every time i switched to the next, and the home screen would sometimes go a little nuts and have black lines or the name of the app i just exited floating in the middle? Probably more annoying than anything was the game of peekaboo i played every time a message notification popped up...since it popped up, then hid, then popped up again, then hid...it was only after a few of these that i could actually be able to hit the message notification and read my message. The phone sometimes lagged quite a bit, specifically the accelerometer when switching from portrait to landscape modes and the three keys on the bottom (call, home, end) had to be pressed especially hard.I decided to go into the Nokia discussion boards to possibly find a solution to the phones not so great software.  What i found was an overwhelming number of people with the same problems (crashes, freezes, restarting), who have been waiting for a software update that would fix the bugs on the phone since it was released...and that was around 6+ months ago...after reading this i decided i was definitely not going to be a sitting duck and wait for Nokia to maybe decide to fix what someone described as a \"half-baked\" product and i agree. I am not a tech-y person at all, in fact this was my first 'smartphone' and my first time using a touchscreen and it was so disappointing.  If i'm paying money for something i expect it to work properly and not have to deal with something that was sloppily put together. I only had it for a week...i cant imagine it lasting more than a month.  Im currently awaiting on my refund.In conclusion, it really is sad because had the phone been properly manufactured or the bugs been fixed, it would've been an awesome phone.UPDATE 1/17/10:i got my refund promptly and i then ordered the Nokia e63...in my opinion its been everything the 5530 could have been had it been fixed minus the touchscreen...have had it for a few weeks now and its been great...would definitely recommend the e63 to anyone who was as disappointed with the 5530 as i was.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst nokia ever", "Author": "Raymond A.

I think that the pros, including the price, outweigh the problems.Pros (for me):NO data plan required!  I really wanted a new touchscreen phone with smartphone capabilities, but everybody REQUIRES you to add one of their $25-$30 data plans on top of your calling plan.  I could not justify paying $300+ a year just to surf the net on my phone.  My $5.99 Tzones package works just fine for checking my email and getting on the internet when I absolutely need to (because it is pretty slow).Touchscreen.  It has one.  That's about all I can say because I don't care for it too much (looks great but don't like the feel of it).WIFI.  Great being able to access the internet from WIFI connections at home, work, and some restaurants.Loud Ringer, vivid screen, sounds good, able to watch movies and listen to music.Price - It was only $[...] after the current rebate ($[...]).  Couldn't find anything that comes close for that price with the features this has (without signing a contract)CONS:Feels kind of cheap (thinner plastic, loose back cover or battery moving around inside).The touchscreen is soft and nowhere near as responsive as my Itouch.It drops my Bluetooth calls after a few minutes.
