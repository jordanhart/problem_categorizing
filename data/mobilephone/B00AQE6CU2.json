It worked great in France (with Orange) and the Google Maps/Navigation was fantastic while driving through Normandy! It didn't even cost me anything on my SIM credit! I'm now using it in Kuala Lumpur without any problems. It is not an iPhone, but it does have the features I needed and does the job well. It is light and relatively small. Note, if you are traveling abroad and just want to make calls from your hotel room (or other places with internet) then the US iPhone works fine using the internet connection (FaceTime, iMessage, etc.). But if you need a SIM card to use the phone on the go, then this one works great.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well...its not that bad", "Author": "JyK1991", "ReviewID": "R2ZL65R9O5JS3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay...CONS:its just a 3' phone... but it fits in my small hands... but I wish the pixels were more.. because Youtube Videos or whatever videos and even the screen is not that that clear.. but like 480p!It kinda hangs in between.... It bothers me sometimes... but sometimes I don't give a damnYoutube: Sometimes closes on its own..Skype: I don't know maybe its the other end.. but doesn't connect that well... Maybe its a bug in Skype.. not the phone..Broswer: Since it is 3' screen.. browsing is hard...Pictures: YUCK.. So effing blurry... but then I again.. I knew its 3MP Camera.. (3.15 actually.. whatever difference it makes)so dont expect HiGh quality pics... it sucks!PROS:Design: SLEEK and stylish... loved it!!Touch screen is excellent...Speed is okay.. I have been using it for just week now...Options are okay.. clear and precise..Thank god it has Wi-Fi.. cuz I don't want to pour out money for data plans.. I use hotspots at home, my college campus and wherever they have free ones...Its not a $200+ phone.. so don't get your hopes up too high.. Keep it low and then let this phone impress you...Its a budget phone.. I know I will be using this for the next 3 years.. so I am gonna be gentle with itHope this helped..

Amat \"Mugetsu\"", "ReviewID": "R1TDZUCHNWXZKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ATTENTION THIS PHONE WILL NOT WORK ON ANY USA CARRIERS 3G/4G!!!!GSM EDGE ONLY!Okay...with that out of the way...The only people who should be considering this phone are...1. Those who ARE or are looking to get OUT OF,  $80 a month 2 year contracts.2. Those tired of the \"Is that a mini tablet in your pocket or  are you just happy to see me\" syndrome.3. Those tired of said mini tablet going flaccid at most inopportune  times do to \"awesome 10 hour!\" battery life...(but its got a 4.5\"  screen!!)4. Those honestly over the whole can't live with out 3G!!  smartphone fad. BUT would still like to keep a phone with  Smartphone Android capabilities.The L3 is LG's smallest of the \"L\" series (L for luxury...lol)Phones, with the larger L5 and the mini tablet L7.This phone is compact but not tiny, wide and slightly thickerthan todays slate like phones (The Moto Triumph for example)It feels good in the hand unless you have the hands of a 10year old.Running Gingerbread 2.3 + a Qualcom snapdragon, modestlyclocked at 800mghz and 157mb of system RAM, it's not going to\"hang with your buddies dual core Droidz XXX\" but for whatit is...it's pretty snappy, smooth and responsive.This is not a phone to load up with fluff, the core neededapps are there, so only the essentials should be installed.Reception is great (from 1 to 5 a 4) the rest of the radiosfare even better, the wifi radio is strong and snappy evencapped at 3.5mb, The GPS is also reliable even on edge.Speaking of EDGE (the phone's only service availablein the USA).In my experience I've found that GREAT edge service,(3 bars +) is better/faster than poor 3G (2 bars -).So far I have 24 apps installed and 34mb free of system RAMBUT I'M ROOTED allowing me to move near all apps to theinternal 1GB ram that the phone treats more like an externalSD card. (this is an odd but cool feature)Call quality is average, I've been told I sound loud and clear.Thought on your end callers tend to soundloud but somewhat \"plasticky\" as if they were speakingthrough a plastic sheet...weird. This may be due tothe loudspeaker sharing real estate with the receiver.Headphones sound pretty good thought I'm no audiophile.The BEATS driver can be installed for ever so slightlyimproved headphone sound quality. (do so at your own risk,but not before BACK UP!)CONCLUSIONI could go on but it's getting long.It's a compact handsome phone, with fantastic batterylife (3 days heavy use/4 days moderate/reports of 5 to7 days standby)LG's own tweaked Gingerbread is pretty nifty, with a fewtouches of ICS and a clever app manager.Is it perfect? nah...Sometimes sound settings revert to stock.The phone could have used a light rubberized coating tothe batt cover (it is textured) as it sometimes feelsa bit slick.LAST WORDThis phone uses a QVGA display (125dpi 3.2\" screen) this isconsidered laughable by smartphone standards as manyfeature phones still use this for displays.But PINCH ZOOM/PAN works wonders...lolCamera is decent outdoors, useless indoors in low light.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its not the best", "Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "R1LEGPOZ4DV1I1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For what you pay for this phone it sure isn't the best you can get.

It is pretty easy to use, though sometimes there is a processing delay and it takes some time after pressing an icon for it to open. The phone is small and lightweight, and looks pretty cute.Pictures taken on it come out OK, and I mostly use it for the phone, Facebook and Email. I really like the fact that the calendar is synced with my google account, and the fact the the whole phone is really google-based. The biggest downside of the phone is the relatively small memory capacity, which makes it pretty difficult to download apps. I have email, waze, facebook and magicjack on my phone, but if I would try to add more apps, the memory would not allow it, and I would have to erase other things before I could use the phone. I have learned to erase internet settings and some of the saved data in the open apps in order to save the memory. Increased memory would be ideal, and that is the only major downside.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Little Phone", "Author": "Leslie W.

So I went to the Android market and picked up AV protection and then Angry Birds of course :)I'm now monitoring Cyanogenmod because they are working on a version of Ice Cream Sandwich for this little phone.
