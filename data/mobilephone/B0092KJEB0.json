{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy to grip style!  The LG T375 allows me to keep work and personal calls separated ON ONE HANDSET", "Author": "Jeffrey A \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R3KODT3Y2236J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG T375 is a dual SIM phone with a 3.2-inch capacitive LCD color display, 2-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM radio and multimedia player.This phone has an easy to grip style - with rounded edges and measuring 4.06 x 2.32 inches and just 0.42 inches thick, it fits perfectly in my hand.WHY BUY A DUAL SIM PHONE?You can operate two phone numbers on one handset - from the same service provider or different service providers.By putting both SIM cards in the LG T375 handset, it's like having two phones in one. (REMEMBER: Both your SIM cards can be on the same network/service provider or on two different networks)The LG T375 allows me to switch networks flawlessly without having to switch my SIM card - and with two different numbers it's easy to keep work and personal calls separated ON ONE HANDSET!PROS:The LG T375 has 50 MB internal storage and a micro SD card slot (up to 16 GB)Capacitive multitouch screen is very responsive128 MB ROM and 64 MB RAM is more than adequate for basic phone functionsThe phones offer GSM/EDGE connectivity along with Wi-Fi. You also get Facebook and Twitter integration (I haven't used these social media features though)According to the Users' Manual, the standard 950mAh Li-Ion battery allows up to 528 hours of Stand-by and up to 14 h 40 min of Stand by time. With normal use, I usually charge my phone every 3 days.Like most phones, you need the headphones Stereo to operate the FM radio but the LG T375 allows FM recording.  I use this feature to make personalized ringtones :))Pairing devices using the LG T375 Bluetooth is easy.  So far I have used the Bluetooth to pair the LG T375 with a Sony VAIO E15 Laptop,  a Motorola T325 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker and a Samsung C3222 Ch@t Dual SIM PhoneCONS:The LG T375 is a budget phone so, the processor is understandably slow.The LG T375 connects via EDGE, GPRS - so, slow data means slow Internet browsing.The screen lacks an ambient light sensor for automatic screen brightness adjustment - it's a bit of a challenge to see the display in bright sunlight.The screen display is low resolution (240 x 320 pixels) with a pixel density screen of 125ppi.  This is only noticeable if I am doing a lot of Internet browsing.The camera is just 2.0 MP and it lacks autofocus and also no flash. These is fine if you use the LG T375  phone camera only as your backup camera.Although my list of cons seem long, I still give this phone 4 to 4.5 STARS.  It's quite a user friendly utilitarian DUAL SIM phone with a very responsive capacitive touch screen - great for calls, texts and managing two phone numbers on one handset.Hope my review was helpful ...

Crout \"MMS Photography\"", "ReviewID": "RNKWC8WMA372T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is great for the price however when I received it the charger was European....must of missed that in the description!The touch is very sensitive so be careful when scrolling for a number early morning or you will end up calling your boss like I did.  I love the concept of the dual sim since I have a business but there is a hold button at the bottom of the touch and my chin keeps hitting it while I talk....have not found a way to disable it. The other con is when you receive a phone call if you do not answer on the first or second ring the touch screen almost shuts down and you cannot answer it....might be just operator error?  overall despite the cons it is a decent phone for the price....have not used the dual sim yet so cannot comment on that.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "like this phone a lot", "Author": "Cindy N", "ReviewID": "RE9USPPTY8A47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got for my husband who has large fingers and just needed a phone he can dial-he doesn't email or text so the phone is good for him.
