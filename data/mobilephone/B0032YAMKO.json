If you are a person 15-25yrs old who emails a lot and sms a lot and also likes the beautiful touchscreen THIS IS THE WAY TO GO it's amazing the amount of apps you can download and the browsing capabilities however if like me you need it for business use or want to sync your outlook contacts or work email DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE or you will find yourself in a nightmare because you WILL love it enough to want to keep it but HATE it because of the lack of compatibility with business apps.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lost in transit", "Author": "Joann Jackson \"dbigyrl\"", "ReviewID": "RNODOX6SBHD0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There has not been any miscommunication because all i said originally is that i hadn't received the phone yet nobody ever said anything about the post office losing the phone. When i submitted the notice that i hadn't received the phone i got an email stating that i was getting a refund for the amount of the phone never stating that the phone was not coming. I assumed that because it had taken so long that I was getting the phone on the company since I wasn't informed at that time that the phone was not coming. It is only just now that I have been made aware that the phone isn't coming. Now you offer me a measly 10% off a phone when i have went back and read reviews of your company and this thing has happened in the past with other customers. I would rather warn future customers of this possibly happening to them if they try and purchase a phone for your company.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "not enough apps.", "Author": "tylar", "ReviewID": "R31YZSIU13HGMF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is terrible i've had it for about 2 months and i hate it, its slow, has very few apps, restarts by itself, doesnt have a headphone jack,( that wasn't mentioned in the description) its just a all around terrible phone, the only thing its good for is texting.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "t mobile smart phone", "Author": "Kay DeTellem", "ReviewID": "RCHXTVG1AZR24", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone arrived in good condition and worked well as expected.
