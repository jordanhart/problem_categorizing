It is by far the best phone I have ever had. Not only did I fall in love with android, but I fell in love with HTC. I was a little leary about getting a phone I knew nothing about, but I trusted my at&t; sales rep and bought it. I have had almost no problems with it. I have way to many pictures and text messages on it and it causes it to freeze up (which can be expected). I usually just restart it and it is fine. Every so often I go through and delete things to give it a little bit of a break lol. I have never loved a phone as much as I love this one. I have dropped it on my ceramic tile in my kitchen and bathroom and it didn't even have so much as a scratch on it. I also dropped it on my concrete steps in my garage and again nothing happened to it. I have to say if you are going to get a smart phone this is the one to get. That isn't even all!! It has an 8MP camera which is awesome and the color is so vibrant I can hardly stand looking or using anyone else's phone. I have to say this phone has me spoiled. When it comes time to upgrade I will get another HTC phone. Also if you lose your phone you can download an app called android lost from your computer to your phone. It will send you the last messages sent and received, phone calls, take a picture from your phone, send crazy loud \"help me I'm lost\" messages (the phone can be on silent and it still plays it loud), you can set the phone to lock up and notify you if a different sim card is inserted, and many more great things to find your phone. On top of all those things it gives you a gps location within 7 meters of where your phone is. Trust me it works. My phone was stolen and I used this app and it had an arrow directly on the house where the phone was. All of this is emailed to you and the person with your phone has no idea any of this is going on. Awesome phone I highly recommend it to everyone!!!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "The HTC Inspire is UNinspiring", "Author": "Marjorie Martinez \"Marjie\"", "ReviewID": "R2QH54Z0K3NA9X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Last year I upgraded my AT&T; contract and opted for the HTC Inspire.  I was drawn in with it's wide screen and 8MP Camera.  I did have a couple of good months with the Inspire - but that was all - a couple of good months.After approximately my third month with this phone I was beyond frustrated with it's low battery capacity.  I would leave for work in the morning, and by the time lunch rolled around I was in the yellow (warning zone) with my battery.  Should I foolishly choose to not charge my phone at my desk, I would be riding the subway in the evening with a dead phone.  I was constantly looking for a place to charge my phone (and inevitably bought a portable battery charger).Approximately six months into ownership my phone (which resided safely in a case) would freeze for no reason.  I would try to reboot the phone to no avail and be forced to remove the battery cover.  This happened at least once a week.Finally, after a year of ownership the inevitable accident with this phone - which has left me with my old, reliable iPhone 3 to carry me through to the END of my AT&T; service, and away from the HTC.Save yourself the heartache and pain I've suffered over the past year or so and skip the HTC Inspire.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Is a nice used phone.", "Author": "Carla Robinson", "ReviewID": "R2H4ZHRGVGGLR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It will last until my next upgrade, but didn't realize it didn't come with an SD Memory cardwhich is needed to take pictures, videos and to view some apps.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS AFTER A FEW WEEKS", "Author": "PLDAVIS", "ReviewID": "R3PTW783YZE47I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ORDERED THIS PHONE AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT.

I got it when I came back from Madagascar as it was recommended by the representative. Everything was fine for the first month or two, then I couldn't make it 8 hours without my phone dying. That number is now down to 5 hours, and it keeps diminishing. Mine even stopped charging and I swapped it out with ATT about 5 months ago,and it still doesn't work correctly. It freezes about 4 or 5 times a day, I can't make calls as it freezes when I call people. It's quite possibly the worst phone in existence.Bottom line:If you want a phone that doesn't freeze and can last through the day, don't get this phone.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not too shabby", "Author": "the average person", "ReviewID": "R209NFL7VC81J6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone surprisingly lasted me 1.5years, without a case, before I replaced it.  Replaceable battery is nice along with the micro sd slot so you can buy your own cheap memory (upto 32gb).  The camera and screen are decent for a last generation smartphone.  It'll run most apps out there because it has a decent amount of ram (768mb), but the processor is a single core 1ghz. The metal body makes this thing almost indestructible, as far as smartphones go at least.  With a screen protector on I've dropped this thing easily 100times (some rough nights), from as far as 4 feet up.  Its landed flat and on the edges against metal, concrete, tile....you name it.  No cracks yet. dents on the metal body but it still works great....ill miss it", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Petula Moore", "ReviewID": "R2WPKXEW4MNDLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it is good as it gets.The only thing I do not like about it, is that sometime have problems with echoing in the background", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "very bad", "Author": "tim cheney", "ReviewID": "R250RTD7YQXZRU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "was not in working condition, waste of time and money want do this again product appeared to be used or reconditioned", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Ms. Powell", "ReviewID": "RTZHFZTXXXFKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone because I had recently bought a new phone & I dropped it in a cup of juice.
