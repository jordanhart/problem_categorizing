The keyboard buttons are flush with the surface and stiff, making it difficult to type with any speed. I hope this phone is durable over the long run, otherwise it wouldn't even be worth 1 star.Also, apparently to turn on daylight savings, you have to shut off the auto update. unfortunately the text doesn't recognize this, and the conversation is now completely out of order.

I broke mine so I needed a replacement & this is what I chose. The keyboard works great but the buttons are kind of flat so I feel as if it's not entering my text. As for the touch screen, it's slow and kind of unresponsive unless you REALLY push down on it. The menu is a bit confusing but for such a cheap phone, it gets the job done. I would recommend this phone if you enjoy a keyboard. the automatic locking while making a call is a bit annoying as well. Also, I found if you receive a long text, the screen is so small that it keeps closing the message on me while trying to read it. The only was I was able to read long messages was by clicking \"forward message\" and reading it that way.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "Judy P", "ReviewID": "R2DTSDQO4795AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone matches 2 others in our family and keeps everything simple to remember.

The texting keypad works very well.  I wanted a cell phone without data and this was the best free phone that my cell service offered, so for the money, it's a good phone.

I HATED the iPhone's touchscreen keyboard!!!  iPhone letters are too small and I would always end up pushing a letter I didn't want to push.  The Xpression's keyboard is a godsend for my clumsy fingers and I never have an issue texting.The touchscreen works fine (not as fast as an iPhone, but it really doesn't need to be), the phonebook and calendar functions allow for plenty of data and reminders, and the phone calls themselves are clear.You can download music and games, but I never used those functions on an iPhone, so I wouldn't use it on this phone anyway.There are only two downsides to this phone.1. Size:  The Xpression is compact, but the keyboard makes it a little thick (granted it still fits in a pocket easy enough).  It just isn't as \"thin\" as an iPhone or droid.2. Poor Camera:  The on-board camera is obviously not close to the latest and greatest; however, I carry around a full-time camera (DSLR or Sony Cybershot) anyway, so for me, it is not an issue.If you find yourself not using the \"Smart\" applications of your \"Smart\" phone, or just want something cheap and simple, the LG Xpression is a nice alternative that keeps your eyes where they should be\u2026 looking up at the world.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "This phone is dreadful", "Author": "Robert R.

Was excited to get a more modern phone. My LG Xpression is a disappointment. It is difficult to type because the keys are too close together. It seems they are crowded in the center to make room for operations on either side of the keyboard. using the regular keys is bad enough but to get numbers, and other operations, requires to much additional operations. On top of all that, it is not unusual when taking the phone out of the belt holder, the camera swathes on.

The \"data service\" doesn't seem to work for usb cables, and there is no way at all to transfer text to my memory card that I bought at cost (just pictures and \"other files\" which apparently is a small list). In order to read multimedia messages that I sent via email, I have to press Get which sends a second text message. And certain files like music or text, or really anything other than pictures it screens out and you can Get until the cows come home but it won't do it. Ummmm, sorry I wanted to import my music as a ringtone. Media Sync doesn't work here either, it sends it to playlist, which also won't allow transfer to anywhere else.So not only can I not pull my texts out (seriously, there's a file manager right there and it stupidly refuses to transfer texts), but due to equally arbitrary restrictions, I can't pull music in. Now let's talk about the touchscreen and keypad. It's annoyingly oversensitive and does stupid stuff like prompt closes of files WITHOUT asking if that's what you're sure you want, and the auto-complete is really dumb and tied to space and not to enter like EVERY other phone, so you finish a word and press space and literally get stuff like \"I'very\" trying to type I've and it decided I was trying to type very.
