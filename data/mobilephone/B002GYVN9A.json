It is decidedly more sturdy than the Curves my daughter has previously owned. Blackberries are known for their high quality & ease of use, but she can be a challenge to the sturdiest of electronics. This has all of that and more. At first, it was in my Best Buy cart, then something told me to come to Amazon. My angels were looking out for my bottom line, because all in all, I saved $30 on my purchase. My daughter likes to travel & this will be another positive feature for her.Now, I had to update the phone via Blackberry's Desktop Manager & it took four hours, but it was well worth it. This phone has reinforced my #1 daughter's conviction that she will only use a Blackberry (my friends tease her for being hooked on crackberry).The only drawback is that we are not able to stream any video, which caught me off guard, but, as my kids have pointed out, that is what iPads & the like are for!You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent general economy cellphone", "Author": "mr reality", "ReviewID": "R3NRJB4ZVJLUSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this Blackberry 8820 from Amazon, seller GigaGrab at a very good price--used--.I received the phone 2 days earlier than was listed (USPS).I immediately plugged in the  charger and to my surprise a little hour glass appeared and, a wipe and  scrub  initiated.Lord, what the hell is scrub.Panic now.I did online research and my mind was put to rest.This action is to wipe data from memory( security) .
