The camera gives clear picture. So far, everything works just fine. The applications are simply amazing...I don't have to wait to get on my computer all the time, and oh, i love the fact that I skype with it. Highly recommended!!! I couldn't find any reviews when i was making my purchase. I hope this helps someone.Ok, so I've used this phone for 4months and this an update. It still works as I stated earlier, but it suddenly turns itself off and on. At first, I didnt bother because those didnt happen often but after a while it got annoying(note that this doesn't happen very often...say twice in a month.Sometimes, the network suddenly disappears and I have to pull out the battery and stick it back for the network to start working again, but I think this may be a network issue rather than a phone-related problem. Hey, if you're looking for a phone that does skype video call, this is not the phone. It does wonderful skype call but does not enable video calls. I dont expect any other thing to go wrong, and I'm retaining my rating because the phone is great. By the way, I will copy and paste this review in another link for this phone just so I'd stop getting prompts for a review. Apparently, I reviewed a different display of the phone and not my amazon-verified purchase", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Misrepresented!", "Author": "DAVID T ROUSTIO", "ReviewID": "R3EAU19VVL2BQO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a a Samsung GT-S5360L on June 17, 2013.
