{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nokia Lumia, you stole my heart.", "Author": "Adrian I.P.", "ReviewID": "R1DQVQYIM5Q95F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted Windows OS and I had to decide between an HTC 8X (available with T-Mobile) and an unlocked 920 (that I could use with T-Mobile without switching to AT&T;).I bought the unlocked 920, I'm playing with it for more then few weeks now, and every time I touch this phone it simply doesn't stop to amaze me. Maybe 8X would have been good too (same OS), but now I have a 920 and really love it. Video and picture quality are without any doubt the best I've ever seen in any phone. The interface is super smooth and totally responsive, absolutely zero lag and zero hiccups and overall provides a very pleasant and refreshing experience. The materials and the design give it a very nice solid non plastic-ish feel. Combined, best pictures on the market (808 PureView excluded), best OS by far, Nokia offline maps and a very solid hardware design - make it the phone of my choice.There is art in technology. Thank you Nokia", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Phone as of early 2013", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "RI7KER39O19XE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best celular phone!!!

Nothing could get it to turn on.The worst thing though, was that this is not an international phone but rather a ATT branded phone that is unlocked.  ATT is everywhere on this phone and that is not what I was looking for in a phone.  My T-Mobile sim would work but MMS would not.  I had to get a T-Mobile rep on the phone and spent a good hour trying to get it to work.  Never did work completely.Sent back. (Did not send back yet).Update:  I did manage to turn the phone back on after doing a hard reset.  The next day it did the same thing.  I have now installed the newest update and will keep the phone going until I can see if that fixes the resetting problem.  I also got the MMS working after getting more help from T-Mobile.  I will keep updating as I see how the phone now performs. The ATT branding still bothers me.Update 2:  I did end up sending the phone back after it froze up again after the update.  I did really like this phone and may try another one in case this one was just a lemon.  I did like the fact that I could use internet sharing and T-Mobile didn't try to stop it.  The camera was nice (I have a Nokia 808 so it still wasn't that impressive).  I would have keep the phone but for the resetting problem.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 920 Red Unlocked International Version", "Author": "Mengxuan Li", "ReviewID": "R1KME247ZX0HNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone, works good and looks beautiful. The only thing I feel not so appreciating is that it is an unlocked AT&T.;", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia delivers again!", "Author": "Kevin C.", "ReviewID": "ROTVU8PUI82F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been tracking this phone ever since the Nov 2012 release, and I generally had mixed feelings about the types of reviews I read all over the internet. There have been complaints about the weight, about lack of an SD card slot, about it being a Windows phone, the list goes on. However, from experiencing this device for myself, I have to say that while it is not the perfect smartphone, it excels in most areas.The phone weighs 185g - considerably more than all of its direct competitors - but it does not feel like an anvil. It more has a solid, almost unbreakable feel (though I'm not gonna test that). The Samsung Galaxy S3 was one of the main competitors at release date, and though it is lighter and thinner than the Lumia 920, it also feels quite frail in comparison. I don't find the weight of the phone to be a negative attribute.One other concern I had was how the WP8 environment would treat me, as it is well documented and demonstrated all over that the Windows App Store is leagues behind Google and iOS. There are obviously missing popular apps (not least Instagram and Youtube), but I have been able to find ample replacements so far (Metrotube and 6Tag) that do the job. If you aren't one to obsess over a name, then you will find these apps more than capable of handling most, if not all of your activities.The phone boasts silky smooth performance, with great visuals and above average speaker output. As far as media storage goes, I'm not too concerned about the lack of SD card slot. The device already comes with 32gb built-in. Most other flagships at release date topped out at 16gb and not all offered SD storage either.The camera is probably the strongest selling point on any current-gen high end Nokia phone, and believe me, these guys have a right to brag. The camera is simply amazing, and there are a bunch of Nokia-exclusive imaging apps that make the photo experience so much better.Battery life is what I would call average from a smartphone these days and it is probably the biggest negative point on my mind right now. Depending upon usage and settings, battery life can vary greatly. If you are one of the users who turns screen brightness down all the way, turns off all services, and keeps the phone running on barebones features, then you can crank 2 days out of the battery easily. If you are like me - a moderate to heavy user who keeps his screen settings on automatic and doesn't bother to turn off things other than location settings, then you will get upwards of 11 hours out of a full charge. I've seen better, but I've also seen worse.Overall, I'm satisfied with the phone. It was either this or a Xperia Z from Sony. The two are totally different experiences, but both have their strong and weak points. The price difference will probably play a role in the decision as well if you are torn between these 2 (though the release of the Z1 will surely drop the Z's price some more). For anybody questioning why I chose the Lumia 920 over the 925, the reasons are simple.The 925 only has 16gb onboard storage as opposed to 32gb on the 920.The 925 does not have a camera that much better than the 920The 925 did not come in red :)", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible", "Author": "Jessie James", "ReviewID": "RN9MKBEBA21ZI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone and it was great and was amazing with my win8 desktop and tablet. 1 week after purchase the touch screen quit working. took it to a repair center and they said the motherboard had melted because of over use, which equates to about an hour of reading documents online, etc.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Cellphone Does not work", "Author": "A.
