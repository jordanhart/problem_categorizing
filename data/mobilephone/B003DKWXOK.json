And the kicker is, everyone I know who has this phone (it's one of the few non-smart phones still in the world) has the same issues.1) The call quality leaves something to be desired. Also it is glitchy. Sometimes you can hear your own voice in your ear very clearly, and then it'll just cut out and go silent as if you lost the call. I hung up on friends a couple times before I realized it was just the phone messing up. I brought it back to verizon, they did a software upgrade, no difference and they replaced the phone. Still having that issue. My best friend with the same phone had to have it replaced FOUR times due to this issue.2) The keypad is nice and the only redeeming feature of this phone. However, if you are using the keypad, you have to have your fingers on the back of the phone while you type with your thumbs. If you apply pressure to the battery just so, the entire screen goes blank until you release pressure.3) After a year of ownership, the phone started shutting off by itself for no reason. I'd just pull it out of my pocket and it has shut off. Again, this is a problem ALL my friends with an env3 have had.LG usually does a great job. the Shine (vx8700) is the best phone I have ever owned. This piece of garbage is not something worth getting.And I'm serious. My first cellphone ever was a Sony Ericcsson and I dropped it in the toilet. It worked better than my enV3 does.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone shuts itself off randomly...", "Author": "K. Bollman \"KennyBee\"", "ReviewID": "R1B3BUL1OW242Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My son and I got one of these LG vx9200 phones at the same time. After a few months they both started shutting off intermittently. We had 2 of these phones at work for on call use. They both shut off randomly. It seems like a crap shoot whether you get a good one or not. Judging from the reviews it seems your odds are better that you will get one that shuts down randomly. Interestingly at work they had purchased the warranty plan and were able to send these back for replacements. Both replacements work fine. They never shut themselves down. I would give this a better rating if it weren't for this problem. Regularly my wife needs to get hold of me and can't. I'm constantly checking it to see if it shut off. Not a good thing.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "DROPPED calls TURNS ITSELF OFF", "Author": "RB601", "ReviewID": "R2GZTD2V4CIDNJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This cell phone is a piece of junk.
