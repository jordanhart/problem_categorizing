Mentia", "ReviewID": "R29LB1KT8N2BB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With everyone owning smartphones these days, I'm not even sure if people still buy these anymore. For those who do decide to stick to the good old motto of a phone should just be a phone, this review is for you.And for a phone, this particular one deserves 5 stars.It does what it does well, and it's also incredibly durable and incredibly light(nokia phones like this model have earned a rather legendary status in terms of durability). What boosts this phone to a 5 stars though is ironically its extra features. There's a headphone jack on the top of this phone, and when you plug in a pair of headphones, you can tune in to FM radio. How cool is that?! I mean, even the iPhone doesn't have that. Also, another bonus feature is that it has a flashlight. Works in a pinch if you're stuck in the basement with no electricity or whatever. Finally, this battery lasts... a LONG time. I've gone a whole week before having to charge this.There's no camera here, for those wondering, but most 'dumbphones' with cameras take crappy pictures anyways, so I didn't really care about the lack of one here. Also, for those who text a lot, you might want to consider a phone with a keyboard, since this one doesn't have one. Obviously there's no retina display or whatever here, but it's not like you're going to be looking at the screen all the time like you would with a smartphone.But for those who uses phones as... phones, you can't beat this model at a price point like this. I bought this phone with realistic expectations, and I wasn't disappointed.If you have any questions, feel free to comment.-UPDATE 11/30/12-So with after almost a half year with this phone, I can testify to the durability of this phone. I've dropped it from the top of a bunk bed (on accident of course) multiple times and it still functions fine. No damage to the screen or anything! That's pretty impressive.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome (HONEST REVIEW)", "Author": "BME", "ReviewID": "R2UTGMJWNOU53E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a t-mobile customer in the states and have been for a while. they dont have the best service nor the best customer service but we are reviewing a phone not a company.that being said i paid under 28$ with shipping for this product and i am one happy little camper. yes a have owned smart phones the last one a owned was a Galaxy S the first one. it was a tough transition after the screen cracked but im glad i bought it. i spent hundreds of dollars and to buy a phone that does not scratch on impacts is great. Nokia is a solid build quality and they last long.Pros: Durable- very sturdy ive dropped it so much these few months ive had it and i see not a scratch on it. i dont drop it at massive heights usually off a table or off the arm rest on to a hardwood floor and once in a while on concrete.Radio/headset- its a cool feature to walk around with a radio with a more than recent signal qualitylight- yes its feather weight compared to everything on this planet. it so light i forget its in my pocketall the features i need- decent texting abilities buttons arent to big i have big hands so its tough but i still think its fantasticcall quality- is good. not the sharpest but louder than sharper sound quality which is a plus becuase although you hear wind and all the background sounds a bit more you never complain about volume.standard headjack- it comes in handyCons: NONE ITS 20 BUCKSHONESTLY IF YOU WANT YOURSELF A PHONE GET IT!! it will not disappoint you get more than what you pay for", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Makes/Receives Phone Calls, Easy to Write Texts, Does What You Want a Phone to Do", "Author": "James N Simpson", "ReviewID": "R1H7OHBIDVCZVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is simply a review of the actual Nokia 1616 handset, not T-Mobile or whatever carrier or prepay service Amazon is packaging with it on this page.  This review is simply for people like I was, who when their old phone has died, need to get another cheap one, and are looking for info on the ones they've seen in junk mail catalogues, online websites or in the isles of department stores to make sure they are not buying a dud.To be honest with you, I made the decision to buy this pretty much on price, it was the cheapest I came across at short notice when my old phone suddenly died, at $19.  I don't need a phone to take photos, I've got a camera for that (although this phone can receive photo texts). I don't need it to go online to visit Facebook, E-bay, Amazon or other websites, I've got a computer to do that. I don't even really need it to send texts, I use Facebook to send messages to everyone I don't want to call, but I did send one to my mum who shuns fancy things like the Internet and it was simple, quick and easy to do using this phone. I've only owned three mobile phones in my life and this really is no better or worse than the other two which were both Motorolas, the last being the WX160, which also is a good cheap phone to get if you can still find one.It is a bit heavier and bulkier than my previous phones but still overall is pretty light.  You hardly notice it if you carry it in your pants pocket.  Comes with a flashlight at the top, bit of a gimmick really, I always just used the display screen on my previous phones as a flashlight, however this one's display screen is not as illuminating as those phones and the flashlight does do a nice job with a small concentrated light beam. Possibly doing it this way saves battery power and lengthens the time between charges if you don't use the torch, I don't know. It's not powerful enough that you'd substitute it for a decent torch if camping or something and wanting to avoid stepping on a poisonous snake or falling down a hole, but it's decent enough if you're sleeping in a dorm room in a backpacker hostel or something and everyone else is asleep with the lights off to navigate your way past everyone's discarded belongings on the floor.  It has a number of different wallpaper pictures you can set for the background, I must honest none of them really thrilled me with a wow isn't that cool moment.  I went with the green lizard but there's flowers and patterns and things like this is you prefer.  The menu is pretty easy to navigate, with easy to understand icons, things like setting the date are very easy.  Has some games on it, they're not very good I looked at them but can't see myself ever doing so again.  These may be different for whatever country you're in but on the phones sold in Australia they are Rapid Roll, Bounce and Forbidden Treasures. The Nokia 1616 has quite a number of ringtones including the Nokia theme.  I wasn't overly excited by any of these either and if you're like me and have a mobile phone because you are on call for work and need to be able to hear your phone before the person on the other end hangs up if it is at the other end of your house, about two thirds of the ringtones are useless.Like most phones in this price range it comes with an FM radio.  You can listen to it like a Walkman, the headphones are provided and it interrupts the radio if an incoming call happens.  Like all similar priced phones though the only headphones that fit the hole to plug into the phone, are the set it comes with. My previous phone I misplaced those early on so expect that feature to not last that long as I'm likely to do that again.  The radio is easy to tune into the station you want simply by typing the number like you would a text.  The buttons on the keypad are each individually raised and a decent size by the way.The phone actually comes with a nice little instruction booklet and not just the usual folded bit of double-sided large bit of paper. The battery comes slightly charged which is nice if like I was you're on call for work.  Doesn't take too long to charge either.  Putting in the Sim card is a bit tricky though, the illustrations on the box aren't that clear you've got to make sure it goes under that metal thing.The only thing that really annoys me about this phone is that is sort of goes into computer monitor style sleep mode after a couple of seconds of non use.  I used to love being able to see the time and even the date when needed on my old phone simply by glancing at it.  You've got to hit the centre square button to wake up the phone and see the time with the Nokia 1616, meaning you've got to touch the phone and not just subtly glance at on the table it if in a meeting or just having a conversation with someone a lunchtime or something.  I don't really know what the selling point of that feature is at all, it's something Nokia should get rid of on future phones. It's not like the time ever burnt into the display on my other phones.  You can also get the clock to speak the time if you're into that sort of thing.It does have quite a bulky recharger compared to my previous phones, meaning it sticks out a fair bit from the wall power point limiting due to furniture and things like this the places you can plug it in.  It only lasts four or five days at most between charges especially if it has been receiving or making calls, which is about half the time of my previous two phones.If you want a reliable phone to make and take calls as well as text, and this one is selling for a cheap price, it does the job.

I only have had this phone for a day but I already prefer it over the  Samsung T139 Prepaid Phone I  replaced with this. Seems to have a stronger signal tha the Samsung T139 Prepaid Phone. I went to the zoo today and I thought it was great to have a radio with me. I had the radio on for about three hours and it didnt seem to use any battery juice.

It is durable.I eventually replaced this one because of my fault.One day I was walking an hour. The phone was in my pocket. Everything got wet including this cell Phone. My co-worker plucked out the batteries and let it stand for couple seconds. It works. Of course, the condition of battery dropped significantly. The phone was still good. Then one day, I was chasing the train, I missed the train. Then I realized my phone dropped on the floor. The whole thing felt part. I had to put battery and everything back. The second blow actually cause some damage. It still worked. Of course, the reception started to get worst. It was still good phone. That was 4 years after I purchased the phone. Instead of charging phone once a week, I had to charge the phone every 2 day. Once a while, I had connection problem. I loved that phone. Then I had to travel abroad. This is a simple phone. I need a quad band phone. Since this phone is getting old with damage. I think it is time to retire this phone and get a better phoneIf you are looking for a cell phone for talking to someone (isn't that the purpose of the inventing cell phone), this serves the purpose. Don't expect this one to work in the foreign country. This is a dual band phone. I am not too crazy about texting, but once a while I want to text small piece information instead of talking on the phone for 5 minutes, it could be a pain. People who use the phone for talking, this is a durable and battery life is good.Nokia makes good phone. Unfortunately, everyone is going to expensive smart phone. Nokia is going to die because it is behind on smart phones. It is hard to find Nokia regular phone.I have another Motorola phone for 5 years. it is still good, but battery is getting worse. I have hard time finding the dumb phone. I am not paying more than 100 for smart phones. I am still trying to find my Nokia quad band phones. If possible, I want to get qwerty keyboard just in case some one asked me to text 20 word messages such as my address.I may pick this one if I could not find other cheaper Nokia quad band phone.

I live in a metro area and get full strength reception on my Nokia Lumia 920 4G Windows Phone, Black (AT&T;) (simply the best smartphone!), but can barely get 1 bar on this phone or other T-Mobile phones (Alcatel, T-Mo's own brand, etc.) -- and that's when I stand next to my windows! If I move to the bedroom, forget about it, there's no bar and I can't make or take calls. Calls drop frequently, too. This is why T-Mobile's network is always ranked dead last nationwide.  The reason I chose T-Mobile for my family's prepaid needs (prepaid is great for keeping track of the kids) and reception generally seems okay outdoors, which is fine for my needs.Next, about the phone. It's small and cute and has good battery life. Calls, when I can make them, come through loud and clear. The screen is decent for its size. But the UI has a distinct Europe bend which means it's not all that friendly to American users. For example, I have small hands but those buttons are even too small for me. The tools menu is a mess and cannot be customized. Worst of them all, the calendar's functionality is simply crazy! Weeks start on Monday, so I always misread the calendar. The way appointments are kept is simply pure evil: get this... when you have multiple events on the same day, you cannot view them all on the screen! It only shows one at a time. For some reason you sometimes can suppress event notifications but other times cannot. If you can overlook these weird UI shortcomings, it's a solid phone for making calls. So I finally decided to migrate my kids' simple calendars to my Nokia 920, much to their consternation.In summary, if you just want a basic prepaid phone, this works, and it's really cute and pocketable and tossable, unlike smartphones. (My Nokia 920 is one stylish and tough phone but not always pocketable in the summer.) If you don't mind getting on the T-Mobile network, this may be the best prepaid option for you, especially if you choose the $30 monthly plan or refill $100 to get to the golden status, which makes all future refills last one year.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tooo Cheap!", "Author": "Felix John Montoya \"the great cat\"", "ReviewID": "RE8PPSOKPUZZ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Too cheaply made I will look for something better!
