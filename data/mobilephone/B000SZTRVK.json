The car charger that came with the phone doesn't work, and the home charger, which is equipped for EUROPEAN outlets, fell apart the very first time I tried to use it (there was a US adapter).  I would have gladly returned this phone, but was willing to put up with the  other flaws and didn't discover the broken car charger until a week after I had thrown the electrically hazardous home charger away!", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "BAD NEWS MOTOROLA RAZOR PHONES", "Author": "Charles W.

They even took 72 hours to respond to my refund request, when it was already past the 7 day refund period! NEVER buying from them again!

It doesn't have a lot of storage, but even pics don't take up much space. In a word, excellent.

I get good reception and it is easy to use and very user friendly.  Some months ago the display went out on my RAZR and I learned they were no longer available.  I purchased a Samsung cell phone instead and it only took a week to determine it was a lousy phone.  I then ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 from Amazon and was ecstatic when my RAZR arrived.  It didn't take me long to return the Samsung.  Recently I purchased another RAZR because my friendly carrier AT&T; said my old RAZR that I had purchased 3 months ago had a bad antenna in it and there was nothing they could do.  They said I would have to purchase another cell phone.  I then ordered another RAZR from Amazon and two days later, my other RAZR that was supposed to have had a bad antenna in it started working again.  I now know that AT&T; didn't want to admit that it was their tower that was bad, so my RAZR couldn't pick up a reception.  I kept getting a \"Network Busy\" message.  I'm going to keep the RAZR I just received as a backup in case this happens again because I wouldn't have another brand of phone.
