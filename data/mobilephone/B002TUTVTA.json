{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Though be prepared to pay a LOT for internet", "Author": "Chase \"Sean Cruz\"", "ReviewID": "R2R0QKD7D16X2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. It's the best phone I've ever had. The keyboard is just the right size and everything works great. I'll try and rate things individually.Messaging(9/10)- Messaging is extremely simple on this phone. There is no difficulty figuring out what is what. You will have to play around with it a bit to get accustomed to it however. You can also keep a record of your conversations from person to person, so there is no need to go back and forth to each message to see what you wrote.PS: They keys are considerably small. If you have giant fingers or even marginally large ones, texting may be a little difficult  as you may end up pressing more than one button at a time.Music(9/10): The music player is wonderful. It will display the CD cover or whatever picture you have set for each song. There is a shuffle feature, however, I took a point off because the shuffle is so random, sometimes you may come across the same songs, and never seem to get around to the others. The sound is very clear and concise. No static. The headphones they give you with it will slip out of your ears a lot. So I recommend purchasing an adapter that goes to 3.5mm headphones that way you can put in your own.Some of the features include:-You own customizable playlists-sorting by artists, genre, recently played, most played, last played-Repeat/shuffle-Shortcuts-background playing-sound effects(Wide, Dynamic, surround, pop, rock, etc.)-Music auto offNOTE: Music can be set as a ringtoneRadio(9/10) -The radio is excellent! As far as reception, its the same as any portable device, so I can't comment on that but as far as shortcuts, station setting, etc, its amazing.Memory(9/10)- The largest memory card you can purchase for the phone is 8GB, which is good enough for me. I can put lots of music and videos without worrying about space. Internal memory is 34MB, which isn't so badCamera/Video(8/10)- The camera is a 2MP camera and it's not bad. It's pretty much what you would expect from a 2MP camera phone. The features, such as zoom/effects/night mode/timer/viewfinder, etc are all very good. More than most phones I would say. The video player works great. Dont expect Iphone quality but it does what I need it to do for a quick video. And sound pick-up is great.Organizer(10/10)-The organizer is great. Here is a list of the organizer features:-Calender(lists wk number on the side as a bonus)[Also lists events you have missed]-MEMO-A very simple tool that you can simply use to write something down for later use. I use it to write down songs I want to download. Very useful-TASK- This is similar to memo except that this is better used for events and remembrances that you can set an alarm to-WORLD CLOCK-Useful for seeing time around the world(I never use it)-CALCULATOR-A very basic and simple calculator(not scientific) that useful for just taking a quick mathematical process-CONVERTER-This is a wonderful tool for doing conversions and it is very easy to use. You can convert Length, Weight, Volume, Area, and TemperatureInternet(?)- This is the biggest flaw, not because I think the internet sucks or anything. Frankly, I haven't even used the internet for the phone. I have T-mobile and previously, I paid $10 a month for internet. I assumed it would be the same. but when I got the phone, it said i couldn't use the internet. I looked through the plans and the cheapest one was $30 a month! YIKES! Maybe not for you, but for me, that is VERY expensive for a mobile internet. But that may be because it's unlocked. It may be different for you. I have no idea. So I'm disappointed about that. I was hoping for wi-fi to make up for it. But this phone has no wi-fi. But I already knew that when I bought it so it didn't bother me too much.Overall: An excellent phone that I would highly recommend. It has a unique look. I love the numbers on the side. It's not bothering in the slightest. However, if you know you have very large fingers, the keyboard may not be the best for you.Ok I tried to cover as much information as I could think of at the moment.If there is any other sections or info you want, let me know. It comes with Sudoku game as well. Which is a great way to relax. LOVE that. And comes with  a dictionaryNOTE: I did not buy from here. I bought on EBAY because it was a few dollars cheaper. But I made the ratings based on the phone itself", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Batteries hard to find..", "Author": "Hostilia", "ReviewID": "R3QJIWWUW00LCG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the phone two weeks ago with a dead battery (NB: I did not buy it on amazon!).  I thought it couldn't be too much of a problem to buy a new battery, but that turned out to be more complicated than I thought.. 1) Samsung does not give you ANY information on what type of battery the phone needs - just says \"standard\" in the instruction manual/website info.  2)  This \"standard\" battery is hard to find in the US - I had to order it via ebay from a dealer in Hong Kong.  My old phone is a Samsung and I was quite happy with it - but if this company can't be bothered to give me detailed information on the spare parts I need, I won't be bothered to buy from them again. Oh, just in case you were wondering.. the battery is called  AB483640BU.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Loved it, but no pictures", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3OA9X8XAQGJ4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this phone. not too big , but has many great features. Unfortunately, the picture message feature cannot be utilized in the United States. There may be other features that won't work as well.

The tech at Samsung knew immediately what the problem was and explained that this was an international version of this phone.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pictures and internet work on my B3310", "Author": "euro traveler", "ReviewID": "R11MLTEEQ4GFTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace an older unlocked Seimens model that I use exclusively while traveling in Europe,buying local phone SIM cards as I switch countries.  I like the Samsung so much, that I've decided to use ithere in the US as well.The B3310 I received after ordering off of this page came in 2 days with standard shipping,fulfilled by J&R; Music World.I was happy to find a Samsung USB data cable unexpectedly included, along with the phone, battery,dual-voltage travel charger, user guide, and a cd with Samsung's PC Studio software.The international charger has a plug made for US sockets, but since it's dual-voltage I can also use it in Europe by simply slipping a plug adapter over it.Since I wanted to try the phone out in the US before taking it to Europe, I went to the local T-Mobile store andbought a SIM card for $10.  After the clerk activated it, I had $3.34 in credit on my phone to work with, morethan enough for me to evaluate the phone and the T-Mobile network in my area.After reading about how some owners had problems with sending and receiving pictures via MMS, I asked theT-Mobile clerk to send me a test MMS and my phone failed to show it.  He then took the phone, calledT-Mobile help, and they walked him through setting up both the MMS and the WAP internet functions for me.Not planning on using the internet as I use prepaid only, but it worked as designed on 2G.Could I have set up the MMS and internet myself?  Maybe, but it would have taken me forever.Very thankful the clerk was so helpful when I all I did was buy a SIM card and no service.After installing a 4gb microSDHC card I attempted to transfer some mp3 music files from my laptop to the phone,and got a Windows message about a driver being needed.  Slipped in the cd from the box and got the driver offof it and tried again, successfully.  Once the USB driver is installed, you can simple drag and drop filesinto the phone's music folder from your pc.You do not need to install the Samsung PC Studio.  I did, but had trouble getting it to see the phone even afterchoosing to install the program and the USB driver.IMPORTANT: I had to turn my phone off while it was connected via USB after reinstalling programand USB driver and only then did my Vista laptop recognize it and finish installing the USB driver.This phone will see heavy texting while in Europe and the qwerty keyboard works wonderfully.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone doesn't work after 4 days", "Author": "Thomas Percell \"Tommy P\"", "ReviewID": "RRZQYHZIQ7MVX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 of these phones based on the user feedback.

Also it did not come with a headset as it should have, and only takes a micro USB headset plug, which is ridiculously hard to find. Samsung is very hard to contact, has very poor customer support, and refused to resolve the problem. I bought the phone for overseas travel, and due to the poor battery life and other problems, it was of very marginal use.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone for my teen son", "Author": "H.

Koeiman", "ReviewID": "R2RD1F5QJXPZ98", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone was purchased as a gift.The person who got the phone liked it very much.Personally, I thought the phone would be a bit larger. I have tried it and it is uncomfortably small in my hands when using the qwerty keyboard. And I don't have large hands.Another thing I did not like was that when the phone is closed (i.e. keyboard not out) and you hold it in your hand and are using your thumb to push the menu buttons etc, your hand tends to automatically go into a tiny squeeze and the phone moves a bit awkwardly and makes me worry that it might not be a sturdy, long-lasting phone because it might possibly break.Other than the size and it's \"weak body\" the phone works fine in my opinion.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Phoenix AZ", "ReviewID": "R3I7JSNNM24RHO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone so far and the review by Chase is very informative and accurate in my opinion.  I only have 2 issues with the phone.  First, I don't care for the menu much... I had a difficult time locating many simple features.  Second, my phone did not come with a data transfer cable.  The port is also not a standard mini USB port so I had to purchase the cable separately for about $10.The music player feature is great and with the addition of an 8Gb micro SD card this device has basically taken the place of my MP3 player.  The music even sounds ok using the built in speaker.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone broken after a little over 2 months ( No Warranty)", "Author": "jim", "ReviewID": "R1NFD0NW3BFS5O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone seems to be ok to start with.

And I only did about 45 minutes of talking on it so far... I'm not a big talker so that's why I like this phone!I ordered it last week April 24 for $90 and I'm surprised that it'$101 now! - May 2, 2011It's got alot of wonderful features - like alot of Alarm settings, radio, voice recodering, calendar, different phone profile settings that you can set to specifically do things, and a FAKE call setting! To pretend your getting a call to get you out of a tight spot.I love how it slides open and the keypad on the regular side of the one works with the screen.It's an awesome phone!I have ATT and I get awesome reception where I didn't get before! well the other phone was a piece of crap and it was a few years old...I ordered it off of Amazon and the order came in 2 days early! and I live in Hawaii!!

Volz", "ReviewID": "R2QRQB5FJUAFQN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Decent phone for talking and texting.  I've had this phone for one month and I like it.  I've had about a 3 day battery life with some talking, little texting, and no data use.  You can't send or receive multi-media text messages with this phone (I have AT&T; and was able to use MMS on a Razr that I used to have).  I have not used it for data because I don't carry a data plan on my service package.  The phone is smaller than a deck of cards when in the closed position.  As an international version, the clock is in 24 hour format, but you can change it to 12 hour format, the date is in day, month, year format - and you can't change that.  Favorites is spelled \"Favourites\".  I haven't found a way to change the font, which is one of those hand-printed style fonts.Update 31August 2011:  I am throwing this phone away.  Call quality is horrible, although it may be my service plan (AT&T;).  During calls, I can hear a small digital hiccup sound and the phone cuts out during that time.  I hear about every 3rd word of a conversation.  Hearing someone spell a word is impossible.  Texting is easy, but no MMS.  I tried to unlock the MMS using a procedure available on the internet, but it didn't work.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very happy surprise", "Author": "M.

I'm not terribly tech savvy so I'm sure it's my ignorance.  I'll have a 12-year old help me!  LOL! But my immediate concern is that the phone lights up several times a day, at least, even when nothing is happening with it...no incoming call, alarm, etc.  It's just sitting there and will light up.  This doesn't help the already problem with the battery going dead so quickly.  Also in the last couple of days this Fring thing has been on my screen and I have to hit OK and clear.  It was not coming up until just now so not sure what activated it.  What's the deal with that?  How did it get there and how do I delete it???  Not sure if the light coming on is a defect or???
