I'm very happy with it so far, it's very easy to use and the touch key-pad is not at all hard to control and use as I thought it would be. The only minor down side is that you definitely need that SD memory card and that you have to purchase it in order to take pictures, watch videos on youtube or facebook etc. You really can't do much without it. Overall great product, great price too for the wifi and gps services.

Ever. I am sure there are worse out there, but that's small consolation.The bad:. The first mobile phone in the more than 13 years that I have been using cell phones where I could not make phone calls because the phone app crashed. Yes. I have got on at least two different occasions error messages stating that the \"phone dialer app has crashed\". A phone where you cannot make phone calls. I could stop right here and this phone would be deserving of a 1-star rating. But let's plod more.. Slow. Slow. Slow. So many times when I get a call, the display does not light up immediately. It takes 3, 4, 5 seconds or even longer for the display to be lighted so I can even answer the call or see who's calling.. Resistive touch screen that is mostly resistant to light taps and swipes. The touch screen sensitivity and responsiveness are (yet) more huge disappointments.. There are many apps that have been pre-installed by LG and yet I cannot remove them from the phone without hacking the phone.. The Windows software to manage the phone from my computer is, well, terrible, to put it mildly.. Sloooow camera. It can take several seconds from the time you tap the on-screen button to take the photo that it actually takes the photo.. The camera is very basic. Average quality in bright sunlight. Very mediocre results otherwise. I cannot also share multiple photos at a time. I know there are Android photo apps available that make are quite good, but surely providing a simple yet functional camera app shouldn't be asking for much.. The slider to move from camera to video mode is such that several times upon tapping to take a photo I end up sliding the switch to the video mode.. Mediocre battery life. This may be common enough with Android phones, from what I hear, but still... with just 3G on, and no WiFi, Bluetooth, or GPS, I still need to charge the phone every day and a half.. While on the subject of battery, what is truly surreal is to plug the phone into the charger, and then within 5 seconds the battery level shoots from 30% to 40% to 50% and then to 80%. Yes, evidently some sort of magic fast-charge capability exists on this phone that can charge the phone upto 80% in five seconds.. The keyboard is also not very well designed. It is very easy to tap a key and have another one be pressed.. Heavy. It is heavy. Yes.. No Android update available. This is running Android 2.1, and I cannot updgrade to 2.2, or 2.3.. And so on... almost every aspect of the phone is a disappointment.. I got a Samsung SA-S5360 Cellphone - US Warranty - Gray phone a few weeks back, and it cost 2/3 the price of this LG monstrosity, and is much, much better on so many aspects than the LG that I realized just how bad this LG has been.The good:. Well, not much, really. This is a most disappointing phone.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good price to quality balance", "Author": "S. Jayawardane \"Empty\"", "ReviewID": "R17X3SN2OS6LX7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great phone for the price.I bought this for my sister in Sri Lanka. Nokia's are the \"it\" phone there and she kept asking for a Nokia. But I sent her this android and she was amazed to discover the power of Android.The four stars are because it is for her. She has never used a capacitative touch screen so the response of the resistive screen is good for her. On the other hand if it was for me I would give it two stars. I have almost the same phone, sprint lg optimus, and I am used to it's capacitative touch screen. This phone drove me nuts when I tried to set it up. I finally went and bought a six pack of Nintendo DS stylus's and was able to operate the phone decently with them. They should have put a stylus holder slot on this phone and it would have been perfect.Also I noticed the screen scratches easily. I took utmost care and there was tiny scratches by the time I shipped the phone to my sister.Given all this it is the best phone available for upright price.

It is an International version, and comes with the opening screen in German.  I would recommend connecting to LG's UK site to download any software upgrades and the English manual, unless you are fluent in German.  I was able to set it up with T-Mobile fairly easily once I had the necessary codes (see the user forum).  The WiFi is OK although it doesn't connect all the time (I did see a warning somewhere that it doesn't connect in the US although I am able to in most instances if there's little or no security).  The only annoying thing is that you need to unlock the keypad after placing the phone call.  If you're prompted to enter information like a PIN or answer questions via a keyed response, it's a little bit of a pain to unlock the keypad each time.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for browsing", "Author": "GS \"GS\"", "ReviewID": "R1HRFTQF5N4GXR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would give this phone 10 on 10 for looks, ease of use and portability.

After I started using it, it is a pretty good android however there are several problems that exist:1. Too little internal storage space--> Because this phone is running android 1.6, therefore ALL the apps need to be stored in the phone storage. I only have about 15-20 apps, and that's it... I wanted more, but if I want more apps, I need to update to at least android 2.2 in order to put my apps in SD card.2. Android 1.6 upgrade--> I downloaded the LG Mobile Upgrade and tried to upgrade my phone to 2.1, however that didn't work out, because the phone is unlocked phone, and I couldn't find the phone model in the list, so I couldn't update. This is a really big problem for me. In addition, because I have international warranty for this phone, if I root the phone and upgrade it by myself, I will lose the warrranty, so I am stuck with this right now.3. Internet--> The internet and Wi-Fi itself is not a big problem, but sometimes when I want to go to another site and I touched the button, it appears  \"STOPPING...\", and the internet could never works (it could not open the page) unless I shut down the phone and turn it on again.
