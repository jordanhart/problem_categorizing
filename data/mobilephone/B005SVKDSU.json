I suppose that depending on which seller you buy from, it could come in the original box and it might be eligible to activate on your Verizon account, but you should probably contact the seller first to be sure.  I am sending mine back for a refund.  I do not want to state which seller I bought it from because so far I have not had any difficulties with the return and do not want to bring any bad karma (I have had enough of that recently).", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well its ok.. i guess", "Author": "smartypants21", "ReviewID": "R1MK1N5OG3VPEJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "well this phone is not the best there is out there but it will work if your not looking for anything fance. first off, the camera sucks and the vibration is too loud. it has horrible sound.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "good but i lost and can not find it", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2D9SWI2TOO7OE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i loved the phone but it  only has so many apps you can not get addational apps for your phone and i lost it and it does not have an app where you can locate it so i would say buy it but if u lose it not my fault it sucks because that phone had all my contacts and ringtones ad recordings on it so there you go", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005SVKDSU"}}
