I had the same model for 3 years (and I am extremely hard on phones as I am always outdoors). It held up great. Survived water, snow, being ran over by the car, and dropped thousands of times. It's a great all-around phone with all the basic needs. When it came time to finally replace my original model I spent weeks trying to find a phone I liked as much... but ended up ordering the same phon off the internet instead.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever.", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "R2YR943DE7VJ2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 3 years and two months. Up until about two weeks ago it still worked great. I accidently got it wet numerous times and each time it wouldn't work for a day or two but once it dried out, it worked again just like new. The battery life is still just as great as ever. I did finally get it wet and slightly soapy accidently about 2 weeks ago and the phone is now shutting off at random times and the number 4 doesn't always work. I have dropped this phone numerous times without issue. Sometimes hard enough for the batter to go flying off. IT TOOK THREE YEARS OF ABUSE TO WEAR THIS PHONE OUT. Obviously it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but for texting and talking, and perhaps listening to music (I accidently downloaded a full song when I first got it... (I don't need songs on my phone so I didn't download any more) and it plays externally quite nicely. I was surprised by how well the external speaker works!) it is a great phone! I seriuosly think LG and/or Verizon made a mistake with this phone. I don't think anything is supposed to last more than 6 months anymore, but I got three years of use which, although not beneficial for them, was awesome for me!!!", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "just a  phone", "Author": "Cathy", "ReviewID": "R2XDF3766QB57E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "easy to use flip phone  already had previous ... my husband's destroyed 2 so had to replace it  I am happy with mine so got him the same one", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "lg vx8360", "Author": "tw", "ReviewID": "R3T4VCNI8ODJWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "orded phone for my husband fast shipping the phone got here fast . my husband loves the phone .he said very easy to work . an works real good will get him aonther one when he needs a new one.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good service", "Author": "seeya", "ReviewID": "R3HBC8PUZCTR80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The service was great, phone was as said it would be and works great.

It's exactly what I need, does everything well. The simple camera takes very nice photos, which you can edit and save. Easy to text, great sound, good selection of nice ring-tones. My last phone couldn't set a wallpaper on the front, this can. Easy to see and access clock on front. E-mail is tiny, so not a big user on this, but in an emergency, I can get and send an e-mail. Just want a great, easy to use flip-phone that's very small and thin, and fits in a pocket, and this is it. I wish Verizon would offer it again - it seems their flip-phones are getting cruddy, b/c IMO they want everyone to switch to smartphones, with their high-priced data plans.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the purchse", "Author": "Noel C.", "ReviewID": "RXJQI9LI5YQ77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase this for my mother in law.
