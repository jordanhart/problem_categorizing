{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good entry level Android phone. Works great with Ting", "Author": "E. Burke", "ReviewID": "RCKF14MWOTXXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Android phone (yes I know I'm way behind the times), and I purchased it so I could switch from Net10 to Ting ( [...] ) which requires a Sprint branded phone to use their service. If you have never heard of Ting, check them out because our bill for 2 Android phones is now lower than what we paid for just one of our Net10 phones per month.My wife and I have been using these phones for over a month and so far everything is great. The slider keyboard is much easier to use than an on screen keyboard. Battery strength is good, I can charge it every 3 days with mild usage however some games and apps will drain it pretty quickly.Internal memory is a bit on the small side (150meg). It comes with a 2gig SD card for storing pics and music, but most apps require being installed on Internal Memory (some can be moved to SD) so you are limited on the number of apps you can install at any given time.The biggest memory hogs are the Google Play/Store apps that can't be easily removed without breaking all your games/apps. You can uninstall the updates for Google Books (6meg) and other of the Google core apps to recover some space, but don't expect to be able to download and play a 25 meg game on this phone.The screen is clear and responsive to touch, 3G web browsing is fast and very cool if your moving from a 'dumb phone', and it has Voice Search built in for Google search and 'Speak your Destination' for the GPS navigation.Speaker phone is loud and clear enough for driving hands free even with the loud exhaust in my truck.The camera is a bit below average and does not like low light situations. There is no flash. It takes decent pics in bright light and video is also decent but far from HQ.Honestly the best thing about using this phone is the service provided by Ting. I average $39/mo total bill for 2 phones, if you have to call them for support you get an answer by the 3rd ring by a live person who actually knows what they are talking about, and their coverage area is everywhere that Sprint covers and I've never found a dead spot.If you are on a budget and looking for a cheap slider Android, this phone would be a great buy for you. If you've got money to burn I'm sure you could find something higher quality. Based on price this phone is a solid 4 stars.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Fabulous Phone for a Great Price", "Author": "K. A. Patterson", "ReviewID": "R3VXD2BQZMBIJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a phone both for my kids and for myself.  I wanted something that I wouldn't mourn if lost, and something durable that would survive middle school, high school, and my purse.  This phone is it.Running Android, the phone lets you sign in to a Google account and download all your contact information.  You can also view calendar dates and emails.  But the phone doesn't come with a lot of memory, so basically no games.  Since this is supposed to be a phone only, I don't really care about the small amount of memory.  If you are looking for an entertainment device, this would probably not work for you.I use Ting as my cell phone provider.  I connect all three phone in the house with no problems; I even ported my old cell number without a glitch.Overall, if you are looking for a small, durable Android phone for not a lot of money, I recommend the Kyocera Milano.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Didn't Like It", "Author": "c. taylor", "ReviewID": "RFUJ7O3SVIRI3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone sucks.

I think it's perfect for someone whose needs are simple- calling & texting.  Although I have a data plan, I don't really use this phone for that a lot.  I think it's tough to surf the web on such a small screen and I don't really need a phone for that.  I also bought this phone to set up with Ting, which I did with no problems at all.  This phone goes everywhere with me & I've never had any problems with the battery or charging or anything.  If you're looking for a simple, reliable phone with the option for a data plan if needed for emergency, then this is the phone for you.  But if you're looking for something more high tech, then you should get something more high tech.  For what I need, this phone is perfect and I love it.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good For The Low End Smart Phone", "Author": "Keith &#34;MuzikMan&#34; Hannaleck", "ReviewID": "RJVINQDM9XB0V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never had a problem with in a over a year now.

I'm always having issues with the earphone jack, closing the slide keybored too fast causes the phone to shut off, it crashes when I use the youtube app and my facebook messenger app, the second I got it and updated youtube -and youtube alone mind you- it said it was low on storage and I can't even uninstall all these factory installed apps I do not use at all.  My older sister has the same phone and has similar problems though when she got the facebook app itself the phone kept crashing now suddenly neither of our phones work.  We can't get the touch screen to work, can't get the keybored to work, and it won't recognize a charger of any kind.  Do yourself a favor don't make the same mistake I made, don't get this phone.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be careful who you buy a phone from", "Author": "Jayne A.

I have not used the phone because it is not supported by the service I have.  I think people should be aware that this phone is NOT supported by Ting, despite an earlier review that says they bought this phone to be used with Ting service.  I bought this from a just launched seller, and tried to return it because it was not as advertised.  He was rude, suspicious, and unprofessional, and refused to refund me as required by Amazon's A to Z guarantee.  Now I will have to file a claim against him through Amazon.  What a pain in the neck.  Just be careful when buying phones on Amazon from unverified or \"just launched\" sellers.
