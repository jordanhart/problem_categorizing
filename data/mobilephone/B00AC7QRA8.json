{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a Sony...", "Author": "Juan Vega \"Dishwasher\"", "ReviewID": "R3EDNVYHEEO1SY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been a Nokia user, and this is my first non-Nokia phone. I like to customize my phones, so an iPhone was out of the question. The new Nokias are quad-band only, which makes them now useless to me since I'm on T-Mobile USA. So I could only turn to Android.There are only a handful of pentaband Android phones, namely the Nexus ones and some obscure options, and this Sony. The Nexus 4 is a terrific bargain, but the lack of a dedicated camera button was a deal breaker to me. I love taking pictures, and a software-only shutter makes it kinda awkward to me. Also, the N4 has a bigger screen and round shapes, which I dislike.Processor cores and screen resolution are largely irrelevant to me, since all apps seem to run acceptably well even on 1 or 2 years-old phones, and to watch HD content I'm largely happy with my HDTV. So, I chose this phone based, primarily, on its pentaband capability, on its looks, and on its being a Sony.As all non-Nexus phones, this one came preloaded with (admittedly) a not-so-obscene number of crApps and a couple of really beautiful and useful ones (namely, Sony's widgets). Sony's customizations to Android are not as obstrusive or colorful as some others (I got to handle Samsungs, HTCs and Motorolas while deciding, by the way), but really add usefulness and elegance to the phone, IMHO.What was really lousy was Sony's launcher. It's... rather monolythic, limiting. In such a harmonious package, the launcher feels rather dated. Even the leaked Xperia Yuga launcher feels like just makeup. So, I ditched it for Nova but the native Sony widgets won't work with it. But, there are some options to replace them (unfortunately, the replacements are not quite as beautiful or as well thought...).Now, to remove some of the crapware and to run an automation app I needed root access. And the only way to keep root access no matter what is to unlock your bootloader and install a rom. And the good news is that Sony itself will help you unlock your bootloader. If you are the daring type, you just won't care about this voiding the warranty. But if you do care, just leave the bootloader alone.I'm very happy with my phone. Almost no lags despite running Ice Cream Sandwich (in that department, Sony announced the Jelly Bean update rollout for this model will start sometime in February 2013), beautiful design and solid hardware (I mean, quad-core HAS to be better, but honestly, all my apps run well enough for me. I haven't noticed that much of a difference, if at all, while looking at my phone next to a Nexus 4). The camera takes excellent pictures: even in macro mode the depth of field is so narrow that the edges of a 10 dollar coin look slightly blurred when I took a macro shot! And it has a SD card slot! And of course, the well known (to me, at least) Sony build quality.The only cons I've found, this far...Battery life. On the stock rom, battery life is AWFUL. I don't know why. Maybe the crApps try to sync all the time or whatever. But the battery drain is CRAZY on stock rom. Maybe uninstalling stuff would work (Titanium backup might help, but I think it requires root access anyway), but it made me consider returning the phone after just a couple days. After I replaced the stock rom with Xperiment 1.5 (a stock-based rom) the battery life noticeably improved. Hopefully, the Jelly Bean update will address this battery life thingy.Autofocus speed and accuracy in low light. Depending on the contrast and the distance to the subject, it can take AGES to lock focus, or even miss it completely, IN LOW LIGHT. I don't know why. And I haven't found a workaround. Maybe in the next firmware release, but right now, even my ages-old Nokia N8 outperforms this one in the low-light-focusing department. Other than this, the Xperia T has an excellent camera with enough options. Also, the pulse led flash works very well and doesn't give the pictures that nasty blue hue or the spot reflection...To conclude, this phone is great out of the box, and excellent if you put the time and effort necessary to customize and optimize it. It's very well worth it.Pros:-Design-Size...-Camera-Official bootloader unlocking (but voids the warranty)-SD card slotCons-Battery life (on stock rom)-Low light focusing speedCheers!", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best smartphone I had", "Author": "Mariela Cristina Lopez Vasquez", "ReviewID": "R16CBY69M2XUUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is beautiful, fast, nice apps, the camara 13 mp is excellent, HD video perfect, you can put a 32 gb micro sd card in, and you can compared it to galaxys 3s and iphone 5 and is there side by side. most people does not know about this phone.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone but everything is in Japanese", "Author": "Applecrumble and Finch", "ReviewID": "RUCEN7G7Y9OO1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The sony Team came out with a great product with great capabilities however the seller failed to mention that the phone was in japanese...the icons on the screen, almost 8 of them are comprised of this foreign language and not to mention the google search icon...i tried to switch the language function on the phone itself to english however it does not change the search function on google, therefore everything comes back with Japanese results.

Words of caution though, be careful not to let your smartphone fall and make sure to have your upgrade over wireless internet and not through your PC with all the cables, at least that's what I was advised. Mine fell and broke the audio and when I did the upgrade via PC, the phone froze or hang due to unstable internet connection.  Luckily, the audio got fixed (not by Sony Center in Manila- they didn't know how to fix it)! If your Xperia hangs or freezes and does not reboot, allow the battery to drain completely (you'll see red light flashing repeatedly and fast until it stops), charge the phone for about 30 minutes before trying to turn it on. Then, continue charging until you get 100%. I was told by the ones who fixed the phone that smartphones are delicate, in general.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "best of the best", "Author": "eustance", "ReviewID": "R2JY36QCIUJLMZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It has the best features so unique and portable it is easy to go with.I will need a 4G but am glad it came to me in a good condition and in time", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent!!", "Author": "Diego Gonzales Vasquez \"Diego\"", "ReviewID": "R298MJZIB6ULUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent Xperia!!

This allows the back mounted loudspeaker to be heard clearly even when you lay it flat on a table.I really like the dedicated two stage camera button! From sleep mode, pressing the camera button will wake the phone up and snap a picture in less than 2 seconds. I am very impressed with this feature, and I wish all the other manufacturers would add this feature to their flagship phones.Compared to my previous phone, an HTC One X, this phone feels smaller in my hand, but the display looks very large because of the small bezel.The Sony user interface is well designed, and I think it is superior to Samsung's Touchwiz and HTC's Sense.I upgraded my phone to the newest Jelly Bean 4.1.2 ROM as soon as I got the phone, so I cannot comment on how bad the ICS based ROM was. I can say that the software runs great, it feels very fast and smooth, and I have had no problems with battery life, crashes, or connectivity. If you buy this phone, do a software update as soon as you charge it up, the new ROM fixes a lot of the problems with the original ROM.The model that I have is LT30at, which is the AT&T; version of the Xperia T. I bought this phone from Jet Set Market, and it was shipped out the next day, and arrived ahead of schedule.I am using this phone on T-Mobiles HPSA+ network, and I am happy with the speeds I am getting. I can get 9 Mbps on the downlink, and 1.6 Mbps. If you use this phone on T-Mobiles network, you will need to enter the APN settings manually.

It does not stay fully closed, and while I do not think this is a real problem, it just looks like a poor design.~~~~2 Month Update~~~~I still think this a great phone!T-mobile has rolled out LTE service in my area, and the only thing I had to do to access it was change my APN settings to Fast.T-mobile.com", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone defective in less than a month!", "Author": "Antonio", "ReviewID": "RTTHF38PLL9MJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a gift for my friend in Panama, After 2 weeks of moderate use he told me that he left the phone charging overnight and in the morning an orange light appeared and was not able to turn on the phone.
