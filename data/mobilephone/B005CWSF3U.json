{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for a Senior, less so for the Elderly", "Author": "J. Norvell \"peaknorvel\"", "ReviewID": "R1EIE2O4OP8NJN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The SnapFon ezONE-C Senior cell phone is about as simple as the standard model cell phones that you used to buy ten years ago.  It is NOT as simple as a landline phone and that made the phone perplexing to the 91 year old woman that I got this for.  It is smaller and lighter than I thought it would be, but that could be a plus or minus.  The buttons are about the same as a cheap calculator; they are large but you need to press in the center.  It has a radio function and a flashlight, which may delight a less elderly person, but I taped over the side switches that operate those with gaffers tape so that they wouldn't confuse.  The display is large and clear.The phone works with an AT&T; SIM card.  I bought a SIM card on Amazon, but, as it turns out, you must actually buy one from AT&T; anyway or they won't process you to get on their network.  The purchased SIM card did allow me to get the phone going earlier however, although it did take repeated phone calls to AT&T; and most of an afternoon to get the phone set up.  The phone comes with a SIM card from \"PureTalk\", a reseller of cell phone time, and I presume that setting up with them would be easier.The advantage of a cell phone is that any landline number can be transferred to it.  My phone user was being moved into an assisted living facility, just far enough away that she couldn't get a landline with the same number without keeping the old landline and buying a forwarding service -- sheesh.  The port to the cell phone went well, but, again, it did take some time on the line with AT&T; folks.  I just added her to our family plan and she is saving a lot of money, although you do need to absorb the cost of the phone, the SIM card, and a $40 fee for the new service.  She no longer needs the landline at her old home.My elderly user is perplexed that she needs to press down for a period of time to autodial, but she only presses for a short time to hang up.  As a result, she keeps turning the phone off, since the \"hang up\" button is also the power on and off button.  For seniors that are used to using cell phones previously, this may not be a problem.  For a life-long landline user, this is a problem.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "easy to use phone", "Author": "Melissa Z Schilke", "ReviewID": "R2884PSDV2B7A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for a developmentaly disabled person.

She is not tech-savvy, but she's picked up quickly on the \"how tos\" for this phone. She loves the large, back-lit numbers and the ease of stopping and starting a call. She's amazed that she does not have to remember and \"dial\" phone numbers, since they are all saved in the phone. The recessed, red emergency button on the back of the phone gives me some peace of mind, for my mom is often out and about and lives very independently. She does not use the radio, as many other reviewers also mentioned. I also purchased the charging stand so she does not have to deal with issues related to bending to plug in the charging cord or inserting the tiny end into the phone; she merely puts the phone into the stand which remains connected to the electrical current via the cord that comes with the phone.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lou A", "Author": "Lou A", "ReviewID": "RI0LUWNXCUFLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Snapfon has a host of benefits: moderate size, easy to hold square shape, easy read numbers,  simple answer and hang-up icons, no flipping case,  and especially the \"Panic Button\".

Most of the phones sold with pay-as-you-go plans are often the trashiest models with poor craftsmanship and half-working so-called \"features\", making it hard to find a good simple phone that just makes calls, sends and receives texts, has a recent call list and address book. The Snapfon is that hard-to-find gem of simplicity. Although it's not perfect, it's been my favorite of all the \"non-smart\" phones I've owned (which have included several Nokia and Motorola models, and even the Razr).Here are my favorite aspects:+Unlocked phone worked instantly with my T-mobile pay-as-you-go chip. No stupid unlock codes.+Battery life is long.+Screen lights up even in locked mode to illuminate the time.+LED flashlight works well.+Big buttons are nice to use.+Much lighter than your average brick phone.Here's what was keeping it from being a 5-star review:-Menu flow is too linear, making some actions seemingly dead ends. Cancel and delete both share the PWR/NO button, making some parts of the navigation dead-ends.-There's no way to do actions like browsing through the menus or turning on the phone silently while still having it in vibrate mode for calls or texts. Switching the phone to \"silent mode\" turns off all types of alerts and noises, including vibrate.-There's no free preview of text messages. Most other phones I've used let you preview the text message from the inbox which made it possible to read short messages without actually opening them. For using Google Voice text messaging, knowing who sent a text message is only possible by opening the message to see the header, which is a drag.-I can't figure out how to delete an unread text message. The option to delete only seems to be accessible after opening a text message, but which fortunately allows you to clear the entire inbox while deleting the one being read. Feature needs tweaking.-It's nice that the buttons are nice and big, but they seem to get pressed easily in the pocket. Hopefully the SOS button won't accidentally get pressed.-You have to directly enter a contact in the address book rather than typing in a number on the front screen and saving it, adding a name later.-While less features isn't necessarily bad, it's a little too expensive for how little it does.-FM radio really necessary? Whatever.Features wished for::? An alarm feature.:? USB connection to transfer contacts from computer address book (and maybe custom ring tones, but low priority).:? Bluetooth hands-free set compatibility.Bottom line: Pretty satisfied so far, despite phone's short-comings. More how simple phones should be.edit: Apparently my point about the chirps and noises while in vibrate mode or silent mode wasn't very clear, because got a personal call from ezONE telling me how to set the phone to vibrate. To be clear, the phone has a vibrate mode, but the buttons still chirp when you press them.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Senior Cell Phone - a great phone for anyone - especially the elderly", "Author": "AC", "ReviewID": "R2BUC15CPK9WYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My mom is 89 and is somewhat hard of hearing and a bit forgetful.  This exONE-C Senior Cell Phone is helping her to stay connected with her friends and family and is providing a level of security because it has some rather unique features as follows: 1. The ringer is adjustable but if set at high volume it is EXTREMELY LOUD and rings like a traditional bell type ringer. (Even if you want a phone which will ensure that no calls will be missed in a noisy environment, this is one to consider. 2. The volume of the call is easily adjustable without needing to go into any menus - there is an up/down rocker button on the side of the unit which can PRESET your incoming volume so your setting from the previous call will be retained for the next call.  The receiver can be set to be much louder than a conventional phone and the clarity is fine.  There is also a speakerphone which can be engaged with one button push.  3. The button size and simplicity of the layout is excellent.  4. The display is brightly lit in a yellow background with dark grey LCD numerals that are close to a 1/2 in. tall.  The display is simply one line but if the content that is to be displayed (such as a long name, etc.) has too many characters to fit in the display window, then the line scrolls repeatedly to show its entire content.  The display is designed to stay lit for a somewhat longer period of inactivity than is usually the case.  So if the person using the phone is a slow dialer or needs to check the number a few times while dialing, the backlight will not turn off that quickly.  When the phone is not in use, the display is still useful as it becomes a digital clock with large numbers and also indicates the day and date.  5. The size of the phone is slim and compact - certainly not a clunker.  It is basically just a little taller than the width of the hand that will be holding it and the width is about 2.5 in or so - a comfortable size to hold.  6. Once up to 9 one touch speed dial numbers are entered (complete with names), it is a simple 2 button press process to dial any of the 9 locations.  The 10th preset is set for 911.  Of course, the phone can be used to manually dial a phone number quite easily.  There is a unique red button (the size of a nickel on the back of the phone which can be programmed to dial several numbers sequentially in the case of an emergency - just press and hold the button for a moment and your selected recipients will receive a pre-recorded message asking for assistance. 7. There is a built-in digital FM radio with an on/off switch on the side of the phone for those times when you might want to listen to the news or music.  The radio uses the built-in speaker to provide a reasonable volume capability.  However,  I was only able to receive one or two stations well enough to enjoy.  Maybe if earphones are connected (there is a stereo headphone jack) the reception might be better - I did not try this. 8. This phone is compatible with either the AT&T; or T-Mobile network.  Service can be purchased without any contracts from either provider.  There is also information enclosed if you want to order service from Snapfon's own provider offering.  9. Battery life so far appears to be acceptable, with my mother needing to charge the phone every couple of days or so with between talking an hour or two each day. There is a large 5 segment battery gauge on one edge of the display while the opposed edge has a similar gauge to indicate signal strength.  The only thing about this phone which would be confusing to an elderly person (and for anyone else) is the menu system if you want to review or edit the phonebook or to check the caller ID history to see what calls were missed.  It is possible to accidentally start to call a stored number when you think you are just scrolling through the names.  All in all, this is a rather unique and very useful phone.  Anyone with a need for an easy to use, hear and see cellular phone will probably not be disappointed with this choice - especially for its reasonable price.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone - Great Price", "Author": "CarlyA", "ReviewID": "R3N5948WAYNP02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for my 81 year old grandmother.

I am in my fifties and ordered it because I believe in the philosophy of \"KISS\", Keep It Stupidly Simple and, of course, easy to use. Please find below initial likes and dislikes.LIKES  1) Very large, well lighted, and real easy to push numbers great when driving, in dark, etc., or just being human.  2) Two of the multiple ring tones are real cool: Hawaii Five-O and opening title song to James Bond movies.  3) Has a speaker phone engaged by holding the \"0\" key or pushing the green \"OK\" key and then selecting speaker.  4) You can elect to have woman's voice announce the number keys each time you push one when dialing.  5) Built-in LED flash light with switch on side of phone.  6) Simple, amber back lighted screen which shows numbers and words with no pictures.  7) Center \"MENU\" button easy to push lets you maneuver menus with up and down push of button.  8) Three large key (green OK, yellow MENU, red PWR/NO) buttons for send call, access to menus, phone on/off, etc.  9) Ability to lock keys with a side mounted sliding lock/unlock switch.  10) Red SOS (Panic) button on back for calling up to four programmable, owner pre-set phone numbers.  11) It irritated my wife when I told her I was going to buy a \"Senior Phone\".  12) Loved the fact she had to eat her words when she actually liked it after it arrived. Told you so dear!DISLIKES  1) NO BLUETOOTH! Spoke to manufacturer about this before buying and expressed my concern.

My fingers and hands don\u2019t work very well anymore. I need big buttons, not a touchscreen.\u201dHe stroked the peach fuzz on his chin, deep in thought. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a phone with big buttons.\u201dThere was a picture on the wall behind him of a woman with the caption \u201cHi, I\u2019m Klare, the Store Manager. Let me know if I can help you!\u201d She looked confident, knowledgeable, experienced. She looked at least 22. \u201cCan I talk to your manager? Maybe she\u2019ll have an idea.\u201dThirty seconds later, Klare was there, ready to help. \u201cI just need a cell phone,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about a touchscreen or the internet or texting or talking to Siri or any of those extra things. And it has to have big buttons.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a phone like that, but I\u2019ve read about them on Wikipedia.\u201d It was reassuring that Klare had done so much research at such an authoritative source. I could see why she was the Store Manager. \u201cYou might be able to find one on Ebay. The only problem is that often the seller doesn\u2019t have the cords anymore.\u201dMy wife and I looked at each other and smiled. Our kids make fun of us because we have two boxes in the basement containing every electrical cord we have ever owned. It would be sweet revenge if we actually got to use one of them!Once home, I got on the internet and started to go to Ebay when I had a better idea. I googled \u201cCell Phones Big Buttons\u201d. Exactly .29 seconds later I had about 1,830,000 results and bought the first phone on the list.I\u2019ve had the phone about a week now and really like it, but clearly, its target audience is much older than I. For example, the phone gets FM radio reception. Only people over the age of 80 would think that was cool. (Mabel: \u201cGeorge, the cell phone comes with FM radio!\u201d George: \u201cMabel, what in tarnation is FM?\u201d) The ring tones that come with the phone are a phone ring from the 1920s, the Andy Griffith theme song and \u201cChattanooga Choo Choo\u201d. The cool great-grandpas can also choose \u201cDragnet\u201d, \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d and \u201cJames Bond\u201d. It also has a special \u201cfuneral mode\u201d which automatically changes the ring tone to \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d. The ring tone volume is adjustable, but even the softest level is louder than an infomercial in the middle of the night.There is also a keen safety feature which only people of a certain age can appreciate. If you can\u2019t wait  for help to arrive if you dialed 911, there is a big red button on the back of the phone you can use to call for more immediate help. When you push the button, a VERY loud voice yells for help. The three standard yells you can choose from are \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up!\u201d, \u201cHelp! I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here!\u201d and \u201dHelp! Someone stole my clothes!\u201d You can also record a custom message. Mine says \u201cHelp! I can\u2019t find my TV remote!\u201dYou may think my message is silly, but you would be wrong. Just the other day, I called Comcast to get some help with a technical issue we were having. The woman on the phone fixed my problem, then asked helpfully \u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d\u201cWell, do you know where my TV remote is?\u201d\u201cThe one upstairs or the one in the basement?\u201d\u201cThe one upstairs.\u201d\u201cDid you look under the red pillow on the sofa?\u201dSure enough it was there!

Worthwhile additions.Let me start with the positives.  Large buttons. I got this for my step dad and this was the primary reason for the purchase. There is nothing else like it. Sound. The old skool ringer is VERY loud. The speakerphone is fairly loud. The earpiece is unfortunately just so-so volume wise. The mono screen is easy to see and that really helps battery life. You can also have the phone \"speak\" each button you press which can be useful. It's a quad band unlocked GSM phone (no GPRS or data) and you are not stuck with pricey service like Jitterbug.

Works in Canada with Rogers.", "Author": "John Faughnan \"John G Faughnan\"", "ReviewID": "R3I4T121BHNV53", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my 83 yo mother the unlocked GSM Snapfon ezONE-C Senior Cell Phone with Big Buttons for about $80 (it's $60 now) along with its car charger (forgetting she doesn't drive any more!). I then carried it to her home in Montreal and activated on a Roger's 40 cent/min (but 0$/day) PayGo plan.My mother likes her Mac Mini and iPad, but she's largely blind, quite arthritic, and has peripheral neuropathy reducing her sense of touch. So most phones won't work for her. This was the only phone we could find that she might be able to use. She needs, for example, to be able to call for help when Montreal's sometimes unreliable wheelchair transport service fails to show up - leaving her stuck in her wheelchair as snow swirls, water freezes, and hungry wolves approach over the ice.It is impressive how few devices are made for people like my mother.  I assume the demand isn't there. Certainly if she were younger she might do well with a VoiceOver iPhone, but the combination of age and diminished touch make VoiceOver hard for her. In any case that was my best guess, but the next best choice to this $60 phone is probably a $700 iPhone 5.Based on limited use, here are my impressions of the device. I'll start with the bad, then the good. Bottom line: I think it will work, but I'd rather buy a better version for $100 than the current phone for $60.THE BAD- It doesn't get its time settings off the mobile network. Very weird.- I fear it doesn't  persistently store its configuration. I don't want to test this, but I think prolonged removal of the battery will wipe all setup - and setup is a bit painful. File this under \"suspicion\" not proven. Settings do survive a quick battery swap. (Maybe it's storing some data on the SIM card, in which case I might have been confused by a SIM swap.)- This is a very Chinese product -- feels like it was built for the Chinese or Japanese market. That is, it has a number of weird add-on features like an FM radio and a flashlight that mostly add complexity and seem weird for the US market. On the other hand, I think my mother might actually use the FM radio. It uses the ear set as an antenna. In my testing it worked well with an iPhone ear set and with iPod ear buds despite the manual saying only Nokia and SNAPFON earphones work.)- It has too many features that can simply cause confusion and will never be used, like 'conference call' and 'call waiting'. Even SMS is of dubious value. The radio introduces many options.- The power connector is small and hard for my mother to find. I stuck a rubber matt near it so she could find it. It is easily confused with the headphone jack.- It feels fragile and unreliable. We're not talking iPhone 5 build. I'd happily pay $40 more for better build quality.- Display is small and text layout is a bit off.

She is on my AT&T; Family Plan and all that I had to do was install her AT&T; chip. The only problem she had was that she had to enter the \"Menu\" to find a phone number. The menu function is foreign to her. Eventually she got it and loves the phone now. I would suggest that the \"Menu\" button become the \"phone book\" button. Then access to the menu could be done by someone else (like me) with a combination of buttons (say * and # at the same time) to program the phone. Then the person using it does not have to enter the menu for every day tasks. She was having trouble when she entered the menu function because she would select the wrong item and get lost in the menu. It is more difficult for older people to learn because, when in the menu, it only displays one option and they don't understand that there are other options they can choose.

To make it even worse, she is almost deaf.  She also gets confused easily and tries to manually input my cell phone number, but often mis-dials and calls other people in my town, but can't hear them speaking when they answer and so she calls them over and over and over.She lives in my home but I often can't hear her when she hollers for me.  So I purchased this Snapfon ezONE-C.  The first one was defective, and I sent it back.  Also, don't bother purchasing the cradle accessory, you don't need it to charge the phone.  The one I got was flimsy and didn't even work to charge the phone at all and I sent it back.  I did get the lanyard and attach it so Mom had something extra to hang on to.Here is how the Snapfon has solved a few of our problems:  On the back side of the phone is a bright red candy-like SOS button.  Every day I ask my mother, how do you call me?  And I watch to see that she can point to the red button and count to five.  The SOS button can be programmed to text several numbers with an emergency message of your choosing, and I think it can also phone a list of emergency numbers from your contact list.  Every time she texts me it uses 10 cents of our ATT pay as you go time.  I have also programmed keypad #9 for 911 and another keypad # to quickdial me.When I am home, I use the sliding lock mechanism on the side of the phone to prevent her from trying to dial out on her own because she can't do it, but still wants to try.  This saves airtime and my neighbors from going nuts with the whole dial and ditch thing.  Even if the keypad is locked, the emergency button on the back still functions and she can answer when I call her back.  There is a nice super loud ring tone that she can actually hear.The things I don't like about the phone:  The fm radio switch on the side.  She accidentally turns it on, and it hisses loudly but she can't hear it.  The flashlight:  same thing.  I'd just rather have a basic phone with nothing she can accidentally turn on.  The phone feels a bit flimsy but so far it does the job.  The first one I bought was sent back because the lock button only worked intermittently and I had to remove the battery to unlock the phone.I'm using this in conjunction with a nursery monitor to try and keep better tabs on my Mom who has fallen a few times, and then not been able to figure out the cell phone she carried to call me for help.

This stuff has been happening continually since he got the phone a few weeks ago.The speaker phone is difficult for him to operate, also.  You have to hold the 0 button down when you are on a call.

The 2 good things about this phone is that it is very load and the keys and text are large.  For the most part this is an OK phone with no frills.On the other side, we kept missing calls because the phone would not ring. I had set the ringer at the lowest level because it is very load and my wife was in the hospital when we received the phone. Every time I checked the ringer setting it was turned off. We finally realized that if you hit the minus volume key when you are not on a call the phone lowers the ringer volume. So if the ringer is set to the lowest level before it goes to off, then the first accidental hit of the minus volume shuts the ringer off. The placement of the up/down volume keys makes it very easy to accidentally change the ringer volume. I have to admit it is mentioned in the owner's manual that hitting the up/down volume key changes the ringer volume when not on a call. It does not warn you that it can shut the ringer off. For a senior with vision impairment, this is a problem in my opinion. I think the only way you should be able to shut the ringer off is in the setup menu.The placement of the up/down switch of the side of the phone also created problems when listening to calls. If your hand touches the switch while you are listening to a call it will change the volume to include shutting the speaker off. This happened several times during our use of the phone. After surgery her hands were not as steady as before and the phone would shut the speaker off. After tying to call my wife and her answering the phone but not being able to hear me we decided we didn't want to deal with this phone anymore. A phone is meant for communications and that can't happen when the ringer or speaker is shut off.Neither of us was satisfied with the voice quality of the calls either.After trying to contact my wife on Thursday and not being able to get thru, we decided it was time to get rid of the phone. We purchase the phone directly from Snapfon. I called customer support at Snapfon and they were very nice. They looked up my order and said we had the phone for over 30 days and we could not return it for a refund. I explain my wife had surgery and was in the hospital for 5 weeks, but that didn't make any difference. We were 10 days past the limit and rules are rules.

If you could get used to the more complicated \"navigation\" it might be easier to make calls on.The phone itself is not much, if any, larger than most mobile phones, so since the keys are larger (and they are much larger) there are not as many keys.  So the usual \"soft keys\" are missing and the \"call\" and \"end\" key must serve multiple functions. This makes navigation more complex than a standard mobile phone.  Green key (call) is also used much like an <enter> key and one must scroll through options using the center (Menu) key and the call key. The end key is also the \"no\" key and is used to back up through the processes.Also the Snapfon does not provide some common options like call forwarding.  We put the Sim card in another phone to program call forwarding and some other options that are not in the Snapfon's \"settings\" menu.  It does not indicate the time/date on missed calls either.

It was a Christmas present for my husband, who is 70 and needs something easy to use. But this phone has two flaws that we consider major and are why we sent it back: 1) You cannot turn off the music that plays every time you turn it on or off! If your volume is set anywhere near \"hear-able,\" everyone around you will hear when you turn it on or off. Do Snapfon users never go to the movies or travel on a plane? You could probably turn the volume all the way down before turning it off, but then you'd have to remember to turn it up again when turning it back on. Either involves repeated pressing of a toggle on the side. NOT!2) You cannot set this phone to Vibrate Only, just Vibrate & Ring (together) if you want it to vibrate. So, if you are expecting a call but don't want to disturb those around you, again you have to turn the volume all the way down. (And then later, after your meeting or movie, remember to turn the volume back up again). The nice young woman at Snapfon said these two features were not there for \"simplicity\" reasons, but my husband and I consider them basic, so it's going back. Too bad, we had wanted the Unlocked feature for a trip overseas in April.[LATER] Realized we can't return it because the box has been opened, we've used the phone trying to figure it out, and my husband already wrote the phone number (from the AT&T; sim card we bought separately) on the instruction booklet.

However, PLEASE NOTE that it does NOT work with Consumer Cellular's older SIM cards!My experience went like this: I had an old Nokia cell phone with one of Consumer Cellular's SIM cards in it (2 or 3 years old) and when I put that SIM card in the Snapfon EZ TWO, it didn't work.  (Note - Snapfon has excellent instructional video clips at their website that demonstrate every espect of how to use the features of the Snapfon EZ TWO...and they have one for how to install the SIM card)I called the Consumer Cellular Customer Service number (888-345-5508) and talked to the Tech Support people and I was told that the older Consumer Cellular SIM cards don't work with many of the newer cell phones and they have to send you a new SIM card.  I asked them to do so (programmed with my current cell phone number), which they do for free.  It takes about 2 or 3 days to get to you because they mail it to you from Portland, Oregon.  When you receive the new SIM card, put it into the Snapfon EZ TWO and then you have to call Consumer Cellular to have it activated.After the new SIM card is activated, your new Snapfon EZ TWO will be working with Consumer Cellular's service.  And that is how we do that!P.S. - You may not have to go through this when you are transferring a SIM card from a phone with one of Consumer Cellular's newer SIM cards...at least that's what they told me.  If, however, your cell phone provider is Consumer Cellular and your original SIM card doesn't work with your Snapfon EZ TWO, this is what you have to do to make it work.  I hope that this explanation helps.  I love the features.  They are the features that I want in a cell phone and will use.UPDATE: 12/26/2013: IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT VOICEMAIL ACTIVATION: Because I was using a Consumer Cellular SIM card, I had to have initial assistance from Consumer Cellular's Customer Service Department to set up my voicemail.  The directions for setting up my voicemail didn't work until after Consumer Cellular programmed my SIM card.  After they program your SIM card (using their computer to do this over the phone), you just follow the Snapfon EZ TWO Instructions to set up your voicemail.  They will walk you through the process to get the IMEI number (serial number) from your SIM card so they can program it.  You have to call their Customer Service number (888-345-5508) to do this.  This call does NOT count against your monthly total of minutes.  It's a very easy process and their customer service is very good.

I wear glasses and travel a lot, so it is great having big buttons so I can handle a phone call easily at airports without having to search in my purse for the reading glasses, and is so so light, that for somebody like me with psoriasis arthritis in my hands.Another smart thing is the orange screen with big numbers which makes it easy to see in the dark.This phone is awesome and affordable", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Senior Cell Phone", "Author": "JP Russell \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R9YF3X2YKUOP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been really pleased with this phone. I keep it by my bed for calls from my wife who has her own business as a pet sitter and is often out on calls while I am still sleeping. Plus I have frequent migraines that send me to bed. This phone allows me to answer without putting on my reading glasses or make calls, without putting on my glasses. The large numbers on the keys are easy to read without my glasses, plus I have a few important numbers programmed into the speed dial feature, so one number is usually all I have to dial. The advertising says the battery life is 120 hours on standby, but I have been getting much more.I read comments made by one reviewer indicating that the 91 year old woman that he got the phone for was perplexed by various aspects of the phone which he admits have to due with her lack of familiarity with cell phones, etc. Yet he rates the Snapfon a 3. He seems to forget, the Snapfon is advertised as a Senior phone, not a phone for people who are, as he says \"elderly\", the kind of person who is very unfamiliar with any modern technology and often is both easily confused by it and unwilling to learn how to use it. Nevertheless, I saw several reviews by folks who bought this phone for their 80 year old parents who loved it and rated the phone a 5. I am going on 70 but don't really think of myself as a senior yet and I would rate this phone as a 5 plus if I could.The SOS button is an excellent feature that I have not seen on any other phone. You press it and an emergency message goes out to the three numbers you have programmed into the phone.The only thing I feel could really be improved is the owners manual, but face it, that is something that could be said about most products today. I have contacted Snapfon's Customer Support with questions about programming my phone several times and they have responded with very clear and helpful answers so I am well pleased with customer support as well.Most recently I contacted customer support for clarification about programming the message that goes out when you press the SOS button. I wasn't sure if it was only a text message or if you could program a voice message but customer service said it is text only. However, it is possible to modify the text message and they gave me instructions on how to do that.I really like the simplicity this phone has for using certain features such as key lock, the flashlight and volume. Instead of having to go into the menu, these are all easily controlled by simple slide switches on the side of the phone which make using these features much more practical.{ASIN: B005CWSF3U, Snapfon ezONE-C Senior Cell Phone}", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, but has a few issues", "Author": "Judith, Barbados", "ReviewID": "R3QNIDUO1B9LQ9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my elderly husband of 89 years, whose hands / fingers lack strength.

He can't hear well, he has little to no feeling in his fingers and he refuses to wear his glasses. *sigh*That being said - he freakin' loves this phone! He used to have one of those gianormous brick cell phones from the 80's. He had to give that up about 7 years ago - no - not kidding!! Since then he's had the same Nokia. Unfortunately he dropped it on the cement and it broke into a few dozen pieces. Never fear, he had a plan! He enlisted my mother to go down to the AT&T; store and buy him an identical phone. Surely they would have it. Surely! After almost 2 days of arguing and ATTEMPTING to explain to him that his phone was OLD... they didn't sell it anymore... and no you can't buy used phones from AT&T...; why don't they keep the used phones and sell them - IS  a good question, but we don't know the answer... Go ahead and write a letter to the president of the company... telling him we understood that he wanted to move to Canada now, to get away from the \"Commies\" who make cell phones... (He really needs his own show. He's quite animated and hysterical when he goes on rants) - my mother and I gave up! Then... I went on Amazon and searched for cell phones for seniors.I found this gem of a phone. I almost want one myself, I love the big numbers, its so cute. Before purchasing it I read that the numbers are almost as big as dimes - they are! I ordered 2, one in white and one in black - on a subsequent rant he complained first about not being about to see white lettering on black and then later, vice versa. He is currently using the white one and loves it to pieces. He can read it, the numbers are big enough for him to see, and the ringer is ear-shatteringly loud. He walked out to the street at our family business which is located on a frontage road along a busy freeway, and we stayed in the office and called him and we could hear the ringer from there - and he could hear us over the freeway traffic. Its very basic, no confusing screen or displays. Its got a programmable emergency button on the back. And the radio is fun too.The only cons we've run into is that he turns the radio on, on accident a lot and it does feel a little flimsy. BUT he is in is 80's and he still drives a big ol' bobtail truck and delivers palettes of goods for a living. He carries this phone around with him everywhere and has dropped it, left it in the back of a freezer truck and sat on it several times - and it still works.Give it a chance, its a good little - big numbered - phone.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Senior Cell Phone", "Author": "Carolyn E.

The SnapFon had an optional lanyard that we ordered and this was the lifesaver.  She now doesn't lose the phone when getting up from her wheelchair.  Also the 911 button on the back, this is a great feature, what I wasn't sure and people should take note, you can DISABLE the text feature and you can program whatever number you want it to call when using the emergency call button.  Mom has severe arthritis, her fingers tend to push things accidentally as she has little control over them, so we programmed the emergency call button to call the nurse's station at the nursing center for help.  We disabled the text option.  So if she accidentally pushes the button, its not calling 911 for non emergencies and its also not texting people in the middle of the night creating a panic for something that isn't a panic.  The big numbers are so helpful to her, she is able to use a knuckle or thumb to push the buttons that we have preprogrammed to help her call with just 1-touch.  The ring tones are SUPER loud, yay!  We did choose one that wasn't terribly obnoxious as she does have a roommate in the nursing home.  She can hear so well on the phone, so even if the phone isn't right on her ear (she doesn't quite get the idea of where the speaker is for the phone since its not like a home phone), but she can still hear because the volume is set at a high enough level, in fact, we were able to turn it down.

They only served to further confuse my father-in-law. The volume up and down buttons are too easy to press when holding the phone because of their location. The lock switch is hard to slide for someone with a little bit of artritis.When an SMS message arrives (gosh, I wish someone would make a phone that would just *NOT* receive SMS messages!), the keyboard locks until you ack the message by pressing the NO (red) button). But if you press the NO button too long, the phone powers off!The keys are big (good), but a bit plasticky which sometimes leads to missed keystrokes.There have been several cases where the phone apparently didn't ring. However, when it does ring, it is very loud (which is _very_ good).A nice surprise is that the phone supports multiple languages. The spanish voice has a madrile\u00f1a accent which is warm and easy to understand.The manual has sections in english and spanish. However, as is typical of most chinese manufacturers, it is a real challenge to understand either version as the text often makes no sense whatsoever.The phone does not come with any lanyard so we bought one from Snapfon. It is very overpriced, feels very cheap and worse yet, it separates easily so it is rather useless at keeping the phone around your neck.Note that there are several fairly similar phones out there.

The \"home\" suggested that the local landline carrier would require 4-6 weeks to get a landline installed. We looked into the landline cost and decided that a cell option would be better, faster, cheaper. Turned out to be the right thing to do. After a bit of research we decided that the Snapfon would be the better choice among only a limited set of options for large-button, large-display, minimum-complexity we could find on the internet. Our family carrier (AT&T;) didn't have such a phone available. Amazon delivered the phone in three days - order to arrival! We had decided to add the phone to our AT&T; family plan, so we had to wait until we got the phone before we could register it with AT&T;, based on a conversation with the AT&T; help line - get the phone, call AT&T;, get the new chip in a couple of days, good to go!We received the phone and called AT&T.; The person this time said that to add a phone to our family plan we had to actually purchase a phone from AT&T;! He suggested we could order a smartphone for a dollar, wait for it to be delivered, transfer the line to the Snapfon for a $40 registration fee, and then throw the smartphone away or sell it on eBay. I didn't believe it either!So, the same afternoon I visited the local AT&T; wireless retail outlet. There I was able to get the Snapfon registered on the spot, with a $40 charge for the new registration and no smartphone - what a deal! Since then, the phone has been great. Our 95-year-old relative has been completely satisfied. The second day he had the phone, he needed to contact a staff member for assistance. His \"lifeline\" - a red cord connected to a switch on the wall - had fallen on the floor and he couldn't reach it. He called me on his Snapfon (my phone number is one of the few he has memorized), I called the home, and they were at his door in a couple of minutes. We now have the home's number programmed on the 3 key (1 is messages, 2 is 911).Numbers on both keys and display are large and bright enough that he has no trouble seeing them with his compromised vision, and the phone audibly repeats each number as it is pressed. His major remaining issue is that he almost always forgets to press the red hang-up button - with his old land-line phone it disconnected when he returned the handset to the cradle. This wastes a minute or so of talk time while the system detects hang-up at the other end of the connection - an issue common to any cell phone.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my phone", "Author": "Happy", "ReviewID": "R4KYFOGCWAQ0D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my Snapfon ezONE-C Senior Cell Phone.

Since she can't hear on the phone, she has hope her caller can hear her tell them to hold on while she puts them on the speaker, then hold the ZERO button for a few seconds which emits a loud tone that the caller hears before the speaker is engaged.

The main problem is that the volume control is on the left edge and this is exactly where you need to hold the phone to answer and place calls.  When he tried to use the phone, there was seldom any sound level because the volume was often turned down by accident.  Another problem is the complexity of the address book.

Out of the box it felt loose and of rather poor quality. Similar to a plastic toy. I assumed it just needed to have the battery put in it to give it some heft. I got the battery in it and charged it up. We got the phone set up and began testing it. I followed the instructions and could not get the SOS button to function at all. I figured I had done something wrong. I called tech support and a guy obviously in a home office answered. Just as he answered I happened to flip on the flashlight button and it didn't come on. Again I thought I was doing something wrong so I started out by simply asking him how to turn on the flashlight before I got into the more complicated SOS button question. He said, \"push the button up and down a couple times\", so I did. I told him it was fully charged and the phone was turned on. His response was, \"I guess it don't work\". I politely told him the phone was of such bad quality I would just return it and didn't need him to next tell me that the SOS button that may be needed to save my mother's life also \"don't work.\"A phone specifically designed for seniors needs more than big buttons, a loud speaker volume, and an Andy Griffith ring tone. It needs to be at least as well made and a prepaid Walmart phone and functional. Stay clear of this phone.

It is as easy to use a regular desk phone and has big, lighted keys, a large high-contrast very readable display (even outdoors in bright light), and plenty of ringer and speaker volume. An unexpected bonus for me is, that at my residence, I have a consistent four-bar signal strength whereas my previous phones the signal strength just vacillated between zero and one. The phone is attractive in appearance, light weight, easy to carry and the battery charge also lasts longer than my previous phones.The emergency button feature is also well thought out and should eliminate the need for the expense of the \"I've fallen and can't get up devices.\" The built in LED flash light is another handy item as is the built-in FM radio that would be very desirable in a disaster situation.The operational menu is straight forward, simple and intuitive to use. Other than the keypad there are only 3 big clearly marked buttons to deal with. The keypad lock, flashlight, volume and FM radio are controlled by four separate switches located on the sides of the case.I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this phone It is one of those rare cases where a need was identified and a device designed and built to fulfill that need and they got it exactly right.

I purchased this phone because I want a cel phone that is mainly just a phone.  If I want to access the Internet, then I use a computer or laptop with a regular keyboard.Additionally, for me, a cel phone is for the car.  No, I don't regularly yak on a phone when I should be paying attention to the road -- I just like having the phone in the car in case I'm running late for something and I have to call ahead, or if I need to call for help.  I occasionally take the phone with me if I'm expecting an important call -- or if the car is being serviced and I'm waiting for a call from the mechanic -- but I have no need to walk around, oblivious to the world around me, constantly talking on a cel phone.Since they no longer make permanent-mount car phones anymore, this phone is the next best thing.  The same things that make it good for senior citizens also make it good for the car -- big buttons, easy to read display, and no complex menus.  I bought the car charger with the phone, and I also made a docking station for it that allows me to have it mounted in the car -- it would be nice if a car docking station with speaker phone was an accessory you could order, especially since the phone doesn't have Bluetooth.So, why 4 stars instead of 5?  Because there are a few minor design flaws, mainly with setting the volume of the ringer and keypad tones.  The instruction manual decribes the procedures to change the volume of the ringer and keypad tones from a set-up menu, and when you follow those steps, the display indicates that your changes are saved... but they are not!Customer service was extremely helpful and friendly in helping me figure this out.  It turns out that, those menu selections to change the ringer and keypad volume settings just do not work on this version of the phone.  To change the ringer volume, you just use the volume buttons on the side of the phone when you're not on a phone call, and then hit the green OK button when you're done.  As for the keypad tones -- as of now, there is no way to actually change the volume of the keypad tones, but that isn't really a big deal.Another oddity is that, when I first charged it and set the clock, the time and date erased and needed to be reset after I simply turned the phone off and then back on.  After that, the time and date continued to work no matter how many times I turned the phone off and on.  Customer service confirmed that this, too, is a minor design flaw for this version of the phone, and not just a defect on my phone.Finally, if you receive a text message, sometimes the characters of the message are broken up in an odd way when you scroll through the message.  Once again, customer service confirmed that this is normal.  I hardly ever send a text, but my prepaid phone account sends me a text with my remaining balance after each call, so it is nice to have text messaging capability on the phone.As for the phone itself, it works fine.  I was able to put in my AT&T; SIM card for my prepaid account, and once I had AT&T; unlock the SIM card, it worked right away.  Calls are clear, and the battery life is great!  The other features, such as the FM radio and flashlight, are easy to use and nice to have.  So far, the phone works just as advertised -- reliable and easy to use.

I've also had issues with reception but your mileage will vary here.  I've used the phone in Manhattan on AT&T; and T-Mobile and in Jamaica (W.I.) with Lime and Digicel.  In all cases the reception fluctuates wildly indoors.  I haven't determined if it is because of radio interference, if I am 'holding it wrong' or the phase of the moon but it definitely struggles more than the candybar Samsung it replaces.Finally, for entirely selfish reasons, I would have found the FM radio, present in the previous Snapfon model, more useful than the included camera but all in all it is a solid, non-too-complicated option for someone with low vision.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone for Elderly", "Author": "Patricia Smith \"Patricia Smith\"", "ReviewID": "R3KF3FHTTYNL8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased for 83 yr. old with no cell phone experience.

He found that the display is easy to read (depending on how well his eyes are working on any particular day, of course.) He likes the easy to read send, end and numerical buttons.Texting is not too bad, but could be better. For instance, pressing the pound key multiple times toggles through different input modes (uppercase, lowercase, etc) but you also have to toggle through Spanish input and many other options, making for many keypresses to go from lowercase to uppercase and back - assuming that you want to capitalize some words. Not extremely user friendly. He finds it easier to send in all upper- or lowercase most of the time. Also, there is no \"Sent\" folder for texts. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice to see what you've sent - especially for older ones with a possibly poor memory.For changing sound options, they are not all grouped together. It takes 8 keypresses to change the phone to vibrate mode and another 8 to change back to audible. To change to completely silent takes only a few keypresses, however. It would be nice if all the sound options were in the same menu area (Silent, Audible, Vibrate all together) and easy to access as this is something that is likely changed often.The battery life is very good. With such a small display, it does not use much energy to power the backlight. He only has to charge it once or twice a week.The earpiece volume can be very loud if adjusted up all the way. The ringer volume is also very loud. Great for the hard-of-hearing - which he is not.

Also, in order to call her speed dial numbers, she has to hold down the number she wants to speed dial for a longer period of time before it starts to dial that number, otherwise the speaker will just say the number.

I love the phone's large buttons and its ease of use; however, for my dad who was not familiar with cell phones there were a few things he had trouble with.  The first thing was the size of the phone and the position of the volume and lock buttons on the sides of the phone rather than on the front face of the phone.  It is a standard size bar phone, but for my dad it is a bit too small.  He can't handle the phone without either switching the phone to \"lock\" position or hitting the volume button (which adjusts both the volume of the ringtone and volume of the sound in the earpiece).  He's in a nursing home and he'd call in frustration saying he couldn't dial out (because he accidentally switched the lock button) or couldn't hear me well, or at all (because he had accidentally bumped the volume button).  Because my dad has moderate dementia and is unfamiliar with cell phones when I tried to explain what was wrong, he couldn't follow me and I'd have to make a trip to the nursing home or ask the staff there to mess around with his phone.  I have been able to use a heavy grade clear packing tape to cover the sliding \"lock/unlock\" button to keep him from accidentally sliding the button. I can't, however, figure out a way to keep the volume button in one position because it's a toggle switch rather than a slide like the lock button.  I would recommend that SnapFon find a way to enable users to lock the volume in place or move the button to a place less likely to be affected when picking up and using the phone.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice little phone for my 83-yr-old mother", "Author": "Judy V", "ReviewID": "R14MB6O1D63XEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my 83-yr-old mother because she never used her other pre-paid phone.

The phone arrived and immediately seemed problematic. The writing on the screen was distorted and jumbled. Sometimes the phone worked, but often when she tried to make a call, it would say connected but you couldn't hear the other person and they couldn't hear you. The voicemail was garbled. Snapfon's customer service is awful: they told me they would examine the phone to see if there was anything wrong with it, and then decide whether it needed to be replaced. I said that was absurd because it meant my mother would have no service for weeks. I asked them to send a replacement phone in the meanwhile, and I would return the broken one. They refused unless I gave an additional deposit. Remember, this is a company whose website says: \"handset replacement included in every plan, no deductible, no shipping cost.\" If they won't replace the broken one they just shipped me without a hassle, are they really going to replace one that breaks a few months later?  I am cutting my losses and sending back this flimsy piece of junk. Here are some things to keep in mind. The 30-day satisfaction guarantee is from the moment you order. So if it takes a week to arrive, you lose that time on your trial. I thought I could try it with our ATT Sim card, but the snapfon no longer works with ATT Sim cards, so I had to close my mother's ATT account to start this one.

She gave up her previous cellphone, thinking she didn't use it enough to justify paying for a plan.  Then I researched the Snapfon.  She hasn't received it yet, but I think it will work beautifully for her needs.  With the help of the technicians at Snapfon, I was able to set her phone up in no time at all.  Chelsea was most helpful in getting the phone activated and instructed me on general information I needed to know to program her contacts as well as answering any questions I had.The phone has many great features, but the one I like best for my mom who, is in her 80's, is the SOS button on the back.  If there is an emergency of any kind, for example if she should fall and is unable to dial numbers, she simply pushes the large red button on the back and it will immediately send out text messages to four numbers that are programmed into the SOS feature of the phone.  Once the text messages are sent, it will start dialling the numbers that are programmed until there is an answer.The sound is clear and the signal is great.  But most of all, the service representatives at Snapfon are top notch!  I feel secure knowing that if my mom should have any technical issues, she will be politely talked through a problem and will be able to handle it on her own which contributes to her sense of independence which she values so much.Thank you Snapfon for making such a good product and for putting into place individuals who put customer service as a top priority.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong battery", "Author": "iappraise", "ReviewID": "R2ZXQCMLAIUDOD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone worked for a couple years.

To get past those notifications in order to use speed dial requires pushing another button (the red Power button) twice, and then the speed dial number.  That's nothing for most of us, but not for a senior--if they have to press three keys to make a call, it really makes it not that much more convenient than a standard cell or landline.

However, SNAPfon connected and disconnected the phone twice, once due to a porting problem for our longstanding landline number, and then because the credit card expired, leaving us without service for multiple days each time.  When the credit card expired, they sent an e-mail 4 hours before cutting off the phone, even though the service was overpaid (because they charged my mom's credit card twice).  Then two weeks later, the battery died.  No charge, no go, no phone.  I ran around trying to find a battery, forget that.  I called SNAPfon, and they sent a new battery, but would not overnight it (for which they want over $50.00). No, SNAPfon is not compatible with ANY other battery, so forget Radio Shack or Battery Warehouse.Frankly, seniors don't need this, and surely cannot afford to be left without 911 service. There is absolutely no excuse.  This is a classic example of a smart idea with extremely poor management.  When I asked them why they didn't call to update the credit card, they felt I should have known to change the expiration, which expires every 5 years.  In this day and age, one expects a little bit more communication, particularly given that Seniors don't have the capability to keep track of these types of details and a simple report off of a basic data system could alert SNAPfon to those users whose credit expiration is about to expire so this issue can be dealt with without loss of critical phone service.  I digress.In my state, there is a law which makes it illegal to disconnect the phone of a senior if it will cut off 911 service.

There is no menu option to leave it in speaker phone mode and you cannot go into speaker mode until the call is connected.
