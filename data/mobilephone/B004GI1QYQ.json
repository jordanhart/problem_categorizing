The phone comes with Spanish and English instruction manuals. The phone is set to display the English language out of the box. The phones charger is for a different receptacle type but comes with an adapter so that you can use the charger in an US standard electrical receptacle.  Nice phone, I found the reviews for it online to be accurate.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good basic phone", "Author": "run", "ReviewID": "RLAORGJFGI6BA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted a phone not too complicated and a good phone to make phone call, not to play or go on internet. This phone is good, I need to plug it just once a week to refill the battery, I don't use it too much. The only bad part is that it comes from somewhere in Asia, so the only language i'm able to understand is english. I'm french, so sometimes I need to text in french, and that's really boring.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "exelente", "Author": "franklin", "ReviewID": "RRZX4M7PRKXT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "soy de venezuela exelente compra muy buen producto y atiempo no tube ningun percanse me llego en buen estado y es nuevo", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cellphone Nokia X2", "Author": "Renuka Sathyamurthy \"ST\"", "ReviewID": "R3C9WRSC08W6J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice Slick and small with most options.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they unknowingly were selling fake Nokia X2's. I bought a real one from another website. In the meantime, the seller was very courteous and ensured I got a full refund on the shipping AND the return shipping!The speaker was damaged (creating a crackling), one speaker didn't work at all (stereo speakers were advertised), the package included a tacky shiny \"original\" sticker, the OVI cd was missing, the packaging box looked like it was printed on an inkjet printer with ink smears, the booklet was made of low quality paper and missing the sleek acrylic paper used for the cover page, the package had been opened, the phone's outer body has a cheap feel to it, and I could separate the screen from the phone's housing with my fingernail.Don't get me wrong, the electronics and software inside the phone seemed to be authentic. The operation of the phone was speedy. Everything else seemed fake. If you like a well-constructed phone with good speakers, then look elsewhere.I compared it to an authentic Nokia X2 and the difference was night and day. The real one I found to be only $91 USD elsewhere (2013, May), it took 1 month to arrive in Canada, but it was worth it, and I got it shipped free. I got a true comparison of what a real genuine Nokia X2 is supposed to feel and sound like. This phone is loud and the quality of the music is great after you set the equalizer to tone down on the treble. The construction of the genuine phone is solid and I cannot separate the LCD screen from the phone's housing.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Pedro Celis", "ReviewID": "R1ICE5COMDSR7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good phone, excellent camera takes very good pictures, is compact, was sent on time, I recommend it 100%. 5 of 5", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE", "Author": "Giovanny Rincon F \"Giovanny Rincon F\"", "ReviewID": "R1EBLF2MXYN4OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TODO MUY BIEN 100% RECOMENDADO PUEDEN COMPRAR CON TODA CONFIANZA TODO A LLEGADO DE LA MANERA CORRECTA LO MEJOR, LO MEJOR", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "genial!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "jean", "ReviewID": "R1C6WIYBVGCXUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "llego como lo anuncia el vendedor!! nuevo de paquete a un precio justo! funciona en 3G en mi pais!! lo recomiendo 100%", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Polish menu", "Author": "Curly", "ReviewID": "R1XRYR3H4UJTIG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Menu was set up on Polish, there are icons witch stay with Polish words even if you change the language to English.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did not receive the item as shown", "Author": "Psycheplay", "ReviewID": "R1IZBE4Y86G4RA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't really have a problem with the product, yet, as I was sent the nokia x2-01 which looks like a blackberry and nothing like the sleek simple phone I thought I had ordered.  5 stars for the shipment delivery, very quick!", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good choice", "Author": "Yonathan Mendez \"YonathaN95\"", "ReviewID": "R18Q62TMF9KXIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone.
