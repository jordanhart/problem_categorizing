The uber sexy AMOLED screen is awesome to say the least. I love the quality photos, the macro on the camera is awesome! The video quality is really impressive! Sound quality excellent! Signal reception WOW! Out at our lake property, where most phones struggle for a signal if they even get one... the signal reception was outstanding! I loved everything about this phone!  The phone is really easy for a newbie to the world of smart phones to learn. I would give the phone 5+ stars for the AMOLED screen!Also, the phone is wifi capable, meaning when we traveled to Aruba, I could sit in cafe that offered free internet and sign on to send emails, Facebook or use Skype etc.  Loved having the phone!  It also took excellent pics even in low light... as well as wonderful hd video!Here's the rest of the story....I received this phone for Mothers Day 2011. I named her \"Ame\" after her AMOLED screen.  Unfortunately by June 3G quit working. First, I called Verizon who walked me through a reset, explained about removing the battery blah blah blah.  The reset didn't last... so the next day, I called Samsung directly because they are the manufacturer.  The Samsung Tech walked me through a different reset than than Verizon had prior and subsequently walked me through .... but still sporadic 3G at best! I then started the Verizon tango... after the reset, I would have to wait for 24 hours or so to make sure that it was no longer working, call them back dance one more time and finally after a couple of tries with Verizon in June, Verizon finally sent a new-to-me phone (factory refurb... which btw irritates me to no end). :-/After receiving the first replacement phone (my 2nd Fascinate) all was good; for about 3-4 or so months... just long enough to momentarily forget why my phone was replaced to begin with. I cannot remember exactly when I started noticing that my cloud service was sketchy/intermittent and that I was missing texts (using Google Voice)as well (I rarely text so it took a while to realize I wasn't getting any). Sometimes I would find my stuff uploaded just fine.. then not so much. I had even emailed the cloud service and Google to complain about their service... boy was that embarrassing on my part. Sigh... Anyway, life was very hectic in November but finally the light-bulb went on in my brain, I connected the dots and called Verizon to complain about my phone in December (busy busy holidays) Come January, they finally replaced my phone (my third Samsung Fascinate) due to poor functioning 3G issues.This third phone arrived around the 15th of January and only lasted about two weeks... texts from Google voice were sporadic, and my Navigation crashed every time I tried to use it... regardless of whether I was using Verizon or Google Maps.  I again had to start the Verizon Tango, the reset etc didn't work... the minute I fired up GPS or tried to go on-line... crash!Now, I really had a hard time deciding to give up on the Samsung Fascinate, I still say Samsung has the sexiest most vibrant WOW factor screen out there!  Uber easy to use even for a newbie!  But when the Verizon tech gave me the out... Finally after an extra 12 hours to decide... dumped the most beautiful phone I have ever owned!  Feb 1st marked the beginning of a different brand android phone relationship.Note:If Samsung gifted me one of their newer ones with AMOLED, just to give them a second chance... I would love to accept, just to see if they've worked out the problems.  But I won't shell out any hard ca$h for another Samsung after three strikes!", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "R3ST29WFWSM0NU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about 7 months ago and I absolutely love it.Before I had a Blackberry Storm, and this is a MILLION times better, and I chose this phone instead of the iPhone because I prefer Android.

The software left much to be desired, but this new thing, AMOLED screen, was amazing!  Battery life just sucked.I had a couple problems with it, but Verizon always sucked it up and just sent me a new one.  I'm not sure if I caused the issue or not, all glitches and no physical damage.  Its been thrown out my car window 3 times with no damage!  That's the magnesium frame for you, very lightwieght and inertia free, but strong.  Very flammable though.So the secret to this phone if you buy one, is GeeWiz.  Its the software for the phone the way Samsung intended it.  Look it up and don't look back!  I can now go most of a weekend on light use, not a sip of charging.Why there is nothing like it: no other phone is as compact and light, while being a full smartphone.  iPhone feels huge and cludgy next to it.

Let's just say, if you are looking for a phone that is never reliable, look no further!!Since I purchased it, the indicator light has never worked. On more than one occasion, when an incoming call was coming in, the phone continued to ring with one long ring, but you can't answer it. Good thing it was a family member calling regarding an emergency! The good news is that it only took about 5 minutes to remove the battery,restart the phone and wait for it to load before making the return call.Another great feature is when you are on a call and your call waiting beeps in, you look at the screen on your phone to \"swap\" or \"answer\" the call but the screen goes black after one second. While you are frantically trying to find a way to answer the important call, it takes so long to figure out how to get any screen back that the person calling has already hung up.Probably the most exciting feature is the random resending of the same text message. My tupperware lady was really excited to receive 103 (this is not an exxageration) messages from me that all read the same thing. She has a limited text plan, which is a fact most of us don't know about our tupperware ladies unless you are the lucky owner of this phone.The most reliable feature of this phone is the number of times it freezes. Whether it be on a call, trying to send a text or while using an app, you will never be disappointed. I almost forgot about the super convenient feature for those of us on the go!! While typing a text message, suddenly you will be backed out of that message and returned to your home screen. Never worry, your \"message saved as draft\". It only takes one hour to type a quick \"hello\"!My friends particularly enjoy my struggle with the small space bar located conveniently next to the period button. I never believed that my fingers were abnormally large for a 5'4 woman, but.this.is.what.all.of.my.texts.look.like.as.a.result. Maybe it's my apparently gigantic fingers' fault, but I have gotten used to every message appearing as a hyperlink.Finally, neither BestBuy Mobile nor Verizon Wireless will offer an exchange of the phone despite it's really reliable qualities as described above. I wouldn't expect anything less from my trusty Verizon who've I paid half my salary to on a monthly basis for as long as they have been \"Verizon Wireless\". Oh, and thanks for the new limited data plan which is super helpful when my phone refuses to 'log me out' of apps.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1XS9UIX0E597S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife had an HTC Rhyme and has not has near the problems I have had with this phone.1) GPS function is very poor.  I cannot use the navigator function on Google maps because it cannot find a GPS signal 75% of the time.2) When I receive a text message (at least 4-5 times/wk) it does not show up in the icon window or indicate I have a message.  I have to go into my text message screen then it shows up there.3) I have missed calls because the phone did not indicate that I missed a call or indicate that I had a message or in some cases even ring.  (My wife called my phone while standing next to me and left a message-to test the system, and my phone did not ring and there was no message waiting until an hour later).4)  3-4 time per week the screen will lock and I cannot shut phone off by depressing the off button, I have to take the battery out.  I have plenty of RAM on the phone.5) Response time is lagging to perform functions.6) In my house using wi fi, 50-75% of the time it cannot find an internet connection, my wife never has this problem with her smart phone with same OS as mine.I write this review so other people do not have the same problems or frustrations I have had.

Phone comes with a few useless aps but once you download the ones you want, you forget about those. If you're using too many aps, it can freeze but i'm a patient person.

I take much of the blame for purchasing a phone after having done zero research, but we were upgrading my husband to the Droid X and if we upgraded me the same day this phone was free (after mail-in rebate Visa gift cards yada yada yada)...I had to wait about 7 moths for the Android 2.2 update.  Then all updates after that I can download about 3-4 months after they go live for all other droid phones.  That is due to poor support on the Samsung side of things, so I don't blame Verizon, just the manufacturer.  I will never purchase another Samsung phone.For the last year I have had to pop of the back and battery to reboot about 3-4 times per week.  This phone just doesn't handle updates well, and since the most recent Android system update, I can no longer use Google Maps Navigation.  I can view maps and see my progress on the map with GPS on, but I cannot use turn-by-turn directions as this phone freezes as soon as it loads the route.  It has done this about every other update, so maybe after the next one I'll be back to having Nav...Of course I had no issues until I was past the 30-day No Questions Asked return period, then I hopped onto some forums and found tons of people unhappy with the Samsung/Verizon pairing.  I understand that it's mostly functional with other carriers, so just do your research first.I'm going with a true Droid next time, maybe the Bionic.  Husband loves his Droid X, and close friend loves his Droid Bionic.UPDATE: 2+ years in...I am still using this phone because as soon as I upgrade, I'll be roped into one of the tiered plans instead of my old unlimited data plan when I first bought this phone.  Granted it IS STILL FUNCTIONAL, but I am still popping out the battery 8-10 times a week.  Some days I don't have to at all, some days it freezes 3 times.  I haven't noticed a link between any particular app and the freezing.  Sometimes I hit the on button just to check the time or if I have any texts, and THAT causes it to freeze up.  OR I try to do that and find that it is already frozen with the time stuck at 2 hours ago!The battery lasts about 7-8 hours so long as I don't use wifi/3g/nav or text too much... or talk on the phone more than 5 minutes.I still don't have the newest release of operating system either.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone screen kept freezing.
