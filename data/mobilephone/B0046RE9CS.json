Perrone \"AnHonestCustomer\"", "ReviewID": "R10I98VBZZXYMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Surely you have read all reviews about this phone (GsmArena, PhoneArena, etc).I want to emphatize just a few aspects that could help you decide:1- I was looking for a state-of-the-art cell (touch), but size is very important to me: I don't like iPhone or Galaxy-S size. I need to put my cell in my pocket, and operate it with just one hand;  that's the first reason to buy Nokia C6-01;2- Quality: there is no people that could give you an opinion against the very good quality of this phone;3- Symbian is TOTALLY customizable: I understand Android could give you a very \"update able\" impression, but Symbian is too.4- I am a middle-age professional (44). Big hands, lot of work, very internet-dependent (for work), and travelling a lot by airplane. I need a cell phone to get email mainly through wifi networks, but I really do not have too much social-related activity (Tweeter, Facebook, and so), so I doubted when reading a lot of reviews referring to this aspects. I can tell you that customization is total: you can decide to put every icon related to screens as you want. I've cleaned my screens and setup the icons I needed.5- Connectivity in this cell is absolutly easy and user-controlable.6- Installing Ovi Apps is an easy and error-free process. I've installed Opera Mobile (it works like a rock!), Skype, a better calculator, QR barcode reader, etc.7- I've setting up my Hotmail account and a Gmail-corporate account without any problem: they are living in my cell exactly in the way they should be: each inbox separated from the other, and syncronizing just when I want (over wify or data operator link).8- Camera is VERY good. Of course it is not a full Nikon with a telex, but the photos are great for such a device;9-Windows application to manage the phone is great. It works like a charm, easy installation, and very high quality presentation. I can control every aspect of the cellphone (You can even type and read sms in real-time using this app, provided your C6-01 is connected through usb cable !), do backups of your data, contacts, messages, and so.10- It is beautiful and very stylish. I've bought the silver one (it's very metallic: not \"plastic-metallic\"). Screen is REAL black, and touch operation is perfect.So, I'm very happy with this purchase.I hope this help you.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "A phone that actually fits in your pocket", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1AV1BZ0IFJ6AI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In today's smartphone market, it is hard to find a phone that is actually a decent \"phone\" size. That is, one that does not feel like a brick when you hold it to your ear. When I saw the Nokia C6-01, I knew I found my next phone. The phone fits perfectly in my hand and is a pleasure to use as a phone. It is heavy for its size, but somehow, that just makes me feel more confident in its build. Since this replaced a Nokia E72, the screen size was not a problem for me. It is big enough for me to see everything I want, and I rarely even need to zoom when reading web pages. Lastly, the AMOLED is super bright, and easy to read in sunlight. It will not disappoint. Even the standby screen (that shows the time when the phone is not in use) is relatively bright. I especially like this feature which really adds to the sophisticated look of the phone.Hardware: Everybody knows Nokia builds quality hardware, so I will not spend too much time on this. Call quality is good so far and the speakerphone is clear. The button placements are well thought out, especially the unlock slider. Slide to lock, slide to unlock. I use it a lot. And if you hold the slider for a few seconds, the camera flash LED turns on as a flashlight. Very useful. One complaint is there is a little slop in the slider. (Not what I expected from a Nokia phone.) The 8MP camera is good in bright environments, although for indoor shots, there is some noise. I am still not sure how I feel about fixed focus cameras, but I guess most of my shots are decent so far for a camera phone.Software: Symbian ^3 is a huge improvement from S60 in terms of \"prettying up\" the UI. The usability itself is still close to the pre-touch era. (E.g. why can I not swipe between call logs for missed calls, received, and dialed? Instead I have to press the tiny tab buttons on the top of the screen...) I have to admit, the 3 home screens are useful, especially with widgets that automatically update weather, sports scores, tweets, RSS feeds, etc. One thing I like about Symbian it is very customizable and I have access to all the settings. It may take a few button presses to get there, but I am OK with that. Also, nothing can beat the free Ovi maps. It has turn-by-turn navigation and traffic updates. It is fast, accurate, and FREE. The search feature also works quite well, which saves time when you only need to type in the name of the place instead of the full address. Lastly, Nokia is coming out with awesome apps from their Beta Labs. I use Situations to put my phone in silent mode during work hours, and Normal mode when I am at home (using my GPS position). And I am trying out Nokia Drop to push files to my phone.Cons/Quirks:1. The proximity sensor does not work dependably when I hold the phone over my hair. That caused a lot of disconnections in the first few days. I was about the send it back when I realized that the problem is gone if I place the phone directly on my ear (that is underneath my hair). This is a strange problem that I do not see in other phones (tested on an iPhone 4). I will live with it for now though, since it is not much of a bother for me.2. The phone can be a little sluggish at times. For example, when I turn the phone to type a message, it takes a few seconds for the screen to actually switch orientation. Or sometimes I have to turn the phone a couple times.3. Battery life can last 1 day with mid-to-heavy usage. I would like that to last a little longer.Closing thoughts:I know this review sounds like there is a lot wrong with the phone, but I am actually really happy with it. This phone is fun to use and a lot of the features are well though out. It has everything that I require from a smartphone. And I cannot stress how important the size is to me. The Symbian OS may be coming to an end, but I am OK riding it out with the C6-01 and waiting for what Nokia comes out with next.  Last thing: people with big hands might want to try the phone out before purchasing.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "The BEST PHONE EVER... Forget the Iphone!...", "Author": "Gustavo H. Echeverry \"Gustavo Echeverry\"", "ReviewID": "R39MT9B6ZR0VLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, after years looking for the real iPhone killer i think i found it!. This Nokia has EVERYTHING that an iPhone can offer you and a lot more!. I had all type of phones before, HTC's, Palm Treo's, Palm Pixi... and more. Let's start for the physical characteristics... is a heavy phone, a thing that i like, since the case is made of really nice Metal hard to scratch (not like other cheap plastic phones). Is smaller that the iPhone but the screen size is perfect. It comes with a GPS that works like a charm, even in other countries (like Colombia) without a data plan since you can download the OVI maps for free via Wi-Fi or on your PC and transfer them via USB or Bluetooth. The app store is GREAT a lot of useful free stuff, apps, games and videos. I got a mosquito repellent app, a 360 degrees panoramic photo app, Compass, Fingerprint security, a lot of Internet Radio stations just one click away from your home screen, Pop-mail and Facebook notification on your homescreen and the best protection against thieves!: An app that you can send a msg from another phone to your C6 and sends back another MSM with the exact location of the phone! and if somebody change your SIM card the phone is locked, your personal info is send via email and deleted, and besides that send you an MSM with the notification of the change and a photo taken with the front camera.  The 8MP back camera is really good and the HD video @ 720dpi looks really smooth. The front camera is really useful for the Skype app or Video calls. The camera flash works also as a REALLY! bright flashlight...  Comes with FM Radio but i never use it since you need the hands-free as the antenna, i usually use with the internet radio. Other apps that come with the phone are Quickoffice, Zip and Adobe PDF Reader. I'm more than happy with this cellphone and i highly recommend it even if you don't live in the US.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Inexpensive Phone", "Author": "George E. Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "R25ELOEZX4DGCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to add my two-cents worth to the other glowing reviews for this phone.  I just received it yesterday and I am very happy with it.  Very solid and expensive looking with a great (AMOLED I think) display.  I am particularly impressed that the steel back cover is so rigid - yet the phone isn't too heavy.  Call quality is good and it was a cinch to import the contacts from my Nokia E71.  The screen is (finally!) glass - I had an N97-Mini for a couple of months and I did not care for the resistive-touch and plastic screen.  To me, it is a little small for comfortable e-mail reading - and I would say that it is too small for surfing the internet.  I have to say, though, that it's Symbian OS is a little bit of a pain to navigate - perfect example is checking remaining space on your micro-SD card - who would think that you would find that under Applications / Office / File Manager?  But I can live with Symbian's annoyances to in order to get a great little phone with a beautiful display - for half the price of a plastic device from one of the other makers.*********************** Added on June 21, 2011 **************************I've had this phone for another week+ and I just want to reiterate what a great little device it is!!  Battery life is great and it recharges quickly.  I've carried it on many evening walks and it shows zero wear and tear - thanks to it's metal construction and glass display.  It's my primary phone for calls between Germany and the US and I've had zero dropped calls or other call-related problems.  And, much to my surpise, once I downloaded the new Ovi Store - I found there are quite a few good free games on Ovi - Angry Birds Seasons, Rio, Monopoly, car racing, you name it - I was really pleasantly surprised!!  This continues to be a compact and very well-built smartphone - I highly recommend it.*********************** Added on November 6, 2011 ************************The Nokia C6-01 continues to be a superb phone.  Still runs like a top and looks like new - despite another four+ months of carrying around and using. Another advantage I really like is it supports both AT&T; and T-Mobile 3G bands in the States - and works here in Germany with Telekom.  Last but not least - I like it so much that I've ordered a second one for my wife to use. Keep in mind though - this phone isn't for you if you want a large screen to surf the internet or check FB.  It's a great phone with super battery life and a very clear screen.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Diamond in the rough", "Author": "V.

Also the new browser does not have an option to remove the status bar at the bottom thateats into already small page space.Recently was running car navigation and listening to the Internet radio streaming at the same time - all on 340MB of RAM - impressive!Also I can view 720P movies shut on my GoPro camera via OTG cable with USB flash reader. Pretty cool!Will take a look at Lumia 620 next. It also has worldwide navigation with free map upgrades.End of Updated on 05/28/2013.First, the negatives.1) Reboots a lot. While searching for the GPS location, playing MP3s, running the custom application I wrote for the Symbian OS - NOT ANYMORE - see below2) Limited applications availability. Only one music player that came with the phone, no player that plays by folder so the music has to be tagged/organized3) Browser experience is sub-par4) Cumbersome navigation. Read the manual!4) Nokia OVI store on the phone stopped working after I swapped the supplied 4GB micro-SD card for a 16GB one - NEWEST UPDATE FIXED THE ISSUE - see below5) Nokia app for the computer is not very intuitiveNow the positives that BY FAR outweigh the negatives, mostly what was not mentioned by the others1) High quality body/screen2) Excellent voice quality3) Sensitive wi-fi radio4) Works perfectly as a standalone GPS with the maps of the whole world available for download. Maps of Europe are superior to Google's. last year in Croatia Google was forcing me to take the ferry since supposedly it was no road available. Nokia maps got it right.5) Availability of cheap GENUINE Nokia accessories on the famous auction site and various Chinese outfits on the WEB. You can get an outstanding car holder for peanuts as well as some basic covers and extra battery with charger that works with the supplied with the phone proprietary power cable.6) With a dirt-cheap (see above) OTG cable you can connect a USB flash drive as an external memory to the phone and it will be treated like an internal memory or an inserted micro-SD card7) Skype works perfectly over wi-fi and 3G8) GSM coverage EVERYWHERE in the world9) Good still/video camera10) Small. No damage to vital organs when kept in the pocket.Suggestion: make sure that USB cables you buy are for Nokia, generic ones might not work. OTG cable model number:  CA-157, GPS holder: CR-114 or CR-115.Also do not buy into Symbian 'obsolescence' myth. NOTHING in Android realm can touch this phone for the price. Android has more apps and seamless download but this phone will do everything you need in a small form factor. Highly recommended.Update on 09/28/2011.Go to [...] and download Store QML client. It updates Ovi store functionality on your phone. Works perfectly!Update on 10/29/2011.Installed a new version of software (prompted by Nokia itself on the phone). Rebooting seems to be fixed, at least partially.Update 0n  11/26/2011New OS update solved the rebooting issue - have not had it once! Also GPS fix now is very fast.

I remember having read N number of reviews and articles on the latest and the greatest technology for a smart phone. But somehow I didn't want to invest big. I didn't want to cry if I managed to lose it. The Nokia C6-01 was a smart decision that I made. I was convinced with the reviews and feedbacks on this little genius and I went ahead and hit \"Checkout\" on Amazon. And it arrived in a neat box within 3 days. I was all set to experiment on this device and Nokia had always been my favorite. I knew it wouldn't fail. I don't mean to say that companies like Samsung and Apple don't make the user's proud. I also don't mean to compare the Symbian^3 (C6-01's OS) with Android or so.What I humbly mean to say is, I got everything I expected in a dream phone. I hate to admit that I am not worthy of an iPhone or a Galaxy. Simple reason being I wouldn't be able to utilize it better (What's the use of owning a supersonic when you just want to buy milk?).Here are some really good things that I found with the Nokia C6-01* Sweet and Small - You can take this beauty out of your denims without having to acrobat. The 3.2 inch screen is perfect for a mobile phone. Anything more would make it less portable. The curved edges are just as pleasing.* Robust - The device build is definitely strong and metallic and not like some clumsy ones that remove their clothes (parts) when you accidently (or deliberately) throw it down.* Amazing display and color - AMOLED display with TrueBlack (all Jargon that means -crystal crisp display with vivid and life-like colors.* Wonderful Point and Shoot Camera - The 8 MP camera is really cool. I was able to click some really good pics. Don't be misled by the fixed-focus definition. It makes life a lot easier* Wifi B-G-N compatible - Means I am able to download a lot of data pretty quickly. Using my home Wifi I could download over 300 MB (Maps) within 3 mins. (which is pretty fast for me)* Offline Navigation and GPS - You can download the maps and routes offline and use it as a normal GPS without having to rely on any network provider / WIFI for data connectivity. And Ovi-Maps are free for life time.* Easy setup with external emails, IMs, social networking - Inbuilt applications allow quick configuration and you are connected in a breeze.Some less good things* It is considerably heavy and I like it that ways. I can \"safely\" throw it at a mad stray dog if it comes to attack me.* Battery power - It doesn't have a very powerful battery, so if you are exploiting the device, you need a USB cable or a power charger on the go. With normal usage, I am able to get a charge for around 2 or 3 days.* Fixed Focus camera doesn't allow good quality macro photography. So I use my dedicated digital camera for that.* Using the GPS for a long duration warms the device. I wouldn't be doing that every day, so I won't worry much.So, that is pretty much it. I have got what I needed. (There is a huge difference between what you want and what you need, and this device has made me realize that you would most often never 'need' everything that you 'want')I am happy with this little genius. This is a rather short review for respect of space on Amazon's review page.

Though there is a delay in getting the Satellite connection, the map works very well once the connection is established (though there are some errors like in some places it asks you stay on the left and take exit from the freeway, while you have to stay on the right actually).  The other features like synch, backup are good and even the APPs are ok ( I am not a gamer). The camera is reasonably good. Even the upgrade to Belle was smooth and Belle looks better. All these positives are neutralized by the single problem of the phone hanging often (Freezes and no keys work) and I have to remove the battery to reset / restart to get the phone working. This happened with all three operating system (This came with Symbian 3 and i updated to Anna and latter to Belle). The battery life too short.I wouldn't recommend this phone to anybody though the price is little less compared to other smart phones.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only for Symbian Die Hards", "Author": "Solom01 \"software user\"", "ReviewID": "R2EZP5N0GF5NRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a soft spot for Nokia phones - they have beautiful hardware and work wonderfully as phones (great call quality and reception) but unless you are used to Symbian and Nokia's lack of support run - don't walk - away from Nokia.  I also own a Nexus One and iPad, so I am familiar with the other systms out there.  Even with the Anna update, Symbian is a mess.  After setting this phone up, I wanted to update the version of QuickOffice that comes with it (the included version is read only - it can not edit). Even though the upgrade was purchased through the Ovi Store, it would not install.  I finally got it to install by a time consuming restoring of the phone to it's original state after backing it up, restoring the changes I had made, and updating it again.  This took over two hours to simply install one of the most popular programs for Symbian!  Anna has been available outside the US for months, but between the ineptitude of Nokia and Quickoffice what is a simple task in any modern operating system is a nightmare - and this is the norm in the world of Nokia which explains why they are quickly becoming a relic.  Forget about getting support from Nokia if you have a question - it's not going to happen. Maybe things will be better with their Windows phones, but it's hard to teach an old Finnish Dog new tricks.So why did I give the phone a four star rating?  Well, the build quality is great, the screen is fantastic and once you get to understand it Symbian is a very flexible operating system that lets you do things that you can't do with Android or iOS. It is the complete opposite of modern phones with tons of apps (forget getting even popular ones like Netflix or Pandora on this guy) - it is a small high quality phones that has a few good apps and can be easily carried in your pockets. If I wanted to use a tablet I would. It is also inexpensive, and if you are a TMobile user who has tzones this will work with it in both edge and 3g unlike most newer phones that will require you to get an expensive data plan.In summary, if you want a relatively inexpensive phone with good call quality and the ability to use it world wide on any GSM system this is the way to go. Just understand that dealing with Symbian and the truely wretched support and software that is Nokia and Symbian has been known to drive people insane!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent little phone!", "Author": "Steve D.", "ReviewID": "R1G7SDVZDYAYKE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If I could rate this phone based on performance compared to my expectations, I'd give it five and a half stars.  Let's get the \"needs improvement\" out of the way:* CPU is a little slow.  In power-saving mode, when multitasking, one application jitters for a fraction of a second while another application does its thing.  For example, when listening to streaming audio while surfing the Web, page loads cause the music player to cut out briefly.* There are some user interface quirks:** The display stays on during a call if you lay the phone face-up on a surface.** When using the on-screen keypad while in a call (for example, when going through automated phone menus), there's a \"call\" button but no \"hangup\" button.  To hangup, you have to select \"Back\" to get to the main call screen first.** Some applications seem to prefer the last network I used them on even if it's no longer available.  It would be nice if the phone just selected Wifi first, carrier next, and then other.** Using the GPS while downloading satellite maps over AT&T; drains the battery quickly.** The phone is definitely on the small side.  Good for slipping into pockets, not so good for watching videos, reading lots of text in web pages or trying to tap on tiny links with my fingertips.** It would be nice if the shell supported more gestures than simply swipe-left and swipe-right.  For example, on Nokias with D-pads, pressing Down brings up the address book.  On this phone, doing a swipe-down would be easier for me than trying to tap on the small address book icon.There are some other minor little usability issues but nothing I didn't get used to in short order.Now for the good: this is an amazing little phone, and more amazing when you consider how inexpensive it is.  First, the build quality is just terrific---it looks and feels solid.  It has a nice, cold, metallic, satisfying heft to it.  The battery cover slides off in a no-nonsense way, and there's nothing flimsy or plastic to worry about flexing to the point of breaking.In addition to feeling solid in the hand, the phone is actually quite sleek and elegant in appearance.  I find the pictures online to not do it justice.The display is GORGEOUS.  Colors are rich and super-bright, and it's easy to see even in bright light (though I wouldn't want to try to read lots of small text in bright sunlight).The battery charges quickly.  I can charge from 20% to 70% in the car during my 45-minute commute, and to 100% in about an hour if plugged into an AC outlet.  I keep the phone in power-save mode and don't use the GPS much, so I only have to recharge it every 2-3 days.The flash camera is good and Nokia has included some fancy image-processing tools like sepia, B&W;, enhancement, color editing, etc.  However, I don't know how it compares to other phones' 8MP cameras, so I don't know if it's anything special.Getting to the SIM and Micro SD cards is easy: pop off the battery cover and you have access to the SD card.  Remove the battery and there's the SIM card.  Done.  You can replace all three in 30 seconds.Call quality is excellent, 10 out of 10.  Speakerphone is excellent, 10 out of 10.  Sound quality on the cheapo earbuds (included) is excellent.  The speakerphone is remarkably good.  On other handsets I've used, the speakerphone might have a hollow, buzzing sound.  This phone sounds solid.  My only quibble is that the sound gets a little muffled when I lay it down face-up (the speaker is on the back).  Also, and maybe it's that AT&T; has upped their game, but lately I have been getting terrific call quality and coverage everywhere I go (Boston, DC, suburban Maryland).Apps: there is a wide variety of Symbian apps out there but still can't compare to the iPhone ecosystem.  On the other hand, this phone comes with almost everything I wanted out of the box.  I downloaded only a couple of games, Opera, YouTube downloader, a new UI shell, RPN calculator and Kayak.  Even without downloading anything, the phone is an instant on-the-go survival kit, with GPS, turn-by-turn SPOKEN navigation, maps, traffic, browser, email, weather, streaming audio player, video player, calendar, clock with multiple alarms, QuickOffice, FM radio, music player, 720p HDTV output, and, of course, it's a pentaband world phone.Maps: Ovi Maps is excellent and, like Google maps, offers map view, satellite view and \"terrain view\" (essentially map view at an angle, as if you're floating hundreds of feet above the map).  Also comes with GPS and turn-by-turn spoken navigation, as I said above.  Better than the \"navigation\" you get with Bing maps on other devices like the Pre, which basically map out your route and tell you how to get there up front.  That's great until you go astray.  This phone gives you turn-by-turn directions and live route recalculation like a real GPS navigation unit.One other thing, and I don't know if this is limited to Nokia or Symbian, but you can set an alarm and then turn the phone off.  Why not save juice at night, right?  At the selected time the phone turns on enough to play the alarm tune.  My Nokias have done this going back to 2002.  Apparently this is something my Android-toting colleagues can't do with their whiz-bang Droids and Galaxies.  Go figure.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPhone alternative seekers... THIS IS FOR YOU!", "Author": "amazoncustomer", "ReviewID": "R1J7HJIYY7U3BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not buy this phone on Amazon, but I pre-ordered it on nokia.com a month before it was officially released in USA (March '11). I am a fan of iPhones, but the fact that I am not with AT&T; or Verizon cost me a fortune to own an unlocked iPhone 4. So I spent weeks searching for the best iPhone alternative out there...Pros:1) This phone is rated #1 in eco-friendliness. Made with 100% recycled materials. This means it has a worthy value when you decide to sell it to a recycle website such as Gazelle.com ($113) as of Oct. 2011.2) REAL metal casing. Not \"plastic-metal\" like Samsung or HTC phones. Very STURDY and compact engineering design. Screen is made with strong glass material called Gorilla Glass Display and is VERY strong and scratch-resistant --> Hence no need to buy any extra bulky protective cases or any screen protection films. (An iPhone would need to wear a big armor casing + front and back protective films.) This makes me LOVE holding my phone in my hand even when not using it!3) Small and compact. Smaller than iPhone and almost all HTC devcices. This is very important to me because I don't want anything bulking up on my left thigh when it's inside my pocket.3) Excellent loud speaker. Clear and crisp high profile ringing. (Nokia is famous in this area)4) 8MP full-focus camera + dual LED flash light! *Full focus means EVERYTHING from 20cm away from the lens to INFINITY will be sharply focused when taken. --- Video record in Hi-Def at 720p resolution with 25 fps (frame-per-second). BEAUTIFUL!5) 3.5mm aux jack. Very handy to connect with headphones, speakers, and for me... my car speakers.6) Facebook + Twitter integrated. The Facebook widget on homescreen is very neat. It cycles through the top 20 most-recent posts on Facebook right on the homescreen!7) Adobe Flash supported. Download supported. Yes you heard it right, you can download MP3 or AVI movies directly to your phone!8) Battery life is excellent. Can last up to 2 days with normal usage. Charge quickly in about ~40 minutes.9) OVI Maps GPS. Pre-loaded and FREE to use LIFETIME. Works in offline mode even when you don't have any data plan with your cellular provider company. Much better than Google map version on iPhone. This GPS software is so intuitive and accurate. Even more beautiful when it works cooperatively with the Music Player. When driving, I listen to my music on the phone (AUX input) and runs GPS at the same time. The music automatically fades out as the turn-by-turn voice guidance speaks and then fades back in when the voice stops. Same thing happens when you receive a call while listening to music. Everything works like a team seamlessly.Cons:Symbian^3 operating system is the main thing to complain about here. NOT very user-friendly.1) Web browser is ridiculous. No back button, no refresh button. Very cumbersome. (I download a 3rd party free browser app to compensate this)2) No push notifications. Have to manually access and update everything.3) Lack of apps. BIG TIME! NO BankofAmerica app, NO Amazon app, NO worthy weather app.4) Nokia OVI suite (Music sync. in particular) is hard to use. Very frustrated to add new music. I like to edit the song infos such as Artist/Album/ArtWork etc. but good luck with doing that using OVI Suite. Fortunately, I use Windows Media Player to compensate this issue and it turns out great!***UPDATE (Oct.21,2011): Just received the latest major update for Symbian^3 OS called Symbian Anna. Here are some major upgrades that I like:1) Home screen is now real-time swipe-able.2) New full QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode. Good for one-hand typing.3) New web browser. A lot faster and simpler user interface.4) New NOKIA Store (formerly called OVI Store). The new store is redesigned with new looks and a lot more responsive to clicking and swiping.Very proud of my phone after the update. After Symbian Anna, Symbian Belle is up next for the new major update.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another Excellent Unlocked Nokia Phone", "Author": "SFL \"SL\"", "ReviewID": "R2EEE47APXS07G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this phone. First a little background on the phones I have owned in the last 5 or 6 years. I had an N95 8G, an E71, a 5800 and was currently using an N85. All were unlocked phones used on AT&T.; I replaced my n85 with this C6-01.For some of you Nokia junkies I will make comparisons to other phones so that you may get an idea if you own those particular phones.Some very positive things I must get out of the way:The screen is awsome. It is the AMOLED like my N85. It is so much better than the washed out screen on the 5800 I was using. Also glass here instead of plastic. The screen is excellent out in the bright sun as well where as the 5800 screen was unusable.This capacitive touch screen is so much better than the resistive that I had on the 5800. Immediate response to your touch. It is wonderful. No repeated poking to try to get a response. I much prefer my fingertips to the stylus.The camera is wonderful. It is right on par with the excellent camera on my N85. Nothing like the horrible cameras on the E71 and 5800.Now I have no problem with battery life as some have had. I am getting 2 to 3 days of moderate use before having to charge. The first day I had it I had to charge after only  24 hours but I was using it constantly getting all of my settings right, downloading software updates, programs, taking pictures and videos.One more thing on battery life. After setting up my home WLAN and my 2 email accounts I quickly realized you should turn off scannning for WLANs and push mail. If you push your mail all day long and leave that WLAN scanner on all day long you will be charging the phone in less than 24 hours.Do yourself a favor and upgrade the phone to Nokia Belle OS. You will thank me. It doesn't take very long to do and the phone is a lot more user friendly. Just go to the SW update in settings and it will guide you thru the installation.About the only negative I can find about this phone is that when sending emails, texts, mms, etc., the on screen key board is a little small for big fingers. I have adjusted and gotten used to it so it is not a big problem for me.Now let me admit I have not had the phone long so I will come back and do an update in a month or so. So far so good. Excellent phone with an absolutely beautiful screen, an awsome camera and great call quality.UPDATE: 05 November 2012I have had the phone for around 2 months now. Still in love with it. It is one of the best Nokias I have ever owned and I have owned a lot of them.1 New Pro on this phone is the GPS. It seems like every time I get a new Nokia the GPS locks on faster than the last one. This one is no exception. This GPS is lightning fast even in my home but outside it is locked on in seconds.1 Con is the battery life. I found that when I went out of town without my PC and had to check email and use my phone to surf the internet and of course phone calls and text messages, I was having to charge the phone every 12 to 24 hours. I guess it is just the price to pay for that beautiful screen. Now that I am back and just talking and texting on it, I am back to charging about every 2 to 3 days. So I am still very happy with that.Still give this phone a 5 star rating. Great camera, great GPS, great call quality, great everything other than battery life. But I can live with that.UPDATE: 07 September 2013I have been using this phone for 1 year now. Still works perfect. Have no complaints at all other than as I mentioned before, battery life with heavy usage, which I have adapted to. Great phone. Will probably go another year with it.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia C6-01 with Belle and VOIP", "Author": "Carbon", "ReviewID": "R2BXV2FCSPS1QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't comment on the fine features of this phone given the other reviewers have already done such an excellent job, but I'd just like to say that the Belle update for this phone is just incredible. When I first bought the Nokia C6-01 it arrived with very \"clunky\" software and would restart itself at the drop of a hat. Boy am I glad I waited for the Belle update. Please do yourself a favour and get this done at a Nokia Care Centre or if you have to do it yourself use a reliable internet connection. Prior to applying the Belle update, it does what looks to be a thorough backup of contacts and messages etc. My personal experience was that after the update it failed to restore my SMS text messages as well as my \"favorite places locations\" that was kept with the MAPS application. The rule is to be sure you always backup your text messages etc using Nokia Suite as you might lose some of these after the upgrade.If you make use of VOIP you will need to re-install the SIP VoIP Settings application. The current version at the time of this review is referred to as \"Symbian^3 SIP VoIP 3.1\". The software will allow you to make VOIP calls over 3G as well as the ability to change the codecs e.g. G729 etc. If you are going to use VOIP over 3G make sure you turn on AWCDMA in the profile settings.As far as Skype is concerned, be sure to download the latest update. At the time of this review Skype has still not supplied a video call app for Belle which is most upsetting to all the Nokia fan boys out there.Also, the phone can function as a WiFi hotspot for all your favorite WiFi enabled devices such iPads, laptops etc. I use the paid version of JoikuSpot which provides WEP Open security.Last but not least, if you want to Voice Dial someone in your contact list, all you need to do is press the call button (The bottom left button that lights up green) till you hear two beeps \"beep beep\" and then just speak out the contact name into the phone. Now, you might have multiple numbers stored under one contact with various detail descriptors including an \"internet telephone\" descriptor or \"SIP\" descriptor etc. The trick is to press the call button to setup voice dialling and then to speak into the phone e.g. \"John Doe internet\" and it will then voice dial the \"SIP\" or \"internet number\" for John Doe. Don't forget to speak out the first name, surname and detail descriptor (cell, home, work, internet,... etc) otherwise you'll get the dreaded \"no match found\" message.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked for only 1 week!", "Author": "Tech Pal \"G\"", "ReviewID": "R2ERJJ1F2PNGNF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a die-hard Nokia fan!I have had this phone for 1 week now and it is already acting up.

The 650Mhz proccessor is fast enough to power all the funtions of the phone. I have dowloaded a 10MB file in 19 seconds via a Wi-fi connection and a 7MB file in 18 seconds.

But even this is being petty. The phone fits in my hands well and the onscreen keys are really easy to use and unlike the iphones, I rarely if never double hit a key unintentionally.

A. Torres", "ReviewID": "R3V1J3Y5CA9N5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone took a while to show up, I have noticed anything that ships via free shipping from an Amazon warehouse is always slow to ship and to arrive, versus other Amazon suppliers.  The phone is solid and decent.  It shipped with a 4Meg micro-sim (I expected a 2M) and some apps were alreadt added.  I have probably used most every feature on the phone.  I connect wirelessly to my router at home and it took a little bit to actually get that working.  For whatever reason I couldn't initially get it to work.  I went to McDonalds and it connected immediately to the wireless there.  I thought my router was broken, but after McDs I went home and it connected immediately.  Go figure.I installed the MySimple Mobile Sim and now for $40 I have unlimited talk text and 3G web.  After the Mysimple OTA programming via SMS the settings I had tried to install were fixed and my phone works very well.  Sometimes the phone takes a moment to respond, but usually a touch triggers a vibration so you know the phone received input.I gave the phone a 4 star because the display dims occasionally very quickly and is slow to recover.  When you hold it to your ear the display goes black from the sensor input, but the power saving display is different and I haven't yet figured out an adjustment for that.The phone is running Symbian3 so it is different than most US phones.  There is a store with some apps. Some apps work and some don't even if they are supposed to work on your phone it might be hit or miss.  I also note that when you remove an app all traces might not be removed, and I haven't figured this out either.The phone connects via USB (WinXP) with no issues and even recharges via the USB port.  The battery life may be limited if you use the GPS or play a display intensive game.It is doubtful that Symbian Anna will ever be put on any US phone although most non-US phones are being upgraded/ or have already been upgraded.I do like the OVI maps, but the GPS is very slow if you are not near a network.  Out in the wild, no network, it took 10 minutes to find the position and kept losing it, the internal accelerometers didn't seem to correct the position at all.  And because it is display intensive the battery dies quickly.  I estimate about 3 hours on GPS and you will need to recharge.I do like this little phone.  It has some minor quirks, but all phones do. It isn't an i-phone but it isn't huge, I can carry it in my shirt pocket, make phone calls, text and surf the web.  I put Opera on it but the default web browser is ok, but not very intuitive.I like the address book.  It can accept voice commands but I haven't tried doing this much.  You can set an SMS to erase the phone and info in case you lose it, send an SMS with your secret message and supposedly it locks your sim and phone.  Haven't tried but I did set a message.  The camera takes pictures.  I loaded a panorama app and shutter-pro.  The camera can be set for small pictures and sends MMS messages.  It has a front facing cam, but very low res I think.  I loaded an app called camera mirror, but haven't tried a video phone call to anyone.I have sent emails from the phone which also works for larger pictures, connected to my yahoo email account, and emails to flickr post as expected.The morning alarms are easy to set as well as world times.  I also have downloaded other country maps in ovi maps.  You can explore another country and even see what the weather is like there.

Yes its smaller which I liked, it has good sound quality, it works with Skype sometimes (but sucks battery power), I was able to get the email configured eventually, it does run Flash, the camera is great, The keyboard system is not unlike any cell phone so its a pain.

I am a long time computer user and international traveler and was hoping to use the phone as a portable all in one device. I have used cell phones of increasing intelligence for about 15 years, but this is my first \"smart\" phone.I read most of the other reviews before purchasing the phone, most of which seem accurate, both pro and con--although I had no mysterious reboots or failures.The phone is well built, sleek and slick, pretty easy to see even in bright light, battery use varies with applications, if wi-fi is used extensively, you'll need to recharge at the end of the day. If not, the phone--as telephone--works for many days without recharging. The sound from the phone is very clear, the clearest that I can remember among my 7 or 8 phones. Texting is also easy (in horizontal mode) although the small keys seem to register my touches a bit differently than I expect. (It helps to aim for the top of the keys instead of the middle.) The hard buttons for answering, hanging up, and canceling out of apps, are extremely helpful, and getting be rare. It allows you to answer or reject a phone call, with one hand, instantly--very useful.The music play back (through relatively expensive Sennheiser headphones) is also very clear and better than the very good Sony MP3 player that I have been using. The camera is easy to use and seems to take very good pictures, excellent in day light, although not quite as good as a very good camera.For many tasks, working with the phone attached to a computer is the best solution, as with entering phone numbers, downloading apps, music, and so forth. I often plug it into a laptop in the morning to charge, sync files, do a bit of texting (see below), and use it as my \"office\" phone.In the past year, I had the opportunity to use a mid-level Samsung smart phone for a month and played with several I-phones and talked with  experienced users. Neither had software equivalent to the Nokia Suite, which has turned out to be extremely useful. First, it syncs the phone calendar easily with MS outlook, which allows calendar entries to be entered on a pc, where I am a much faster typist and screen negotiator. Second, it allows text messages to be composed and sent on a pc or laptop. This may seem a bit silly, but text communications have largely become the norm among persons on the go, and unless one is a speed \"thumb typer\" one can do this a lot faster and more accurately from a laptop keyboard. Third, it provides very convenient notices of the availability of upgrades. Fourth, it allows photos to be previewed, before porting them over to what every system you use to keep track of and edit them. (I am old-fashioned here and do this on a laptop or two.)The sync feature, is to my surprise not included with most other smart phones, although apps of evidently lesser ability can be purchased. My previous dumber phones and the mid-level Samsung smart phone I used over the summer lacked this feature.) To get a very good sync package for free, makes the phone an even greater value than I had appreciated. It means that one can keep MS outlook consistent across several computers (I use three different computers routinely, and used to do this manually by carrying a flash memory with backups of my appointment schedule and contacts. The C6-01 does this automatically via the OVI/Nokia Suite software with a cable or via bluetooth.The phone, which I is typical for smart phone families, takes some learning and a lot of downloading, more or less like setting up a new computer--which of course it really is. (The operating system has been upgraded three times in the past year, with each one being a bit better than the previous one.)One problem that I constantly run into is that Nokia's intuition about how to do things is not the same as mine. Finding the message and phone logs initially takes several strokes and some good guesses. Sending a message requires guessing the meaning of two similar looking icons. Importing sim card phone numbers is especially round about, rather than automatic, but possible. On such things, the phone's software is no worse than MS word or word perfect, but it is still annoying to have to spend a few minutes puzzling out some rather routine tasks.  Nokia's online help for the phone provides answers to most mysteries that I could not puzzle out myself. (With practice, one \"gets\" Nokia's logic and it becomes a bit easier to find things and turn on and off various features.)I ran into a variety of minor problems that I thought were the phone's, but turned out to be ATT problems--eg they had not unlocked my sim card so that it could be used in an unlocked phone. ATT had previously provided info to unlock my last phone from them for use in Europe, so I thought that the sim too would have been unlocked.Recent revisions seem to have improved the GPS. The maps are excellent and the phone does a good job of locating you on the map, although it is not quite as accurate as a true GPS would be. The turn-by-turn advice, however, more than occasionally gets confused if there are lots of streets in the same area, but the maps are good enough that one can take a quick look at them and figure out which way to go, when the voice (of which there are many to choose from) fails.The GPS seems to have been improved in the various upgrades over the past year, and its locating ability and maps are very useful.It is an excellent phone and MP3 player, those parts are very user friendly; a very good camera, decent internet device, and much improved GPS system, good although not yet for foolproof turn by turn advice. All this for the price of a decent camera or GPS device.Overall I give the C6-01 very high marks. Its a convenient pocketable size, smaller than most small cameras and much smaller than most smart phones.One can be hot or cold about the phone according to what one is looking for and how much of a premium one puts on size and universal apps. The text is smaller on this phone than on phones with larger screens, and there are fewer apps, which is sometimes, although not often a problem.I rather like its small size for most day-to-day purposes. Its suite of software is terrific and more unusual that I had appreciated before my experience with a mid level Samsung, I-phone, and low level LG phone last summer. It is definitely a major improvement over my last phone, and its international portability is a major plus as well.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best handset that I had bought", "Author": "Diekastro", "ReviewID": "R270XLVTIC18LI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its very light weight, and looks so elegant.

Swapping a GSM chip in another country worked 100% of the time and within seconds. The call quality is as good as any phone ever used. The bluetooth 3.0 pairs perfectly with all devices used (headset and MacBook). Music via Built-in FM radio,  Radio streaming (via Nokia Internet Radio application) and MP3 player are simple and provide multiple listening options. WiFi connects easily.

GPS works great and free (once you understand the connection settings to use per the Nokia support website). Casual photos and videos are simple to use and the quality is fine for sharing. The built-in flashlight using the dual-flash is really bright and very useful and there when you need it at the push of a button.Other observations:Resistant to shock: This phone took a 3 foot fall on a hard tile floor while receiving a call and kept on ringing until I answered the call.

The 5800 was a great phone for it being my first touchscreen experience and I grew used to the resistive touchscreen. Had the unit not start malfunctioning more frequently, it would probably still be my primary phone. But, the screen apparently was losing power, as it would go fuzzy and virtually inoperable in cold climate, the slidelock seemed to be shorting out, and placing calls started to become a chore. It was a good 3 year run. The C6-01 is proving to be just as competent as the 5800...very clean, very responsive, loaded with features. It shares similarities with the iPhone and the Windows Phone. The AMOLED capacitive touchscreen took some getting used to but I'm starting to really get the hang of it. Texting is slightly different; not as quick but it's just as responsive. Has a great camera. Great sound clarity when taking calls. Pretty much does the same thing the 5800 did, with slightly quicker response and lots more memory. Here's the downside. First, the battery life is not great. I have to charge this phone daily, where with the 5800 I could charge every other day. The loudspeaker does not have the same quality as the 5800, for a phone that records and plays back video in 720p HD. Also, in some instances, the phone has a tendency to freeze on some applications and on a couple calls. Then, when texting, some buttons get pressed even when not pressing anything, which lets you know how responsive the touchscreen is. Some of the button placement could have been different to avoid mistakes in sending a text message. I also am not too pleased with the notification light, which is not very bright. And there is no way to disable camera sounds altogether, but the 5800 had the same issues. I'm still trying to determine the response time when sending multimedia messages. The slidelock, when first using this phone, was very hard to slide, but has become much easier. Overall, this phone is great so far.

It was used for travel in the UK with 02.Size: Great size and a good heft. The metal and glass outside casing made for a very nice look and feel.Construction Quality: Construction quality is excellent. Very good fit and finish.Battery: Long battery life and fast charge to full. I got two days with 4-5 calls a day (~30mins a piece), and a full day with heavy data usage and calls. It charged up over USB in a couple of hours.Screen: Amazing screen, great colors. I believe it is a Samsung AMOLED. Very easy to read.Bands: The phone I received was a true world phone. It had all the bands I needed for travel (GSM 850/900/1800/1900 UMTS 850/900/1700/2100). Call quality (sound and connection) was really good but wish the speaker could have been a little louder.Usability: Software: Symbian takes some getting used too (iPhone and Android user here). But overall everything was there and their app market is pretty good, was able to get Angry birds for free. Huge plus was the Ovi Map market. All the maps, for pretty much most of the world, are available for free from the Ovi portal. Also, with JokuSoft you are able to make the C6-01 into a mobile hotspot. Mechanical: Three hard keys and on screen keyboard. The hard keys have a good click feel to them. The only trouble was the on screen keyboard, or maybe it was my stubby fingers. I have to be careful to make sure I was pressing the correct letters on the screen. Of issue though is that the phone gets very hot if you use it continuously for more than 15-20mins. This occurs whether the phone is being used for data or for regular calls. I would recommend using a blue tooth headset.Camera: I used the camera and video options when I was on holiday. I used it outside during the day and found both the camera and video/audio to be quite good.Conclusion: So why four stars. After many hours at different O2 stores, and their in-store techs, I found out that my map feature would not work. Its A-GPS and so needs a data connection to work apparently, and though I was getting a solid data connection for everything else,the map software would not connect. So no maps and a lot of wasted time. They mentioned that I was not the first person to come in with this issue for Nokia phones. So I am left with three possibilities, 1. a dud phone, 2. problematic OS software and 3. something amiss with O2.Given a working map tool I would have rated this phone five stars, and the failed tool makes me want to rate it as one star. Giving Nokia the benefit of the doubt, and with excellent call quality, etc, I went with four stars.

Macdonald Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2OOSJUN7TVJA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST IMPRESSION:I have had the c6-01 for eight days.  This is a first impression.  I will write an addendum in about six months.My last cell phone was a Samsung Solstice.  I was very unhappy with this phone.  Seven out of the twelve menu icons called up the internet - usually on one of AT&T;'s sites.  I was constantly accidentally hitting one of these icons and getting unwanted data charges.I would basically use my phone to talk to people and to text.  Even though the keyboard was small, I could still compose a message but, it would drive me crazy a lot of times.  I would often type without looking at what I was typing until I had typed a whole lot of characters.  On the Solstice, you can't scroll back to a mistyped character without first erasing every correctly typed character after the one you wanted to correct.  This was particularly bad if I had mistyped a character at the beginning of the message and I was almost through.  I would have to basically start all over again.The camera was crummy too.  Photos were always \"washed out\" and lacked detail.There were other issues too that could have been easily fixed with a software update, but Samsung never issued an update for this particular phone.I spent some time looking for a phone that would correct all the problems I had with the Solstice.  Finally, I settled on the Nokia C6-01.  It solved all the issues I had with my old phone. The 8 Megapixel camera is superb.  The detail is more than what I expected.  The video is great.  It records in 720P.While the keyboard is small, it is a lot easier to type on and a lot less frustrating.The phone is completely customizable.  No longer will I accidently access the internet by having unwanted menu icons on the screen. The only time I can conceive of getting on the internet will be to video chat with my son in New Jersey.  The C6-01 has a front-facing camera and a back-facing one, and can connect to the internet.It is small - easy to fit in your pocket.I discovered another thing this phone can do.  I can connect it to my laptop computer and type a message using the laptop keyboard - a really good feature if you don't want to type on the phone's keyboard.UPDATED FEBRUARY 18THStill five stars.I've had five cell phones - The first being an analog one.  This one could very well be the best one I've had.  Firstly, the audio on calls is great.  It is really cool to be able to voice command the phone to turn Bluetooth on and off then send text messages with my computer keyboard.Since I purchased the phone, I upgraded the operating system to Nokia Belle.  It is awesome.  It is completely customizable with six home screens - not four like in the Amazon description.  I have tested out some of the features though I will probably use them infrequently.  I set the gps maps to guide me home wherever I'm at.  Very accurate directions are given for my return trip from work, though I'm told to take some side roads that I would not ordinarily take.  I suppose the gps maps feature will insure that I never get lost again.Another feature I think is really cool is the ringtones.  There are 96 tones to choose from and you can also use a song that you already have on your phone.Here are other features I haven't used yet, but they intrigue me.  One is the dictionary which will translate a word from another language to English.I have also download \"Angry Birds\" and a battery monitor program.I also like the fact that it uses a micro sd card.  I put in a 32 GB card.  I can always witch it for another if it gets filled.  I don't anticipate that.  I want to shoot some longer 720p videos that the included 4 Gb card does not afford.  I can transfer them to my computer and gain the space back on my phone memory card.If you are in the market for a smartphone, this one will not disappoint you.  It is a really good phone.  You can't beat the price, and, as one reviewer said, \"it actually fits in your pocket\".The description of the phone given by Amazon is inaccurate.  The new operating system makes much of the description obsolete.  Check out my picture under the black version. This is like the main homescreen.

I loved having a physical keyboard like on the mini and was kind of hesitant to get another all-touch device after enjoying the full keyboard but the E7 & E6 were both a bit high out of my price range. So I took a chance and purchased the C6-01.I've had it and been using it for just about a week now, but so far as my title says, it's a little dynamoThe first thing I noticed when I fired it up is the screen. Yes it is small compared to the lap top sized phones people carry in their pockets these days. But for me personally that is ok. It's what I wanted. I prefer smaller phones. But the screen is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. It puts alot of the higher end more $$ phones to shame. Nokia really hit a home run with the Clear Black Display. It's just a beauty of a display.Even though I'd never really tinkered with Symbian 3, I'd had enough experience with past Nokia Devices that setting up the basics of the C6-01 was a piece of cake.Next I set up the things that are most important to me like my music library and bluetooth devices. Both were easy to do. The bluetooth on this thing is amazing. The range and connection seems to be farther and stronger than on previous devices. It paired easily with the SYNC technology on my Ford Vehicle.I'm not the type of person that goes App crazy and gets alot of worthless stuff that I don't and won't use so I've found a few apps on the OVI store that are essential to me like Remind Me, Wikipedia Reader, X-plore, Internet Radio and a few more. I also loaded Swype which I'm learning how to use and take full advantage of.This is just a preliminary review. I'll re-do and add as I've had the device longer. But to touch on a couple of things others have noted....So far I have not had any phone re-booting issues under any circumstances. The battery has performed pretty good so far. I've installed a battery extender app so maybe that has helped. I believe the Symbian Anna & Belle updates are going to tweak the battery to give it more lasting power.Like I said, I'll add more thoughts as I've used the device longer. So far though, I've been totally happy and totally enjoying this little beauty.Say what you will about Nokia, but they have always given good value for the money in terms of features.

Obviously cannot compare to the N95, but still a strong body. The battery life sucks...its partly my fault too, as I have many processes running. Camera quality is top notch. Call quality is good. The phone does restart own its own sometimes, but rarely. The turn-by-turn navigation sure has saved my many times. The biggest advantage is the pentaband nature of the antenna, so I can have 3G on both, AT&T; as well as T-Mobile.Drawbacks: Battery life, as mentioned above, cannot add any Carddav or Caldav accounts...which, although is painfully missing, I can work my way around. Screen's too small (get what you pay for?).But one note to Nokia. Grow a pair and treat your American and Canadian customers at par with others.

Read On!", "Author": "Book Glutton", "ReviewID": "R2HF5C6F5M9VSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the fifth Nokia phone and the fourth Nokia Smartphone that I have owned. I have favored them for almost 14 years now. I have not been on a cell phone contract for over eight years, so I just buy the phones I want (all Nokia) & change the SIM card. I have liked them for their simplicity, their many features and their ease of use. When I first opened the box for this Nokia C6-01, and after charging and some initial setup procedures, I did what I have always done. I \"synched\" it with my Microsoft Outlook. It's a real easy procedure. I always use the Nokia software. They have had Nokia PC Suite and now they also have Ovi. I have done this for over ten years now. It's pretty basic stuff.This time, however, from the time the sync was complete, I began to get messages: \"Memory Full. Close some applications and try again.\" These were mostly when trying to use the Calendar, but it also happened for Contacts and for other things and at other times. I cannot tell you how many factory resets I did, and repeated this process, before I went online looking for a solution. None of it worked, and I am usually able to get to the bottom of technical problems.The Nokia C6-01 phone has an extraordinary amount of memory compared to others, so I do not know what was happening. I had not yet run or installed any other apps. Something \"it\" was doing must have been grabbing the memory-the sign of a nice \"bug.\" There is a selection to see what Apps are running, but none would show up except \"Menu.\"\"Google-ing\" the above message brought up a host of different Nokia phones that were having the same problem besides the Nokia C6-01. It was not a new problem. Just Google the message yourself and you will see. Obviously, this has been a problem for some time. I am figuring that it is something that is imbedded in the Symbian Operating System, or some other internal problem. I am surprised that Nokia has let this go on so long and spread to so many other phone models. This may be at least one reason that explains why Nokia sales are down, while people wait for it to move to the Microsoft Phone 7 platform.I tried to follow the recommendations that were suggested in the various forums. However, not one worked. I must have started from the beginning, again setting the phone back to factory values at least a dozen times, but to no avail. So, I gave up. So did my loyalty to Nokia since 1998. I cannot spend any more time with it. I wasted more than 12 hours on this.So, this is the last Nokia phone that I will buy at least for now. This one, however, is going back to Amazon for a refund. I must do the research now and find a comparable phone from another manufacturer. My loyalty to Nokia has kept me out of touch. So far, a few of the Samsungs Samsung I9000 Galaxy S Unlocked GSM Smart Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android OS, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, GPS and MicroSD Slot - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black (the only brand for which Windows Phone accepts a MicroSD card-although you have to \"marry\" it to the phone-see specs!) and several HTC models like the HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black have caught my eye.Update: Still, after more research, I found myself wanting a Nokia. For someone who favored them for so long, it just seemed like a no-brainer. Reviews all tell the story of Nokia loyalty. Anyway, hands down the E71 probably will go down as Nokia's best or favorite phone. In spite of that, after all of the above, I was attracted to the E72 which had high reviews and had improvements over the E71, in spite of what was said by the extreme E71 loyalists. And for the price that \"BLINQ\" was offering for \"Open Box\" models on Amazon, Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation -- U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black), and in spite of what I said above about Nokia, forgetting about the touchscreen and other gimmicks and concentrating on what I really needed, I thought I would take one more chance.I bought one. I love it. However, I had the same problem with it too. You can read my review for this there. I found a solution that will probably work for this phone too. I feel a little stupid that my Outlook file might have been the culprit, but there was so little troubleshooting help, I thought I was doing the best I could do.So, in fairness, I am raising the rating from 1-star to 4-stars!", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia C-6 Unlocked cell phone", "Author": "oneradtech", "ReviewID": "RW8BYE0SSWVKE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone arrived on time.

A used phone can be like a used car, you are just buying some one else's problems. I didn't have it long enough to really test things like the camera and all the whistles and bells.

Upgraded to the new Anna operating system, over the air, with no hiccup.  However, I bought this phone to use on my vacation to Taiwan, HK and China in the fall.  It is then that I discovered that Nokia phones intended for North America (or Europe) does not include Chinese (or any Asian) language support.  Solution proposed on various websites indicated a trip to a Nokia Care Center is required to add the missing language support.  So while on a trip to Shanghai this December, I brought the phone to a Nokia Care Center.  They said it will cost 120 CNY, which would not be bad around $20 and would take an hour.  After it went to the technician, I was then informed that my software is a newer version than they have in China (they are running Anna also!) and they only install newer and does not go backward! So no Chinese language support, only display little squares. It would get 4 stars if it includes Chinese or Asian language support out of the box, like Iphone, Android, Windows or Blackbery, almost all of the other major operating systems.

The Nokia USB cable did not work to connect to Nokia Suite completely ( It recognized the phone, but was unable to update, however, it worked with another cable I had already). The phone made the impression as if it was returned by a customer before, cleaned and repackaged. It was not in original retail package but kind of a gift box. The wrist band was missing as well. The seller was willing to take it back and refund price and shipping, however, I had it forwarded to Bermuda and paid customs and shipping for that.I just wish the seller would have said its kind of refurbished or otherwise opened before.I bought this phone to use the GPS without having to use Data plan (especially when abroad). For that it is great like other Nokia GPS phones. Other than that I want to use it as a phone and for some sms messages, maybe take a picture at times. So just for things you don't need data for. I don't want email etc. Its nice it has wifi, so at home I can download maps without connecting toteh internet. Howeve,r the voice guidance can only be downloaded via nokia suite on a computer. I don't have a data plan, I don't want one. However, the phone is full of apps you cannot get rid of. I don't want Microsoft office for a phone (requires paid registration), Typing is hard enough on the touch screen. WHo would create a doc on a phone? I don't want the weather forecast or public transport etc. At least I was able to create a folder (I called it trash) where I could move unwanted icons, because otherwise they crowd your screen. Unfortunately you don't find instructions how to get rid of any of those (only some can be deleted, the rest eats phone memory). As you may notice I am not a smart phone fan, so that makes me bias. I have no use for fancy apps, just the opposite, they make life harder for me.Pros: GPS, wifi, bluetooth, unlocked, good phone calling quality, well build, 8megapixel, flash built in, can be used as a flash light in the dark. Skype can be installed to make free or cheap calls via wifi. Charges via usb (my old Nokia did not) and also has a charger input for the typical Nokia chargers (small connector) from before. It came with usb charger and car charger for usb. Since I still have my old chargers I have two sets now. USB chargers work on other phones like blackberry or samsung as well.Cons: too many useless apps, cannot sync with my mozilla calendar (insists on Outlook), it seems Microsoft used its new influence on Nokia to lock people into their software. App store not very organized. The keys on the qwerty soft key pat on the screen are relatively small (even in landscape) and the fingertips often hit more than one key or the wrong one. The touch pat works with heat sensitivity, not like in the 5230, which I had before, with actual pressure. So the phone comes without a pic or stylus to be more accurate. Maybe I just have to get used to it a little more. Many apps cannot be deleted even if you don't plan to use them ever.Too bad I lost my old Nokia 5230 Navi edition.

I'm not sure if I will use all the social networking stuff, but the map was a big selling feature for me. Again, I don't know how to use it just yet. I can turn it on, and that's about it.The phone feels solid, and it is small. This isn't like the big dumb looking iPhone. This phone fits in the same case that I used with my RAZR v3.The micro USB port is ...different. I can't tell if they expect me to use the special Nokia connector or if I can safely use the standard micro USB plugs. I would have liked this phone much more if it had come with the standard mini USB port, though.Feel free to ask me questions on this. I plan to update this post as I experience better or worse thoughts.[[UPDATE 28 February 2013]]I don't talk much, so my battery life is typically longer than most.I noticed my \"standby\" time was only being limited to 3 or 4 days, and that was mostly because the screen always displayed the time (even though I keep it in a phone pouch where I can't see it).Once when the battery got very low, I was asked if I wanted to put the phone into a Low Power state. I selected YES and now the clock no longer shows all the time on the display. This has increased my battery life, too! I only have to plug in the phone every 7 to 10 days. Each time I plug it in, though, I am asked if I want to turn Low Power OFF. I always select NO - because I don't know any other way to access this feature on the phone!I do not have a data plan. It is $0.20 per text I send or receive, but I don't like to text so I don't care. I have only SENT 2 only RECEIVED 2 Texts.I have a wireless router in my home, and I am able to check Facebook or my email from my phone using that wireless connection. I don't like the tiny QWERTY keyboard, so I go to my PC when I want to reply.All said, I think I prefer my old RAZR v3 flip phone. I liked the physical buttons! When you are checking voice mail and it says \"press 7 to delete\", you look at the screen and there are no buttons! You must navigate there. If you want to call your credit card people - easy, right? 1-800-DISCOVER. Only the onscreen buttons don't always include \"ABC\" with the \"2\" key, etc.I had thought about selling mine here for $150 with the case, gel cover, original box, manual, etc (HINT-HINT).

It is a pain to use it", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R2NHESLFE88ZFK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't usually write product reviews, but this scam is important for you, human being pals, to know.NOTE: If you are expecting to only be able to do calls and send sms, and you are happy with that, then this post is not for you.This post is for the people who believes this thing can replace an iphone, android, or soThe quality of the product in the outside is good, if not excellent, just as you would expect. If you see it at a store, you probably want it.The AMOLED display is just quite different so you will notice its vivid colors to be apart from usual LCDs, and it has good resolution.But...The software is the worst part of all. Nokia is unable to deliver good quality software. The so called Symbian (Anna, or v60, or whatever you want) are terrible pieces of code poorly written, in every aspect.Sumarizing, buying this, also includes (not listed above):- Random restarts (I've never saw my iPhone restart while doing anything...at most, the apps itself crashed...but even that wasn't often).- Unnoticed moments when you in fact can't make (and perhaps receive) calls. I won't go deeper, but I was very surprised to see that I wasn't able to call, and all my friends around me were able to do so. I had to restart the phone in order to solve this, so this is CLEARLY phone issue, not network issue (so don't argue in favor of Nokia).- Music player can't go beyond many songs when playing. It just crashes before you end up listenning to music, with an included restart (yes, everything that was open, goes to hell).Besides, you need to be somehow enthusiast about resetting your phone every once in a while.The first time was because (Ok, my fault) I mistakenly entered my Nokia account password. After that, an \"invisible app to the user\" in behalf of various nokia services (maps, store, social, exchange) was attemping to connect, but with wrong credentials, the only thing it was doing was to drain my battery cellphone. The workaround while I thougth I would find a solution, was to check my phone constantly for that app, and then close it.Ok, reset the phone!. Next, The music library wasn't able to load music correctly. No more than 800 songs or so. Ok. formatted microSD, phone internal memory, erase every trace of it in my Macbook, reset, and then restore music. Fine, it finally looks ok.But guess what? Now, suddenly, my installed apps manager is not able to show all of them. I cannot install apps from ovi store nor .sis files anymore. Ok, at this point you should be an expert in the resetting business: Format microSD, format internal, *#7370#, connect to WLAN, connect to ovi store, redonwload everything. Download maps, set voice assisted driving GPS. change positioning server from nokia to google (as their also-bad-written-code-for-positioning server takes forever to know where you are). Setup emails, Facebook, twitter, foursquare, re-sync contacts, re-sync music, photos. Go to camera, set maximum quality for pictures (why would I want to save pictures of 6 MP if the produced 8M pictures are 600 kb in size? Nowadays, that quantity is nothing). Set profiles, tones, screensaver to nothing....etc Done. Now what!!??? My \"smart\"phone is slow as hell. Ok, one reset more. Oh and by the way syncing music is a pain. Because the also-bad-written nokia multimedia manager is not smart (because the phone is the one that should be), and then uploads your songs, within nice folders ordered by artists and albums. But guess what? To open them, the phone needs to build a database...and to build it, it needs to read the WHOLE Sounds folder. Why in hell is not the desktop manager able to build this database while uploading files and at the end upload this database? It takes forever to sync music, and after that the \"Refresh library\" step takes another eternity. If you add a new song...be prepared, because your \"smart\"phone needs to scan all the Sounds folder again. It makes sense, because the phone doesn't know where the file was uploaded, nor the artist, nor nothing. So scan everything....right? So idiot approach...Really, really, really, please don't buy this as it's poorly designed software will make you hate this thing.Pre-answers:\"It is meant only for social things.\" Yes, but the preinstalled nokia social apps is crap. You will need to get/buy better apps. And guess what? Since Nokia didn't came up with push notifications, you need to have all your social apps open and connected (if this is your case, not mine), draining your battery.\"You can't expect a perfect OS. Even other brands has faults\". Yes, but what about support? All you will find on internet is a bunch of another users asking for help in Nokia forums. Seriously, the support page only has obvious FAQs, and a forum. Nothing else. Just do a quick google for the problems I've had: \"SSO nokia application\" \"uninstall SSOUI nokia\" \"refresh library not working nokia\" \"cannot install apps nokia\" \"unable to install apps nokia\" (you'll find some unsolved posts from 2006!!). This is the proof that I'm not lying to you.Plus:-To capacitive touch sensor is not as precise as other phones. Be prepared to tap accidentally on things, since your thumb, which can't go anywhere while holding your phone, will cause this.-Hardware buttons can't be used while the phone is soft-locked. Seriously, why do I have 5 buttons in this thing if I can't even change to the next song while the phone is locked?? I had to buy an app for that....shame on me.-User interface loves to appear quick questions while anothers appear, so you will answer something to some question.-Downloads from web browser are automatic, if you clic on something that downloads anything, it will start automatically.-If you use earphones to listen to music, and change phone to silent, you won't hear any notification of calls, sms, etc. OK, thats abvious, profile name is silent. If you change it to general, then the sound goes to earphones and \"smart\"phone speaker. So, its your choice, everything or nothing.-If you don't upgrade to Symbian Anna, be prepared for buggy wlan connections (the settings say it wouldn't connect, but it will). With Anna, you reduce this weird thing to almost 0 (but not 0).-You will have to upgrade to Anna. Everything I said happens on Anna. The previous version looks like a Beta compared to Anna. And Anna looks like a Beta compared to anything. Picture that...-There are a lot of minor stupidities that you only say \"I couldn't expect less than that\".I would return this, but unfortunately I can't as it came in a carrier plan.Anyone who wants to discuss this, be my guess. There is a quote in software development that says:\"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot- proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.\" Whether apple and google had already beaten the universe and their software is idiot-proof (including me), or Nokia can't win the universe.

Como yo venia de usar un nokia e63 queria pasar a un \"smart phone\" con pantalla tactil, pero queria permanecer en Nokia. Y bueno el telefono funciona bien, las aplicaciones funcionan bien, los juegos funcionan bien. Es un buen telefono para empezar a utilizar los telefonos estilo iphone.Los contras:1. La pantalla horizontal: cuando quiero escribir en la pantalla horizontal muchas veces tarda mas de lo que quisiera para que el telefono entienda que gire la pantalla.. y muchas veces el telefono ni sabe, asi que tengo que darle unas sacudidas para que entienda.2. La bater\u00eda, aunque dicen que pod\u00eda durar como 4 d\u00edas, la m\u00eda, al final del d\u00eda, ya tiene 2 o 3 rayitas. Y es uqe el telefono pasa buscando como conectarse a internet, asi que hay que desactivar el escaneo wi-fi automatico, activar una opcion que dice algo de widgets en modo desconectado, desactivar el bluetooth, y no jugar mucho.. tal vez asi dure 2 dias.3. La c\u00e1mara, 8 mega pixeles y todo eso, pero todav\u00eda sigue siendo una c\u00e1mara mediocre de celular. He visto fotos en black berrys o iphones, y esas c\u00e1maras son mucho mejores.

For basic cell phone usage, the phone does work.  I have been able to use it overseas and in the U.S. as a basic cell phone without any problem.  Where the phone fails though is as a smartphone.Bootup is excruciatingly slow.  It takes so long for anything to appear on the screen that I often (needlessly) press and hold the power button because I'm never sure that I actually turned the phone on.The phone also randomly reboots itself.  I've had it reboot during websurfing.  I've had it reboot while checking the Ovi application store.  It randomly reboots when listening to MP3 songs.  It reboots when looking at text messages.  Every reboot is annoying, and it's made worse by the slow bootup (see previous paragraph).The Ovi application store is a joke.  First, there's hardly any applications there compared to Android or Apple.  And when using the Ovi store application from the phone, it's impossible to tell if the application is truly compatible with the Symbian 3 operating system used by this phone.  It is entirely possible to download a non-compatible application, unless you carefully read all the reviews to find someone who downloaded the app and has this same phone.I could live with that, except that the screen isn't responsive, so I find myself tapping the screen and nothing happening to get to the review link...and the same thing is true for web pages, icons, etc.  The phone is slow and often unresponsive to touches.Installation of apps...requires a reboot.  At least I think it require a reboot, because everytime I install an app, the phone reboots.Bottom-line:  I happen to use and/or own an Android phone and a Blackberry phone, as well as previously owning Palm phones.  All of those phones are more responsive, have better applications, and better operating systems.  This phone is only good for being able to carry around the world and make a phone call.

You have to consider how you're going to use it. Carriers will not sell you a sim card. In order to use this phone in the US you'll have to get into a long-term contract, only then will they provide you with the sim card.Unlocked phones are orphans that lack the benefits  or perks of  phones that are part of the carriers networks. If you get this phone and simply insert another phone's sim card into it, you've just wasted your money, since its internet feature will be disabled, or it will be much more expensive to use.Also, you can't use it with a no contract carrier. You'll basically end up with a nice looking phone that's far from as useful as the phones you get through carriers, due to the system that is. Or, far from as useful as it could be.Think twice if you really want a nice looking phone that can do half of what the approved phones can do. Of course that wouldn't be the case in Asia or Europe, but in the US, good luck in tapping the phones capabilities with verizon or t-mobile without ending up sucked into a long-term contract like with any other of their phones.It's amazing how many knuckleheads go out and buy unlocked cellphones without thinking how they're going to activate it, and what it'll entail in terms of carriers policies. Sure this is a great phone in theory.Also if you bought an unlocked phone of your choice, and could easily get a sim card with no contract for it, then how come there's a big market for no contract phones, with several carriers accommodating it? The neggers  must be mad that they can't answer this question. If unlocked phones were such good choices everyone would get them, but most don't.The neg flocks group thinking is noticeable.The web is full of examples of how it's a hassle getting t-mobile to provide a sim card for someone's unlocked phone. It's also full of cost comparisons, and they all say unless you travel abroad often, getting an unlocked phone will be a waste of money.
