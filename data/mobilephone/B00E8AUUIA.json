{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Android phone as it should be", "Author": "Abdulla Fakhroo", "ReviewID": "R2YCFDQ16Z84GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "- Solid quality (best implementation of plastic that makes aluminum jealous).- Attractive design (departure from small, medium, large, X-large, XXL and XXXL sizes of the exact boring design).- OS simplicity (IOS alike simplicity away from annoying and useless Samsung features).- Utilized storage (no software/features garbage).- All-in-one device (the only device that is needed besides a notebook).- Productivity enabler (large screen that makes Internet browsing, email checking, youtube watching, corporate login and office suites use enjoyable on such device).- Seamless application (no brainer installation and easy to use features in both Windows and Mac flavors).- Tolerable weight (barely feels it in pocket).- Lasting battery (above average continuity in comparison to many other phones).- Excellent price (considering the features above and the latest processor power available on market).- Excellent supplier (no hassle lightening fast delivery in great packaging).Finally a perfect device that replaces my iPhone 5, Samsung Mega 6.3 and iPad Mini all together. Really love it, hope that Sony continues offering future models of this series forever.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great gift", "Author": "Alicejo", "ReviewID": "R3VIS9B2HNAB5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it.

The user's ability to control it is hindered.  It does not support voice commands and inputs.  The camera seems completely out of place.  For a product from a company founded on sound, it has a really poor speaker.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "is that a phone in your pocket??
