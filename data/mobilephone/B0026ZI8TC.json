I received the product promptly and it worked perfectly. I had dropped a cell phone in water before and put a blow dryer on it and it worked so I took the chance and I am very pleased with my cell phone. I would recommend this seller and be a customer for him, thank you.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good and sturdy basic cell phone that will last you a while.", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3Q81JF0U3WODU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using this cell phone for several years, I admit I am in no hurry to switch to another one.  Admittedly, I only use my cell for phone calls, no texting or Internet browsing for me, so I can speak for only some limited features of this phone, but for basic service this phone can't be beat.  The flip-top design means no involuntary phone calls when you throw it in your pocket and it rubs against something, which was a big factor for me in the purchase of this phone, and the red color assures you will find it inside a bag.  After all this use, it still charges OK, though I am very upset with AT&T;'s service in the New York area, which is pretty horrible.  There are only a couple of basic demo games this phone comes pre-loaded with, which is a pain, but I find myself using the calendar feature and other little features like a calculator all the time.Overall, if you're looking for a workhorse that will survive some abuse and use mostly voice service, I would recommended this phone.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Condition of Merchandise", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R1J8QN8PM9X5HK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All pretty much okay.

It only has one very minor blemish which I was expecting a used product to be in a little worse shape.  My mother has had her phone for 6 years and this company was able to keep her happy by having one of these older phones in stock.  They promised it would arrive in 6 to 12 days and it arrived in 2 days.  That was fantastic!!!!!  I would buy from this company with no hesitation in the future..  Thank you for keeping my mother of 87 years happy.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "My mother wanted a spare.", "Author": "R.

I never had any problems with reception until I picked up the Samsung SGH-A707.  I'm constantly having to change my location in my apartment--the phone often hovers between \"No Service\" and one or two bars.  Half the time I respond to texts, I get \"Service Unavailable\" messages.  It's frustrating.  I never had this problem with any of my previous cell phones--two of which I used in this same apartment and always got perfect reception.  Even my cheap, featureless Nokia, which was at least 3 years older than this one, got great reception here.And speaking of features, this phone does have a decent camera, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.  Other than that... what good is a cell phone without good reception?  I'll be looking to sell this as soon as possible so I don't have to get out of bed to send text messages anymore.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "DICKSON RC", "ReviewID": "RLNZJT5WL0EUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent telephone and quick shipment, this cellular one is a marvel, he/she came in their new box and it works of marvel, I hope it lasts me as others that I have had of the same one.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "A.

Makes a great mp3 player, it has great sounding STEREO speakers and takes a MicroSD card for tons of music. You need an adapter for regular headphones, get a bluetooth headset and your good for hands free too!The only reason I'm ditching it is I'm switching providers and getting an android phone for less per month than AT&T.; Plus the charging slot \"wore out\" or something, I have to use the \"right\" charger and wiggle the plug to get it charging.
