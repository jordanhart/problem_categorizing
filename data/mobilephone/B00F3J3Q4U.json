{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Im not a apple head, i love android but..", "Author": "Chidinma", "ReviewID": "R2OY0GYDVMLBGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely \"one handable\" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not \"droppable\" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "This seller is a liar and a thief", "Author": "hamid", "ReviewID": "R2RLVAGDCOQRQR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This person selling this item is a liar ..
