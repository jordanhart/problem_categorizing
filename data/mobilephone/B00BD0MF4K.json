{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This phone/ straight talk service is pretty amazing!!!", "Author": "wdjones93", "ReviewID": "R3VQTO2C98PMZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS- I moved away for college and had to start paying my own phone bill. It was my first year away, so paying for a smart phone on a two-year contract was too expensive, so I played it safe and got a prepaid dinosaur Verizon phone . I soon realized how crucial it was to check my email , social media, etc, away from my dorm room, anytime of the day (work emails, class updates, events on campus). I like many, was super skeptical of straight talk service, but who wouldn't be after having your parents pay for Verizon service for over 7 years. Eventually, one of my classmates convinced me to give it a shot, and It's been pretty wonderful. My iPhone 5 is my first Apple product (originally android user)and only paying $50 a month for service, is so affordable for my college kid budget. It's even better that I don't have to worry about going over a set data limit. Overall, I love it!!!CONS- it seems like it slows down towards the end of the monthly billing cycle, but I have wifi all over campus so it rarely effects me.  - I called customer service twice and both times, the customer service representative spoke english as a second language (I presume), so the conversations were a tad bit difficult.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "waay better than android phones!!", "Author": "B. Ryden", "ReviewID": "RQQHVZFDERTS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone at WalMart and after it was set up, i had my number ported and up in running in less than 2 hours from Verizon. I hated high prices of Verizon, and had problems with my samsung galaxy after 9 months or so, tried Cricket for 1 day, and finally i decided to try apple and i will never go back. This phone is super fast for 3G (10x faster than cricket and almost as fast as 4G LTE Verizon), battery lasts almost 3 days before needing recharge (my Samsung lasted about 19 hours), and the software is so intuitive and user friendly. Plus you dont need to worry about getting your phone hacked in wifi locations like with android/pc products. Plus wifi speed is faster than android also. Siri is a great bonus also: just speak to it and it will search the net, make a call, find a business or restaurant. This is priceless cus it can do the work for you as you drive. The Maps feature is the best because on android, if you're following directions and have to exit the app, you cannot resume where you left off and have to enter the addresses all over again which is dangerous when you're driving. With apple, the app keeps running in the background and once you click it, it automatically resumes where you left off, blinking icon showing you where you are on the map. This alone makes the phone worth it. Plus, i don't get faulty addresses like i did with the android, the map app is up to date. I cannot believe how much improvement and features this phone has over the android, cus you would think that android programmers would just do the same stuff apple does, but they cant seem to get it right. The phone doesn't even come with a manual because apple knows you don't need it :) buy this phone and you will be so happy you did, especially if you're only familiar with android like i was.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would give lower stars if I could.", "Author": "bryanmd88", "ReviewID": "RUR1WA4PE8XOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, this is WAY cheaper at Walmart.

This is a response to anyone, if you want to be taken seriously, and have any type of credibility, please learn how to spell, use symbols in their correct order($25 not 25$).  I understand that the average users don't care about this, but it makes us all appear poorly educated when we put our poor grammar out there, for the world to see online.So to edit this error, Walmart has this exact phone for $649, or 26 payments of $25.Also I doubt anyone actually cares that their $45 phone service, won't see 4g on verizon any time soon.The phones are not divided up by state.  The phones are purchased through which ever service provider gives the best deal for those phones and will still support whatever the agreed upon amount for their service, at the $45 per month service rate straight talk sets their service at.  There may be a very small percentage of the decision making process to determine what phones work best in which areas, however the phones are purchased almost exclusively by which carrier happens to give the best deal for their equipment.If you want to know what phones are what. Most of the straight talk phones are marked on the bottom right or left corner of their boxes with: CDMA (Sprint), CDMA-V (Verizon), GSM (T-mobile/ AT&T;). iPhones are a little different in how they're marked.Check out this link (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3939) for further details to determine what iPhone you are actually purchasing.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love this phone", "Author": "joseph", "ReviewID": "R1NRSRGTKYXCZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this phone it is worth the price, you will not regret buying this phone at all. so go a head and buy this phone and injoy.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$680.00", "Features": "Apple iPhone 5 64GB, White, for Straight Talk, No Contract\nApple iPhone 5 64GB, Black, for Straight Talk, No Contract", "Name": "Straight Talk iPhone 5 Prepaid Cell Phone, 16 GB, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MqRWJu8NL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BD0MF4K"}}
