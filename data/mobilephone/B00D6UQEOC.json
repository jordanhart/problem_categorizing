Yes, the regular camera is super high res, but if you're planning on taking a lot of instagram pics of yourself, you'll have to get good at doing it blind, because the face cam is pretty darn useless in low light & certainly isn't high res even in good lighting.If any new developments come up, I'll let you know.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "waterproof", "Author": "Andrew Bishop", "ReviewID": "R3PSIQ7BT5RWBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 8/5/13For whatever reason, I find myself unable to add the photos of the phone and box to the Amazon site - maybe whom-ever posted the page needed to allow it?Anyway - as someone asked, I thought I would post the frequencies used on the product:GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900UMTS/HSPA Bands  1/2/4/5/8(of which Data uses following bands 1(2100), 2(1900), 4(1700), 5(850), 8(900))Update 8/2/13I finally found the ZR on the Sony website, but it's on the sonymobile site.It arrived, had it for literally 5 mins - I will try ad post a couple of photos.Compared to the wifes Iphone 5, its a little larger - about a quarter inch in both directions, and a little thicker, but nice in the hand - doesn't feel much heavier.Screen is fantastic.I had a look at the waterproof doors and see the seal on inside the battery compartment.I didn't quite set the back on correctly the first time, so could see where someone thought it was fully engaged, but in fact wasn't.Sync'd up with my google accounts very quickly.Camera seems very good - can zoom in on a photo very far.-------------------------Initial reviewI have just ordered my ZR, having had a play with a friends phone. I was impressed enough to order my own. - I don't like to run with the crowd. - and thought it was a great alternative to the S4 & Iphone.- He gets a lot of positive comments on it.(Sorry Amazon, you were a little more expensive than where I found it, even with the free prime shipping!)Based on another review here, I did some research first, and phoned Sony customer service to ask about the waterproofing.Yes, they do class it as waterproof, with the proviso that you keep the ports closed. - Which, I guess, is fair enough- I don't expect my car to keep water out in a storm if I leave the sunroof open!Taking that a step further, I asked about how I would return it if it did get water in it. - They take the phone back, and test it as is for water resistance with all the ports closed. - If it passes the test this way, then they make the assumption it was damaged while the ports were open. - if, on the other hand it fails that test, they replace the phone under warranty.I was also curious about Croma (I was looking to buy one, so as the other reviewer bought his there, I looked it up) - its an Indian company. - So not sure if the other reviewer is based in India, or just imported it from there. - Which might be another reason Sony USA wouldn't help?Anyway, looking forward to getting mine, especially having had preview of my friends, I will try and remember to do an update.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone, a few comments though..", "Author": "Advo", "ReviewID": "R2CM29RRQU4Y3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the phone in general. It is waterproof (so far), it looks quite nice, it is very responsive and fast. It gets a good signal. Battery life is very good. What I notice (in contrast to older phones such as the Defy+ and the iPhone 4S) is that many \"special functions\" drain the battery relatively little. With that I mean web surfing (as long as you moderate the brightness), listening to music and notably use as a WiFi-hotspot. On the Defy, all of these uses drained the battery fairly fast, and the iPhone 4S for example does what, 2 hours as a wifi hotspot? 3?If I use the Xperia ZR as a hotspot to download a steady 3 mbit/sec, the battery will last 7-8 hours. On LTE, with around 20 mbit/sec, it'll still last 5-6. This can be very useful, if you're out with friends you can turn on the hotspot for an hour or two and it will have little impact on the battery, while other (older) phones would have simply been dead afterwards.Skype is still a problem though - I like to run Skype (signed in) around the clock, and that drains 4% of the battery per hour (with the screen turned off and the phone otherwise dormant). But I guess that's a Microsoft and not a Sony problem. Also, I found that this is only true if I use the cellular data connection. While I'm on wifi, Skype has no noticeable effect on the battery. The way I am using the phone now, with Skype turned on and the phone on wifi most of the day, the battery easily lasts from the morning of one day until the evening of the next. Battery life is just not a problem with this phone. I cannot overstate how much that improves the user experience.Three issues I have with the phone - the first is the fact that I'm not so happy about the port seals. The way the Motorola Defy handles it, you have standard-looking ports with plugs that go into the ports and seal them.I dropped my Defy into the ocean one time with the headphone port open (the headphones were not plugged in). I scooped it up a few seconds later. No water came in. As long as you have a headphone plugged in, you run little risk that rain for example will get into the Defy.With the ZR it's very different.The seals kind of cover and go around the ports, and when the seals are open in particular the headphone port offers a wide opening into the phone. You can see the light from the screen through openings that are situated around the headphone jack. In other words, if you are using headphones or if the seal is for some reason not quite tight, water (such as rain or a spilled drink) will get in extremely easily, much easier than into the Defy. That's just stupid design.The second point is the camera. I guess I wouldn't be complaining about it, because it is ok, but I've had extensive opportunity to compare it to the camera on the Optimus G (also 13 MP, much older phone) and that camera is just way better, especially in low light.The third issue is the \"washed out looking screen\", which has been a compaint with the Xperia Z as well and which is caused by the fact that the navbar and the status bar are grey-ish or brown instead of black. This makes the screen look grey and washed out.According to many comments I've read, Sony fixed this for the Xperia Z and for the ZR and made the bars black  - I suppose that must be only for Europeans and Americans. I bought the ZR in Asia and on 4.2.2 I still have this problem. I suppose the Asians weren't complaining enough???Other than that, the ZR is a very good phone and I'll certainly look very closely at Sony's phones when I buy my next one.Note about LTE: There are two versions of the ZR - the C5502 (no LTE) and the C5503 with LTE.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Unlocked Phone with a few Compromises", "Author": "c", "ReviewID": "R2ZK1GXVG1ZMKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a string of Nexus 4s I was unhappy with. It was tough finding a decent phone of medium size which is unlocked, this was definitely the best choice. I really like the layout and flexibility Sony has built in to their UI. There are a few things that are not preferable, but overall I can live with. It gets good reception and is quick. I am disappointed with the camera performance (my 3 year old Nexus S has much clearer pictures) and how the default album view is all one large album, versus the stock Android view which is separate albums. I do really appreciate the sd slot which allows me to add extra storage, as opposed being locked into only 16GB of the Nexus 4. FYI.

This is a much welcomed upgrade and I was always a fan of Sony phones before. This is my first in their Xperia line and it's looking good so far. I didn't want to go to big with a 5\" screen so I settled for this and it's perfect. The display is very crisp and bright. Yeah the viewing angles could use a little work but I'm not the one to care much about that. The nice 13mp camera on the back is very nice, producing sharp images and good performance overall. The front camera on the other hand is a sad little .3mp which I couldn't understand. Everything else about this phone is high end except for that. Fortunately, I don't take a lot of selfies but if you do, look elsewhere. Performance is snappy and is in line with today's modern phones. Battery life is amazing, especially paired with their power saving features as well as having changeable batteries. The waterproof works superb as long as you secure all the ports and the back plate. I'll be interested to see what else comes down the Xperia line but so far so good.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good effort on Sony's part - better than Z", "Author": "William Small", "ReviewID": "RFY2IXS3B8CZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I may be a difficult customer when it comes to a smart phone. I tried the Z, it's battery life was poor, so I tried this.  It was really good in most ways, but it seems to not pull the cellular signal as well as my trusty Motorola Defy or my Google Nexus 4.  Apparently Tmobile's signal is lacking in my area (Annapolis, MD) so I really noticed the difference.  My friends were wowed by the underwater video demonstration I gave them.  The other issue I had with the phone was bluetooth issues with multiple devices, such as my Toyota Prius, Bose Soundlink, and Jabra headset.  I was hoping they would release the new version of Android before my return window closed in case that would resolve those issues.  Supposedly people in areas where the 4.2 operating system were released for it, or people who have rooted their phone and put on 4.3 have experienced an improvement in signal strengthl. If the issues were resolved, Sony would have earned my money.  The phone is FAST and the picture is great. Can hardly tell the difference between this picture and the Z.  Phone feels great in the hand.  Battery life is excellent.  I would like to see more products like this and would like Sony to get my money with this, but it needs a little refinement.

I'm coming from the Moto Droid Maxx which was a 2 year disappointment.

This phone has a TFT capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors, what makes it very cool about definition (HD), nevertheless it does not has the same colour intensity of an AMOLED display (i.e. Samsung Glaxy S2/S3/S4), you must face right to the screen  to see it entirely well, seeing it within any other angle will make the screen to \"fade\" a little bit.As this is C5502 model, it supports the following bands:-GSM 850/900/1800/1900-HSDPA 850/900/1700/1900/2100So it works fine in ECUADOR (I have it with a data plan from Movistar). The phone is unlocked so you can use it with Claro or CNT as well.Xperia ZR supports up to 32GB of storage (with microSD) and 8 GB internal and includes a 13 MP main camera with sweep panorama and supports video @1080p (30 fps). Secondary camera is only VGA. Other features are: Quad-Core processor, 2 GB RAM,  DLNA, Internet tethering (hot-spot), and it is dust and water resistant (over 1 m). In order to waterproofing to work, all \"doors\" must be closed.Sony made cool enhancements including security features. For instance, with MyXperia you can locate your phone if you lost it or it is stolen, you only need to activate it and then you can access through [...] and you can make it sound (alarm), delete all your information, lock your device or locate it in a map (you must have GPS enabled for better results). Aditionally it comes with a trial version of McAfee mobile security which provides  more security functions (you can buy the full version later for USD $ 17,49).Other cool apps from Sony (preloaded):-Music Unlimited-Video Unlimited-Walkman-PlayMemories-SocialNews-Reader by SonyIf you have a PSN account then you can use it to login to some of this apps (as required. You can use your Facebook login too).In summary, Xperia ZR is a great phone, with cool features and with a cool camera.The following product goes great with this phone:Frosted Hard Cover Case + Hd Ultra Clear Screen Protector Film for Sony M36h Xperia Zr (black)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT A 4G !", "Author": "majid", "ReviewID": "R30U327SGFTJ48", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for a month but I just notice I have a bad connection and slow and my plain on the phone is 4G Finley I found out this phone is not 4G as they say on the product information phone it's just a 3G and have problems on the voice  speaker is low hard to hear it till if you connect it with  the head seat so I had to return it  thanks for customer service amazon!", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Travis Rajnath", "ReviewID": "R2LBD2SANVOTY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i say i was getting a screen protector with this. get more colourswrd wrd bless am out of there", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont bother with this sub par phone. better options are out there.", "Author": "JCoats", "ReviewID": "R1QOHO1YOLQUBH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing!

This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3\" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich.
