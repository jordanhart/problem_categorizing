You can watch movies, listen to music and surf the web and each of these things can be done while talking on the phone with it!  Android 2.2 features live wallpapers, which look really cool, but drain battery life.  With 'Power Manager' app, my battery lasts ALL DAY LONG with normal wallpaper!  TONZ of apps and customizability!  I'm synced with my office email and my personal one!  I can even view attachments straight from my phone email inbox! It has Flash so I can view any website. It has a camera button and a flash.  Allows me to video record and take pics and immediately share them via MMS, email, Facebook or Flicker.  Videos allow you to immediately share via Youtube!  My case has a stand, so I can sit it up and watch movies in both landscape and portrait mode!  I can tether my phone to my computer or laptop via USB or wirelessly with 3g connection, which on T-Mobile has tested as fast as Sprint's 4G and even faster in some areas! This can only be done on Android 2.2, but it's pretty cool!  I can print documents from the phone to my printer at home from anywhere!The only things it's lacking in features is a Front Facing Camera, a significant amount of app and/or internal memory, a High Definition Camera/Camcorder and an actual radio, but TuneRadio resolves this in the GREATEST WAY!!!It's better than ANY OTHER SLIDER PHONE currently out IMO!  It ranked third in speed amongst the TOP cellphones currently!", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Android Phone", "Author": "Luis A. Perez", "ReviewID": "R2V4I0MVDEJZBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing there is so much you can do with it.  The phone first came with Android 1.6, but I later updated to Android 2.1 and it made it alot faster and better to work with.  The battery life on this phone is not so great it does not last a whole day.  You can also use this phone as a mp3 player and it works really well.  It is not as fast as the newer phones and when I download certain apps it slows down.  The internet browser is awesome and you can watch flash based websites.  The google apps work really well and I love the google calendar that syncs with the google calendar on my PC.  It is an awesome phone, but it is not as fast as newer phones out there and the I wished the battery life was better on it.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "great first android smartphone", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RC7PIW4MVXA89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone used, so far has been a great phone. It is my first smartphone i came from using a older tmobile tm506 flip phone & wow at the difference.This phone is like a mini computer at your fingertips, I can check/write emails, check/sell/buy on EBAY (requires app), check/write/reply/request friends on Facebook, check my bank account balance (app) live current weather maps and future forecasts, upload/watch vids on Youtube, and anything else i would normally do on a pc, you just have to download an app  from the android marketplace.I was a little worried about some of the stories ive heard going around the internet about, it breaking down, but at the used price point this phone is going for its still a gamble but just not a large gamble.... I figure if i get a years worth of use out of it, ive got my money's worth.it has great features too, like Wifi, GPS, 5mp camera w/flash, a nice sensitive touchscreen, slide out keyboard, just to name a few.The camera has its good points and bad, the good is it takes excellent upclose pics, but not so good distance pics, when taking pics from a distance it comes out looking kindof like when you look through a telescope backward where the image seems far off. And the auto focus is a little off on mid range pics.The battery is really the only major drawback for me i can live with the slight camera issues as i mainly take up close pics anyways, the stock battery last between 6-8 hours of medium usage, i upgraded to the biggest battery i could find and it came with an extended back door, now my phone last about 30-35 hrs with wifi, bluetooth, gps, 3g all turned off, but i do turn 3g back on when i need to use the internet, but turn it back off when im done, this also prevents apps from auto updating and running your MB usage thru the roof.I will update this review when if i have any issues with the phone, but as of right now im still running the stock 2.1 android OS and i plan to upgrade to 2.2 or maybe even a custom  rom, so i will update this when/if i do", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touchscreen stopped working within 60 days", "Author": "Theresa Doyle", "ReviewID": "R3KHJ4KH41LBL2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "What I like about phone:  real keyboardWhat I don't like:  it doesn't work, warranty service not availableAny \"new\" My Touch 3G Slide phone purchased from Amazon seller is not covered under warranty.

So basically I wasted alot of money on a phone that doesnt do what it said it would. Glad my contract is up in a few months so I can find something else. It's an ok phone otherwise but has no memory even with an SD Card because alot of things wont save to the card. It wants to keep them on the phone for some reason.

But after it breaks the first time, t-mobile is just going to continue to send you refurbished models, which means they too will also have problems. I am on my 8th one as I type this, the first one the power button stopped working and had to be pressed with a paper clip like another reviewer here mentioned. Another time Sense(The UI) Kept crashing/restarting constantly, a few times the buttons on the bottom stopped working completely(The home, back, and menu buttons), another time it wouldn't even power on for no reason(I.e. full battery and power button seemed to work), another time the touch screen would do things on it's own accord, i.e. typing and doing things on its own(Not a virus but just a sensor problem), recently the touch screen went out, and on the latest one, it came with the GPS taking 20minutes to load and no one can hear me when making phone calls. I keep good care of my electronics and know none of these were user errors, I'm honestly shocked at the variety of problems I have had with this phone. Usually problems tend to be recurring, but as you can see I haven't had the same problem once.Also to make it worst none of the cases stay on this model for more than a month without either breaking or just falling off. But something internally will go wrong before you drop it and break it anyways.Seriously though, I know this phone has quite a few good reviews, and maybe a lot of them were from when the phone was new, I didn't bother checking, but save yourself the trouble and get a more reliable phone.

Lipsitz", "ReviewID": "RJZZFKE7Q47U9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the first two months or so that I had my HTC myTouch 3G Slide, I thought it was the greatest phone I ever had.  I drove big rigs for a living at the time, and nothing is more important to a trucker's cell phone than the actual phone.  Recent legislation prohibiting truckers from using their hands to operate cell phones while operating commercial vehicles makes Bluetooth functionality, especially voice dialing, very important.  For my purposes, the phone could also double as a modem when tethered to my laptop, allowing me to keep current with weather, road, and traffic conditions, as well as to instantly submit my paperwork upon delivery, and to receive any needed permits that may have expired.Voice calls using my Bluetooth headset were exceptionally clear, and the two devices maintained connection up to 60 feet, nearly twice the usual 35 foot range.  The device could also be tethered via WiFi, eliminating unnecessary USB cables between the already crowded cab and sleeper.  I opted, however, to use the provided USB cable, due to the unusually short battery life (90 minutes talk, 8 hours standby).  Thanks to the Android OS, I was able to prioritize WiFi connections to disconnect from T-Mobile and connect via WiFi to access points in our terminals and at truck stops, so I didn't exceed the limits on my allegedly unlimited data plan.  The physical qwerty keyboard allowed me to type much more quickly than I could with the virtual touch screen keyboard, and had a nice feel to it.The first problem I encountered with the phone was that the supplied 2GB class 4 MicroSD card was unusable, and could not be made usable by any means.  I replaced it with an 8GB class 4 that worked just fine.  I also discovered that most of the internal memory was taken up by \"bloatware,\" apps I neither wanted nor could I remove them.  This sharply limited the apps that I could install to just a few very small ones, or one normal size app.  The Android OS that originally came with the phone device did not allow for installing or moving apps or most data to the user's MicroSD card.  As I tend to use a cell phone for, well, a phone, this wasn't initially a big problem for me.In early 2011, after just a couple of months of having the phone, T-Mobile forced an over-the-air (OTA) upgrade to the Android OS.  The upgrade was done without any notification of any kind, nor with end-user permission.  Because most who had this phone did not know what had happened, we individually thought we had somehow damaged the phone on our own.  It turns out the OTA upgrade damaged the telephone transceiver.  Both T-Mobile and HTC have refused to acknowledge the problem and replace the devices.  The damage to the transceiver was caused by the forced OTA from Android 2.1 to Android 2.2.  Again, both HTC and T-Mobile are very aware of the damage they did to everyone's phones, they just refuse to acknowledge it because they don't want to have to replace the phones they damaged, nor let those they harmed out of their two year contracts.An attempt was made earlier this year to install an alternative to the Android OS called CyanogenMod.  The alternative OS is growing in popularity due to the lack of bloatware, though it is very easy to turn your cell phone into a paperweight if you don't know what you are doing (installation and tweaks).  It was with this OS that I was able to determine that the phone transceiver had been damaged, and that there was no way to fix the problem short of replacing the transceiver, which is costlier than replacing the phone.The phone will work occasionally with CyanogenMod, but it locks up just as many times as it previously rebooted.  Fortunately, the CyanogenMod OS allows for easier and faster rebooting, but the phone should not be relied upon for important or emergency communications.  The Bluetooth, WiFi, and GPS radios were not damaged by T-Mobile's damage, so the phone is a bit useful as a very small tablet device.

The T-Mobile service is a whole other review. Honestly these very expensive phones are great but break very easy and then brings you to tears to get a new one. Its funny how it became USELESS after having the phone 13 months after the 1 year warranty. Weird, isn't it? Tomorrow I am getting a blackberry from Boost Mobile and if it breaks I am only out 160, it still is money but not a half of a grand... I mean it was my high school graduation gift but my mom is more upset than me because she paid for it. Very disappointed HTC, you charge so much but yet make your phones so cheap. This will probably be the best phone I ever will have but it really didn't last. Oh, I forgot to mention I treated it like my baby. Never dropped it, never took it in bathroom when showering (steam), NOTHING! So it definitely wasn't my fault. Not a scratch on it, its just a very expensive paperweight now.
