This phone has all the features, very high tech but also very easy to use, its well made, fast (as fast as any 3G phone) and tough. I pay the same 45 bucks a month for service, unlimited talk, text and web ect....no contract. I love that this phone is water and dust resistant. With three kids that is a must! It has gps and books, who needs a separate gps or kindle when you can have this? You can quickly download apps from the app store on this, and delete them. It comes with a 2 gig sd card so its all ready to go when you get it. The charger is great, works with a usb so you can charge it on your computer if you need to, or even get a little adapter for your car that they sell for 5 bucks at any gas station. No need to search around for an adapter to work with your phone jack. Have I mentioned I LOVE this phone. :)", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tough phone, nice programming.", "Author": "0rvodragon", "ReviewID": "R1Y7DN1M0IHT8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so I've this phone for nearly a month now, after switching out from my last net10 phone, the LG optimus net (aka Optimus 2). As far as I can tell, it is a vast improvement, especially over most of the Net10 android line. As far as durability goes, it is pretty tough; as it is commercialized, it can stand up to splashes of water as well as dirt and dust and a gorilla glass touchscreen against scratches, and with the outdoor-based apps like the compass and jogging path app, it is basically and android for the outdoors. It fits pretty well in my hand, which is nice since it's also not a giant like other phones are turning into. This was a nice surprise since when I saw it came with a front-facing camera, I thought it would be bulky. It comes with a nice 5 MP camera and a light, both of which working quite well. The comes the programming of the phone, with 1GHZ processor, making it a pretty quick device, with only the Samsung Galaxy Proclaim matching it in processing speed. Now, of course, it doesn't match against the Net10 heavy hitters (which are nearly twice as much in cost). Then there are the little tricks this phone hides; one widget actually shows the apps you use the most. Meanwhile, and I just found this out, you know those three or four different home screens you never use, or the times when you didn't have enough room for more apps on your home screens? Well with the Defy, you can create up to nine home screens you really need or delete those home screens you don't use. The graphics are nice and flamboyant and everything pretty much runs nice and orderly. It even has the last 4 apps you used in the flip down menu, just in case you need them again. These little things seem to make the phone say \"Do you still need this?\" or \"Should I prepare Kindle for you?\" If you can spare the expense on this phone, especially with the great deal on Amazon, this phone is perfect and will last you a while.EDIT: Ok, no matter what I say next, I still think this phone has earned five stars. Ok, so after playing some app games like angry birds and cut the rope, I noticed my phone actually slowing down and turning into a miniature sun in my hand. Apparently what happens is, at least from my understanding, is that with all other apps you need a app game will actually slow it down a lot with its complex data, such as the physics engine behind the game as well as the graphics and cinematics, which in any video game need to be updated every millisecond. However, this causes the phone to heat up quite quickly and usually freezes, or make the toolbar disappear, taking away your phone app, browser app, and the button to take you to all your other apps. The trick is to reset the phone and let it cool down so it can get its head straight. Now you may be asking, what's the point of an android if it can't play games. Answer? I have found out that emulators work great for this game, allowing you to play hundreds of gameboy video games or other video games on the android. It does get hot, but not nearly as hot as with app games, and since these games are probably a lot longer, story driven (and free), they easily help to replace app games for me. Every other app still works, including Ultra Beat Hazard, the only app game that works with the Defy that I have found. I still love this phone and it still works great for me.RE-EDIT: Okay, so while the games do still overheat the phone, I found out that the toolbar does disappear on occasion, and not just from over heating. This is, however, just a hiccup in the programming. Because the phone can switch the main screen to go sideways, the toolbar will actually orientate with the phone. When the toolbar disappears, then, I can just turn the phone sideways, turn it right-side up, and thus the toolbar reappears.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone but only works on the Sprint Network", "Author": "Rodger Goleman", "ReviewID": "R3QSSHLEU0M37Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is nice, but I could not use it after activation. The bars were blocked and I couldn't make or receive calls. I was able to use it with my home wi-fi connection so that's a plus. After 2 hours on the phone with Net 10 trying to trouble shoot the phone and trying to find out why I couldn't use it, I found out that the phone only works in areas with Sprint Towers. I would recommend the phone, but only if you live in an area that provides Sprint service.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible service -- good phone when I can use it", "Author": "Katie Birkey", "ReviewID": "R8G5IL52TJ9ZY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone has good features, runs decently enough, no complaints about anything except... reception.  There is only one place in my house where this phone works, and this week I learned that when the sky is very cloudy/foggy, even that one spot doesn't work.  We do not live in a rural area, and we are just minutes away from the interstate.  Even so, this phone reception is terrible.  Calls are always dropping, or sometimes they cannot even be made.  I learned just a little too late that it is unwise to purchase a phone that uses Sprint towers.  My husband got a different Straight Talk phone that uses Verizon towers (a Samsung), and it is awesome.  He has full bars when I have none.  I am currently saving up for a different phone.  If you can find a phone that uses Verizon towers, then Straight Talk is a really great option.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola-DEFY-", "Author": "Brian W.

I was scared I wouldn't get good service on this phone, but I took a plunge and tried it and I'm sooooo glad I did!  I LOVE THIS PHONE!  Even more so because it's water resistant and pretty tough.  I get great signal (even on one bar or no bars I can send texts and make phone calls)So for everyone...THIS PHONE RUNS ON SPRINT TOWERS...if you aren't getting decent service it's probably because Sprint doesn't have great reception in your area.  It's the 2.3 Gingerbread andriod system version but honestly, it doesn't bother me.  I don't think the phone is slow or disappointing it works great for me.  The battery life is pretty good on the phone, I can usually use it up to a full 24hrs before having to charge it.Now for the cons, I don't particularly care for the keyboard you use to text with, the keys are kinda of small (even for my small hands) and I usually mess up spelling.  The phone storage isn't very good, and I don't particularly like how I listen to the music on my phone.  There's three different programs on the phone to be able to listen to music and after updating the pre-installed apps on my phone Play Music wanted to charge me after 30days.  Music+ keeps telling me everytime I open it it will charge me data use.  The other app I can listen to music from is MediaSee but that doesn't have my music in order so it takes awhile to find what I'm looking for and I can't really figure out how to set a song as my ringtone...yet.But overall, very very good phone.  I'm extremely happy with it, and the cons...completely able to deal with it.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Be careful as the plans are falsely advertised herein", "Author": "davlippo", "ReviewID": "R1MEMFREJSVWY7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The 30-Day Monthly Plans are NOT all accurate. I bought(2)of these phones based on their information that I could buy 750, 500 or 200 minute plans for $25/$30/$15 just exactly like any NET10 phone on the planet. It's advertised on NET10's web site for plans as low as $15/month and Amazon simply cut-and-pasted their information herein. When the phones arrived I then discover that I have to pay for \"unlimited\" minutes only and need $90 for service per month. That's a bunch of bull that us common folks that want a nice smart phone are made to pay contract level pricing. That defeats the whole purpose for the popular pay-as-you-go concept. We're back to using our \"dumb\" phones and I pay about $15/month for both phones which is all that is necessary for us but the false info. was really disappointing. We returned our phones to Amazon for a full refund. I did call NET10 to confirm and they would not activate our phones without the \"unlimited\" minutes but they clearly advertise 750/500/200 30 day plans as low as $15 but never mention that these are not applicable for the Defy XT NET10 phone.
