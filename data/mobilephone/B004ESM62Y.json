No bars at all for a month, I couldn't even call 911 if I wanted to, after that month I switched carriers. The customer service was totally unhelpful. I had emailed and called them more than once and they could not explain to me why I was not getting any service and they didn't refund my money back for that month. I went on facebook and a ton of other people were having the same experience. I went to their website several times and on their coverage map it showed that I had service even though I didn't. I feel sorry for people who order an expensive phone through Boost Mobile, thinking that their coverage map is accurate only to find out that they don't have and service.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "FAST SHIPPING REAL CARD.", "Author": "corey miller", "ReviewID": "R5TD66FCFUKGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got my card in like 2 days this is legit. its way overpriced but it is legit and did come in", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "just go to the boost online site,,,,", "Author": "Chris Rubio", "ReviewID": "R3M5ZABYXTGOHU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know why I paid soooo\u00f4 much for something I could have bought for 50 so take my word", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "laverne", "Author": "1112", "ReviewID": "R1IZJFQTBI4HZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[[ASIN:B004ESM62Y Boost Mobile $50.00 Reboost Refill Card]Be detailed and specific.
