Mine used one but I didn't need to use a sim card after I had S T set this one up for me ....

BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE.. It works better than my Nokia E5 and that is a nice phone also....Sure with it being used there were apps on there I didn't want... Yes, there are Verizon apps that don't want to be removed, however, this does not hurt the phones ability to be a terrific phone.... I love the camera, video, texting, internet, all of it ! .... I have absolutely no complaints with this phone at all....The best part about this phone is that I have a MUCH stronger signal with this Verizon phone using it with Straight Talk than I had using a Straight Talk phone.....This is a wonderful phone.... Oh my goodness I almost forgot... Some might find me a bit \"nerdy\" here but I really love the speaker use to type up a text to send...... I am still learning what this phone has to offer me and I love it ! !I do suggest that you use a stylus ( not the one with the pointed end but the soft squishy end ) AND use a static cover over the face ...  There is a help app that is marvelous in the menu and I also downloaded the manual onto my laptop....

Endress", "ReviewID": "R324PLFCMA6SGD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Maybe you saw the original version of this review. If you did, forget everything you read, because in the few months between then and now, this phone has taken a disastrous nosedive.Here's the deal: Lots of electronics these days, they're made to break. I was hoping that this one was an exception, but after a few months of gentle use and great care, I have been entirely disappointed.I won't make a grocery list of glitches and crashes, it'd take far too long. Just know that if you go into this thinking \"But I just want it for X feature\", you'll probably be disappointed. My cell signal is weak compared to other phones with the same company. The battery life is painfully weak. Buttons to call your contacts just don't respond. Occasionally, text fields will ignore all input, making it impossible to type anything, anywhere, until you reboot - which takes a weirdly long time. The wallpaper doesn't even stay up. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Don't even get me started on apps - native, purchased, downloaded, they crash all the same.This phone's strongest selling point is the Google Play Store, which is expansive, reasonably-priced, and very secure. However, that comes with any Droid, and if you are looking into the Droid OS, don't let this discourage you - I hear wonderful things about other Droid phones. But this isn't the one for you. And mind, this isn't just one buggy phone. Many reviewers agree with me, including my own sister, who got the phone at the same time I did and is struggling just as much.Bottom line: I'm surprised this thing ever reached shelves. A stain on Motorola and Android, both of which are generally far superior to this piece of work.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "New?  Really?", "Author": "Lise", "ReviewID": "R1U7V0KPD33OOT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update:  Motorola is willing to honor warranty and repair phone at no charge based on proof of purchase date.First, the phone did not come with the car charger as advertised.  Since it was a replacement phone, I didn't worry about it.  The booklet and warrenty information that is in the box with all new phones was missing.  Also not a big deal as I was relacing the same type of phone.  Now, after 89 days, the phone screen has turned to a gazillion speckles.  All attempts to 'reset' the phone have failed.So, if you have $250 to spend on a phone every 90 days, this is the phone for you.Amazon stated their 30 return policy and told me to contact the manufacturer for warrenty.  It would be great if I had the warrenty information which was missing fron the box.  I am left without a phone, unable to purchase another, no warrenty information, and relying on the charity of Motorola to hopefully make this right...if indeed it is really a NEW phone.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible phone", "Author": "Eric V", "ReviewID": "R1CUS24W1KAOZ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All I can think is that the quality control on this phone was horrible. Maybe some of them work the way they are supposed to, but apparently a lot don't. My wife has a Droid 3 and I now have little faith in this phone, Motorola, or Verizon. If you look around the web you will find a large number of people are having the same problems with the Droid 3. It turns off for no reason. It accesses the web, texts, and allows phone calls when it chooses. It has a hard time keeping power (beyond normal cell phone battery issues). She just turned her second one in and we're waiting on the box with her third one. It looks like Motorola messed up....but other than redistributing refurbished phones that have the same flaws they don't seem to be able to fix the problem.

It fits really well in my hand. The keyboard is one of my favorite things about this phone. Easy to use and very responsive.

I was super psyched about being able to use apps and mobile data and what not.The best feature overall is the physical QWERTY keyboard. If I had the option, this would be on all of my smartphones. However, there's an issue with the design in this keyboard. The track on the keyboard that extends and retracts from the screen is fairly thin (there are two) and can become damaged. What happens is it forms a behavior on how it feels like closing after a while and requires you to push one end of the phone before the other end, otherwise one track will trigger while the other is stuck.One serious con about this phone is that it is outdated. The processor on this generation of Droid cannot meet the expectations of the apps that are in the market today. I would frequently use my phone for nothing but texts and calls, and apps would run in the background without my knowledge and slow the phone to a halt and thus be infuriating. The only way to restart the phone would be to remove the battery which, in the end, would cause software damage and data corruption.Don't get me wrong, the look and feel of the phone is wonderful. If you're not looking to use this phone for many, many apps, then by all means please buy this phone. But whatever you do, do not put a case on the phone as the case will misalign the track on the phone and cause future anguish. For me, I dropped my phone once and it was never the same.TL;DR (too lazy, didn't read) - I gave this a 3/5 simply because of the phone track on the keyboard being easily misaligned and the processor being too old to handle current generation apps.

It took a while for the Forwarding company (JAC). The weather has currently, been bad here in the Philippines. I guess that's one of the reasons why it took almost 2 weeks to get it here.Let's get on with the Phone. It's my first Android Phone, I mean really. Not a big fan of high end phones, though I've had my fair experiences with the Apple part. The reason why I had to buy this phone was because of the Fact that it's cheap and it's a side slide qwerty keyboard phone.I was quite feeling vexed for the Phone while I was waiting for it. As I was reading reviews and such, I was anxious about the Phone, thinking that I might get a badly used phone. When the confirmation for pickup came, I had to rush off during lunch from the Office, picked up the Package and back. Once I opened the phone, I was surprised that the Phone is in a somehow great, condition. There were some minor things coming from the Phone like the Dent on the lower right side and some scratches on the bezel over the upper right. I guess the Phone took a fall on its side. The screen display state is great, the phone had a flimsy film covering the display when I got it, though it could've been placed by the Seller itself. I have no issues over the back cover.I've read a lot while waiting for the Phone. Issues like the Phone heats up over the lower back portion, phone hangs up or restarts. Short battery life? and other things. The issues for me are the overheating and the short battery life. Bloatware coming from the stock rom of the Phone was cleaned up by rooting and installing a custom rom for it. Which also did help the battery life somehow. While for the Overheating, I've had that toned down a bit by underclocking the cpu. It did lessen the Heat over the back portion while playing games. I'm on the process of doing an undervolting which I'm still trying to figure out how to do.Current state of the Phone right now is great, though I wish that the Battery life would extend for up to 2-3 days. No hangs has ever occurred, there were some slowing at times but it was tolerable.Undervolting should ease the Heating issue over the back portion once I figured out the guide. Will be buying a new battery as well to go with the phone.It's a great phone for me (will be buying another one for my Girl). Thanks to the Seller for giving me an above average used phone. Though I never got an original wall charger and a usb connector (just got generic ones along the package), still, thanks.For those who are interested, do the things below and you have a nice phone:- Buy a new battery or an extended battery if you are buying a used/refurbished phone.- Root and Flash the Phone with a custom Rom to remove the bloatware from the Stock rom and improve battery life.  - Do not use an ICS rom as I've been reading. I had mine installed with Steel Droid.- Do an Undervolt - overclock/underclock if you know how to.- buy a case and a screen protector to go with the display.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Some problems here and there but Its Great", "Author": "Brianna Davis", "ReviewID": "R1SW2RN032AUZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's has its problems and I ordered a new one and I got a used but it looks new.Troubleshooting and Application foreclose is always happening but I can not complain better than my other phone that I hadI love Droids, better than iphone's in my opinion", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "re: Motorola Droid 3 phone and shipping", "Author": "J C Utter", "ReviewID": "RKAT0JEMYBWD4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is almost exactly like the one it replaced (due to being lost).

When I was able to, I upgraded to a Droid 3, hoping for everything that I loved but with an 8 MP camera instead of a 5.The camera improved, but pictures with flash are still pretty bad.  (My camera and an iphone taking the same photo- iphone will have VASTLY better photos.)The things that drives me crazy is the GPS. It rarely works - maybe 10-15% of the time that I want to use my GPS.  However, most of the time it just says that it's searching for GPS for turn-by-turn directions. However, it's somehow able to locate where I am and give me written directions. I've done everything I can think of and searched the web for fixes, but to no avail. Verizon sent me a new one, with the same problems.The other problem is the keyboard. The Droid 2/3/4 are the only verizon smartphones with slideout keyboard and I can't stand touch screen typing.  Droid 2 worked great, but Droid 3 has keys that are constantly sticking. I thought maybe it was just my first Droid 3, but the replacement Verizon sent has the same problem. Some keys I have to hit either super hard or 3-4 times to register. It's not consistent so sometimes I hit a key and it works first try and other times it takes 3-4 attempts. End result is that typing can take a LONG time.I also have the bugs others have mentioned where it will randomly restart or freeze on me.  However, those are usually fixed pretty easily and quickly, unlike the keyboard and GPS issues that are ongoing.I don't know what to do and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for almost another year. I gave my Droid 2 to a friend or I'd be tempted to throw this one away and go back to the Droid 2.  My boyfriend recently got the Droid 4 and the issues I don't like with the 3 seem to be fixed. It's weird because the Droid 2 worked great.  My guess is that they tried to do some cost-saving measures with the 3, realized they didn't meet ANY quality standards and then fixed them with Droid 4.

And it has only got worse over the years. Part of it is the bloatware that comes loaded on it, but even after a full factory reset, it's still too slow. Apps crash frequently without warning too.The keyboard, which I wanted initially, is not that great. It too can be slow and unresponsive. I have grown to love others' floating keyboards since they're much better than Droid 3's. Battery life, which was decent at the start, has progressively got worse too.Also, it has an annoying habit of randomly turning off - If I am lucky I hear the \"Droid\" robotic-voice when it does that though. Hopefully I wasn't needing the alarm-clock if it turns itself off!Also, it is heavy. I didn't think much of it at first, but compared to my wife's previous HTC Android phone and her current iPhone, this Droid 3 is a brick (house!).

Don't be fooled, it say HD camera and whatever but the pictures are horrible!Lastly, my friends and family have said to me my voice sounds fuzzy when I use this phone.Just so I'm not to mean, this is my first smart phone so it is very convient.  But I'm assuming all smart phones are convient. Also, it has a GPS which is wonderful so I don't have to buy something seperate.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Nikki", "ReviewID": "R2O1EOP38VLR61", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first I really loved this phone.  After a while of having it, it lags something terrible, and every time I want to make a call with my phone, I push the call button and I have to wait for my phone to decide to make the call.  Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to actually start dialing and if I push the button more than once, it will call however many times I push the button.  My step-daughter, my husband and myself all have this phone, we all have the same problems.  I was stuck with this phone for 2 years before I was eligible for my upgrade.

Take it for what its worth but I've had thid phone for six months and would never own another droid of any kind.  The OS is unstable, reboots constantly, freezes, and shakes. They will send you another one if you're still under warranty like I was but guess what, you will receive another refurbished Droid that someone else sent back with the same issues.I like the idea of the integration with gmail and google apps but its just not worth it, especially when you can still do the same things with an Iphone.  I stayed away from the Iphone for years because of the hype and price but I decided to give it a shot and the difference is night and day.  You get what you pay for.  The OS is quick, compact and very nice to look at and use.  Not clunky like the droid.  Its Iphones for me from now on.
