So I gave this HTC phone a try. It has everything I need in a phone. qwerty, wi-fi, 3G, way cheaper than BlackBerry and besides, taking pictures is sooo simple, just 1-click. it's unique, low-key phone that seems to last for a long time.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "HTC Snap!", "Author": "Chelly", "ReviewID": "R1QN1RXADLGJGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in dire need of a new phone! I had a Sony Ericsson Vivaz pro and the touch screen broke for no apparent reason! I needed an new phone ASAP. I did a bit of research and found this phone. I love love love the Window mobile system. The keys are nice and big, took some time getting use to but now its great. The trackball is smooth and fast. The battery life is AMAZING. Its a good phone, if you dont need any high tech apps and such. Even came in a fitting leather case!Cons: The camera could be better but eh, whatever. Wish they threw in a screen protector.Comparing with other phones around the same price, it is definitely a winner for me.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Buy!", "Author": "Erin M. Moncur", "ReviewID": "R3F1QXK0O177ZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually read the product reviews before I purchase anything online, and I must say that the most of the previous reviews were absolutely right. I had no problem with Sim card compatibility (I am not residing in the U.S. - I just popped it in and bing, I had service) and the wi-fi is absolutely fabulous. Another good thing was that it arrived within two days and was properly packaged. It is brand new!As for the other features, the keys are big, the screen is an optimal size, the sound is clear, and the phone is extremely light weight. It is taking me some time to get adjusted to the features and the functions of the phone, but the manual is really easy to understand and other relevant information can be found online. For the price I paid, I must say that I got more than expected. Great buy!!!", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone", "Author": "kamrul", "ReviewID": "R3T353PXA97MJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought two of these at 139.99 and damn it went down $10. This phone has everything you need from qwerty key to wi-fi. It is a Windows Phone which has a downside (reason for 4 stars instead of 5). It will lag if you have to many applications open. It works like a Windows pc. It has a cpu and RAM memory. You have to go to task-manager often and make sure that only the apps you are using are open. Too many apps will definitely slow it down or even freeze it (in response to the person who gave a one star). Other than that, the calling quality, ease of texting, Wi-Fi, MS office apps, and PDF reader are awesome and I'm enjoying this phone.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not an HTC s521", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RK4I8ED9XJHUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for use on ATT network, It is actually a HTC Maple s520 according to the model number put into the phones description under settings. I like the phone alot minus one problem, picture messaging does not work, so if anyone who is savvy with cell phones and knows how to change mmsc codes, I could use the help.Update: Got ahold of HTC and they fixed my picture message problem, so if you live in the usa and are on att plan, once you get the right mmsc codes, the phone works fine, in fact this is the best phone Ive owned, the WIFI is quicker then I thought it would be, obviously not as fast as the droids, but you will pay alot more for a droid or any other new 3g/4g phone, Im pretty confident this phone will last me awhile. Received the phone fast, absolutely no complaints on amazons part, and would make this purchase again for sure.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent phone", "Author": "Eflan456", "ReviewID": "R1MKV0FF8CY947", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a decent phone, and the letters are much larger than that of a blackberry's. It's overall easy to use, has good battery life, however, the wifi internet is a pain to use. Text message retrieval can be a pain as well, because sometimes if you go back in a conversation by clicking \"older\", it'll stay stuck there and you have to keep going forward to the beginning of the message to see what's being said. It's easily remedied by deleting the convo and starting a new one with that person.The alarm clock is good. If you turn your phone on silent so no one will call you, the alarm clock will still work. Or if the phone is on vibrate. So no fear about accidentally setting the phone on silent and not waking for work.The camera isn't bad for the pixels, but don't expect HD quality. It's simply not the phone for it. The scroll button in the middle works well, and I haven't had a problem with it. I also have never had problems receiving texts or calls. Call clarity is WONDERFUL.Also, since it's a Windows OS, it's easy to sync up to your PC to put your own ringtones on, take pictures off of the phone, put music on it, etc. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, I would definitely get this phone. The unlocked international feature, with a warranty, is definitely worth it!", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's okay...", "Author": "Cassius", "ReviewID": "RSJTW77GXQPIZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone a couple months ago when mine dropped in the toilet. It arrived on time, and I was generally impressed with it. I like the fact that you are able to see both the sender and the receiver when viewing messages, unlike the Dash, where you have to flip back and forth between Inbox and Sentbox to read a text conversation. The scroll ball works nicely for the most part, but sometimes it freezes in one place and I have to scroll around for a few seconds to get it to work again. There are also plenty of Profiles available to customize the phone with, too.But! When I got the phone \"HTC\" was printed on the bottom of the back cover like it is shown in the picture. After a month of use it started to look a little distorted, so I rubbed it with my thumb a few times. Low and behold, the \"HTC\" was rubbed off and it now read \"WIND.\" I don't know what a \"WIND\" is, but I'm pretty sure it's not an HTC. I didn't really care that much because it's a phone, it works and I'm not a label junky. If you're looking specifically for an HTC, you probably shouldn't get this phone.There's one other thing I don't like about this phone. When I miss a call or if I get a voicemail, I get these weird text messages in my inbox. They look like codes for a layout or something, I don't know. I just delete them. Overall I am happy with my phone, and I'm glad nothing worse is wrong with it.

Didn't know what the problem was-- maybe because it is an international phone from New Zealand?!Anyways, I also read on a previous review that the wifi speed/operating system is a bit slow.. and it is slowwww and it does freeze.

Big upgrade! I got the phone in one day which was cool. The phone was actually the htc snap s-522 not the 520. I put my sim card in and it makes calls and sends text. Picture text are not working, and also for some reason the phone will not sync to att network for data; pics, & Internet which is a big problem. I own a small insurance business and internet is the key to staying in business. I called att and they were useless. I called htc and they have not been able to resolve my problem yet. Very frustrating. Att says call htc and htc has said to call att. Already wasted 3 hours trying to get this issue resolved. Leaving town for 2 weeks in less than 30 hours and no way to access email or process documents as needed.
