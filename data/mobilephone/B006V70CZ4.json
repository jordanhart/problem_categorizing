Darnell", "ReviewID": "RU1WRTBNFQ3O0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed a phone. I looked at their star rating and it was very good. Many many reviews on this company so I felt confident going in. I made the purchase on October 20th 2013 for a droid Verizon cell phone. I was fully aware that this was a refurbished phone. It came in a timely manner and looked great. I went into the Verizon store to get it all hooked up and was informed that it was broken. Apparently there is a little red dot indicator in the battery compartment when the phone has had liquid damage. This phone, in Verizon's words had been damaged by liquid. This should have been something observed by those refurbishing the telephone.Well, things happen I guess and I emailed the company. They are good at getting back to you via email. They sent me a label and I took that phone to the post office to return and lo and behold it wasn't a prepaid label, so I had to pay to send them back a broken phone and get insurance on it. I told them this via email and they said to send them the bill. WHAT? Why didn't they just give me a prepaid label to begin with????I received a replacement phone. Off to Verizon I went. The same guy helped me. He started the process and the phone came back as registered LOST OR STOLEN. WTF? Now isn't this the first thing a company should be looking for when refurbishing a phone?So I am pretty mad at this point, but for some ridiculous reason I gave them a third chance to make this right. They send it out and give me a tracking number. No phone. I check the tracking number and it says it was delivered. I am so mad I almost cry at this point. I go to the post office a total of three times. My gas. My time. Finally filling out a PS 10 (or something like that) which means, the phone has simply been lost or stolen in the mail. So now I guess I just want to cancel this whole stupid thing and get my money back. I have no phone and no money and I am pissed. The company now is not very sympathetic and has not apologized for this whole thing. So now, at the end of December (remember this started in October!), they give me a refund less $15 for a restocking fee. Now I am blowing my top. I had no idea they had to restock broken and stolen items (lost or stolen items) I called Amazon twice and they emailed the company on my behalf. They (Amazon) sent a letter that stated their standard \"$15 restocking fee\" . I told them I had every intention of filing an A-Z claim and that this company is downright awful, here are the reasons and I will not sit for them stealing $15 from me. Amazon, itself, reviewed everything and gave me the $15 as a good will gesture. This was a very stand up thing Amazon did, but Pacific Cellular did take the $15 from me.This was the worst experience I have ever had in online retail. I would never recommend this company.
