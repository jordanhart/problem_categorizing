{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A $19 LOCKED Phone With Very Limited Storage For Apps", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2CR0S7LTG5163", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "T-Mobile currently sells the Evolve for just $19 at T-Mobile's MetroPcs website and T-Mobile's neighborhood MetroPcs stores, a far lower price than the $80 price at T-Mobile mall stores.The version sold for T-Mobile is LOCKED to T-Mobile and the version sold for Metro is LOCKED to Metro. Both versions can be unlocked after 90 consecutive days of paid service. Third party vendors claiming to sell UN-locked Evolves buy LOCKED Evolves for $19 from MetroPcs and then resell them at higher prices with NO warranty.The Evolve is an okay phone for $19, but ONLY for those people who are willing to work VERY hard to manage the Evolve's tiny internal memory, which sharply limits the number and size of apps and games that can be installed.  If you do not keep at least 200 mb of open memory, the Evolve will stop working.The T-Mobile/MetroPcs 3G network is strong in very large cities, weak in many small cities and does NOT exist in most rural communities. Check your neighborhood on the coverage map on the MetroPcs website BEFORE buying.The Evolve can connect to wifi networks and use wifi to stream Netflix movies. Its 3G is not fast enough to stream video but 3G is fast enough to stream music from Pandora radio or Spotify.The four inch screen has good color and contrast but is not sharp enough to easily read small text. The Evolve's small size makes it comfortable in your hand and in your pocket. The soft touch coating provides a secure grip.The Evolve's tiny internal memory requires you to install a micro SD memory card on \"Day One\" and set that SD card as the default for storage. You must transfer large apps to the SD card and uninstall updates for the apps you never use and then disable those apps in the apps menu.You must keep AT LEAST 200mb of internal memory free for your phone to operate smoothly. The \"one star\" and \"two star\" ratings for the Evolve are the result of people not leaving enough open memory for the Evolve to work properly.The battery charge lasts only two or three hours if you are steaming Netflix videos or using the GPS to navigate. Keep wifi, 3G, Bluetooth and GPS turned off until you need them. Keep the screen brightness at the lowest possible setting indoors. Keeping wifi OFF, 3G OFF, Bluetooth OFF and GPS OFF enables you to get about 12 hours per charge including some texting, downloading email, and some short phone calls. Keep a charger at work and in your car for mid-day charging.The camera lacks a flash so it will struggle to take acceptable photos indoors but it takes okay, but not very sharp, photos outdoors in bright sunlight. On a rainy day, set the camera's light balance to \"cloudy\" and lock the ISO at 200 for \"okay\" photos.You can double available internal memory and double battery life by disabling bloatware on your Evolve. Go to \"settings\", \"apps\", and then \"all apps\". For each app, uninstall updates, uncheck notifications, then check \"disable\". If decide later to use an app, you can check \"enable\". The useless apps include: Android wallpaper, Black Hole, Bubbles, Face Unlock, Hangouts, Live Wallpapers, Movie Studio, Music Wallpaper, Phase Beam, My Metro, My T-Mobile, Swype Keyboard, Talk Back, Word Clock, Chrome Browser, Google Books, Google+ (Google Plus), Google Games, Google Magazines, Google Movies, and Picassa Uploader.These apps clog your memory and several will run even when you are sleeping to drain your battery. Remove or disable them on \"Day One\".Bottom Line: MetroPCS and T-Mobile have better phones if you plan to spend $100 for a phone. If you want a $19 phone, the Evolve is an acceptable choice.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "What do you want for fifty bucks!", "Author": "JRW", "ReviewID": "R35GRNHFS9CBS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone works well with a T-mobile pay by the minute plan sim card.You can use wifi most of the time and go with SKYPE or google Voice.When necessary this 3g phone works well.The camera is not great but it gets the job done when needed.Contrary to a lot of reviews I find the display pretty good.I purchased this phone at discount (including a starter sim card) for $49.00", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD BACK-UP!!!", "Author": "fresh", "ReviewID": "RNZ7T8BP6S568", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a very good back-up phone.

It doesn't have flash light (thus neither does have a flashlight).  The battery discharges so quick when using WiFi.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "Mathew", "ReviewID": "RNE5NB26NZ7KH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone does everything I ask of it.  I use it as an mp3 player, camera, and phone.  I also use it to check email, watch youtube videos, and store some files among other things.  This camera does all of that and more without a problem.  But you do get what you pay for and here is what you are sacrificing by paying less. 1. Battery life could be a little better.  I haven't ran out of battery yet, but I only use the phone a couple of times a day, and don't really play games on it.  If you like to play games and do a lot of stuff, the battery will run out faster. You can also turn off the wifi and bluetooth, and lower the screen brightness, as well as close apps to save battery. 2. The camera takes satisfactory images.  I expected the camera to be worse that it actually was, but it was actually alright. The only problem is shooting at night because there is no flash, but no big deal. 3. Games that require a fast processor might be slower.  I tried GTA Vice City on the phone and it ran pretty good.  I haven't played many games on the phone but if GTA works, it can't be too bad. 4. The phone doesn't have much internal memory, so having a micro sd card ready is pretty necessary if you want to install more apps. but the micro sd cards are pretty cheap these days.Here are some positives1. The phone is relatively cheap2. There are a bunch of apps available in the Google Play store3. The camera is good, but there is no flash4. The mp3 player sounds good, and does everything I ask of it5. Youtube videos looks very good. I don't need a super high def screen on my phone.6. The built in speaker is loud. Plugging in headphones sound good too.7. You can use the wifi to surf the web and make calls over wifi.Like most phones, I would also buy a cover because I don't want to test it's durability.  I have also heard that some peoples phones run slow.  My guess is that they don't know how to close apps running in the background.  If you do, it's easy, and the phone should run fine.Overall this phone runs good compared to phones that cost hundreds more. It may not be blazing fast, or have a super hd camera, but it works fine as a phone, mp3 player, camera, and web browser, and it can run the apps that any more expensive phones can.  In my opinion, this is all you need in a smart phone", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone for better price", "Author": "fabian1986b", "ReviewID": "R2TMZETJ2PQ1AZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone have good features for great price im happy with the phone android 4.1 3g network  5 mp i love it", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "my son's smile", "Author": "Sidney Taylor", "ReviewID": "R1MS0TGXRRD0QF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son love his Alcatel one Evolve phone....

It was what I could afford The battery life is terrible about as bad as the Samsung Dart. By the time I get to Lower Manhattan from Brooklyn I need to use my Burro charger or find a plug! If I don't turn it off while using the portable charger it doesn't charge. The lag time on this phone makes trying to do anything a real drag. So I schedule things using my  old blackberry. I wouldn't suggest this phone to anyone as a primary phone it's probably ok as a backup I guess I would have come out better buying a used or refurbished phone from Amazon or Craigslist.. If you are outside  say at  the park you can't really see the screen unless you put your arm over to provide shade. If you  turn up the screen  brightness seems  the battery life is even shorter. No flash and lousy pictures its 5Mp but its awful  and hard to find covers and I live in NYC!! This phone is thicker  than most model phones now adays even cheap phones. Its about as heavy as The Concorde T Mobile use to offer  it does not take good pictures but the front facing camera is 99% better than the back.

Little did I know that, for whatever reason, Alcatel disables LogCat on this thing. Android developers will recognize that as the means by which a developer gets messages from a running application so that its operation can be examined and debugged. I've worked with a number of Android phones and tablets and never had this issue before, and I can't imagine why Alcatel would do that, given that they left the other developer/debug features intact as far as I can tell. It's a real inconvenience. There may be workarounds but rather than invest the time to investigate them, I'll likely just send this phone back and just get one that doesn't have the problem.
