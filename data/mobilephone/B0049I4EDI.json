{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Smartphone Available", "Author": "techno", "ReviewID": "R39HJRS7CUMJBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Trophy with Windows Phone 7.5 has everything that you would need on a Smartphone.  I use it mostly for business connected to Exchange 2010 which makes it the best dual capabilities smartphone for business and leisure.  The sound system is amazing and the pictures are sharp and clean.  Having native Lync and SharePoint is a HUGE advantage over the clunky droid and iphone.  Calls on Trophy are crisp and clear and never dropped calls.  Battery last a reasonable time for Smartphones and browsing the internet with IE9 is lightning fast.  The People hub is amazing and easy to add contacts or groups.  Local Scout is really a nice feature.  It quickly finds ALL the restaurants, shops and other places of interest in our city and when we travel.  There are so many other nice features with this phone. We liked the phone so much that my wife bought a Trophy as well.  She loves it and uses it also as a dual purpose Smartphone.  We would highly recommend the Trophy to anyone that wants to replace their droid or iphone.  Or even as a first time Smartphone buyer.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "say NEVER to iPhone", "Author": "I.

Although not all apps are available on it, the windows app marketplace offers many, similar, and better apps for nearly every need.

No regrets so far. It does what I need and much much more. Intuitive, nice looking, feels like a quality product. Not as many unnecessary bells and whistles as my wife's Android. Who needs all those options? Home screen is simple and shows everything you choose to see (emails, texts, vm, weather, photos) at a glance. No accidental calls like my last phone. Keyboard is a little small but my typing gets better over time.I like having a phone not every has. Was quite reasonably priced in 3g form from Verizon online store. Can easily turn off data or wifi to save battery. Camera and video good enough to replace a digital camera for everyday needs. Apps store not huge but how many do you really need?Would highly recommend this phone and Windows platform in general.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review for the HTC Trophy", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1IGNS93DX9J9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this smartphone. Microsoft really outdid themselves with Windows Phone 7. It performs nicely and is rather enjoyable to use. The animations are always smooth and the phone is rarely sluggish. My only real problem with WP7 is that it doesn't have as nearly as many apps as Android of iOS, but for me that's not a huge problem since the apps I use most are for social connectivity (FB) and music. As for the hardware, this is my first HTC phone, and I will definitely try to stick to HTC in the future. The touchscreen is excellent, and the hardware in general gives this phone good, smooth performance. The battery life with the default battery if generally good (I could get in about a full day, if not a bit more), the 3g and wifi is pretty much run of the mill, the camera, while not great, does take decent photos if you try. The phone, while not having any really unique features, is a good phone in general and I would definitely recommend HTC and WP7 after having this for about a year.Pros:+Windows Phone 7+HTC Hardware+Generally good performance, enjoyable to useCons:-Lack of apps-Lacks any unique features (ie 4g, high res camera)Overall: If you are interested in a Windows Phone, I definitely recommend.Note: If you want better battery life, I would recommend the Mugen Power 1800mAH ext. battery for the Trophy. It's a bit pricey, but you will see improve battery life.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC 7 Trophy T8686 Windows Phone 7", "Author": "Taran", "ReviewID": "R1YKOQHA4S832G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC. it seems to be brand new, its a Voda Phone unlocked though it seems to be brand new, the phone is fast responsive and looks stylish, the Windows 7 Phone OS works great there is everything I need although people complain that the apps are limited.

Its getting very frustrating, old and tiresome that when you go to a website that offers an app, very few if any have an app for windows 7 or 8.  I have a nike fuelband and a gopro and would love to use them with windows but cant because an app is not provided.  Its the same for every website and or product offered.  NO APPS.I really like the windows operating system and the HTC phone.  Was cool to be the only one at work with it a year ago.  Microsoft promised to open doors and make headways in the market but have failed, now im stuck in a two year contract with a phone that is useless.

I now know why apple and windows fans love their phones and tell me it's all about the operating system.  everything runs so smoothly on this phone i can't believe it.  it is so FAST! I JUST CAN'T COMPLIMENT THIS PHONE ENOUGH! the messaging looks and feels awesome. the live tiles, lock screen, the apps (yes the apps) are awesome.  the live tiles are what made me want to try windows in the first place. now that i have this phone i love the live tiles soooo much more than those dead icons. i don't know who came up with this concept but they deserve a raise.  facebook is all integrated and easier to navigate than on my android app. did i mention how smooth and fast moving around on this phone is?  i can go somewhere and set the camera to automatically download my pics to facebook or somewhere else - cool. my favorite app right now is the garmin app. yes google maps are free and a great program but this app is just plain easier to use and easier to navigate with. calls are clear, my bluetooth works perfectly with this phone. i can play my musin louder on this phone than my commando but not as loud as on my ipod nano touch.now the less than perfection:battery life is only ok.  my solution is to buy an aftermarket 3500 mah battery to more than double the current battery life.the camera is nowhere near as good as the iphone but on par with my casio commando.the youtube app is just a link to the mobile site. the android app is better. don't know if this is a google thing or what but i just liked the android app better.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I've Had Yet", "Author": "Jeskiska \"First-timer\"", "ReviewID": "R2UDVVD03AWK14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I jumped into the smartphone in April 2009 with the Blackberry Storm.
