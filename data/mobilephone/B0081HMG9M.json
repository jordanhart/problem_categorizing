{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Revelation.", "Author": "Carlos Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "RA2SRGCI3F2QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Today August 2 i have been using the phone for over 40 days, i bought it from this page but from seller ipadsimshop.wow! 1.5Ghz Dual Core for this price? 1GB RAM, 16GB ROM, microSD slot, super AMOLED screen? YES PLEASE! double checked with the seller to be sure that a mistake wasn't being made and BAM! the price dropped to 199$, bought it in a blink.The phone lived to my expectations and exceeded them. the first thing you notice is that it is very solid and slimmer than what the pics suggest, once turned on immediately fell in love with the screen, beautiful colors and blacks are black, side by side the screen displays better colors than a galaxy s2, very crisp text and details. The phone is SO fast that it puts to shame the iphone 4 too, according to the benchmarks is even faster than the galaxy note. The camera is great in outdoors, everybody praises the pictures it produces but once you are in a low light environment prepare to be disappointed, that could have been improved.Battery life: if you have never owned a smartphone you are going to be terribly dissapointed, if you come from another smartphone you'll be happy with it, if you come from a blackberry you are going to love it. Once you adjust your mind to turn off unnecesary things you'll have a good full day of battery, 4G LTE Radio is a power hog.My config: installed APN switch from google play store, didn't update google maps (important), switched off gps in the power management widget, DONE! Screen is at 100%, wifi always ON. About 16+h battery life everyday, i spend 8+ hours in wifi coverage. for that i installed wifi buddy that lets me force wifi always on even if phone is lockedPROS:-SPEED!-Screen-Size, 4.0 inches. makes one handed operation comfortable, i have big hands-wow factor, everybody asks for it and all my friends love it-PRICE , competes with 350-500$ range of phones-build quality-apps are always running, never kill themselvesCONS:-4G consumes too much battery-no smart dialing in phone, like T9 predictive search in directory, you have to click search and type the name.-Mediocre low light pictures, the good thing is that it takes'em very fast-Loudspeaker not very loud, trying to play a song in a crowded area? Don't-no dedicated camera button, not really an issue.-Screen is glass but not gorilla glass, metal can scratch it***UPDATE: march 11 2013, 8 months after my original review i still like this phone a lot. not planning on getting anything newer anytime soon. Travelled to Europe, no problems there, fast GPS lock saved me from unneeded expensive cab fares many times, Worked fine in Kenya, Brazil and Chile too with prepaid sims. I dropped it accidentally in a toilet in Santiago de Chile's airport and it survived. It has fallen many times from my ears height (1,85m) and it still works perfectly.The battery life with 3G/4G cellular data is still my only gripe with this phone. in wifi coverage it barely uses power. I would complain about the camera too but not at this price, its ok for casual day to day shots, for travels i take my full featured camera anyway.I updated it to android 4.0 ICS and the battery life noticeably improved but i found out the phone was using lower clocks to save battery, the phone is slower while idling and it takes time for it to wake up from an idle state, a quick fix i found was to disable onscreen animations. I really don't see a meaningful difference from android 2.3,- cosmetic uplift makes you feel updated.- added the predictive search in directory while dialing, yay!- The camera improved a little in the dark- the rest is just mehI Bought an anker 5600mah power pack here and it fits in the same pocket with the phone while extending my power well beyond 48h of use.i hope the update helps", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super fast, responsive phone", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R3C5I4ZJRDSDYZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My impressions so far about this phone: it's impressively fast with absolutely no lag at all, and doesn't even pause to catch it's breath with Netflix.The screen looks beautiful, just like a Nexus s, where the colors pop out of the screen. wouldn't expect any less since both the nexus s and the burst have a super amoled screen.The battery seems to be draining fast though, but I've been using the screen in full brightness and the keyboard on haptic feedback.The keyboard is accurate and the screen responsive. the four capacitive Android buttons are responsive at the first touch. I've had phones that take several tries.the earphone volume in the pantech burst is very, very low which is a let down, but so far is the only complain I have aside from the battery drain.edit 1: been playing Homerun battle 2 and it played without a hiccup. It's a graphics intensive game, wich tells me the GPU is good. This game is no solitaire or chess with lame graphics.

Bonnett", "ReviewID": "R1XYDW6C1UOLQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually didn't buy this on Amazon, but I did buy it recently and I think the previous reviewers did a good job but I'd like to do a review of my own from a more tech side, not saying the others did not but a few key points were missed.Pros:It's fast, it has a 1.5Ghz Dual Core Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 CPU. For those of you wondering what that means, the latest CPU out in the $500 phone range is the S4, so it's only 1 generation behind.5MP Rear camera that takes pretty good pictures, and a VGA front shooter. Most phones with this price only have 1 camera, and the rear camera has a LED for flash.1GB of RAM. Though that doesn't sound like much with today's 2GB, my Galaxy Nexus only has 1 and it does very well with it.4G. Not just HSPA+, but full blown LTE.Adreno 220 GPU. This is the same Graphics chip that the SGS2 and Galaxy Note uses, so it can handle games well.ICS. Something that wasn't mentioned, this ships with Android 2.3.5 (Gingerbread) but has a Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwhich) OTA update waiting for you.16GB of Storage. Doesn't sound like much, but it also has a microSD card slot, something that a lot of new phones don't have.And of course price. With all these pros, this phone is about half of what you think you'd pay for it off contract.Cons:It's plastic. So are a lot of phones out there, it makes them cheaper for the manufacturer and lighter for the consumer but I personally like a heavier device.Battery. As mentioned before, this doesn't have horrible battery but it doesn't have anything impressive either. It has a 1650 mAh battery and it can last awhile but don't plan on not charging this overnight.Camera. It's not bad, but don't plan on replacing your point and shoot with this.Let me also mention that despite the camera being on my cons, the ICS upgrade helps a lot by adding a batter software to the optics. I would suggest this over and over if you're looking for a good phone without being stuck on a contract or if you're wanting a premium phone to use with AT&Ts; GoPhone service.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like the phone, but some negatives", "Author": "Scouty", "ReviewID": "R6FRVSOWSHC4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is fantastic for the price! The only cons are the call quality isn't as good as expected. It doesn't drop calls, but sometimes I sound muffled to the person I'm talking to. If I hold it on my right shoulder, the caller says I sound like I'm far away. The only other problem is battery life. I researched many phones before I purchased this one, and basically most smart phones for this price and higher don't have fantastic battery life. I can use it all day, talking, browsing, and texting. I usually charge it overnight, which is typical.The screen looks fantastic, and I haven't had a problem loading any sites or videos. Has a 4G connection, which works great. It's fast and looks great.The camera is a phone camera; it doesn't take amazing pictures. It works for an everyday camera. Daytime pictures look good. It doesn't, however, take good pictures in the dark.For the price, this phone was worth it. I use it on Straight Talk's sim program, and haven't had any problems with connections.

(if it's rooted)Good form factor for everyday use.Can stream high definition (720p) video from my NAS, across my network.Works well with my old bluetooth earpiece.Cons:Lame battery life. Available extended battery is only 1800mAh and is $41.The default Pantech UI is annoying, install Holo Launcher HD for a stock Android look and feel.Camera is awful with the stock ICS app, but if you install the Camera FV-5 app it works much better.There is no ambient light sensor. The low setting is still blindingly bright in a dark environment, and of course, too dim for outside in the sun. I'm always manually adjusting it.[Edit] Install the app 'Lux Auto Brightness' from the Google Play Store. Since the Burst doesn't have a light sensor, it can use the camera instead, and then auto dim or brighten just like the more expensive phones. I have mine set to use the rear camera, and adjust on wake. It works perfectly without a noticeable impact on battery life.[/edit]Even with the negatives I mentioned, this is a great little phone. I use mine all day, every day and it does everything I need.

I was presently surprised that every bit is true. This phone's data works in 2G (GSM Edge), 3G (1900MHz WCDMA in T-Mobile refarmed area) and 4G LTE (1700MHz T-Mobile LTE).I get very good speed (10+Mbps with LTE). The phone has everything that I wanted including a 800x480 display with good viewing angle. It also has a digital compass. And it comes with 12GB of usable memory w/o the need of micro SD card.The only downside is its battery. The phone seems to suck battery very quickly. Even without any data-happy apps like facebook, gmail running in background, the phone could easily drop below 30% by afternoon. There seems to be some bug with its 3G/4G that sucks power.Fortunately, with a couple of Apps. I can place the phone into 2G and also turn on the Airplane mode at night. I am now on my third day without charge and my battery is at 30%.If you are looking for a budget phone with a budget plan, I highly recommend you getting this phone for T-Mobile.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone!", "Author": "caleb seitz", "ReviewID": "RDWZ5HBP00IE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone! I woud suggest everyone who wants a smartphone that is fast and great for everything! The only cons I can think of is the battery life, but everything else is great!", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Kept Android Secret", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RCZJ465YXOCKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a world of what's new and relatively not that imaginative let us take a look at something that already works. Today there are four major players in the smartphone categories. Blackberry, Windows, Android, and iOS. Blackberry is only available on Blackberry devices and limits how much you can really shop. iOS is only available on iPhone and restricts you even farther by only letting you select a color, memory capacity and carrier. That is unless you want to buy an older model. Android and Windows phones are available from a number of brands and carriers and most importantly, you can select how much or how little phone you want. You may favor battery life to a faster processor or maybe want higher screen resolution to watch movies on the go. Whatever you're looking for, and however you want to use your mobile device, Android and Windows phone have you covered. But this is an Android device so lets stick to that. But first lets have a quick look at the iPhone 5 ($199 as a 16gb device with a 2 year contract or $649 if you buy it unlocked).It is worth mentioning that I have owned a few iPhones. They are very simple and none of them stand out very much from their predecessor. This being said I branched off of iPhone because I decided to read the full specs of the iPhone 5 before I, \"upgraded,\" once again. It was not hard to tell that if the iPhone 5 were an Android device it would be on the lower end of performance. Quite a bit of money goes into making an iPhone and the fragile device has helped spring up a multitude of make shift repair shops that will fix your broken glass, replace your battery, etc. Is there really a good reason the back of the iPhone is made of glass? I know it looks good but this is probably going to be dropped at some point. So welcome to the world of otterbox cases and behold, the pretty glass back isn't even visible anymore.So what of the specs? Lets compare the iPhone 5 and this Pantech Burst. Both phones were released in 2012. iPhone 5 of course took advantage of the Christmas shopping season (who wouldn't want a slightly bigger iPhone 4?) and the Burst was released 11 months earlier in January. So the iPhone has the edge and is technically a newer device. As for the rest:  iPhone  BurstCPU  1.3 GHz Dual Core 1.5 GHz Dual CoreRAM  1 GB  1 GBVideo  4 core 280 MHz  Adreno 220 *Resolution  640 \u00d7 1,136  480 x 800Pixel Density  326  233Screen Type  LED  AMOLED* - Adreno 220 is an excellent GPU but I could not find any specs. There is plenty to read if you take some time and google it.No mention will be made of the cameras. Smartphone cameras have a lense the size of a match head. Comparing which has the best \"camera\" is about as useful as comparing well, match heads. If you plan to use a phone as a camera and ditch your real camera, you're being foolish. Both cameras are suitable to send MMS messages and neither should replace a real camera for your precious family moments that are worth framing.No mention of battery life either. These devices are running a lot of hardware. Both will only make it a day with regular use. Both should be charged as you go to max out battery life. The only things I will mention here are 1) if you wanted to swap batteries in the Burst it will only take you a couple seconds to do so. With the iPhone, it is not wise to have a battery for swapping. And 2) Android takes the step of making many of their apps mostly black. Some say it makes the phone seem dark but remember, the more color the screen pushes the faster the battery dies.So as the specs clearly show the iPhone is close on specs with a low level Android device. Winning in some areas, losing in others. Overall it adds up to a pretty even fight. The so-called retina display is hardly worth calling a breakthrough. In fact at a pixel density of 233 you really only notice a pixel if you look for it (looking for a pixel that small will give you a big headache). And with AMOLED, the thing you will notice immediately is the purity of color.What of Siri vs Google? Well Siri sure talks a lot. Google lets you talk and then just does what you say. Say, navigate home and it will. Tell it to take a note for you, and it will. Say to call someone, and it will. Ask it a question, it will find the answer. Apple made it a point to show everyone that Siri could be your friend and will talk with you. Google didn't spend much time or effort showing off their voice activated system but built into the device are links to videos that help you get the most of the system. So iPhone gets Siri and Android, I will call you Sara. Take the i from iPhone make Siri take the A from Android and make Sara. Haha I am so clever.Connectivity to bluetooth is always an iPhone nightmare. It connects to your earpiece fine. But what if you are using a car stereo and trying to stream Pandora and have a GPS running at the same time? None of my iPhones have ever made a solid connection to my stereo. Eventually skipping like a scratched CD and ultimately leaving me to plug it into the AUX input. iPhone bluetooth is completely useless in my application. Fearing it was my car and not iPhone I went through the steps of buying the 3Gs, 4, and 4s. All had the same problem. The Pantech Burst came through with flying colors. Driving nearly 200 miles without a skip or missed beat. I didn't know that was possible. Now I feel my unlimited data and Pandora subscription are worth the price.Lets sum this up. If iPhone were an Andoid, it would be a low end Android. This Android device is running the current ICS, has street names spoken in Navigation, has amazingly good bluetooth connectivity, and never hiccups at any app I throw at it. To me the choice is clear. This phone is neck and neck with iPhone 5 and unlocked it is $500 cheaper. Is anyone ever really impressed with seeing someone else's smartphone anymore? Not really. So pass the butter and bring me a phone that does the same job for less money.************************************This device uses a micro sim. If you have an iPhone 4 your sim will drop right in. The larger sims need to be replaced with the micro sim or trimmed (not recommended)The Pantech Burst has been used on the Strait Talk network. I connected to 4G LTE but Strait Talk throttled me back a lot when I hopped over the 2 gig line. None the less it is still a good value plan.

My phone was bought used, in like new condition, and unlocked. The camera is the one downside, it works great outside but is not real good in low light situations. The processor is fast and smooth and the display is bright and clear. The 4g works well with AT&T; reseller services. I strongly advise against using this phone with AT&T; as they do not allow access to 4g, yet allow resellers of their service to use 4g. Go figure. When installing apps make sure to switch them over to Internal Media Storage because they automatically install to system storage, RAM. The phone has 1gb of RAM but only about 800mb is available, while it has 16gb of system storage. As for battery life and charge times I was disappointed when I first received this phone. However, I went to an auction site and purchased a new Pantech battery and a new Pantech charger. The difference was amazing. My phone charges in less than 3 hours and holds a charge for twice as long as it originally did. I can't guarantee this will be the case for you but it really worked for me. Battery life in any smart phone is not great but at least now I can go all day on a charge. I believe some phones are shipped with old batteries or there was a bad batch. For anyone willing to root this phone it offers tremendous capabilities once you get rid of all the AT&T; bloat ware. To summarize I paid $90 for the phone, battery and charger and it will compete with $300+ phones and win in many categories. After 8 months and a few drops this phone still works like new and offers a fast processor and lots of room for apps without going to an microSD card which is slower than internal storage.

It will force restart occasionally when trying to pair with my blue tooth.  It has a fast processor so it boots fast, so not a problem.  I really like this phone and my Pocket, so I use both, one for one month then the other.  I like the amoled screen, very rich, but my only complaint is the phone is very narrow.  Coming from the Pocket it feels even more narrow than it is.  In ICS it would not let me choose 2G only, since I don't have a data plan.

I wanted another smartphone, so I went around online and found this one. I didn't want to spend much because I just started college plus I'm cheap, so from those criteria, I bought this phone.Size: Anyway, my first reaction to this phone was actually quite disappointing. I opened it and the size was so small. I had gotten used to my giant of a phone along with its heavy duty case which made it even bigger.Battery: This phone varies a lot. I've had it since about mid-July and some days its fantastic other days it just plain sucks. Some days, I'll wake up at 8 and unplug it from the charger and it will stay at 100% until like 10 AM, and by the time I plug it in at night, it will only have gotten down to 70% or so. But other days, I'll unplug it at the same time and by 10 its already down to like 60%, and then it will completely die by 3 PM with the same usage as the day before where it lasted so long, which is a major problem for me, because often times I'm out of the house until like 8 or 9 PM. I don't I added too much stuff to it that would make it suck battery life which is what I find weird. Two things that help though are turning off data as well as GPS. GPS kills the battery like no other.Screen: The screen brightness toggle does almost nothing. It's just about the same brightness on the lowest as it is on the highest setting, so often I have to go inside if I want to see a text someone sent me. One other thing about the screen is the pixel density. I can understand if this is your first smartphone, it would be fantastic. But coming from my beautiful HD Xperia Ion, I often complain to myself about how bad it is.Camera: Absolutely terrible compared to my old Xperia with it's 12 MP camera that could take better pictures than any digital camera that I've had. The camera settings are also very limited compared to what I was used to. Not bad for basic usage if your not trying to take quality pictures though.Speakers: They're a little tinnier than my old phone, but my old phone's speakers weren't fantastic, so that's not a huge change.Software: Although this phone has relatively new Android software, I can't download some apps just because it is an older phone which bothers me a little bit more than it probably should.I found the opening screen (if you don't have a lock on it) to be a little weird, but I got used to it after a while. Also, if you do have a lock on it, I have found that the touch screen doesn't keep track of sliding fingers very well, so I've accidentally locked myself out a few times just because the phone wouldn't recognize it.Overall, this phone isn't bad even though I would prefer a better one. If you're looking for the basics of an Android OS smartphone without very much \"fancyness\" that you would get with the newer ones, this is the phone for you.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "D.A.Beirne", "ReviewID": "R2NPMYZFPNZBYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my kiddo lost its iphone so I replaced it with this android.

Low-light areas appear entirely pitch black. (3rd party photo apps fix)- Camera does not adjust for exposure compensation at all in video recording camcorder mode.  3rd party apps did not fix.  Camcorder only works at day time outside or wide open large windows or very brightly lit areas.- Camera quality is okay in bright light.  Slightly worse or on par with HTC Droid Incredible in brightly lit areas.- The Camera's LED is very weak.  Does not light up beyond 3 feet.  Not functional except for close-up macro shots, where you wouldn't want to use flash anyways.- Earpiece and Microphone are low volume in calls.- Audio volume transmitted through earphones are also low volume.  Its max volume is the same as a normal device's mid-way volume.- Rear Speaker is low volume and very poor quality.- Performance is very sluggish despite the modern processor and graphics chip.  Performance is slower than HTC Droid Incredible ADR6300.  By performance, I only measured amount of time it took to launch the same app.- Battery life is poor.  Even with 4G turned off (which is tricky to turn off, on even when data is off).  Battery life on par or slightly worse than HTC Droid Incredible with generic batteries.My test on continuous video playback with MX Player:  Loss of 1% in battery life every 2.1 to 2.6 minutes.  About 3.8 hours of continuous video.  Screen on time is about the same, felt like I lost 1% every 2 to 3 minutes whenever the screen is on, whether web browsing or play a game.  Somehow drained from about 80% to 30% in 1 hour using Copilot GPS.- Lag on phone wake-up - apparently helped by turning off animations and switching to 3rd party launcher.- Slow and buggy search app (when you press the magnify button on the lower right).- Does not work with mobile banking apps for mobile check cashing.  Photos are distorted/corrupted.- Bug - Battery meter drops 10-20% every time you restart.  Goes up a little over time (or not, no idea how it exactly works).- Dodgy microphone.  Voice picks up well in videos and audio recordings.  Very poor in calls.  Annoying to test echoes and muffling sounds, taping over and untaping the secondary noise cancelling mic.

I went ahead and gave it four because it is a solid device if you know what to do to make it so. I have owned this device almost 9 months, and feel that I should describe my experiences.The Pantech Burst was not my first smart device, but my first smart phone. I owned an iPad and iPod Touch prior, and still own the iPad. I guess I didn't know what to expect from Android, I don't know. Guess I wasn't expecting the random lag bursts (pun unintended), the partitioned storage capacity, or the incredible amount of customization. I was completely unaware of how unstable Android seems compared to iOS. Not that I dont like the customization, but I was used to constant fluidity and simplicity.First the Cons:1. Random episodes of unexpected lag during use. Not very much at first, but increasingly so as time went on.2. Partioned storage. I don't like having 1GB dedicated to system storage, and the rest for media. Just the way it is.3. Some apps incompatible. I bought Asphalt 7, and it goes through the setup menus, but controls are completely unresponsive.4. Fractured OS. Downloading the ICS update immediately was an obvious choice.5. Camera is bad in low light.6. Wakeup lag. Never fails.Now the pros:1. Incredible customization and personalization. So much so that I will be staying with Android, despite the flaws.2. Bigger than 3.5\" screen, super amoled looks gorgeous.3. 16GB on a budget phone. Nice.4. Makes good pictures in outdoor areas.5. Dual-core 1.5GHz CPU.6. 1GB of RAM instead of 512MB on a budget phone. Also nice.NOW, how I overcame some of the cons to make this a nice, solid phone.1. Install ICS. Hands down.2.  Get Nova Launcher, Prime version if desired . (I did.) Allows more customization and significantly reduces use lag.3. Disable onscreen animation in developer options. Almost completely eliminates wakeup lag. I haven't (yet) found a way to improve lowlight pictures or the fractured OS making some apps not work right. Overall, I made this phone a 4-star phone, and I like it so much that I will be sticking with Android for my next phone. I do believe that once you go Android, you never go back for a relatively tech-savvy person like me. The lag may not bother some people, but I guess I'm a speed freak, or maybe I just enjoyed that part of iOS too much. So overall, if you are pretty tech-savvy, like to tinker with your phone; dont, and dont mind the lag; like to customize, tired of iOS, want good speed in a budget price, get this phone.
