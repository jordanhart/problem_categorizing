Yesterday I received my phone and the first thing I noticed was the box label was broken, It seems as if someone had opened the box first; the user manual is for a SAMSUNG phone (What the...?) and the battery was out of its package, it doesn't come with handsfree and an important thing THE PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED, I had to pay $20 to unlock it.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this Phone!", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R2L0MY6W9552BL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a T-mobile Sim Card, had it for 10 yrs now. This will be the 4Th phone it has gone in. I had a very specific set of demands for my next phone.Bluetooth 2.0? check. wi-fi (no data plan)? check. gps? check. android 2.2? check. that's all I really needed. However, I got way more. I was not expecting to get a very good tilt sensor, I was not expecting a multi touch screen, or good gps accuracy, or strong Bluetooth or wi-fi reception. I was wrong on all accounts. Yes people, it only has a 600mhz processor, it's not rooted, and no it don't have gingerbread or ice-cream sandwich as an os. go ahead and pay your 800 dollars. Yes my package also came opened, how ever it was done to install the update, integrate market (yes android market works just fine over wi-fi) and install the screen protector. No where in the ad does it say it came with a hands free device. International phones only come with a travel charger with an adapter, a usb cord and a headset. Without the greedy carriers getting their grubby little hands all over the phone and no data plan, things can be tricky, but there are always ways around that. Example... install opera mobile for built in flash (youtube ect) Install mobo player and its codec pack to watch vids other than mp4. I have a gps program with the maps on the memory card. tada! no data plan required for turn by turn. as a mater of fact i am watching an absolutely beautiful 2.8 inch version of the little mermaid playing through stereo Bluetooth headphones right now (conversion test). I have angry birds and Rio installed (seasons requires a data plan) and a nes emulator installed with all 758 roms installed. the processor cant handle much more, but its more than enough for me, and far more than I payed for. just reset the phone data, and set it back up and your good to go. and connect to wi-fi (duh).", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005H1VCOU"}}
