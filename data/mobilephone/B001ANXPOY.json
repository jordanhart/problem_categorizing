{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for the price, stylish!", "Author": "A Bright Pen", "ReviewID": "R1KJZQE961CF6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, considering its retail price.  For $80 full price, you get Bluetooth capability (although Virgin Mobile prevents the phone from transferring files between devices; you can only connect to headsets), an okay camera, and some nice, solid style.The phone is sturdy in terms of build.  Some elements of the body are not the best and give away its affordable, basic nature.  The battery gets practically red-hot after about seven minutes on a voice call.  I talked for about 20 minutes once and almost singed my fingers.  Perhaps indulging in a bluetooth headset for longer calls is warranted.The keys are comfortable and responsive, and the T9 text entry is very good.  The T9 dictionary is the best I've used, and I've used phones from nearly every manufacturer, including other Samsungs.You'll hear talk of how the screen is not full of vibrant color; this is true.  It has a limited number of colors on the screen, but I have not noticed this negatively affecting my enjoyment of the phone, especially at this price.If you want to know about Virgin Mobile service, I find the website relatively easy to use (although not the best I've used; it doesn't quite measure up to T-Mobile or AT&T; in terms of ease of use).  They have many many options in terms of how you buy your minutes, and their pre-pay monthly plans and minute packs are VERY affordable.  They also have a program called SugarMama, where you can earn free minutes by giving your feedback on advertisements.All in all, I am happy with this purchase.

Keyes", "ReviewID": "ROLGITTRVU8NC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I transferred over to Virgin Mobile after having much difficulty with T-Mobile. I am very happy with Virgin and my Samsung Slash. I get service everywhere. The sound quality through the earpiece is decent. The buttons are big enough for easy entry. It's pretty basic and not too flashy, but it's stylish enough. The only things I don't really like about this phone is that when I text people, it always adds an unnecessary \"RE:\" before every message, and ends each message with \"...\". I don't really know if you can change this, but it's only a minor issue. Also, the Slash gets rather warm with use, but not as hot as other people have made it out to be. I don't burn my fingers or switch hands. The camera quality isn't that great either. But for the money, it does the job and I don't have to suffer with another ugly phone that T-Mobile gave me. I would recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Burnt fingers?

Does the battery get warm? Yes, but too hot to touch or possibly get burned? Give me a break.It get's great reception, gives you quality pictures and easily recharges.My only complaints are the length of the active battery time which is well below the 3.5 hours claimed and the long recharge time required to gain only about 1.5 hours of actual usage.other than that it is still one of the best phones i've ever owned with worthy features you'd find on much more expensive cell phones.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Phone and Plan For Tweens and Teens!", "Author": "Mrs. F \"GdlyWom\"", "ReviewID": "R2N7HI1UA4EP0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted capable, yet inexpensive cell phone service for my 15-year old daughter, and Virgin Mobile delivered!I bought this phone for her from Walmart for Christmas (Virgin Mobile also offered this model for free w/plan activation on their website). The phone is girly-pretty, has a functional camera, records audio, enables her to make her own wallpapers and more, and I couldn't beat the prices anywhere, in my opinion (a calling plan and unlimited texting for about $40? Awesome!).  Although many of her friends have more advanced phones and plans (which I personally think is ridiculous; teens don't need a smartphone!), her phone holds its own against theirs when it comes to style, bulk (she can hide it easily) and freedom (it's her very own phone; she doesn't have to share minutes and messaging plans with the rest of the family!).  The call quality is great, and so far we haven't had any problems with dropped calls. However, we did find that the texting can be a bit glitchy when she is sending a text as one is coming in; it won't send hers. She just has to resend it once she receives the incoming one.All in all, I think that this is a great first cell phone for tweens and an inexpensive, yet excellent option for teenagers, especially for parents that have to pay the bill.  Virgin Mobile is, in my opinion, a cut above your average pre-paid service.  And the plans are so affordable that your wallet will thank you!", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "be careful", "Author": "22timtan", "ReviewID": "R368VV9B2O3QH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was sent a phone that was already used and activated even though they claimed it was a brand new phone", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "about the samsung slash", "Author": "Lucia Clark", "ReviewID": "R1R7Z6DCF5Y709", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is beautiful, portable and easy to handle, but it has a signal problem.  the signal drops as soon a s you begin talking.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "brian erline", "ReviewID": "R16JS3FP1L6KFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, because its retail price.

Just a cool, vintage Virgin Mobile phone that gets me all misty eyed thinking about the good 'ole days when phones were merely for talk and text. You can install Opera Mini and Google Maps thus increasing the usability of the phone like if you need directions or need to access your email or to look up something on the internet. I love the fact that it can get on the internet and is so tiny and cute w/ the slider feature that it hides easily in one's pocket. I love it. The only issues are the calculator only goes to the hundredths decimal place (Mantra goes to the ten thousandths), there is no zoom on the camera (Mantra has a post picture zoom feature) and sometimes the texting can be a little cumbersome when using the space key b/c you have to press it twice to get it to space once (Mantra space key only needs to be pressed once per space), but the phone looks so cool, and the slider feature is so slick and awesome that that in itself makes up for the aforementioned lagging features. I just kinda wish it had the exact features that the Manta has. The Mantra I feel is a better made phone because it's made in Korea whereas the Slash is made in China (both by Samsung), but I love them both. The Mantra I feel also has a brighter screen and it is a little larger. I actually have both phones and just swap them whenever I feel like changing it up a little bit. Sometimes I want to use the flip, other times the slider. I love the Slash though. Still a very relevant and cool phone for Virgin Mobile. I wish they still sold them. This and the Mantra are the coolest phones on the market even today, but I'm a minimalist with whom these phones fall in line wih my paradigm that phones are primarily for talk/text with some light internet access and other features like camera and bluetooth. It has everything I need. I just wish I was able to download more ringtones and wallpaper since I refuse to purchase them. Both Slash and Mantra have only a very few stock ringtones, wallpapers etc so I just take pictures and set them as my wallpaper, but as far as the ringtones go, they are cool, but so few of them so you're pretty much stuck w/ stock as I haven't figured out a way to download free ringtones as it blocks those sites that I've tried. It seems like you'd have to pay for the ringtones and wallpapers directly from Virgin Mobile, and that I don't like. But, like I said, I won't pay for them anyway, and I can live w/ the stock stuff so it's all good. Great, cool-looking, easy to carry, hide and use phone. Great job Samsung. They just don't make 'em like this anymore like many great things, but cell phones are just way too involved these days.
