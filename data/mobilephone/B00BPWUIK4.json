Also don't want to be locked in to a long contract.  Just wanted a basic pre paid phone with a slide out qwerty keyboard. This phone was just what I was looking for. Easy to set up and use. Great for texting and making calls. Not many bells and whistles but then again I don't need them.  Only downside so far is needing to charge the battery every other night.A good basic phone for the money.  I would have no problem recommending this phone to someone.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "as expected from a used phone", "Author": "Ann Marie Curtis", "ReviewID": "RPKK140J3HF33", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "after only having it a few months people have complained they can't hear me very well, and that I keep breaking up.
