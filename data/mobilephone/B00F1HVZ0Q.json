I wanted one in good shape and ordered a used one in the hopes it would be in excellent condition.  This phone was so new that the prior owner had not removed all the plastic strips that protect the sides of the phone!The S4 is very nice, comfortably sized, great battery life, and with my update to Cyanogenmod it totally kicks the ass of any other phone I've ever had.  Throw in a 64 GB card and I have 80 GB to shuttle around ridiculous amounts of movies, mp3s, pictures, games, and anything else I damn well please.
