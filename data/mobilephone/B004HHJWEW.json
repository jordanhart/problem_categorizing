Yes, the phone has a short battery life if you are on it 24/7 (but what would you expect with a smart phone) If you use it moderately it will last much longer.

This phone performs well up to the point you start comparing it to the iPhone...PS. I noticed that many people placed their 1 star review to this phone simply because they had a bad experience buying this phone from some of the \"bad\" sellers here on Amazon. This is completely unfair. The phone is more like 3-4 stars. It DOES have a camera. I don't understand why some people say they received their Blackberry without camera in it.

I have had the blackberry 9650 for about a year and four months now and its time to say, I'm ready for a new phone! When the phone first arrived all was well, but within a few months little problems would turn into minor problems. Now I'm forced to keep this phone that comes with a two year contract and deal with its mood swings such as shutting off randomly.  Anticipating the arrival for the phone was something words cannot express because it seemed like the best thing on the market. Trying to set up the phone took me the whole night but it was worth it to me, and since everyone I knew had a blackberry it became the \"thing\". The keys were so small that my thumbs had to adjust but it became easy over time. The company had sent me a charger that was able to swap the sockets, but it was useless to me because I never even needed the extra. The memory on the phone is terrible, I'm constant deleting things to make room for more things and thats a loss for me which I don't like. However, it lets me keep in contact with people in various different ways which I thought was cool and insightful at the same time. The screen protector that came with it broke and it was a good accessory for the phone, and also the headphones which broke too.  The phone does the job of what its supposted to do which is the most important thing to me, but always waiting for it to load and reboot itself makes me not want to be bothered with it anymore. I wouldn't mind another blackberry use a more upgraded version with more memory and lots of new featuers.

Right out of the box, the trackpad button was installed crooked. I took it back immediately and was told by the Sprint technician, \"yup, it's crooked, nothing we can do about it, RIM shipped thousands like that\". And so began nearly a year of frustration with this deeply flawed device. Six months into using it, the device suddenly began turning itself off for no reason, usually just when I was using the browser. I took it back for repair, and they marginally fixed it, though it continued to shut down on occasion. The crooked trackpad continued to impede navigation throughout my usage. When they upgraded the operating system during the shut-down repair, I had hoped for better performance. Instead, it just slowed the phone down even more. As I travel to rural areas often, I need a phone that can also function minimally as a web browser - and this is where this phone really fails. Mobile media pages load with excruciating slowness, if at all. The camera image quality is also very poor, and the rudimentary controls are clunky and primitive. After less than a year I had enough and purchased at full price an HTC Android phone, and love it. Clearly, RIM has no clue about the current smartphone paradigm; the Blackberry line is a thing of the past, and the 9650 is an overpriced piece of junk, useful only as a phone, and marginally for messaging.

I was very pleased with how quickly the phone shipped. Then when I took it to Verizon the guy goes, \"Oh, man, how could you do me like this? This is a Sprint phone!\" He tried to get me to activate another service to get a phone for cheap but I've been down that road before. Pretty much my heart sank and I am upset with Amazon and PutGroup for misleading me. Even the pictures of the phone Amazon is advertising shows that it has a little Verizon logo on the phone. Now I am out a phone for another week and it's hurting my personal life as well as my business (I'm a General COntractor).

If you are okay with rolling the dice and trying to get a phone that will last until you are eligible for an upgrade on your carrier, then take a chance. But if you are looking for a \"new\" and longer lasting phone (at least 2-3 years) than do not buy a phone online....from any company, in my opinion. They are NOT new. There was a distinct discoloration on all of the white screens on the last phone that I had through Cell Lounge (now a name change) and then it flipped out and would not re-boot itself at all, rendering it useless. But I will say that this company knows full well that they are peddling inferior products and are willing to replace or refund your money.

Honestly speaking, I made a brave attempt to buy this product even after seeing negative reviews but after receiving the product I realized what people are complaining about.Here is my take on this: At about 180$ if you receive an unlocked outdated model with few issues which can be fixed very easily then I would still call it a great deal. Life is a game of adjustment !!! and I actually bring into practice each and every time...I faced only 2 issues with phone:1) The battery door was old, appeared to be used2) The wall charger was not working.I replied to seller and he promptly sent replacement parts for above things.Many people receive the phone unlocked and think that just inserting the SIM card should make it work for GSM, if the phone does not works or if they see Activation Required message then they start complaining. Even in worst case, the phone is locked you can get unlock code on-line from free to about 30$ (it all depends on the urgency). On this I would say, the seller is good enough as they send me the unlock code when asked for. After unlocking, I easily switched to GSM and removed the activation required message.For any help please type in following in youtube:\"How to Unlock Blackberry Bold 9650 Unlocking Remotely by Code

While the website claims that the phone will be shipped with instructions, none were in the box. Also, and more importantly, the Amazon website does not mention anything about a 7 day return policy. I had to travel on business so I did not get around to activating the phone. When I returned and tried to activate the phone, I realized there were no instructions which made me run around to the cell phone stores trying to get the unit working. When I tried to return the phone, the company drew my attention to the invoice which states a 7 day return policy. Anyone contemplating buying this phone should be aware of this.

Right out of the box, the trackpad button was installed crooked. I took it back immediately and was told by the Sprint technician, \"yup, it's crooked, nothing we can do about it, RIM shipped thousands like that\". And so began nearly a year of frustration with this deeply flawed device. Six months into using it, the device suddenly began turning itself off for no reason, usually just when I was using the browser. I took it back for repair, and they marginally fixed it, though it continued to shut down on occasion. The crooked trackpad continued to impede navigation throughout my usage. When they upgraded the operating system during the shut-down repair, I had hoped for better performance. Instead, it just slowed the phone down even more. As I travel to rural areas often, I need a phone that can also function minimally as a web browser - and this is where this phone really fails. Mobile media pages load with excruciating slowness, if at all. The camera image quality is also very poor, and the rudimentary controls are clunky and primitive. After less than a year I had enough and purchased at full price an HTC Android phone, and love it. Clearly, RIM has no clue about the current smartphone paradigm; the Blackberry line is a thing of the past, and the 9650 is an overpriced piece of junk, useful only as a phone, and marginally for messaging.
