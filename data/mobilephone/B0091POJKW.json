{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone at a good price and no contract needed", "Author": "Winter", "ReviewID": "R1J2T32EADDHOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am on a month to month plan with Verizon and needed to replace a Motorola Razr 3 phone as it is no longer supported by Verizon's tech support people. I did not want to commit to another 2-year contract with Verizon to get a new phone so buying this one was an easy decision. It also sells for less on Amazon than the cost from Verizon with their pseudo discounts.The phone itself has much better reception than the Motorola Razr 3 or Blackberry Storm phones which is important as where I live in Monterey the reception from Verizon Wireless cell towers is often spotty or does not exist at all.The picture of the phone is deceptive. I thought the phone would be a lot thicker than the Motorola and it is not, even with the larger battery in the LG phone. The phone is only 0.75\" thick and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and also slips easily into a pocket.Battery life is roughly double that of the Razr3 from Motorola and for that of the Blackberry Storm. Not having to recharge the phone every night is good thing as is not having to plug it into the cigarette lighter in the car when using it while driving.Bluetooth works as it should and was easily paired in my Prius and GM truck for hands free talking while driving. Having used this feature in two vehicles I would not want to go back to using a Bluetooth headset while driving.The phone appeared to be new but came in a non-descript box without any instructions or a warranty card so it is not a straight from the factory phone that is being sold.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Verizon LG VN150 Revere, new or refurbished", "Author": "Dennis Friedman", "ReviewID": "R2HQH5C0STX8EJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It does work with my Verizon contract, I had 6 months yet to go, I really like this cell phone, it has a nice large display, large buttons, all I needed was a basic cell phone, this fits the bill, I like putting all my contacts in groups & I had seventeen contacts in one group and it still was not full, no other cell phone I have owned has done this, speed dial let you chose which number you would like to use for each contact, be ready as soon as you activate the phone it will ask you to chose which settings you want, also in your setting set it to when your receive a phone call it \"Rings & Vibrates \" for the times when it's in your pocket, hooked on your belt or covered by a coat.  Also this would also be a nice for our Seniors who can't see very good. Thank you  UPDATE,  I had bought a refurbished cell phone and I new it, the problem with this model phone, seller claims that when you push the send button when programming the cell phone, it reprograms the phone in to excepting automatic up dates, that is incorrect software and ruins the cell phone, I have had this happen to me two times, the correct way of programming it is, do not push send to program the cell phone, there is supposed to be a paper in with the cell phone that explains this.  He knows of other sellers that are selling refurbished cell phones as new, if you find a cell phone that price seems a little low, call the seller and ask them if it is new or refurbished, I called another seller looking for a new cell phone and asked this same question, as of yet the seller has not returned my email,Thank YouUPDATE,  LG VN150 RevereIMPORTANT  if you own this cell phone you must make this change as soon as possible,  if you are buying this cell phone do this just after you activate  your cell phone, if it starts to do this updates, stop it, do this1.

I'm not quite ready to pay $30 a month for a data plan I would barely use and so I still have an LG Revere.The phone is reasonably small which I like (I avoid the qwerty phones because of their ridiculously large size and poor battery life). The battery life is also great with the phone able to go for days without needing a charge. That's about where the positives of this phone end. The call quality is fairly bad and if you want to put in a wired headset you are limited to 2.5 mm headsets, which are generally of poor quality and becoming increasingly hard to find. There's no reason for LG and Verizon to do this except to punish people who refuse to get on board with the smartphone bandwagon. The phone also gets an extraordinary number of dropped calls. I'll have full coverage and with no warning at all the call will drop. It happens on average every 25 minutes or so, so during a long call it can happen multiple times.The camera is also quite poor. I had a free feature phone from AT&T; five years ago that had a 3.2 megapixel camera, this one has a 1.3 megapixel camera. LG has also gone out of its way to make it impossible for you to backup your contacts onto your computer. They have discontinued the software that was used to interface Outlook with your phone and they have made it impossible for open source solutions like BitPim to access the address book (backup software worked with previous iterations of this phone like the LG Accolade but not on the Revere).Overall, this is a pretty lousy phone but its your best choice for a new phone from Verizon unless you feel like adding $360 a year to your phone bill.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "FALSE ADVERTISING AND UNTRUE!!!!!!!", "Author": "Joss", "ReviewID": "R1JP78BOB44YKQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone DID NOT work with Verizon existing plan as claimed.Therefore, it is still sitting here and not able to be used.Very disappointed in this advertising scheme.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "White screen within 15 minutes of taking out-of-the-box", "Author": "Billy Whisenant", "ReviewID": "RZD3BS0FP38DR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product shipped, and was received sooner than expected.

Also, when paired, it will not transmit key prompt tones through the Panasonic handset when using a telephone menu. I have no trouble at all with call quality or key prompts with our other cell phones when using Link-to-Cell.

It feels sturdy, not cheap... it's just nice. Visually, it looks pretty good too (although my \"NEW\" phone came with a scratch on the front). But if you text more than ten times a day, you're going to HATE this phone. First, the inbox and outbox are scrambled: messages are stored as they come in, not the typical conversational way of newer phones. That's not an enormous problem, but the text input really is. There is no way to permanently change the mode of input (say from Abc to T9). Every time you open a text, it will start with Abc, and you will have to go into the settings from the text input screen to change it TEMPORARILY to what you want. There is also one single page of symbols, even when you change the input mode to symbols, which, ps, is the only way to use symbols other than hitting the 1 key repeatedly and hoping you land on the right one. Also, if you go past the symbol you wanted, you have to delete it and start over. Same goes for changing words in T9. If you type \"good\" and you want \"home\" and you accidentally go past \"home\" when hitting the next key, you have to delete the entire word and try again, or go through the whole cycle of words again. You can't highlight words and go forward and back through the list. My new phone was ALSO defective in that a few of its keys are too/not sensitive and I either end up with 4 of the same letter or I have to press it three times before it even registers once. If you don't text, then you'll really like this phone. If you text... beware. Oh, you can also give individual contacts their own ring and text tones, which is really nice! You also can't change the shortcut keys, and they suck. One is a tip calculator, the other is \"shortcuts\" which you can't change, another is a list of \"events\" which seems to just be a list of things you've done, like turn the speaker on and off and change the volume or get a message, and the last is the web browser, which I doubt many people use on flip phones.
