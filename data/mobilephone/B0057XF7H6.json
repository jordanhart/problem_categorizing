The gorilla glass display is just what i wanted, my two year old watches videos on it all the time, has dropped it couple of times but not a single scratch....you have to experience it to believe it....... have been comparing to android phones lately and the i phone......i tell you this is the way to go.....have not been forced to sign up for any data plan or pay some stupid service tax fees to these blood sucking telephone companies. The phone itself is amazing more so after the free belle upgrade from Nokia, they know how to make customers happy.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "jag", "ReviewID": "R1BRSWPOCJOERN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like this phone for its design and durability,only thing that's not fit for me is the OS  of the Nokia x7, still symbian Would be great if it is harmattan", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top Gun World Phone", "Author": "Idymee", "ReviewID": "R34LPM6IB9ZRV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great and am loving it.

Many reveiwers spoke desparagingly about the processor, lack of apps in the ovi store and the view that symbianv3 was not on par with ios and andriod. I have been using the device for about a month and the processor performs just fine IMO. As for the ovi store, I personaly am not interested in downloading 10,000 apps that I am no longer going to use once the novelty wears off. The two Nokia's I have owned thus far I much preferred to the Blackberries I have had in the past. As for symbianv3, it preforms no worse than any other os I have used (better then some). I was looking for a device with the best antennea in the market (this is Nokia). X7 also has very good sat/nav, locks onto satellites faster than any device I have ever used. If you are in the market (as I was) for a device with the best antennea and sat/nav on the market you can't go wrong with the X7 or any Nokia for that matter.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "ROX7KALO14WXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia's absolute awsome quality.the sound is crystal clear, also 4 surrounding stereo speakers with big 4\" screen, loads flash, built-in GPS.hardware wise it's way superior than apple's iphone 4.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Troubling transaction...", "Author": "PM", "ReviewID": "RK39APE92V8SC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was not a pleasant 'Sold by the oem shop...

Now that Nokia does not sell phonbes in the US anymore, except from authorized dealers like Amazon ( according to their own US Website), they will refuse to service them.This is a very good phone, problem is Nokia decided to place the SIM card card and micro SD card in two tiny little trays.  And if you frop and lose one, or break one, you can not get a replacaement, AT ALL. I have been going back and forth with them for a week now, they even offered to replace the phone with a different model, but can't guarantee it will be brand new.Botrtom line, be careful when buying Nokia, and make sure it was released in the US.  Most Nokia phones on Amazon, and other sites are imports you are SOL foro any kind of service.
