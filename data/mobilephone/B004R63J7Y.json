Screen is bright with a good size (3.2 inch). It has Windows Mobile Office, so you can read/write the standard MS office files.Major drawback to me is that the phone is locked for Verizon. It means you need to activate it with them.When you power-uo this phone it'll try first to login on the Verizon's CDMA network and maybe if you travel to another country it will activate in GSM as Vodafone subscriber (there is a Vodafone chip).But if you plan to use for GMS carriers you should ignore this activation.According to Meir Herz to set the phone to GSM and get rid of CDMA network. Here's how to change it to GSM:- Put your GSM chip, power it on, ignore the Verizon activation.- Tap start button > Settings > Personal > Phone > swipe your finger to the left or right until you get to theNetwork page.- Tap the mode of operation field, select GSM/UMTS.- Tap OK.Your phone will now work on the GSM network. So it is unlocked !I followed this and it worked. Same for non-US GSM carriers.Other minor points: the screen easily gets the fingerprints marks, so maybe plan to buy some screen proctectors; device is a bit heavier but not too much.That's all for now, if I got any important info I'll update the review.Enjoy !", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best phone for price this low", "Author": "Alexander Pataridze", "ReviewID": "R3L0PA2ALJ8TYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone about a week ago, i was very excited. After turning it on i just switched from the Global Mode to GSM/UMTS and it connected automatically to the local cellular network (in this case Beeline). Although the phone has resistive display, it's really very sensitive. The screen is very colorful, 256k of colors do their job very well. Phone plays 720p HD videos really neat. Foreseeing all of the pluses and minuses the price is a big plus for me. Who cares if it's working on Windows Mobile 6.5.3 which isn't maintained any more. There're still awesome apps and games for this phone, like a PSX emulator or Huff and Puff (Angry Birds alike game) or even Zuma Delux, who doesn't like it?!Great job LG thanks for this phone :)**Update**After a while i decided to update the system from V5 (which comes preinstalled) to V7, which made phone even more awesome, with newer software, android-like home screens and many more.

All the bugs and kinks have finally been worked out, and the phone even has a task manager hard button! (WM does not kill programs when you exit they just go to the background and eat up resources. You have to go into the task manager to kill programs) It is also the fastest WM phone I've had also. I hate Android and OS, don't even get me started on Apple products....... I have had smart phones since they started making them and I have always preferred Windows. My first unlocked phone was the Motorola Mpx220 (old school).  Windows 7 is great but it doesn't even support the landscape view, yet. So I'm sure it will need a million updates and tweaks before it get's worked out. Anyway this is Microsofts greatest scam anyway. once they fix all the bugs in any operating system, they start from scratch again.  If you like gadgets and like to keep up with the Jones's this phone is not for you. For the smart phone power user this is the best WM phone. I do everything from my phone from writing reports and e-mails for work and my small business.For instance  I have already made a power point presentation right from this phone then synced with my laptop and even my PC (which is at home) from I94 during rush hour on the train on my way to work.  My only complaint is the camera sucks !!! My last phone was the Xperia X2, which turned out the be a great phone after I rid the phone of all the Sony Ericsson software that ruined the phone and it had a 5MP camera. I almost never used my digital camera after I started to use the phone. Compared to $700 that I paid for it the day it was released (and it still sells for around $300) this phone does it all minus the radio, picture quality, and direct video output (which I never used, because I could never keep up with the cord) for $100.Still using the phone as of 11/17/2011. It freezes up periodically but after I updated the sofware it started to work great again.. I also forgot to mention because this is a world phone it works on CDMA and GSM networks.

You still get a Verizon splash, and some things seem hardwired to Verizon.I can connect to my wifi router.  I can make and receive phone calls.

The AP ap worked, one for Wikipedia didn't--always got an error when you tried to search.It seems moderately powerful for the price.  I don't have a lot of use for data away from my wifi router, but at some point will try out T-mobile's $1.49 a day mobile plan.Edit: I did get mobile browsing to work with T-Mobile's $1.49 per day data plan.

Some quirks.", "Author": "Tze-I Yang", "ReviewID": "R3GC5DX71M2JQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone directly from Amazon.com in July 2011 for my husband, so we've had about 10 months of experience with the phone. We have updated the firmware to v7 since the begining of the ownership, so the option names I mention may differ from your phone's. Without further ado, here are some of my observations.Pros- Inexpensive full-featured smartphone with touchscreen- Has a physical keyboard; good for composing longer messages- Works with AT&T; Prepaid (GSM); successfully tested voice, sms, and data (up to 3G speeds)- Works with T-Mobile (GSM); successfully tested voice and sms (I did not try data but it should be up to 2G speeds)- Should work Page Plus Cellular (Verizon MVNO, CDMA); I've been looking into this and, as long as the ESN of the phone is clean on the Verizon network, it should be fairly easy to activate- Recharges through a standard micro usb port- Simple notepad-like application (OneNote) that's easy to use- Batteries last around three days with moderate use- Many free and paid applications work on this phone if you look for Pocket PC applications- Wifi works- You can remove shortcuts in the menu that you don't want to see; so if you'll never use that Verizon app: delete!Cons- Could not get mms (picture messages) to work on GSM networks- Could not get tethering to work- Did not auto-detect the apn setting (for internet) on the sim card- Occasionally had to reboot to fix things like the internet connection (gprs) and switching between usb modes- Browser (Internet Explorer) would sometimes get an \"out of memory\" error from web sites- Microsoft phased out Windows Mobile 6.5 support; no more Marketplace applications- Annoyingly hard to position cursor at the beginning of a line with the stylus in the notepad application; I've have to use the direction keys on the slide-out keyboard most of the time- Ghost voicemail notification (this may be the AT&T; network's fault); icon says that there's new voicemail but actually no new ones exist- Likes to automatically delete hidden SSID network settings whenever it can't detect them- New message notification goes away even when I visit the inbox but don't read them (they're still marked as unread in the inbox)Comments- Since the phone doesn't automatically detect the apn setting on the sim card, you have to manually add it. I eventually downloaded and installed the free HTC Network Wizard .cab that automatically configures things for you based on the selected network- If you want to set up the voicemail for GSM networks, set the voicemail number to your phone's number- There's a dedicated Task Manager button on the side of the phone if you need to switch to a task or to end one- There's a physical reset button under the same flap that covers the usb port. Just use the stylus to press and hold to reboot the phone if it gets unresponsive; there's no more need to take the batteries out to do this- You have to jump through some hoops to get GPS working on the GSM side: switch to CDMA or Global (both CDMA and GSM) mode, turn GPS on, select COM4 for the port, and switch back to GSM mode; I never used it much so I can't really comment on how fast/good it is----Nov. 29, 2012 Update- This phone works with Page Plus Cellular in CDMA mode; it took the OTA programming and receives/sends calls and text just fine- It's annoying that you have to manually turn off the screen when charging the phone; otherwise, it will stay on and take a long time to fully charge", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Unlocked Phone - Some Tinkering Required for Fully Functioning Phone", "Author": "WhoNowBrownCow", "ReviewID": "R2NB8JA0Q11OPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick Review:Pros:-Awesome Touch Screen-Solid feel, and materials are very nice.-Keyboard is awesome.

Not a big con, but could be better, I think.-Windows Marketplace for apps sucks a big one.-Alert/Notifications lack customization beyond stock sounds (with the exception of ringtones).Overall, I would recommend this phone.Long review:I recently bought this phone (unlocked) and I use it on T-Mobile. After about a week and a half of use, I can easily say I love it. Since it is unlocked, all I had to do was put my T-Mobile SIM card in the slot and turn it on. The phone recognized it and automatically connected to the T-Mobile network. Right away I was able to import contacts (from my SIM card), call people, and text message out of the box. However, getting the MMS (multimedia messaging service, being able to send picture/video messages) was not so easy to get working. I spent a great deal of time looking around on the internet to find a solution, and I finally have it fully functioning on T-Mobile! I will describe the additional steps I had to take later in the review. Now, on to the rest of the phone. The phone is quite solidly built; no flimsy plastic parts, and the slide out keyboard has a little spring/kick to it (I like it). The touch screen is not capacitive, it is touch resistive, and so it does require a little pressure in order to work properly. It takes a little getting used to, but after a little bit, weird it is not. The screen is actually very responsive and there is very little to no lag at all when in use. Also, because of the resistive touch screen, a stylus is included. First thought of a stylus would be: \"What? A stylus? Please, that is soooo old!\" In all honesty, I actually like the stylus. It makes me feel fancy. Plus, the stylus has its own little compartment built into the phone itself! The screen itself is very nice! Colors look very good for such a small LCD screen. The phone is not super thin, due to the slide out keyboard. With that said, at the same time it is by no means fat or brick-like. When in my pocket, I don't feel like my pants will suddenly and randomly be pulled down due to the weight of this phone, which leaves me content. Also, I wear a belt, so that may help a little bit. Other physical features of the phone include everything mentioned in the ad/description for the phone itself. There is a lock/sleep/power button on the top. A memory expansion slot, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone/audio jack, a camera button, and for some odd reason, a task manager button. I'm not too hot on the task manager button, I find I often get it confused with the camera button (they are quite close); however, you can easily disable it within the Windows Mobile settings (or assign it to your biddings). The three buttons on the front of the phone are nice to have. I find that I rarely use them, but I don't find them a nuisance so I could really care less. On the front, the metal (or whatever material it is), is interesting to say the least; it has this weird line design on it, but I don't mind it. The physical keyboard is really nice. The buttons are very nicely spaced and not insanely tiny. The space bar is in somewhat of a weird spot, but it is easy to get used to. For the price I bought this phone for, (brand new, $90), I am amazed at the amount of features this phone has! It has Wi-Fi connectivity, a GPS, a 3.2MP camera, and a touch screen! Thus far, I am still trying to get the GPS to work. I do not have a data plan, so I really like the Wi-Fi feature. The 3.2MP camera takes really nice photos, and the video is great but not HD. I really wish a flash was included. The phone is also Bluetooth capable, which is a plus if you have Bluetooth accessories.  For internal hardware, this phone also is quite amazing for its price. It has a 1GHz processor which for a phone isn't too shabby at all; my iPod touch 3rd gen (32GB) has an 833MHz (around there, but it is under clocked by Apple) for comparison. For RAM, this phone has 256MB on board, which is okay for some, but personally, I think for a phone this is more than enough. Being a \"Global\" phone, or whatever, this phone is not only CDMA network compatible, but also GSM capable (which allows it to work on T-Mobile, and AT&T; for example). The fast processor really shows in overall smoothness of the OS, and in apps. This leads me to the next part of my review, the OS and apps. The Windows Mobile 6.5.3 OS is not the best OS out there compared to Windows Phone 7, iOS, and Android, but it is certainly not the worst. I found at first it to be a little confusing, but like so many other features of this phone, change takes a little time to get used to. Now I find the OS to be quite user friendly and very easy to navigate around. Some parts of the OS are nice, like the main welcome screen, but other parts are a little quirky. For instance, you can select any sound (or song with a simple edit in the OS registry) for a ringtone, but you are limited to the crappy stock sounds for all other alerts/notices like SMS and MMS notifications. I found with an app I found online (Ringo) you can select a custom text message alert tone, but that's it. Kind of a downer if you are really into customization. I'm quite sure that there is a way to have custom tones for notifications and such, but I have yet to find the way. You can set a custom wallpaper, custom ringtone, and custom themes. The phone also features voice control, but I have yet to figure that monster out. The phone comes stock with Internet Explorer, but as on my computer, I simply cannot stand any form of Internet Explorer; I can say I dislike it with a fiery passion. Luckily, there are many other browsers that are much better, and faster than IE. I easily found a mobile Opera build for Windows Mobile which is very fast and easy to use. For apps, I would not say you are extremely limited, but I will say you are limited. The windows marketplace included on the phone I found was extremely crappy, and I would stay away from it. All the apps on it are for the most part overpriced (for what they can do), and with a simple google search, most of them can be found online for free. Installing apps from a computer is super easy. All you have to do is download the .cab file from the internet (for whatever app you want to install), hook your phone up to your computer, and drag the .cab file from your computer to your phone. Tap on the app on your phone, and install. That easy. A little longer process compared to Android and iOS, but the Windows Marketplace sucks. Now on to what a lot of people who purchase this for T-Mobile gripe about, the MMS service mess. The included messaging service on the phone sucks; it's clunky, awkward, crappy, and too many menus/steps to send a single message. I do not think I would have gotten this phone to work properly on T-Mobile without the help from \"Pizzaboy192\". Look him up if you run into trouble with your Fathom (concerning messaging problems). What I had to do to get the MMS messaging to work properly to was install some software that removed the \"PowerMedia, or Arcsoft\" SMS/MMS app that came with the phone. So the SMS/MMS app was removed, which left the native Windows Mobile SMS service on the phone (I believe T-Mail). I had to install a couple other things in order for the MMS service to be used on the phone. Once everything was applied, it was very easy to adjust/edit the GSM SMS/MMS server settings in order to get the phone to correctly communicate with T-Mobile's services. It all sounds super complicated, but in fact reality was not. Simply applying a couple .cab packages was all that had to be done. If you have any questions on this process, contact me at: keeganpmjones5@gmail.com . I am, however, not to be considered \"Tech Support\" in any way. I can answer simple questions that I can answer. I also cannot guarantee anything. I can give you advice and only advice. I am simply someone else on the internet, not an employee for LG, T-Mobile, etc. Overall, this phone is an insanely good deal at this price. Just be aware that as this phone is intended for Verizon, getting it to work correctly on other networks will require some tinkering but IS NOT DIFFICULT AT ALL. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT WORKING IS PATIENCE, A LITTLE TIME, AND BASIC COMPUTER KNOW-HOW. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants maybe not a super fancy phone, but a good solid phone.

You can not get a better smartphone for under $90 and that as well powered by a Qualcomm Processor of 1GHz.Display $ Appearance:=====================I only wished that the display was slightly bigger (minimum 3.5 inch) but 3.2 inch is still a very good size for a WVGA (800 x 480) display. Most of the people in the reviews have complains that the touch screen is unresponsive because due to its resistive nature but I must admit that this is the most responsive touchscreen I have ever used. The phone comes with a handy stylus that is stored at the back of the phone and is useful specially while surfing the web. You have to calibrate the screen at least once in order for it to work flawlessly. This phone is not very slim because it has a FULL QWERTY slide out keyboard which is a plus for texting and other purpose. It has dedicated buttons (physical) for Call/Cancel/Menu/Task Manager/Lock/Power/Volume etc.Multimedia Performance & Camera:===============================The default media player is not going to support all the formats out there so I installed the TCPMP which plays almost all video formats and will even stretch the display across the entire 3.2 inch screen. The video playback is very smooth and there is also a 3.5mm standard headphone jack so that you can plug in any headphone of your choice. I installed the YouTube app on it and it also plays videos really well.Camera on this phone is  3.2MP which does an okay job in taking photos in situations where you do not have a digital camera. It can also shoot videos at 640 x 480 / 25fps. The quality is not very good and somewhat acceptable if you can live with it.GPS & Other Sensors:====================This phone has built-in GPS as well as A-GPS (uses cell tower). I downloaded the Google Maps official app on it and the A-GPS was working immediately after starting the app. It was not very accurate as it will only tells you that your location lies within 30 meters or sometimes more. In order for the built-in GPS to function, you need to enable the \"Location ON\" from Settings>Personal>Phone>CDMA Services>GPS. If you are using the phone on a GSM network then you first have to just enable CDMA network in order to access the GPS settings because the GPS settings are only available when CDMA network is enabled. You can enable the CDMA network from settings>Personal>Phone>Network. The built-in GPS shows the most accurate position and will take about a minute or two to lock on to satellites. On average it is able to see 4-6 satellites (indoors). The maximum I was able to lock on to were 8 satellites. The more the satellites, the more accurate your position would be. If your App is unable to connect with the built-in GPS then you have to enter the GPS port, which is COM4, in the app settings. The phone also has a gravity sensor, proximity as well as luminous sensor.Windows Mobile 6.5 OS:======================The only thing that was first preventing me from buying this phone was the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS but I got over with it after I installed the app called SPB Mobile shell which makes the phone more customizable and gives you Android like menus and layout. I was also able to download some of the FREE apps from the Microsoft Marketplace. Some of the apps that I have installed on this phone are Opera Mini browser, YouTube, Google Maps, TCPMP, Facebook Mobile, SPB TV, WMWiFiRouter etc. I have kept the default firmware that came the phone and have not upgraded like others had.Things I Can Change on LG Fathom Phone:=======================================- I wish the camera was at least 5.0MP- RAM could have been 512MB, though 256MB RAM with 1GHz processor is still very fast.- Slightly bigger display (maybe 3.6\")- Ability to install other OS such as Android/Windows 7 etc.- Battery life (5 hours of WiFi use is enough to drain the battery from 100% to 0%)This still is a very good phone from LG for those who have a tight budget but still want to have a smartphone.

Old fashioned? A little bit, Bulky? May be, Boring user interface? Yes, but it can be easily fixed, so, Why one should buy it? Below my reasons:- First of all, The Company I work for only allows synchronizing Outlook with Windows and Nokia devices.- I've already have a GPS software which only runs under Symbian and Windows Mobile OS.- I'm not a \"blackberry guy\" so the big and useful slide-keyboard comes really handy.- The user interface can be upgraded to an attractive one. The first step is to upgrade it to the V7 software through the Verizon website. If that's not enough, just install the SPB mobile shell along with the Sense UI. The result: A full packed android like device that costs only 90 bucks!!I also love the good quality camera, processor speed, GPS performance, call quality, WVGA resolution, the \"n\" WiFi and the embedded software such as the one called \"gallery\". SPB shell adds more fun and usability to the package making it a really good deal.Since nothing is perfect these are the cons:- Accelerometer performance: Sometimes it turns the screen when it's not supposed to, and the other way around.- Memory: I'm a technology junkie, so after a couple of weeks I run out of memory. I've already worked it out using SKTools software. Enough if you are an average user.- Microsoft no longer supports Windows Mobile 6.5!!!!!

I have no problem getting phone service, but I am having trouble with 1) retrieving my voice mail and 2) sending text messages, even though it detected and dialed the correct numbers, *86 and +1 (312)314-9800, respectively.  AT&T; customer service confirms the numbers, but can't help further since this is not their locked AT&T; phone. Can anyone out there help?Bought it because I plan to use it with a local SIM card in my upcoming travel to Thailand and Indonesia.  It's great for my simple needs since I am a light user on AT&T; Go Phone plan.  The good: Wifi works, therefore access to my hotmail and ocassional web browse of CNN.  The photo player and music player work, and can also sync/transfer these files from your PC to the phone's internal memory or micro SD. The camera is quite good, but I am a more serious photographer to stoop this low.  For similar reason, I don't care for the phone's GPS and subscription fee to find out if it works. And not interested in any data plan either to explore 3G and other services. Not using this to replace my laptop for heavy duty web browsing and e-mailing on Wifi.Yes, it meets and exceeds my needs less the 2 minor problems. Overall this is a bargain: price, style and nice LCD screen, etc.Update:  I've since learned through an AT&T; forum that AT&T; switches off the simple voice mail feature from your current plan and changes to visual voice mail because it's a smartphone. It's an extra cost feature of course. Other AT&T; users are experiencing the same problem too when switching to different smartphones.  The work-around to retrieving your voice mail is to dial your cell number using a land line phone, and when you hear your own greeting, press * (star) and the pin/password.

The delivery was very fast( i have amazon prime) and all i had to do when it got here was open the box put my Sim card in and change the network setting from cdma to gsm. After an hour or two the interface started to bore me so I googled skins and or themes for windows mobile 6.5.3 and alot of results came up. well i tried a couple they were OK i guess. Anyways while I was searching for all things lg fathom related i came across a website that lets you download a few files and lets you run android on your phone from a micro SD card.  Ok so now that i have told you about that lets get to the review itself.This phone does so many things( with or without android running on it) and I think I will start with the battery.  The battery is OK, I get a few hours of use out of it with the WiFi turned on and a little longer with it turned off.  The screen is very good, the specs sheet says 480 by 800 and has 18 bit color (262,144 colors) but i think it looks better than that.  There is 211 MB of ram available to the user, and this has a l GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S1 QSD8650 processor which makes this phone very speedy when using multiple applications or when having alot of tabs open in the web browser. Speaking of the web this phone connects to 802.11 b g and n wireless networks and it works on CDMA in the 850/1900, GSM in 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA 1900/2100, the high speed data technology includes 1xEV-DO rA plus HSDPA.  Were I live I get HSDPA and it sends text messages and connects call much quicker than at and ts regular 3g.  The camera on this device is ok it is 3.2 megapixels which is pretty good considering this is a phone.  This phone has bluetooth 2.1 and it also has a headphone jack so you could listen to music through either one.  The lg fathom also supports mass storage when connected to a computer, which also means it can be synced with windows media player.If you click on this link [...] you can download the files that you need to run android.By using battery saving apps and lowering your screen brightness you can be more battery efficient with android than with windows mobile.  The good thing about putting android on the fathom is that it is pre-rooted so you can instal any of the apps in the android market from the get go.  I personally like android on the lg fathom better because it lets you customize your device more, it has a much larger app store and it is faster than windows mobile 6.5.3.Also I did not make the files and are in no way associated with the maker(s) of the files.

Pero una ves que aprendes a usarlo realmente es incre\u00edble la experiencia. Yo le instale el Opera mobile 10 porque el explorer en este tel\u00e9fono no es tan agradable, instale tambi\u00e9n facebook, windows live, un emulador de la calculadora HP 49g, youtube, google maps, y le actualice el office mobile y todo anda perfecto. Es un smartphone que le puedes instalar lo que quieras y hacer todo lo que haces con tu netbook en este aparato. Su hardware es realmente poderoso y viene con todo el software indispensable para llevar tu oficina en la palma de la mano. Su teclado qwerty tipo slider es fant\u00e1stico y hace muy c\u00f3modo el uso de este smartphone y a la vez lo hace lucir como un  verdadero mini computador. Veo videos y escucho m\u00fasica sin ning\u00fan problema porque ademas tiene una entrada de 3.5mm en donde podr\u00e1s conectar cualquier aud\u00edfono de tu preferencia con una fidelidad de audio excelente. Al principio es un poco molestoso porque si estas en la calle o tu auto se pasa buscando conexiones wifi para conectarse y a la final si estas en movimiento ya ni le haces caso pero cuando quieres conectarte a alguna red este busca con mucha eficacia donde puedas hacerlo. Su c\u00e1mara de fotos si bien no es la 7ma maravilla pero es muy decente con una resoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de 2048x1536 pixeles, autofocus, grabadora de video y muchas opciones mas que la hacen mas que suficiente para las exigencias no profesionales que casi todos tenemos. Repito que este smartphone en un principio no es f\u00e1cil de usar y no es para personas que les gusta o est\u00e1n acostumbradas a tel\u00e9fonos fashion o fancy con iconos enormes para que puedan usarlo tambi\u00e9n ni\u00f1os de preescolar, es una herramienta sumamente poderosa para tu trabajo o estudios y me atrever\u00eda a decir que estamos ante la presencia de los \u00faltimos tel\u00e9fonos con un verdadero windows de sistema operativo ya que con windows phone 7, microsoft a ca\u00eddo en el mundo fancy and fashion. Realmente me doy cuenta que Lg con este producto no hace mas que mimar al publico estadounidense ya que con el precio de este mas sus incre\u00edbles caracter\u00edsticas lo hacen ser un verdadero regalo.

The stylus and battery were sent but that battery was the wrong one and so once again the phone still did not work.  Then company went on break for Passover and they couldn't get me the correct battery.  They sent me an email saying it was on the way but then several days later after it had not arrived they finally sent it and emailed me again to say it had been sent.  Over two weeks after the phone had been ordered, the 3rd battery was on its way. That battery had signs of water damage and the phone kept turning on and off without no reason.  Needless to say the phone never worked.  I had ordered another phone at the same time and while it didn't have the sylus and battery problems the screen was not responsive to touch and would take multiple touches before it worked properly.  Also, this phone did not work properly on the Tmobile network.  When I complained to Ross Cellular they repeatedly asked me to remove my negative reviews on Amazon.  Eventullay, they told me if I would do this they would process my refund in a timely fashion and not make me pay for the return shipping.  If you want to know why there are not more negative comments about this phone and Ross Cellular it's because they bully people into taking off negative comments in exchange for handling their return smoothly.

No other phone I know of does that!?!?5- Downloaded and installed Bing from the Market Place and now I have it all including turn by turn Navigator:)Last but not least, this phone is a powerhouse with amazing productivity tools and all handled via ActiveSync and Outlook.

He logrado instalar: google maps, Skype, juegos en 3D, emuladores SNES y PSX, Opera Mini, entre otras muchas aplicaciones. He actualizado el Windows Office al 2010 y est\u00e1 muy completo. He podido ver presentaciones en power point y documentos word...Tiene un teclado muy c\u00f3modo para escribir y una pantalla de 3.2\" que permite jugar, navegar en internet, ver videos de Youtube y muchas cosas m\u00e1s.Estoy muy contenta, funciona en cualquier pa\u00eds porque est\u00e1 desbloqueado.
