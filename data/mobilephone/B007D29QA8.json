{"Reviews": [{"Title": "android of the future", "Author": "Albert Santiago", "ReviewID": "R3UMOOMSDF6E7B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "PHONE is very futuristic in presence. It will capture everyone's attention. Looks like a heart monitor on your wrist. Lol. Literally. WiFi capable works well. Bluetooth capabilities. Speaker on voice calls sounds low but with headset sounds well. MP3 / MP4 sounds loud & clear. Apps that dont exceed o.s 2.2 work well. Pandora,YouTube,Google maps, voice search , voice commands. Games work but screen is smaller than most phones plus on your wrist makes it uncomfortable. Video chats don't work even though there's a camera/camcorder built-in & even if , the eye is placed,sideways instead of in the top center of the screen as it should have. Battery life is about 8-10 hours on sleep mode and 4-6 hours while using but depends on what your using it for as internet takes most power and text and calls take the least. I almost forgot, the charger is short and its male to female usb. It charges within 30 minutes. 8 gb micro sd with adapter. If you have chubby fingers, I recommend a thin stylus. I'm still testing the capabilities, so far shows promise. I highly recommend it for techies, however , for other consumers id say wait till they perfect the smart watch. If your a consumer that only needs it to check your fb, Twitter and other social networks and talk, text and listen to music ? Then buy this. Buy it and you wont regret it. And yes , you get email too. ;)", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "SVP Z1 Android Smart Watch", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R12FJSP9VB61PH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have 5 other Phone Watches and this one is by far the best of them in most aspects.1. Phone quality: I tried to use the included bluetooth headset and the sound quality on the other end of the conversation is poor. The speaker phone is real soft and makes a static/hissing sound when you hit the speakerphone button on the phone. So, if you are in a loud area you might be out of luck unless you find a headset with better sound quality.2. Camera:  I have 5 other watch phones and this watch has a killer Video/Camera compared to the others on the market.  I am a big video recording person and love that this thing takes great Videos and pictures.  So, they don't compare to my Galaxy S III's pictures or videos. The video is smooth and I assume it shoots at 30FPS.3. WIFI:  The WIFI doesn't always seem to work and I am not sure why.  I can get the WIFI to work at work but not at home... your experience may vary.4. SIM Card: This SVP Z1 adnroid watch uses a standard SIM card and only has one SIM card slot.  I use T-Mobile and I ended up going to a monthly plan from the Pay as you go plan due to the fact that I wanted to use the Internet.  So, if you don't care about using the Internet or using data you can go with \"Pay as you Go\" option.5. Functions: The phone doesn't come with the Google Play Store... it comes with APTOIDE.  So far I have been able to find most of the stuff I have on my Galaxy SIII. The phone has a calculator, Alarm, sound recorder, Video recorder and camer, Internet and a few other things.6. I did notice that you can do APP to SD to save memory on the phones memeory. Yes, the phone does come with an 8Gig memory card.7. LCD screen: The LDC screen is not the highest quality and it's not the lowest quality. That being said, I have noticed some yellowish tint ( found out it's the viewing angle) in the white areas of the background pictures and when taking some video's.  The picture will fade depending on what angle you look at it and it looks \"washed out\". The Colors are not \"POPPING\" like I was hoping they would but what can you expect from a $234 Phone watch. There isn't a pen to use on the screen and typing on the \"Micro QWERY keyboard\" is a little fustrating at times.Conclusion:  I would recommend this to anyone who like the coolness factor and would like something that they could use as to take video or picture without wipping out their bulky camera or phone, if they don't want to take their phone with them or if it dies they have a backup.Update 3/4/13I found my jabra bluetooth headset and it seems to work just fine with call quality.  So, I guess I am totaly satisfied with this watch. So, as things come up I will post updates.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice regarding price", "Author": "Markus", "ReviewID": "R39YKV2XVI5JYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "like it very muchpros:- very high standby- lots of RAM (2 GB (4x the RAM of iPhone 4S))- lots of storage with included 8 GB micro SD card- VERY cool USB connector in wristband included !!!- screen resolution same as HTC Wildfire mobile phone (!!!)- cam shots quite nice pics regarding size of gear- quite fast reaction on screen regarding very limited CPU capacitycons:- very poor WiFi range- no Google Play market.

With this watch, it's much harder to misplace. But not only that. It functions as you would expect a smartphone to function. All of that on your wrist! This is a prelude to the next generation of even smaller smartphones.But, it's not quite there yet. Some improvements need to be made. A better WiFi connection would really help. More battery life.  I could not get the internal GPS to work at all. (I really wanted to use Google Maps.) 3G or 4G system would be great along with updated Android OS. 2.2 IS NOT \"2.75G\" as they claim.

Overall, it would be a fun toy and would probably consider buying the next generation model, but I had to return this one because it came out of the box with a dead pixel on the LCD screen. Slightly frustrating nonetheless.  I didn\u2019t have much time to necessarily give this a fair review, so I\u2019m giving you my initial impressions after my 2 days of having the phone.The backlighting is overpowered and leaves more to be desired. The LCD screen always looks white-washed/faded out and brightness levels do not do much for the LCD screen. WiFi range is good considering a device as small as this, however it is slow and turned off at random intervals. I had set the option for WiFi to connect automatically when in range, but it failed to do this on numerous occasions. Camera is well positioned for taking pictures, but improbable to use for video conferencing. Unfortunately, does not have a true dual core processor as advertised and would assume it has much less than 2 GB of RAM. I would recommend using a solid picture/color as the background as trying to use one of the Live Wallpapers pre-installed on the watch lags and chops up the animation. Does not have the Google Play store, but instead uses Aptoide. Standby battery life is great, but when you are browsing the internet or downloading, the battery life significantly reduces.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007D29QA8"}}
