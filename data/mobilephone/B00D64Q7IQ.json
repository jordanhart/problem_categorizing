{"Reviews": [{"Title": "a great phone for the price.", "Author": "Jon B \"Jon B\"", "ReviewID": "RAJ015FY4ADQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the money this phone is a good deal. You really wont be able to find any cases for it online or anywhere ells. I contacted the company and they said cases would not yet be available until they find a distributor. The phone it's self is fast and it has a nice screen. It has two slots for a GSM sim card. Be sure to use the one on the right side, if you dont you wont get 3g speeds,(i'm using a straight talk At&t; sim card). It also has a micro SD card slot. I have yet to find any tech support information on the manufacturer's web site. They have failed to respond to two of my e-mails containing general questions. It also looks like there will be no android updates for the phones. The phone it's self does not have a \"check for updates\" option in the setting menu, and the manufacturer website has virtually no information on any subject other than the phones themselves. Even the information they have posted about their phones is week, and leaves much to be desired. I guess since they are sold through amazon.com they don't need any tech support through their website?Update: 9/30/2013 they finally responded to my questions, (about three weeks). The answers were very generic, but at least I know I can contact them if I need to. They said the updates to the android operating system [if any] would be available direct to the phone (over the air), or downloaded and loaded onto an SD card. They way thge e-mail was stated seemded to imply that updates to the operating system would seem unlikely, (see the e-mail below).Good Afternoon,Thank you for contacting BLU Products.

I live in Canada but travel allot to the the U.S. I have my Canadian provider in sim one and roam mobility in sim two works flawlessly.My only criticism is the location on the usb port which is on the top and would be much better on the bottom, also the only headset that gives a nice sound is one that came with the phone.  My monster headset sounds like crap with this phone my bluetooth one works perfectly.All in all for occasional use when travelling very useful probably not a good phone for everyday use.I also like that it runs pure android with no add ons pure android is a real pleasure to use unlike the one that comes with Samsung phones which is overly complicated and junked up.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far great..", "Author": "Cell phone queen", "ReviewID": "R14S4MF80SO5L3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I\"ve only had this phone for a week, but so far it has been  pretty close to perfect, I am impressed. The reason for my review is to let others know that if you buy a silicon case for the galaxy note 2 it fits this phone perfectly. I know there is  a lot of buzz about cases for the blu phones.

In fact there have been no issues that I can identify that are independent of the Android OS, for example importing and merging the contacts took a little bit of creativity but that probably has more to do with Android than the phone or BLU software customizations.The only concern I have thus far is my wife has experienced some trouble connecting and staying connected to wireless. I have not seen enough evidence to assess whether it is a hardware or software issue and if it might be related to BLU or not.We have not had any bad drops with this phone yet so I can't really speak to its durability. The protective case that comes with it won't do much to save it from a nasty fall and my wife seemed to feel that it inhibited the use of the phone too much anyway.This phone in my opinion is a great value. Thin and powerful at a low cost. My wife found this and asked for it because she liked the new Galaxy S3 but we're both very frugal people and refuse to spend more than a couple hundred dollars for something like a phone. So far she is very happy with the phone, she plays a lot of silly games and uses Facebook, Pinterest etc and has had no issues.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!", "Author": "Tawana Fant", "ReviewID": "RVWL9DP85ACBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is nice for the price!!

So I bought this phone to c if it would work on st and b as good as what I was used to with a droid on Verizon. I am a heavy phone user and have a short patience level with gadgets that don't work. However, after using the APN settings provided online by st ( something I have never done before but found quite easy) the phone was very fast and performed exactly as I hoped. Now the larger 5.3 phone does come with a snap on case and glass protector so no worries there. The battery life is great I make it all day on the charge. The speaker volume is a bit lower than I would have hoped and there is no way to quietly mute all rings. The camera seems fine so don't take all those camera complaints to seriously. Overall a great cheap phone. I have people asking me all the time what type of phone it is. Don't b afraid to buy it.

This is the first time I am using this brand and I must say I am completely satisfied. The phone has good features, starts up quickly an is very responsive.

The phone was rooted and with in the information about the phone info was changed to accomidate what the seller wanted buyer(s) to think was on this phone. Sorry!!!
