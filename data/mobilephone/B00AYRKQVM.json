It probably took a short while to get accustomed to it, but that's probably due to my impatience as I later discovered that everything I needed from the phone was possible through customization and was basically an app away.  Pretty much thin and very light weight with a good camera too.  Only reason I wouldn't give it a full five stars are limitations of the small memory size of 8 Gb plus could do with a bigger battery capacity.  By the time one starts getting to fall in love with what the phone can do, reality check sets in on these limitations.  Hey, guess something has got to give for the relative cheap price.  Irrespective, a very good phone and probably fair to say that even with these limitations, it could have gotten five stars from me if it was a couple of bucks cheaper. lol", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone for the price. I'm very happy!!!", "Author": "Carmen", "ReviewID": "R2H14FJ76815ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast shipping, excellent product, brand new, got it from GSM Shop. I highly recommend this cellphone it's awesome and it's a fast dual core phone for under 300$ with samsung quality, jellybean and apps runs smoothly, the screen is really good with very deep blacks (better than the S3 mini) obviously you can't compare it with a galaxy S3 or S4 wich are way more expensive, the phone is very stylish, thin and light. After a month of use i can tell you it's fast, turning it on and shutting it off is very quick, no bugs at all with jellybean, the camera is awesome, very nice quality pics even if you're moving and even in low light environments. The phone is not too big not too small, just right. The quality of the sound processing is amazing, with a nice pair of headphones you'll notice the difference and the speakers are good too. Haven't try heavy 3d gaming but with normal android games (angry birds, fruit ninja, plants vs zombies, etc)and emulators (NES, SNES, GBA, MAME)it runs smoothly. Finally the battery life is amazing, with the app battery saver and minimum brightness (even with minimum brightness the screen looks nice and clear, no need for more unless you're outdoors)you'll get a whole day of battery life without problems, my use is regular internet browsing via WIFI, chat, music, casual gaming, etc... I use it a lot. All in all a very solid phone for under 300$ you'll definitely not regret it.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "RODOLFO", "ReviewID": "R3P3ZA1NL3TBEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone works pretty well, its fast.
