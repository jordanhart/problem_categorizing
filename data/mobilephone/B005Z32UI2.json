While most of the things that a typical user will ever want to use are covered through Nokia Store apps (most of them are free), the Spartan system rules N9 compared to iOS and Android.- no memory expansion slot (think about 64GB instead of 16GB version when ordering)- no user-replaceable battery (same as iPhone)- incompatible with Nokia Suite (use Nokia Link that I found only marginally or minimally useful since it doesn't sync contacts or calendars)- Nokia killing some nice *convenience* services that makes you wonder if their commitment to Windows Mobile platform is going to leave behind some long-time Nokia fansOverall a great product from Nokia, even superb if your main thing is to use this device mainly for phone calls, check email, do some light social networking. If you are more into entertainment on your phone then stick with iPhone or an Android-based phone. If you plan to switch phones, make sure your current phone is using the microSIM card or you'll need to get one from your cell provider or use the cutter.

The Nokia N9 is the most beautiful phone hardware I've ever owned. Not a surprise, as only Nokia and Apple churn out engineering this elegant.  I'm somewhat of a phone junky, as I've owned most of the headliner phones from the major OS's: iPhone 4s, galaxy s2, galaxy nexus, Samsung focus, etc.Hardware: I'm typing this on my iPad, so don't have the typing patience to get too much into this, but wow this hardware is elegant. The curved screen complements the swipe os perfectly, the unibody construction is so well out together, the large generous speaker on the bottom provides plenty of volume, and the clear black screen really does provide such a vivid picture that icons look like they're floating on the screen.  But really, you have to hold this phone to appreciate it.  The old king of design (iPhone 4s) has been supplemented.One more thing on hardware, and this was huge for me. The antennae on this phone is pure Nokia, I.e. excellent. Typically, I have difficulty getting signal in many places in San Francisco with AT&T;, but the N9 keeps a signal everywhere I go. In the east bay in the hills where my iPhone and nexus routinely would lose signal the N9 has 2-4 bars. It's really amazing.Software: the Meego experience is simple and effective, and I love it. Before Meego, my favorite OS was WP7. To be clear, when I rate an os, personally I'm excluding available software (ie apps). The reason is I'm thinking of the engineering and the thought out into the OS design, not how many developers chose to support it. I'm not saying apps are not important, far from it, but the number of available apps is so individually relevant (or not so) to the Individual user you have to decide how important that is to you.Much like wp7, Meego provides most used functionality with the minimal amount of screen interaction. Close an app, slide down. Switch an app, swipe right. Get notifications, swipe left. Minimize an app, swipe up. That's it. Simple, effective, and gorgeous.The N9 also comes with an incredible amount of connectivity out of the box. Gmail, exchange, Picasa, Dropbox, skype, twitter, Facebook, and more. I especially love how Skype is built in. Make calls and message directly from within the app.Battery: my only gripe with the phone. With everything enabled (especially gtalk, Skype, and Facebook chat) the battery is done after 12 hours of light usage. Start using the phone and youre down to 8 hours...that's is horrible. When you're NOT logged in to the messaging apps, battery shoots up to 2-3 days of light usage, and 16 hours of heavy, which is brilliant. Im not sure if this imitedto a few vocal N9 users, or if this all phones, but this is my experience.Summary: if you don't need a lot of external software, but need a heavily reliable phone that does mail, messaging, camera, Skype, music and video brilliantly, it is amazing. If you need more, definitely take a look at the lumia 900. It's not out yet, but supposedly has the same hardware design with a great os as well.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best touch screen experience ever", "Author": "J. Cassada", "ReviewID": "RHCMKR5NNW1V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a little over a week now, and I like it more and more everyday. There was an element of frustration at first...Gmail doesn't seem to want to play nice with Meego. Even some of the workarounds wouldn't help my mail and contacts to sync. Maps would freeze, Drive wouldn't load, and there was a few other hair-pulling frustrations.So why five stars? Well, most of my frustrations were fixed. Peruse the pages of the Meego forum and you'll find a lot of answers to tech problems. The N9 user community is very helpful. Also, the phone itself makes the tech woes dissipate from utter user-joy: the screen is incredible, a joy to look at. The N9 UI is the most intuitive touch screen experience  I have ever used. The indicators on the lock screen are smart. I can't believe more smart phones don't use the same approach to indicators.I'm using my N9 on T-mobile, and while I seem to have fewer signal bars overall, I have fewer dropped calls. I can even talk on my N9 in my basement, which I couldn't do with my Sprint phone. Whether or not it's because T-mobile has a superior signal, or whether it's because the N9 has a better antenna -- I dunno.Some have said that the Ovi store has a paltry selection, but I've found everything I need and more. Sure, it's no Google play, but how many light saber and fart apps does a phone need?Admittedly, the battery is wanting. If you have a bunch of background apps running, it'll be toast in one day or less. But if you tweak your settings, you'll easily get at least two days with moderate usage.So, it's a phone I recommend. Even with all the baggage of the various tech problems (which are fixable), the poor battery, and the fact that Nokia will quit supporting it after 2014 (might need a new phone by 2015 anyway) it's still worth it. You know you have an awesome phone when the associates at T-mobile and best buy ogle it with \"wows\" and \"where did you get that?\" The N9 is like a pretty girl - she's worth fighting for.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia N9 - outstanding, but ...", "Author": "M. Elek \"Just a guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1V522RVFDKU2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only true negative about the phone is that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop killed development of the MeeGo system so the company could focus on Windows Phone.Others have said that this is a physically beautiful phone, and it's true. There is so much to like about the phone that it makes you wonder how far MeeGo could have gone.It's pure Nokia from its purposeful shape to its interface and minimalist design. The Gorilla Glass is an excellent choice, because it should stand up to hard use. (I'm going to get a Zagg screen protector, anyway.)Included in the box is a silicone glove that fits so perfectly that it feels like the phone's original cover. It doesn't add any bulk to the phone. It slips easily into a pants or shirt pocket.There are just three buttons on the phone, and they are all on the right side. There is volume up and down and the power button. That's it. You can wake the phone with the power button, or you can use an option that allows a double-tap on the screen, which is what I use. No more accidentally pocket dialing - at least, so far.I'm moving up from the N900, which I thought was a very good phone. The N9 is a big leap forward. It's a fingertip-driven OS, which is responsive. The brightness of the screen at its default middle setting is excellent, although I would like to be able to turn off the automatic mode.I'm using the OS with PR1.3. Call quality is very good, and because the phone has NFC, it was a simple matter of touching the phone with the bottom of the base for the Luna Bluetooth earpiece to sync. I transferred my contacts from my N900 via Bluetooth. You can also sync your schedule, notes and SMS messages, if you want.I bought the 64GB version, and I would urge others to do the same. There is no ability to add extra memory via an SD or Micro-SD card - or even a new battery. So it makes the most sense to get the phone with as much built-in memory as possible.The phone's camera has a flash. There is no shutter release. You touch the screen to indicate where you want it to focus, and then touch the camera icon to take a photo. Simple enough, although I generally find the process of taking a photo with a phone to be a bit awkward. The rear-facing camera uses a Carl Zeiss Tessar lens. There also is a front-facing camera of so-so quality for video calls.The \"home\" screen holds all of your application icons in rows running down the screen, which can make for a long list if you add a lot of apps. The upgraded MeeGo OS allows you to create folders. You then move your app icons into the folders.One feature of the phone is Swype, which lets you type without lifting your finger from the screen. After enabling Swype, you move your finger from letter to letter on the keypad. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it. Once you do, it really cuts down on the time that it takes to write a text message.The virtual keyboard is small, particularly when holding the phone upright. When not using Swype, each keypress shows an enlarged letter, which helps to cut down on errors. Still, typing in information is a slow process.Charging is via a Micro-USB port, which also sits next to the door for the Micro-SIM card. The charging port is covered by a flip-up door, which I think could easily snap off. I would have rather have seen a sliding port cover. Next to the charging port is the headphone jack, which I think should have some type of cover to protect it from rain. In its case, the SIM card door is covered, which makes sense.The phone's speaker is on the bottom. It has decent quality, although I think the stereo speakers on the N900 were better quality.This is not a 4G phone. It's 3G. One very cool thing is that you create your Wi-Fi connections. The phone will automatically connect to Wi-Fi, saving you on data downloads. When you move out of Wi-Fi range, the phone automatically shifts to a 3G connection. You never have to think about it, unless you enter a new Wi-Fi zone. You'll still have to authenticate certain connections, such as those at McDonald's, Starbucks, Barnes and Noble and others.But I like that it transitions from one to the other seamlessly.Likes: Operating system, design, interface, gorgeous screen, impressive build quality, implementation of Bluetooth, NFC and Wi-Fi.Dislikes: No ability to add external storage or change the battery, flimsy cover for Micro-USB port, smallish virtual keyboard.Biggest dislike: Nokia killed off MeeGo.UPDATE (6/11/13): I've been working with the phone for about a week. It's truly an elegant phone. The screen is beautiful, and the phone is slim enough to slip into a shirt pocket. I don't think it's a phone that I want to put into my back pocket and then -- without thinking -- sit down.Installing (and uninstalling) an app is very smooth. The Nokia store isn't completely empty, but of course it pales in comparison with Google Play and iTunes. But that's the state of MeeGo.Bluetooth functionality is very good. I have the Luma earpiece, which is also NFC. Pairing with the N9 is about as easy as it gets. Touch the back of the phone (above the camera) with the base of the Luma, and it paired in seconds.I like being able to close an app rather than have it running in the background. Some (Facebook -- that figures) won't close with a simple top-to-bottom swipe.I've increasingly been using the Swype keyboard, which is great for sending texts, but not so great for filling out forms on a Web site. It's best to temporarily turn it off.Battery life is so-so. I would have been OK with a few more grams/ounces for a larger-capacity  battery. If you use the phone for texting, checking e-mail and a few other tasks, expect to charge it nightly. But I think that generally is true for most smartphones today. It seems to be a trickle charge, which should help extend battery longevity.Apps that I've added so far:- Flashlight: It works very well. I use this more often than I thought I would.- MeeScan: Barcode scanner. It's a must for smartphones.- Dropian: Good to have for DropBox users.- Panorama: A bit clunky but works.- Opera browser: It doesn't work with the Swype keyboard, and I don't really care for the Opera keyboard.- Firefox browser: Works as expected, although the built-in browser also is very good.- Angry Birds: I'll admit to loving this game, except now I have to replay all of the levels.- SpotOn: It extends the functionality of the built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. I recommend this.- Grab Radio and Internet Radio: Still playing around to see which I like best. I would like TuneIn Radio, which both seem to use to some degree, but both of these radio apps are missing some of my favorite local stations.I also added about 130 albums of music. The built-in music player has enough features for me. I would like to see the video player be able to handle FLV videos. I guess I'll find a video converter.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cell phone but discontinued", "Author": "Carlos Maiolino", "ReviewID": "R16YJ7ATUNN4TP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a really great cell phone, good hardware, and a good but unfortunately deprecated operating system. It lacks applications, and Nokia looks to not care about it anymore, so, looks like people with this phone will be limited to the current set of applications, and the few ones able to download from nokia store.Also, the SDK for this phone is deprecated, I had to workaround some stuff to install the SDK on my Fedora system, because the packages available for Fedora is just for Fedora 14, and looks like the another packages for another OSes are also deprecated. So, this is a good cellphone but with no more attention from Nokia, which make it IMHO a bad buy. I bought it because it's almoste pure Linux, without many modifications like android, but, tbh, an Android 4.0 phone looks now a better choice than this.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Delight To See & A Joy To Use", "Author": "projekt", "ReviewID": "R2X6EIN0INTGC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned and used an iPhone 3G for the past 3 years, I thought it was time for an upgrade. With fierce competition in the market from many manufacturers eyeing the throne for \"Smart Phone\" king with their splendid products, it was not going to be an easy task. I had settled for three contenders that I had thought were worthy of consideration. They were: Apple's iPhone 4S, Samsung's Galaxy S2 and Nokia's N9.Having owned an iPhone 3G, I didn't feel that iPhone 4S was considered an upgrade to my experience. Yes, there have been major advancement in the processor, the screen display is wonderful, the multitasking issue has been answered, and many features that you may know of. But, the experience and look, well to me, is still the same. And Apple's control over the OS mars the experience. It was until you performed the jailbreak that things started to get fun.The Samsung Galaxy S2, is a monster of a phone. It does everything apart from shaving your beard. Yet, there was always this doubt when deciding to go and purchase it. The Android UI, in my opinion is clunky. It's not very well layered as the iOS. Then the issue of future upgrades. With Apple you're in the loop, as for Android, you are compelled to purchase a new phone or read the numerous forums on how to install the upgrades manually, which is a task.However, with the Nokia N9, I was taken aback with its beautiful & simple design. There are no buttons apart from the lock & volume rocker on it's side. A cover is included in the box, to shield and protect the N9 from the bumps & blemishes. And it does not hinder the design nor obstruct the beautiful swipe gesture. The quality of the phone is great. You may at first be intrigued by the small button at the top of the phone that secures the sim card compartment and how to get it to open. It was frustrating at first. I even thought you are required to be double jointed to get the thing to open. But once you understand the design it all makes sense.The MeeGo OS is a wonder in itself. It is a well layered interface and the response is very fluid, despite the Nokia N9 not graced with a dual core processor. Yet the ingenuity of a swipe is so natural and so seamless that you're left to wonder of the simplicity of the gesture. The UI and the phone go hand in glove. To activate the phone you either press the on/off button on the side or simply tap the lock screen twice and swipe (either from left to right, right to left, top to bottom or bottom to top) you're presented with 3 home screens:' App Screen: Screen that lists all the apps' Open App Screen: Displays all the open apps' Notification Pane: All your missed calls, SMS text messages, emails calendar, feeds, Skype, Facebook, Twitter & notifications are displayed here in an organized manner.The N9 is very versatile and efficient. The battery under PSM (Power Save Mode) should last you 3 full days of regular use (making calls, sending text, emails & etc...). I had many contacts on my previous iPhone 3G, all I had to do was Bluetooth my entire contact list to the N9. That only took about 20 seconds. The Bluetooth feature was something very useful that I had sorely missed on the iPhone.The camera is wonderful, with a plethora of options that may render your compact camera useless. There is a front facing camera, but this hasn't been brought to use yet. However, there shall be an update soon to address this matter.Nokia have stated that they will stand by the Nokia N9 with updates and support till 2015. Since it's release last summer, there have been 2 updates so far with as stated above, one update promised for release by the end of the month to make the N9 experience all the more mesmerizing.Yes, there may be a lack of apps when compared to iTunes & the Android market, but the Ovi Store inventory is increasing week by week. And the N9 comes with Angry Birds, NFS Shift, RF 2011, GOF2, Facebook, Twitter & Skype dedicated apps.The Nokia N9 is a delight to see and definitely a joy to use. It should be considered if you are going to purchase a smartphone soon.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent even 1.5 years down", "Author": "Nikhil", "ReviewID": "R1O1N0GOO8ZVRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone continues to remain the king when it comes to having a clean, bright interface that is a joy to use everyday. Purely for this, I'd rate it highly. It is sad that in 2013 we still have button based multitasking and app interaction paradigms on Android.It could've used a little more processor power as it lags sometimes. There are also some bugs, but nothing disastrous.I really wish Nokia hadn't killed of one of the phones that represented how the future smartphone should be, something that sits in the background, not taking over your life, yet displays the information you need when you want it (the always on screen, combined with Billboard is killer!) and is a pleasure to interact with.If you want apps, look elsewhere. If you want  a phone that does the basics right, this is the one.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful!", "Author": "nfh1429", "ReviewID": "RB0LYTMV114P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia N9 is a fantastic phone. Probably the best phone hardware I've ever used, running the best mobile OS I've ever used. I'm quite familiar with Android, Symbian, iOS, and Windows Phone 7.5 (and presumably WinPho8, since that's supposed to be a 'refinement', not a complete OS change). I've also used many different types of hardware, from plasticky Samsungs to aluminum Nokias to glass/aluminum iPhones/iPods to mishmash Motorolas and Sony Ericssons.This...is the best one to have in the hand, to look at, to rub against your cheek...not that I ever did such a thing.-Hardware-It's made of plastic. But not the cheap kind Samsung like to use with their Galaxy phones. Instead, it's a single piece of machined, high-grade matte polycarbonate - the same kind used in F22 jet fighters - that's colored all the way through, so even deep scratches won't show up as discolorations. The front of the device is devoid of any buttons, leaving you with a piece of convex Corning Gorilla Glass that is so beautifully integrated into the shell, it looks like it's been melted on. The bottom right corner sports the front-facing camera (strange position, but presumably, Nokia want you to video chat in landscape, like a normal computer monitor), and the bottom left has a breathing light to tell you when it's charging. At the top center, you have a silvery Nokia logo, next to which is the proximity and light sensor. Above them, in the polycarbonate shell, is the earpiece. That's all you have on the front.On the right side of the phone, you have the volume rocker and lock/power buttons, all shiny chrome. The bottom houses the speaker grill and microphone. The left side is a barren expanse, and the top is where you'll find the covered USB plug, headphone jack, and microSIM tray. The back has a lovely centered chrome plate containing the 8.7 megapixel Carl Zeiss lens and engraved Nokia logo, next to which is the dual LED flash. Nokia took minimalism to a whole new level with this phone.The screen itself is a comfortable 3.9\", which is big enough to type on in portrait and small enough to use with one hand. It doesn't have as sharp a display as, say, the iPhone 5 (326 ppi compared with 251 ppi), but its AMOLED ClearBlack Display technology ramps up the contrast to near infinite, something that cannot be said of the iPhone's LCD display. The blacks are so...black...that it's almost impossible to tell where the screen ends and the bezel begins until you add some color, and that's on any brightness. The colors are bright and in your face, the curved glass lending to the effect that the icons are floating on the screen. That contrast between colors adds to this phone being usable even in bright sunlight, something we have in surplus here in Texas! One thing that I can say is a bit distracting at times is the PenTile pixel arrangement, as on the Samsung Galaxy SIII. Put simply, the pixels are arranged in such a way that it looks almost as if a very fine mesh were over the screen. It's not terrible, but once in a while, you notice it, and it's impossible to un-notice it for a while after that. On white screens, you might be able to see a pixel-wide vertical magenta stripe on the left edge, and a mirrored (green) stripe on the right. Other than that niggling issue, all is well.Inside, you'll find a 1GHz TI single-core processor backed by 1GB RAM and dedicated GPU, which, due to optimization of the OS itself, makes the phone go about its business like a greased weasel. It also boasts Nokia's signature pentaband antennae, with support for nearly all GSM networks you care to come across in your travels, including T-Mobile and AT&T; here in the States. NFC is a nice touch, enabling you to transfer files and such or pair Bluetooth devices with a simple tap (much as Samsung want you to think they invented it, it's been around much longer than the SIII has).As other reviews have stated, however, the battery isn't phenomenal. I'm a pretty heavy user, and I've been able to deplete the battery in less than a day. That said, I was outside much of the time, so the brightness was always up (a battery killer on OLED screens), plus push notifications and all that good stuff.Another thing is the loudspeaker. It's...ok. My last phone was a Nokia N8, and that had a great loudspeaker, if a bit tinny at times. The N9, though, suffers a bit. Unlike the N8, the N9's sound can't be muffled by simply placing a finger over the speaker grill, which is a plus. Instead, it feels as if the sound is coming out of the entire bottom 1/3 of the device. Calls on speaker are adequate, but music and movies? Get some headphones.The buttons on the right side do feel a bit jiggly, but aren't about to fall out of the device. If you use the provided rubbery case (which adds about a millimeter extra girth, probably less), you won't notice that slight wobbling at all.The ambient light sensor is rather eager, sometimes overly so. It's easy to convince the phone that nighttime approaches simply by holding a hand a foot away and blocking the brightest light source.-Software-You've heard of iOS, Android, Windows Phone, WebOS, and Blackberry OS. You may have even heard of Tizen and Bada and Symbian. Ever heard of MeeGo? Probably not, and that's because there is only one mass-produced MeeGo phone currently in existence: the Nokia N9.Quite simply, it is superb. It's a joint effort by Intel and Nokia on an open Linux kernel to create the most intuitive and simple mobile OS in the world. I think it worked. All you do...is swipe. Wake the screen up with a double-tap, then swipe the screen from the bottom to the top. Switch homescreens with a swipe from left to right or vice versa. Put an app aside by swiping from the bottom, or close it by swiping down from the top. In an app, swipe up from the bottom and hold it halfway up for a second - you get the launcher with commonly used apps (phone, messages, camera, and web are the default; they can be changed with an app). Everything is fast, smooth, and easy.When you start the phone up, you're greeted with the main homescreen - a grid of apps. Scroll up and down - no explanation necessary. Swipe from the right and you get a screen of open apps displayed as live cards. Yes, this is true multitasking. You can minimize apps and stare at them in this homescreen as they go about their respective duties. I've had map downloads, app downloads, installations, and web pages loading all at the same time, and simply watched them go on this screen. From here, you can long-press any app to display little red X's to close them individually, or select the Close All option at the bottom. Simple. Swipe right to left again. This is the last homescreen, displaying notifications. Everything goes in here - SMS messages, Facebook notifications, RSS feeds, emails, tweets, calendar events, etc. It's all organized like the normal Facebook news feed, with messages and emails at the top, separated from the rest. Above them all, the time, date, and weather. Swipe right to left again, and you're back to the main app grid.Nowadays, most people seem obsessed with the number of apps in any given OS ecosystem, and I do get it to some degree. With iOS and Android (WinPho is catching up), you have apps for everything. Literally. With MeeGo...not so much. However, if you can't find something in the Nokia Store, you can hop onto the interwebs and get something there. Kindle? Done. iBooks? Done. YouTube? Done. Dropbox? Done. Google Reader? Done. Evernote? Done. Pandora? Well...not quite. Spotify is available, though, as is a great internet radio app from Nokia. Whatsapp? Done. Instagram? Done. Facebook, Twitter, Skype? Already integrated so well, you can call someone via VoIP, or send them a Facebook message, or chat with GTalk...all from the contact card. Facebook messages and SMS messages go to a unified inbox, so it's easy to switch back and forth depending on how you want to communicate.As was also mentioned in another review, the MeeGo community of developers is amazing. To quote a certain blog, \"It would seem the Meego community doesn't like being left out of anything; either that or when they hear an app developer say 'No, we don't have any plans at the moment', that translates into 'I dare you to do it yourself'.\" And it's quite true. Dead platform? I don't think so. There are many talented developers out there who know what this phone can do, and are willing to devote their time and energy into making it do it, usually for free.Small touches on this OS show how much thought went into making it. In standby, the AMOLED has softly-lit pixels displaying the time, using up next to no energy (there is an app that allows you to edit what that screen says - date, battery info, network connections, etc.). Double-tap the screen to wake it up. New message/email/voicemail/missed call? Slide that notification to the side, and it opens it up directly. Need to put it on vibrate? Tap the top (where you would slide down with Android/Symbian/iOS) and hit Silent. Playing music from your collection? Hit the options button and get recommendations based on what you're listening to that open in Nokia Music (no USA option, but you can access the one from the UK!).-Overview (tl;dr)-Drop-dead gorgeous and sturdy hardware matched to equally beautiful and hardy software make this phone a true delight to use every day. You will be noticed if you have this phone. Take it to a T-Mobile or AT&T; store, I dare you.Some claim this phone is limited by lack of apps. I say - you didn't look hard enough. This phone may not be for the average user who loves games or toting specs. Instead, it's for the real power users, those who are sick of iOS and Android, or don't want a phone everyone else and their dog has. This phone has much to offer, limited only by the imagination of its fan base.Oh, and...first thing to do when you get it: Update to PR 1.3!*Small Update*-I just realized this, so I figured I'd add it on: you can tether quite easily with this phone, even if you don't have a tethering plan. Now, when you choose the US as the region, it blocks it. Just download an app like SpotOn and there you go - instant tether!-I also wanted to mention...that shiny chrome plate on the back? I'd have to say that's the only design flaw on this phone, because even though it looks great at first, it attracts scratches. Since it's right there on convex curve of the rear of the device, it rests there. Drag it across any hard surface and there are scratches. So even though this phone is too pretty to put in a case, you should definitely do something about it. The included case fits perfectly, and raises the chrome plate off the resting surface slightly, so that's a possible solution.-Another thing: be careful when you're charging the phone or when it's hooked up to the computer. The little plastic door covering the USB port isn't as tough as the rest of the phone, and I have the feeling that it's going to be the first thing to go for many people.-Remember how I said it's for power users? I forgot to mention Developer Mode! Just go into Settings, then Security, then Developer Mode, and toggle it on.

While there are not as many apps available for this device, the ones that are are plenty useful. When Sailfish becomes available, I may try it out but I'm extremely satisfied with Meego now.The camera on this device takes amazing pics. Some reviews have knocked it for use in low light but the flash makes up for it with crisp, clean images. To be fair though, I haven't figured out the video yet, as the autofocus seems to have a mind of its own.

I think you'll agree that its smooth.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful!", "Author": "Quoad Toad", "ReviewID": "R1TJ9YA2Z5X7OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the N9 for about two months now and am extremely happy with it.  The more I use Meego, the more I like it.  My tablet has Android ICS and I thought it was great, but Meego is far cleaner.  It's also extremely intuitive.  I didn't need to learn anything to use this phone. The Swipe feature is similar to the PalmOS Swipe and is a highlight of this phone.  It's so easy to move between and close program.  The N9 is also very fast with a responsive screen and many programs can be open at once without slowing down the phone.The build quality of the phone is great.  It feels like it's all one piece.  The screen curves into the case.  The screen is vibrant and speaker is crisp.  Calls go through with one try and I haven't had any dropped calls.  The battery seems to last a long time for my purposes - the battery is still about 3/4 full after 16 hours of usage (I charge it overnight).  I estimate my usage as follows per day - 10 minutes talk time, 6 hours playing music, checking email several times a day, 10 texts, a few minutes on the internet, and a few minutes of game play.  I check email and Facebook manually.The N9 is a pentaband phone so it works with both ATT and TMobile 3G.  It requires a micro sim card, but I just stopped by my local Tmobile store and they gave me a micro sim for free.  I was also able to set the phone so that it automatically uses WiFi while I'm at home and 3G while I'm out.One of the most important features to me was the music player and I am very happy with the N9's player.  The sound quality is great and I've even heard new things in my music that I hadn't heard with other players.  With 64GB of space, I was able to fit all the music I need on the player, with lots of room to spare.  I wish this phone had a memory card slot too, but with 64GB of space, I haven't come anywhere close to needing one.  Also, if you have an older Nokia in-line music controller that came with a Symbian phone, it will work with the N9's player.The camera is good too.  It's easy to share pictures on Facebook or send them as an MMS.  The image quality is acceptable, but I'm picky about cameras.  It works well for taking pictures of random things I see when I'm out.  Swiping through pictures to view them is fast too.  I downloaded an app that takes panoramic photos, which is fun to use.I am happy with the selection of apps available on the Nokia Store.  It's no where near as extensive as the apps available for iPhone or Android, but it has the essentials - QR code reader, hot spot creator, call recorder, translator, Angry Birds, Opera Mobile, and more.  You might want to browse the Nokia Store before purchasing the phone to make sure there are enough apps to suit your needs.  While this phone isn't popular in the US, it seems to be popular throughout Europe and Asia, so new apps are still being created.There are a few of downsides to this phone.  My previous phone was a Nokia N97, which ran Symbian.  Symbian could be customized much more than Meego.  I was disappointed that the N9 comes with only 3 profiles, without the ability to create more.  I was also disappointed that the Nokia Suite that I used with my N97, could not be used with the N9.  Without the Nokia Suite, there is no easy way to back up text messages on the N9, like there was with Nokias running Symbian.  The last downside is that Nokia does not make a US version of this phone (like it does for other phones like the N97).  I ordered directly from Amazon and my phone was branded with a \"Starhub\" logo and included \"Starhub\" apps.  I researched \"Starhub\" and it's a mobile provider in Indonesia.  I almost sent the phone back because of this, but decided to give it a try anyway.  I kept it because despite its shortcomings, as I grew to love this phone.Overall, this is a great phone and I definitely recommend it.  It's a very unique phone and it's too bad that Meego hasn't taken off.  I still think it surpasses Android with its simplicity and beauty.  It's not for everyone, but it's worth giving it a chance if it sounds interesting to you.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Literally the one and only...", "Author": "T. Doan \"10basetom\"", "ReviewID": "R3CZR9LD1E2MM6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is the poster child for potentially great products that were never given enough time to reach their full potential. The N9 is arguably one of the best phones that Nokia ever made, and unquestionably the best phone design that came out of Espoo. In fact, its monolithic polycarbonate design in bold colors is so iconic that Nokia/Microsoft Lumia phones still sport more or less the same design. If you don't already know the story, then let me try to put it in a nutshell: the N9 was a flagship phone powered by a new Linux-based OS called MeeGo that Nokia released shortly before making a pact with Microsoft, and which Nokia quickly deserted to invest all their resources into Windows Phone. MeeGo was very innovative for its time, getting rid of the need for physical and virtual buttons and making everything revolve around swipes. Even today, I still find the swipe gestures in MeeGo more intuitive than iOS and Android. Anyway, enough about nostalgia -- below are my impressions of the phone after using it as my daily driver for over a year in 2012. Don't let the four-star rating scare you; the N9 would easily score a perfect 5/5 if I had reviewed it in 2011.RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITYGood. Reception where I live is fine. I've never had to ask the person on the other line to speak up, and vice versa, even in very noisy environments (I think the noise cancellation mic helps here). The speakerphone could be louder though.DISPLAYGreat! Some people may not like the Pentile display, but for me the true blacks and colors that pop more than make up for a little fuzziness. I love the OLED display.BATTERY LIFESo-so. Maybe I'm too much of a power user, but the battery life could be better -- a lot better. It will only make it through a day with mild usage.CAMERAGood. The photos taken with this phone can be very nice in the right lighting conditions. The camera software is also fully featured. It doesn't compare to the iPhone 4-5 camera, but no complaints here.EASE OF USEGreat! Once you get used to the Swipe system, there's no going back. It's so second nature that I found myself swiping to close or switch apps on the iPhone inadvertently.DESIGN AND FORM FACTORGreat! One of the best phone designs ever. From the quality of materials, choice of materials, styling and fit -- everything comes together to make a timeless masterpiece.PORTABILITY (SIZE / WEIGHT)Good. Just a tad heavier than an iPhone 4, but with a 3.9\" screen. It is very easy to grip and use in one hand compared to the phablets that have been dominating this space recently.MEDIA SUPPORTGood. Maybe not as flexible as Android, but it can play all my music and movies out of the box. There's no memory card slot, and you only get about 4 GB of space to install apps, even with the 64 MB model. Kind of misleading if you ask me.DURABILITYGreat! The polycarbonate shell on this phone can take a beating, and you won't have to worry about paint chips. I've dropped it at least twice with no issues. This is one phone that deserves to be seen without a protective case.ECOSYSTEM (APPS, ACCESSORIES, ETC.)So-so. It cannot match the Apple and Android ecosystems, but I was still able to find quality apps to replace most of the ones I used on those platforms.BOTTOM LINELooking back on my time with the Nokia N9, I've been mostly happy with it. Sometimes even ecstatic (design and software), but a few times it left me wanting more (app space and battery life). If I could summarize the character of this phone in one sentence, then I'd say it's a solid phone with an iconic design and promising OS that never got a chance to shine because it came out at the wrong time. Although the Nokia N9 is pretty much dead now, it is survived by the new Jolla phone and its Sailfish OS, which is a direct descendant of MeeGo.

With the N9 being discounted by more than $500 and having 64gb of memory I decided to give it a try.I was not disappointed! The screen is bigger than the Dell, the form is smaller and thinner mostly due to there being no buttons on the front of the phone. I was a little concerned that Nokia partnered with Microsoft just before the release of this phone and had pretty much abandoned the Meego os almost before the release of the N9.

But because of a small battery, few apps, slow browser, and age/lack-of-updates it will never be a good phone.  IF YOU DON'T KNOW LINUX (or know someone who does), DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.Long version: My iPhone 3GS was dying.  I tried the HTC One, but found it too wide to use one-handed (and the HTC One Mini too weak).  My second choice was the Nokia N9, which a friend of mine has and loves.It's a pretty phone and is a good size for one-handed use.  The UI is easily learned.The phone claims to be able to import Google contacts, but that's no longer true because Google no longer supports the Exchange protocols.  So, to do basic configuration required \"developer mode\".  It's like \"jailbreaking\" IOS or \"rooting\" Android, except on the N9, it's just a settings change.  (Go Nokia!)  I \"ssh\"ed a vcard file to the phone, installed a file manager, and opened the file.  This is standard operating procedure for the N9.There are the basic apps for it - and they're pretty good - but rarely are there duplicate apps.  If you don't like the default calendar app (or any of many others), too bad - you're stuck with it.  For example:  * I use GMail and the default mail app has awful support for archiving.  * I found the photo gallery useless for browsing 3 years of photos.  * The support for group text messages was appalling.The webbrowser is slow (because it is old hardware).  Also, websites won't always give the phone the mobile version of the website.  This is fixable by installing Firefox and its \"Phony\" plug-in, but then you have to use two webbrowsers.The maps are Nokia's own maps, which had closed business (but are probably better than Apple Maps).  The voice navigation was awful.  Sometimes it didn't work at all.I did love that it ran Linux.  It had the \"apt-get\" package manager.  Copying my music and photo library was as easy as \"ssh\".The worst part is the battery.  I turned on both Skype and GoogleTalk and the battery was dropping 5% per hour.  That is, doing nothing on the phone would have killed the battery in a day.  I turned those off and the battery would last the day ... as long as no process was running.  I left a game running once - the phone was asleep in my pocket but the game was still open - and the audio process almost killed the battery.

The headset speaker is awful, and the conference speaker is just ok. From what people tell me, the mic is pretty good though, and it filters out a good bit of background noise.  The 64g storage is great.Meego OS is absolutely awesome. I love the OS itself. Innovative, smooth, lots of fun and easy to use.  The settings grouped a little odd, but you get used to it.  The built-in music app is really good (and plays FLAC out of the box!), the built-in video player is awful.  The built-in video player is really picky, and won't play a lot of usual videos (mostly screen resolution issues, I think).Now, the real drawback - the apps. Not much out there. There are some apps, and a handful of those are really good.  Most of the good ones are paid-only, and more likely than not it's going to be more than .99 cents. I'm fine with that (I'll gladly pay for a good app), but coming from Android or iOS people are going to be surprised.I found enough apps to cover everything I absolutely needed, so I'm good. App addicts are not going to like it, for sure. Social media is relatively well covered here.  Skype has chat and calls, but no video calls (real bummer).  It had Google's Video Chat, until Google changed the API to try to force people into signing up for their social media site.  Sigh.  Now Google Video Chat sort of works, sometimes, and usually only when someone calls you with it.  The biggest bummer for my purposes is the lack of a really good podcatching app. There are three in the store - 2 don't work and one works... Mostly... But it's missing a lot of the niceties that even an app on my Blackberry 8320 had 7 years ago.All in all, I absolutely love this phone and I am not sorry I bought it.

I find the virtual keyboard on the N9 difficult to use in comparison, mostly because the \"keys\" are small and it's too easy to press the wrong one with no tactile clues to aid you.  I've seen where there are alternate keyboard apps online though, so I will probably try that out and see if it helps.  I do think it's nice that the N9 makes a sound like a physical keyboard when you press the virtual keys.  I'm not big on talking on the phone, but the call quality seems quite acceptable so far.  My Nokia phones have always had great call quality and I see no indications this one will be any different.I have already rooted the phone to enable the WiFi Hotspot app which for some reason does not work out of the box in the US.  The current version of fbreader makes the N9 a nice alternative to my Sony eReader.  The physical form of the N9 is very satisfying.  It's beautiful, sleek, relatively lightweight and feels good in your hand.  I was a bit disappointed that I could only find the 64GB version in black, but I ordered a purple rubber case to go with it to solve that problem.I think my phone may have come from the UK because the power adapter provided with the phone is the terrifying three-pronged British version, and the default language selected was UK English.  There was also a US power converter supplied in the box, as well as a USB cable, earphones and a black rubber case.I couldn't be happier with this purchase and I look forward to playing with my new toy!", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "jobard", "ReviewID": "R2YPFL0S3N2T86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy to have the nokia N9.

Therefore, I do not assess N9's functionality in comparison to what other more dedicated devices can offer. Please read my review with that in mind. It's a great phone as far as I'm concern. The navigation concept of the phone is very simple and intuitive. It does what a phone is supposed to do. Besides offering great quality in making / receiving phone calls, a few typical apps for social media networking are included to keep users connected. It also connects to both my personal e-mail / calendar as well as work e-mail and calendar, Gmail and Exchange. It needed some searching and configuration tho. Apps can be found to integrate SKYPE and Gtalk to N9's Contact. That's a feature that I use frequently. The Map / Drive work great just like the Nokia way. The phone is also very reliable. I had to do a reset for Map and Drive to work initially but other than that it runs for weeks without crashes. Although taking pictures on a phone frequently does not turn out to what I would like, N9 does come with a pretty sophisticated software to compensate it and of course, it's packed with a Carl Zeiss lens. I also prefer its dimension and its build quality over other products that make me feel uncomfortable to carry on me as a phone.

Def better then windows phone(its a waste Lumia 900 is windows) and android. The only problem I had with this is that its made in China and I don't know if the specs/standard for China is low or something but the battery life is horrible!!! I've let drained completely on first day used and shut down to charge complete. Repeated over 5x's b/c this is suppose to help prolong the battery since its new. Unfortunately the battery last's only about 3.5hrs with minimal use and I have all the things on it off and lowered to preserve power already too. This phone is suppose to last about 7hrs. So if you're getting a N9, I deff recommend but not ones made from CHINA!!!!

And no SD-card slot, or FM transmitter.No physical camera button either.The screen is nice, and I like the clock it shows in standby mode. It's very fast and smooth UI.

So better to order micro sim cutter and sometimes it takes several weeks to come if you order from outside US. Be careful when you cut macro sim to micro because if it damage to gold foil that will neither work for your new phone nor older. N9 looks better than newer iPhones and provide excellent manufacturing quality. Another important thing is price.
