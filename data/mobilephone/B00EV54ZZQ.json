It is not a Galaxy s5, so if you expect this to be a top notch phone it will not be, it is a very good decent android phone, the phone performs well and is great for anyone who is a casual android user. If you want a quicker processor you will have to shell out much more dough and buy the galaxy, but for my children and myself this phone does the job and a really good price.So far I have bought this low cost Samsung and another model and both perform well with no issues.Pros: Great price and great performance.Cons: Not as quick and flashy as the $700 galaxy s5I would recommenced this phone if you want the latest but are on a budget,", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "simple but functional", "Author": "Oliver Sureda \"topper\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q9DUK61OQKVZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Is a good phone but slow.

The camera is poor, but I want a phone to comunicate, not to take pictures, then it's not a problem. The GPS works too.I found it comes rooted, and that gives the phone more funtionality, but for me it's better to restore to fabric before the first use, to eliminate some apps that are not necesary (unless you are in China), and as it comes rooted, you can delete other system apps that doesn't work in other countries.If you want more funtions, you have to find other model, and pay more,", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great phone and great price", "Author": "Ruben Guardia", "ReviewID": "R3NDCO6XC3OV5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is s a great phone and great price, I recommend it you need a small and not too expensive smartphone", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seller lied about Mobile information", "Author": "Richard Atahuaman", "ReviewID": "RLU5JQUEEUHI5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Seller give in their advisements wrong information.
