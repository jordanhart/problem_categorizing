Every time I touch this peice of garbage it infuriates me. It's SEVERELY underpowered for the Android OS. I've never seen a more lothargic phone. Just about everything you try to do with it takes so long to load you give up half the time and just end up mashing the home key a million times to try and get it to stop. It's like trying to get a 90 year old man to do you a favor. It get's to it in it's own sweet time.One of the other reviewers was talking about how it will randomly shut down and reboot in hte middle of whatever your doing. Yep. Confirmed. In fact, my phone will randomly reboot in my pocket when I'm not even trying to use it. And when it reboots, you'd better start a movie. Because it takes a full 2 to 3 minutes to boot up and figure out where it is. I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but when you're in a hurry to make a call it's the longest 3 minutes of your life.And how's this for being born under a bad sign? I can no longer get into my contact list. Anytime I try to open it, it fails and dumps me back on the main screen. The only way I can call someone from my contact list is to look through my recent calls and hope they're on there.Besides that, the contact list is permanently affixed to motoblur which is a big pain in the butt. My contact list has every person from my facebook/myspace/yahoo list on it. And if I want to get someone off of it, I litterally have to remove them from my facebook/myspace/yahoo list online. I can't just block specific users that I want on facebook, but not on my phone. I weep for those freind collectors that have 900 freinds on their list.I'm horribly, horribly dissatisfied with this peice of junk. I highly reccomend that EVERYONE avoid it like the plague.

The important accessories like USB cable, SD card, driver CD were not provided with the pack.Coming to the phone- I can see green dots on supposed to be black background screen. The phone is very slow and takes so much time even to save a contact. The facebook, gmail apps or email clients won't let you define more than one mail ID from a particular domain. The camera though 5 mp gives an impression of a VGA camera. Sometimes i even can't receive call as the on screen touch control button for that hangs. The way you can store contacts is very bad.On an overall at $ 190 it is value for money piece, but when it comes to quality does not look like someone like Motorola has manufactured it.

The first stopped charging after about 4 months and was replaced.  After 3 months the screen on the second one stopped responding properly and then started going nuts by selecting stuff and moving icons around all on its own. AT&T; had the gall to tell me that since it had been previously replaced by a refurb unit, it was now out of warranty.  I had to demand to speak to a manager to getthem to concede that it was still under the original factory warranty.Now after only 2 weeks, the latest one is showing the same signs of slowing down and the screen is jamming up when I am on calls.  All 3 suffered from poor call quality with people I was talking to saying the call kept fading out - not what you want for a business phone.  It seems to be when the phone is held in certain orientations it simply does not work too well. Sometimnes when it is on speaker - the people on the other end cannot hear you too well either. I have had similar problems with all 3 units screens locking up and being unable to answer or to end calls.  defintely not what you want if you are trying to look/sound professional on a business phone!The first one had Android 1.5.  I think the phone app was poorly designed and I got a lot of butt-dialled calls.  The 2.1 version seems to have cured that by making the redial buttons really small. I love Android but defintely do not love AT&T; or the backflip!I am so done with this unit!  Motorola and AT&T; have refused to replace the unit with another model. AT&T; have been only slightly more helpful but their solution was that I should upgrade to a different phone.  My reply is simply that after all this and their lack of willingness to help me get a phone that actuially does what it is supposed to - if I am going to have to sign another contract, it will certainly not be with them!", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not get this phone", "Author": "Katrina", "ReviewID": "R3AV04QSJNOD0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Backflip right after it was released. Bad choice.The first phone I had would text people on its own, call people while it was sitting right in front of me, call the wrong people, text the wrong people, and it would restart itself randomly. AT&T; replaced it in July, and by the end of July it was doing the same things and more. I did a software upgrades, changed the SIM card (twice), and it would work for a few weeks and then start acting up again. Finally, I couldn't get into any of my contacts, as the phone would crash as soon as I selected a name. And then it erased everything I had on my homescreen and everytime I tried to open an app it would crash. I went to AT&T; and then allowed me to get an early upgrade for the insurance price of the phone--but it was a long 10 months with this phone.

The flip-over design is cool, but the keyboard part is a little too thick, so you end up with a big lump in your pocket; the iPhone form factor, which covers more area but is thinner, is actually more convenient.  The keyboard works well for texting, and I have no complaints about call quality and reception.  Your experience may differ, but I found the second touch pad on the back of the screen to be more a bug than a feature--I was constantly hitting it inadvertently, so I ended up just disabling it. The phone seems to have a real talent for getting unlocked and doing things in my pocket; it's not that unusual to fish it out and find new icons on my desktop that have somehow gotten there through inadvertent presses, and I even pocket-dialed once.One big problem with the phone is that it's slow.  It takes forever to boot up (and there seems to be no way to disable the aggravating whooshing sound it makes when the Motoblur splash screen hits in the middle of the boot process), and once it's running, it's sluggish in most normal operations.  Some small but persistently annoying glitches show the disadvantages of a system like Android, which has to be adapted to a wide range of phone platforms.  You can make a call with the phone folded up, but let's say you're calling your voicemail with the phone folded: you call voicemail and listen to a message, but the number pad goes away when you connect, so when you need to press \"7\" to erase a message, you can't--you have to hurriedly unfold the phone and use the keyboard, then to hear your next message you have to hold the phone back up to your face, etc.  It's endlessly aggravating.  The sluggishness of the phone in web surfing may more be the fault of the AT&T; network, but at least on AT&T; the web is so slow you're not going to want to try anything ambitious--you'd grow a beard before you actually finished buying concert tickets, or whatever cool stuff they're doing in the ads.Don't let anyone sell you you need a screen protector for this phone.  The screen is made of Gorilla Glass; you can carry it around with change, keys, and metal shavings in your pocket and the screen will remain unscathed.

Then I found it is crashy, slow response, It drove me up to the wall. and I waiting for the 2.1 Update 1 to release wish that will make it better. But No! it is slow to the Z!!! It still crashes when I am on the phone. Application behave straight. I can't even play my movies anymore after upgrade. Overall experience is horrible and ATT is not giving a devil about it. And I see the phone still on the market. Seriously?! Take it off the shelf and recycle them.Upgraded this POS to Samsung Galaxy S. Wow!!! I love this phone, nice screen, fast response and all the android apps u can run.

It has been a decent phone. Its done everything it was meant to, however it is quite slow. From what I've read it has a 528 MHz Qualcomm Processor. Which really isn't bad at all. However the phone is very bloated with the Motorola Blur on top of the Android software. Don't get me wrong the features are nice, but if the phone can run it at a decent speed then they just aren't worth it. Even the Motorola Atrix which has a dual core 1 ghz processor lags a little time to time.SoftwareThe phone was initially released with Android 1.5 Cupcake. Motorola Released an Update to Android 2.1 late Q3 2010. The phone has decent software but I have found that some apps aren't compatible with the version of Android I have. Such as Google Music. I never had the phone when it had 1.5 on the device; so I can't really comment on the speed of the device before or after the OS update. I would wager that the new software is heavier than 1.5 but really hasn't slowed the phone down. My personal belief is that the Motorola Blur software that overlays the Android is what ultimately makes the phone very slow.ProcessorThe processor isn't terrible. 528 mhz. However the software is simply too heavy. The phone lags like nothing else I've used in the past. My old Motorola Sliver was more responsive. For instance the entire phone will freeze just as it is receiving a text message. I thought when I receive the phone that it would be fun to use and try out the apps, however I was quite disappointed with the performance. I tried everything I could find to speed up the phone to no avail. Eventually I just deleted the majority of the apps of my phone and use it for calls and texts. Rarely I'll use twitter or the browser when I'm near wifi but not much else.Battery LifeThe phone lasts as long as any phone I've used. About a day of decent use and then you have to charge the phone overnight if you want to have a phone the next day. If I don't use Wi-Fi or blue tooth and make only a few calls I have been able to make it two days, but this is a rare occurrence.CameraThe camera is pretty nice. Its 5 mp and takes decent pictures and video. The pictures are much better than the video. I don't know what the quality of the videos are but it isn't very good. Seems VGA quality to me, especially in the sound department.Speaker/MusicThe speaker on the device is actually one of the best I've had on a phone. The quality is quite clear and crisp. Of course the bass on it is atrocious; even so it is much louder than any phone I've used previously. As for the music player it gets the job done. It's nothing special and like everything else on the phone is quite slow.All in all the phone is barely good enough to get the job done. Aside from that its really not worth the price. There are a ton more android phones that are eons beyond it and are cheaper. I hope Motorola figures this out soon and alters their Moto-blur to not be such a processor hog.One final thought in comparison. The iPhone 3g which runs decently well and really doesn't lag too badly has a 412 MHz arm processor. The Next up 3gs has a 600 MHz processor. Its sad to see the Motorola Backflip have a processor that falls in the middle of these two devices and it can't even keep up with the 3g iPhone. Just shows that apple really knows how to make software work with the hard ware.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "WAS a steaming heap of dung, but a root and flash changed it completely!", "Author": "theeinferno", "ReviewID": "R22YJO53YFPKAY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Every negative thing written about the Backflip was true, when it was running Motoblur software on top of a crippled and outdated Android 1.5 OS.  It took a lot of concentration and digging on my part, but with the help of several web forums and tutorials, I eventually figured out the proper steps to get it upgraded to a modded, unbranded version of Gingerbread, (2.3.7 cooked with Cyanogen 7) and now it's a totally different phone! With Motoblur and all AT&T;'s other crapware removed, the drain on the Backflip's tiny processor has diminished to a reasonable level, and consequently, it no longer crawls at a snail's pace when asked to do anything. I was able to sideload unapproved apps, change a few settings and enable tethering, and now the phone is so much better in terms of being stable and responsive, that I even managed to turn it into a wireless hotspot with the help of Barnacle! WiFi calling is working natively and in 3rd-party apps (even internationally), I replaced the old music player with DoubleTwist and the stock browser with flash-capable Dolphin HD, and suddenly, for a fraction of the price, the modest little Backflip can do almost everything my HTC Sensation 4G does. Yes, it was a bit challenging to change the operating system, and took some time initially, but I couldn't be happier with the results. If you have this phone and hate it, try rooting and flashing it (nothing to lose but time, right?) and I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised. Oh, and regarding the power issues, (rebooting, etc.) I ordered a new battery for mine and stuck a fabric band-aid on it, so it would fit more snugly under the cover, with a bit of constant downward pressure.

I bough this thing when it was released. Unfortunately, the complains I am reading right now were not available at the purchase time and due to the fact I live outside, I read the first complains on the phone 4 weeks after the purchase. Too late for me to return it.I tried everything, this phone is the worst thing I ever had. The Original OS by Motorola is completely limited for doing anything, it is locked, meaning you cannot install your own apps to figure out where is this piece of crap failing. It was rebooting every 2 minutes and the battery was increasing its temperature. I wiped out the OS and did a rebuild using a custom MOD, more efficient, user friendly and reliable than the crap used by Motorola. Same problem. Is not a problem on the OS or the software, it is a hardware issue. In my phone, i was able to isolate the issue to the SIM card. No matter what, if you are using the internet connection provided by your operator trough the SIM card, the device will reboot randomly. By disabling on Settings->wireless & network settings->Mobile networks->data option, the phone stop rebooting. Connected to a normal wifi connection, downloading APPS, chatting and looking for youtube videos and IT WONT REBOOT. Do it using the SIM and it just doesn't work. Just in case, i changed my SIM 3 times, no difference at all. I tested each on other smartphones from friends, it worked fine.By the way, using more than 2 apps on this crap will also popup the error message \"application xxxx has stopped responding\" wait or close app. Is the whole hardware that is failing!!! It does not matter if you are using 1 application, the processor doesn't seem to handle it and you will be spammed with error messages about unresponsive applications, when the fact is the hardware cannot even handle 1 single app when you touch more than 1 button in less than 1 second on the touch screen.My advice: Motorola is doing all wrong, and you don't have to pay for their mistakes.

You will find a host of unhappy Backflip owners and that to me says that this phone is a problem child.  At best it is completely underwhelming in terms of performance.  It is slow and really quirky as a smart phone and bad call quality makes it a complete lemon.  The Android 2.1 upgrade has given access to better designed apps so things like butt-dialling are no longer such a problem but to me it has slowed the phone down?  Go figure!I am on my 3rd Backflip in 8 months and each one of them has been a pain.  The first one stopped charging, the second one suffered screen failure & went nuts.  The third one is spluttering along starting to show symptoms of the screen playing up too.  Sadly,  I was really excited by the form factor, the fact that AT&T; had finally conceded to include an Android phone in their line and never dreamt that Motorola would put out something as bad as this. Motorla insists there is not a problem, but I and a host of others disagree.If you load apps it really slows down so it is actually quicker for me to fire up my desktop and load e-mail than it is to get e-mail on the phone. Very frustrating when the screen freezes and you cannot answer or end a call.  I am doing hard resets about avery month (whereupon all the apps you loaded go away) and still having to pull the battery out about every third day to get the phone untangled.I could go on for weeks about the complete lack of acknowlegement of the problem by Motorola and the poor attitude of AT&T;, but will let you form your own conclusions!Bottom line and my problems aside, there are way better phones that have come on the market since this model was launched.

People send me texts and they show up as received on my AT&T; bill but they never make it to my phone.  If you are on a call where you are told to press \"1\" or \"2\" or whatever, you have to open the phone, wait for the light to come on, press the alt key and the number, then close it back up to listen again.  It's a horrible design.  The keyboard is awful - you can't use fingernails.  When you use your fingertip, it presses more than one key because they are so small (and I have small fingers).  If you use the alt key to get symbols, it gets stuck on all the time.  I can't even text more than a word or two without getting so frustrated I quit, and I used to send thousands of long texts.  If you want a computer and don't care about using the keyboard or the phone, you may like the backflip.

Kitchens \"deliberatespurothemoment\"", "ReviewID": "R3PRF6GZMLJLIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A relatively small phone that sports a backlit keypad the flips down. Once open your forefinger(s) rest on the unique touch pad on the back part of the screen. This allows you to scroll and browse hyperlinks without obscuring the screen by touching it (realistically at first we are more prone to touching the screen). Despite being a little used feature, having the choice is definite plus on the diminutive screen. Loading the Opera Mini app for improved website rendering speed will also let the touchpad feature shine. The keyboard also features arrow keys and the primary navigation buttons of android (back level, home, application menu).My primary interest in purchasing this item was having an Exchange capable work phone with SMS texting. I also wanted to load apps such as Words with Friends / Angry Birds or even advanced scientific calculators. The games run a bit slowly (hint: turn off background in Angry Birds). Other apps run just fine My messaging needs were met with the excellent MotoBlur aggregate tool that comes preloaded on Motorola Android phones. This tool can present a universal inbox that has your texts, SMS, and email accounts presented in a pleasing tile manner. I was pleased with the extra backend features that are paid services on platforms like Apple's MobileMe. A real boon when your various configurations choices are stored with your MotoBlur account. This allows easily transitioning to another (newer) Motorola Android phone later on. One fantastic feature of MotoBlur is a remote tracking of the phone using GPS and a remote wipe so you can protect your sensitive data if the Backflip is ever stolen or lost. MotoBlur does have its share of quirks, as some initial confusion confounded me pertaining to exactly on which service was I composing the message or from which address book was being used. For instance one email message to a coworker went to his defunct Facebook registered email address rather than his work email. I did like the tile like presentation of the information - it immediately reminded me of the new Windows Phone 7's manner of presenting important information on the main screen. I will be moving to another MotoBlur capable android phone for AT&T; rather than HTC or other for just these features. Motorola has added a service that makes using the Backflip a real timesaver.Caveats:A common source of frustration with attempting to text in collapsed \"phone\" mode was a propensity for my rather sausage-like fingers to hit the \"home\" button rather than the on screen keyboard's space button. I made a point of using the backflipping keyboard for important messages. Tilting the phone into landscape mode would have obviated this I suppose and increased the on-screen real-estate for the touch screen keyboard.It is a real shame the Motorola Roadmap flags this device to remain at Android 2.1 level. AT&T; also blocks some of the more interesting Android Marketplace options (such as the new Amazon AppStore for Android). Again, this phone will remain at 2.1. It would be great to see a 2.2 Froyo version with it's tighter code, better features and purported ability to leverage performance improvements even on older phones (this was released in 2010 and it speaks to the Android marketplace that Backflip is considered dated). The processor in the Backflip really suffers in comparison to modern Android phones such as the Optimus S (sprint) or Optimus V (Virgin Mobile). This is primarily due to the graphics chips in newer phones that offload much of the grunt work of rendering onscreen eye-candy from the main processor resulting in a much smoother user experience.Final Word:The phone still has performance enough to serve most entry-level android user needs.

All of the throwing and dropping was accidental. It's even been stepped on. This phone has no cracks or flaws in the screen. All of the buttons work. There's some scratches on the phone's body that are purely cosmetic only. Not to mention, there's powder that was used at an old job buried all through out the phone. The speakers and the phone itself works perfectly, with the exception of sometimes the screen freezes (to fix, just push the power button to lock then push it again and unlock) and it can be quite slow. The slowness didn't actually come until after I updated it. It's probably just got a really full memory. Overall, I love my phone. I wouldn't trade it. I've always been pleased with Motorola. No, it's not the quality of Nokia (you know, those dinosaur phones that lasted for forever), but it's pretty close with the latest and greatest. While my friends have gone through iPhones, my phone has stayed tried and true. I don't have to get a new phone for the good features. I will also say that the camera is fantastic.
