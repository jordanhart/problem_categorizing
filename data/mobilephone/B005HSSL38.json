GPS is better than my old iPhone, with turn by turn voice navigation--and it's FREE. QWERTY keys are very easy and responsive. Camera is 5mp and captures DVD quality video, which is amazing for a phone in this price range. Links right up with email services. Screen is bright and works well in sunlight. Comes with business apps, like QuickOffice, and you can get a lot more apps. All-around sleek, sturdy, and powerful phone.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "basingstoke", "ReviewID": "RDI8FXMT2BX72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This arrived really fast, within less than a week. The price was decent, a little cheaper than Walmart. So far the product seems perfectly good. I got it activated and working within hours the day it arrived. Be aware, it has the same coverage as AT&T;, so if you don't have that in your area, don't get this phone. For me on the other hand, it's great, because we don't get Sprint service out here in the country, but we do get AT&T.; Just be forewarned.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "fast business phone", "Author": "sysadmin", "ReviewID": "R1RAHXITTO8JC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "600 MHz ARM11 processor, fast phone, great responsive keys, slim design, solid feel, qwerty keyboard, 5mp camera, 3.5 headphone jack great for regular headphones, 3g internet speed, wifi, bluetooth 2.1, Great alternative to blackberry.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT OVERPAY FOR THIS PHONE ON AMAZON (read on)", "Author": "John Raisor", "ReviewID": "R1O16IARZTF56A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phone.

Great Ideas with poor implementation.", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2415EZ4NPDG4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in March 2013. In about 5 months it started to suffer 'out-of-memory' errors. I attempted to remove as much off of the phone's memory as possible (using the Office-FIle Manager dialog) however, even doing that did not alleviate the memory problem. The errors went on for 3 more months. Finally, last night, I guessed that maybe all of the old emails in my Google were using the memory so I deleted them. After that, the phone would never initialize correctly again. I called StraightTalk customer support today. They were unable to fix the E5 over the phone so they decided they would ship me a new phone free of charge after I return the old one (which I am doing tomorrow). The customer service decision to ship a new phone made me very satisfied with the service. The support folks provide a PAID return label for FedEx. The phone is the reason I can only give 2 stars. It has a great many nice features, however, the flaws (memory issues) with the phone make me wonder if I would ever pay $159 for this phone again. The answer is no.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "No issues", "Author": "Deborah", "ReviewID": "R1Z4P2X5QWJK6D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone works great as I had expected :) would have liked it to arrive a little sooner, but no issues with the phone itself :)", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "cpuldn't activate", "Author": "Ted Davis", "ReviewID": "R3UWDM5LDA7JJJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Straighttalk wouldn't activate for this area, this was a good buy and not Amazon's fault.I will continue to buy from them.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overpriced", "Author": "AMCBEE", "ReviewID": "R3LACVIG8SEBVB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You can buy this phone new at Wal-Mart for 149.99 -s&h.; Why so high?
