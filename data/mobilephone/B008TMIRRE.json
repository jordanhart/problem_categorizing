{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Needs Recalled", "Author": "Kyle J. Karwatski", "ReviewID": "R1B1AVFK10GNH7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a PRODUCT REVIEW, not a SELLER REVIEW.This phone, Huawei Ascend II (M865c), should not be being sold to anyone.The model that works through Straight Talk has issues with network connectivity.Half of the people who purchase this phone experience these problems.When the phone is rebooted, the device fails to connect to the tower and is stuck in an inaccessible mode while the only thing displayed is a loading sign.This has been experienced by multiple of the same phone across multiple states. (They sent me replacements that all had the same issue)The program inside the phone is called com.huawei.android.keypadprogramming. This program crashes from the issue.---So, you may not experience these issues immediately, but after you reboot a few times, you will experience this.Straight Talk is aware of the issue. The deny being aware, however one of their employees (Vincent) informed me that it is well known with recent Huawei devices on the Sprint network (this phone operates on the Sprint network).The phone manufacturer is also aware of this but will not release a patch for the phone because the cost outweighs the benefits for them.---Regarding Straight Talk customer service... Please demand your money back if you have this issue. They (the managers on the support lines) have lied to me many times over the past few months and I have not receive a refund. Please do not be fooled by them. Ask for corporate.---Regarding these sellers on Amazon: This phone is not worth $140. You can buy it brand new from Straight Talk for $100... But, obviously, you don't want to do that.---I hope this helps you make a decision on your phone choice.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Most Abysmal Piece of Crap EVER!", "Author":

I couldn't say to anyone, even my worst enemies to buy this phone; it is that bad. Upon start up, the phone needs to be restarted. One night, it took me 2 hours to actually be able to make a call.

I soon found out that this phone has a lot of problems. About 6 months after I had bought it, the phone started to force close and not restart when I power it off. I had to factory reset the phone and set it back up. It also started to force close the programs and even automatically close the programs without any warning whatsoever. About 1 month ago, maybe 2, I started having problems with the charger cable/port not charging the phone and had to replace the charging cable for it. All the while, all the other problems kept getting worse. Then just yesterday, the charger port stopped working all together and won't even charge now. I now have a phone that is completely useless to me. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. IT IS A PIECE OF S***. I'm not even planning on having the phone replaced and just buy a completely new phone through a different provider.

First I can say unless you just want to talk on this phone only then that is its only redeeming quality. That is absolutely horrible. For a prepaid phone this doesn't really have any features beside it being a touch screen. The Wi fi drains your battery to nothing in a matter of minutes. It flat out sucks. Also the processor its not the fastest even with a 4mb memory card. I do not like the fact that I have to reset this phone multiple times whenever there is a problem. Visiting my friend in Texas even hard resetting the phone didn't work. Even though Facebook has Android games this phone isn't compatible with most versions. Straight talk should reconsider their business model for releasing this useless heap of garbage to the market. YouTube usually won't play and when it does sucks the life our of your battery faster than you can blink. Of course if your fingers are too big you'll be cussing the phone more than recommending it. This is the worst phone I've ever had. I love the straight talk service but I think I'll be better off eve  I pay a little more and upgrade to Verizon.

When I bought it the thing was great for the longest time.

My phone held up great until I started having the \"Keypad\" programming issues. I've called customer support so many times I don't even care to try anymore. They've sent me replacement phones and what not but to no avail. Of late my main problem has been my text messaging as the keypad programming can be taken care of, if only for a limited time, by factory resetting the phone. No matter where I am whether I have full service or not, full 3g coverage. My phone will not send messages. Only after I resend the messages does it finally send to the person i'm trying to contact. Once again i've called customer support. They state there's connectivity issues in my area, really the capital city of Indiana is having connectivity issues for 3-5 days?! No one else within my friends group is having any issue out of their straight talk phones. So i'm assuming it's once again the phone having issues.
