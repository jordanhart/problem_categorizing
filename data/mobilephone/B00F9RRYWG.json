I turn off all unnecessary apps (extras) and battery now holds very good charge. Nice display, Wi-Fi, bluetooth, good screen response, pretty fast, Sim card included this is big plus. Camera is ok, no flash though. SD card slot.

Almost never even a minor hiccup. Even the hotspot works OK for a fraction of the cost of iPad data service.

But, MetroPcs sells it for just $29 at the Metro website and neighborhood MetroPcs stores. It runs on T-Mobile's 3G network, which is strong in most large cities and in some smaller cities.  Use the coverage map at the MetroPcs website to verify coverage in your neighborhood BEFORE you buy a MetroPcs phone.The Valiant is fine for calls and texting. Its tiny internal memory makes it a bad choice for gamers and folks who want to install dozens of apps. You must add a memory card to store your music and photos.The camera is useless indoors but takes okay photos in bright sunlight.  Music sounds poor through the rear speaker but fine through headphones or a Bluetooth speaker.Bottom Line: the Valiant will let you make phone calls and send texts on the bargain $40 a month unlimited plan from MetroPcs.  If you lose it or drop it, you are out $29.  THIS is the phone to take on your next canoe trip or hiking adventure, not a $600 phone named after fruit.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible Value", "Author": "Cecil B", "ReviewID": "R2SK1AL6K641GM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Costs as little as $19.99Dual Core CPUGood Battery LifeNice DisplayCons: Will not Play COD GhostsNo Flash on the cameraNo Front CameraI will attempt to practice Brevity on this review.The phone comes with 4GB of storage, 2GB is dedicated to the OS. This means that you have to either be very selective in what apps you install, or be proactive on deleting apps that you aren't using. It has a removable battery and SD Slot, so there is no problem with putting all the media you want on it.The phone has a dual core CPU and 768MB of RAM, and performs the way you would expect a phone with those specs to perform, snappy and responsive. This is where budget phones tend to fail, they often still come with single core CPU and 512MB or less of RAM, and get bogged down quickly, this phone doesn't have that problem. It runs apps flawlessly that I have seen more expensive phones with similar specs fail to run at all.I haven't attempted to root this phone, but I did unlock it. I bought the unlock code via Ebay for $3. I paid $29.99 for the phone directly from Metro PCS (it is currently available from Metro for $19.99 with no rebates), that makes less than $33 for an unlocked 3G GSM phone that is a decent performer.I have used and worked on a lot of cell phones over the years, I can't think of any available for close to this price that hold a candle to this phone. I will be buying a couple more at $19.99 , I will unlock them, and stick them in a drawer as spares, so when family member break their S3, Nexus and LG G2 phones, we will have a capable backup until their better phone can be replaced.This phone is perfect for novice users who don't want to invest much into a smartphone while they decide if it is right for them (most smartphones in the price range are tough on beginners because they so underpowered), it is also great for more advanced users to keep around as a backup or to carry in situations where the fear losing or breaking a more expensive phone. It won't keep an advanced user completely satisfied, but it will keep them going in that several day period between losing the old phone and getting the new one.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "iPhone is a massive ripoff", "Author": "S.

Yeah iOS is slick,  the iPhone feels better made, but its not 20 times or more better to support the price you pay for it. While short on space its nothing qn SD card mini wont cure.

My wife liked it and wanted one and knowing I usually find better prices on Amazon I looked here, at the time I think the price was 63.00 bucks AND once we recieved it and got it activated (17 dollars) at our local store the total was STILL less than I paid and we still had a bit of scratch left to get a hybrid gel case and screen protection. . . . of course I got both here, LOL.So now we are ordering some for the kids.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "stopped charging", "Author": "Maura Murcko", "ReviewID": "R30OMWU4373UBH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "bought this for my daughter for Christmas.

It is is not a S5, but for less than you'd probably spend a month on service, it will do all the basics without much complaint (except for maybe the camera).
