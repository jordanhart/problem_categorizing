Obviously I have no complaints about the price.  It's an ok phone.  Nice size buttons and they are raised so you don't have to use your finger nail to punch in a number.  Fairly decent display but only 3 or 4 wallpapers which are not so hot.  Sound could be better but I'm still testing.  Sound is the most important thing to me.  But, since it has a camera, I began taking lots of pictures.  Then I bought a data cable to transfer them all over to the PC.  Turns out, this phone does not support data cable transfer even though Tmobile and Samsung and a bazillion merchants on the internet sell a data cable for this phone.  Pretty crappy arrangement for a camera phone (not to mention costly).  Without data transfer, it costs you 25 cents per picture to email it to yourself in order to get it on your computer.  Just so you know the score and don't spend days (as I did) trying to get this matter straightened out with the seller, Tmobile and Samsung.  The data cable that they sell for this model only functions as a charger, not data transfer.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty basic phone", "Author": "jchen3", "ReviewID": "RBIQYMYBV4LGD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a very long time, probably 3 years already it it has served me well.  The reason I am writing a review is to clarify somethings that other people have said.  First, you cannot compare this phone with a more advanced phone; it's only a flip phone, nothing else.  This phone is really for people who only use it to call or text and the other things like the alarm which I used so the camera doesn't need to be superb and the screen resolution doesn't need to be clear either.People have stated that this phone is flimsy but I can tell you, my phone has survived a great deal like drops but it's still intact.  Some have said that the volume isn't very good but for me, it's loud enough, sometimes even too loud, then again, I'm not one of those people who blasts their music on their earphones.Sometimes it does display low or no bars, but I have never dropped a call.  I do wish that this phone was able to set the alarm to vibrate rather than just music so you won't disturb others when it goes off.Overall, it's a good phone to keep around if you aren't into smartphones or texting because it provides the basics pretty well.  The front screen displays the time which I use all the time.  The battery lasts a long time, a week for me, if you don't use it too much for calling.  It's a good little phone, great for a child who's given their first or second phone.  Usually I don't write reviews but some comments I read were contrasting to my experience so I wanted to bring it up front.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome, just what I needed!", "Author": "Mandee Lynn", "ReviewID": "R1MUDKRT8J02H6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought the phone, I read a lot of the reviews. I got mixed feelings because sometimes you just never know, and reviews are the only way to really get a feel for something you buy online. Well, I was kind of reluctant to buy this phone because I have a T-Mobile Plan and this said \"Pre-paid\" so I was little concerned that it wouldn't work with a T-Mobile contract plan.  Not one of the reviews really clarified it for me if I could use a Sims Card with an already-contract.  I was buying it for my grandmother who needed an easy to use flip phone... something she could flip open to answer and flip close to end a call. This phone seemed perfect so I decided to buy the phone anyway and give it a try and to my surprise, it does work with a Sims card for a contract and not just a pre-paid one. However, T-Mobile has changed their Sims cards to be smaller now, so if you do buy the phone, you will need to go in and get the \"old style\" Sims card for this phone to work.The phone was received before the delivery date and in perfect condition!  (No real wear and tear or scratches.) The charger and battery were in the packing with the phone, so there is no need to order a separate battery or charger.  The phone works just fine and holds a charge and is very nice for the price I paid.I would gladly buy this phone again and I bought the phone from the seller: recellulartoo.  I would greatly recommend this seller!", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive basic flip phone--small and lightweight", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R2Y5P19ATGN32V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Cheap-got at BB on sale for 20-Good size keys for texting-Small, lightweight-Can sync contacts from T-mobile siteCons:-Old school graphics, fuzzy, and colors not bright-Can't connect to your PC (when will Samsung get it and start using USB connection?)-Camera is only 640x480.The biggest drawback of this phone is that you have to \"send\" any pictures you take because there is no ability to connect to your computer.  The phone advertises bluetooth but it is useless, except for using a headset but I don't use one...other reviewers have mentioned problems in general with the bluetooth. Texting options are limited and inconvenient for symbols, caps, etc. but I don't text much myself so that isn't a problem for me. Reviewers have complained about the phonebook not being easily accessible but all you have to do is push on the \"down\" part of the circular function area and it comes right up. The \"up\" button brings up your call records so you can quickly call any entry there. Only two steps to send a text message...press the center OK button and then \"send message\", couldn't be easier so I don't know why people are complaining that you have to go through multiple steps to get to these basic functions (some Cnet reviews).

Furthermore, you can switch to regular entry (ABC), but that is on a per-text basis; you are not able to change the default setting permanently.  Also, after nearly two years, the phone keeps shutting itself off even though the phone is fully charged.  I've missed quite a few calls due to this problem.  However, since the phone is no longer under warranty, I'm unable to get the phone fixed for free.Advice:  If you want a phone that lasts, don't choose this one.

However, it's always nice to have peace of mind in carrying a phone when driving around, due to potential crimes, accidents, tow service, or simply to make a call to a friend or family in a sponteanous event of need.  This is where Tmobile's prepaid shines because I can do all the above with their Gold Rewards plan.  Simply purchase a $100 card and your prepaid account turns to GOLD status which means your minutes don't expire for a year AND if you top off the account with as low as $10, all your minutes roll over and last another YEAR.  So if you read this right, that means you can theoretically get annual prepaid service for $10 idefinitely.  Of course, this only works if you don't use a lot of minutes - which works fine for someone who sparsely uses their phone to begin with.As for the T139 itself, it's a typical small flip phone.  Text entry was easier than I remembered with these numeric keypads so not too bad for short messages.  Camera is VGA but quality is surprisingly pretty decent and useable for situations where you need it.  Battery life is, of course, phenomenal when compared to any smart phone.  Also, with bluetooth, if you keep this in your car and hook it up to a cig charger, you can have a real \"car phone\" where the bluetooth will just sync all the time to your radio and never worry of a dead battery.Overall, if you're looking into purchasing a secondary phone with prepaid, this is a great model to get.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just a Paperweight after 6 months", "Author": "C.

It feels good in your hand. It has survived being dropped  on the pavement a few times. Sound quality for handheld is fine. It's cute. Buttons very easy to see and to push. Battery life is great.Cons: What I failed to see anyone mention in other reviews is that if you want to use a headset, you have to purchase one made specifically to connect with this phone. This is also true if you need to buy a new charger for home or car. This is a major flaw, both for the environment and for your pocketbook. The sound quality is fine, unless you want to use the speaker. I can generally hear fine using the speaker, but the other person often cannot hear me. Sound quality w/bluetooth is impossible.  As another reviewer mentioned, texting is a drag, because you have to set it each time for 'abc' --  how lame is that? Also there is no address book to enter physical addresses. The menu is complicated and annoying. But then, I was used to the ease and simplicity of my old Nokia.I had a Nokia flip phone before this one, also very simple and inexpensive. It had all the features this one doesn't. I used it for years. The only reason I bought the Samsung is because the Nokia is no longer available. If anything will drive me to a smart phone, it will be this Samsung. I haven't been able to find a headset yet, and even if I do, don't know if I want to invest $ in a headset that can work only with this phone.I wouldn't buy it again, but..options are limited with t-mobile if you want a basic phone.

The representative moved forward with the activation using the electronically stored IMEI# and told me to purchase airtime in order to complete the activation process which would take several hours. Several hours later the phone had not been activated, and a second TMobile representative stated his records showed the IMEI number for the phone had previously been reported lost or stolen and the phone could not be used.The good news is with a couple of clicks I had a return receipt from Amazon for the phone and SIM card I purchased to use with the phone, along with an appointment for UPS to pick up the package within 2-5 business days.

The problem is not the cable not doing data; the cable would do data if the phone let it. If you get a Bluetooth dongle, you will have your phone and your USB dongle, but, it is no improvement. You cannot transmit data (jpg, mp3, etc.) by any non-cellular method, not by USB Bluetooth dongle, not by cable, not by IR, not by pairing to another better phone (it won't), not to a card or dongle enabled PC (it won't).  So you are stuck to either emailing yourself or another phone with real Bluetooth capability instead of this phony wireless Bluetooth (pun intended).The Bluetooth connectivity Samsung, T-Mobile and other vendors are peddling only permits the use of hands free talking and Bluetooth headphones. It does not permit file exchange or pairing to any computers, other phones, or any other device. Don't learn the hard way (I did). For this reason the phone is a piece of junk if you want to do more than talk or message. If you don't believe me, just go into the Bluetooth menu on the phone. You will find Bluetooth profile selections for using only headphones or hands free. Nothing else.I'm giving it 3 stars as a consolation since it actually feels good in my hand.  I'd like to give it one star because it is almost impossible when reading all the current internet literature to learn what \"Bluetooth\" capability this phone really has, especially for the unsuspecting consumer.  I finally confirmed my suspicions after a few days of trouble by calling the person who handles returns in a local Wal-Mart.  Yup ... lots of returns sir due to that limitation on Bluetooth.  It does have connectivity by only for headphones and hands-free and although I agree with you that it is deceptive if you are buying one of these cheapies for the first time, you will find many other cheapies have the same limitation on Bluetooth.  And, you can't return it since yours was purchased 16 days ago and our return policy is only 14 days in Wal-Mart for cell phones.
