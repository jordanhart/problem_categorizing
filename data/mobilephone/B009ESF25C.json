To start, it's casing is made from machined polycarbonate which allows it to fit like a glove in your hand.  The polycarbonate has a great texture which is both soft and grippy.  Words really can't describe it, you have to actually hold the phone to appreciate it.  The screen is beautiful and Windows 8 customization makes iOS and Android look boring.  We now have 4 on our T-Mobile family plan because my two college son's (who both wanted the Galaxy SIII) changed their minds when they got to play around with my phone for a while.  We have had zero issues with these phones so far.  16 gigs is plenty so I don't miss the lack of an SD card and we love the ROOMS feature which allow us to have shared calendars.  I have my own calendar, a shared a calendar with my wife and we have a family calendar that my wife loves where she can enter all our family plans so everyone knows what's going on.  Each has it's own color and we can post photos and notes to share with all your group members.  The facebook integration is loved by our two college boys because you can text and facebook chat in the same screen without having to log on to facebook.  If you want to contact a friend you just go to messaging, a big time saver.  Get one while you can because this phone will be a monster hit for sure.  There are plenty of apps if you need them but Windows 8 has everything you need built in and the web browsing looks great.  It's easily a five star rated product.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC 8x", "Author": "RichardP", "ReviewID": "R2DRERLJJF19XB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is great. It is light enough to hold, feels good...no rough edges... very balanced. OS is of course stunning. It is so fast, both in the navigation of the phone UI, and browsing the net.Only three complaints.1. The camera button activates the damn camera with the slightest of touch, so if you hold it in the left hand your ring finger hits it all the damned time. I do have fairly large hands, so natives to OZ may have better luck than me.2. The Bluetooth makes initial connection to my car (2006 BMW 5)then drops the connection. My old phone was the hd7 and that uses Bluetooth 2.1, which the 8x uses as well. So no idea what that problem is all about, but a pisser nonetheless.3. Office app and saving documents. In WP7 if you had access to your corporate SharePoint server the built in app would not connect to it unless you made somewhat major changes to the authentication process, in WP8 that is not the case. You can easily add your SharePoint site to your office app and browse with no problems q.... the complaint is after you create a site link, that link does not show up in your MS office apps. So you can create a new word doc and save it to SharePoint, you can thankfully open a doc from SharePoint mod it and save it.Over all best phone/os I have used.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "has offline maps", "Author": "Aman", "ReviewID": "R230EXM6OYEJJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is amazingly nice to hold and use with one hand. It feels very thin (the spec sheet does not do it justice sine it only lists the maximum thickness but not the hand friendly shape).The phone has offline maps. While Nokia makes a big deal out of that feature on the Lumias, the feature is in fact also present on the 8X. Under the Maps app, click the three dots near the bottom edge to open the app menu, go to settings, and look under download maps. This means that one can use the maps app without a data connection, its faster in that mode even in my local region but the real advantage will be when traveling outside the US where the data plan is either unavailable or extremely expensive. The GPS and maps can now work without Internet.The built in wireless charging is very useful. I wish HTC had offered a matching charging plate. Right now the options seem to be the Qi charging plate from either Nokia or Energizer. They both work great, but the Nokia does not come in black, and the Energizer one is a little too big to look at (though works well).The icons on the home screen look so much cleaner than the iPhone and Android screens. One can customize the icon sizes to suit ones own usage style. This is more useful than I originally realized.The Facebook integration in the People app is another very nice feature. Gives you all your contacts and FB updates in one place. Have hardly openned the facebook website or their mobile app since I got this phone.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Feel in the Hand", "Author": "Moriel", "ReviewID": "R251HITO7PVPTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this phone.  The edges are very thin (maybe 3mm) and the back is curved thanks to HTC's innovative reordering of the internal components.  Many other phones (iPhone, Galaxy S3, Nexus 4) have a screen, followed by an L shaped chipset + antenna, followed by a battery.  HTC put the battery between the screen and the chipset, allowing them to make the battery thinner but maintain the same volume.  This makes for a super thin phone that nestles into the cup of your palm.  I keep picking it up for no reason what so ever, just to play a game or search for a new app, because it is so much fun to hold.Windows Phone 8 is mostly awesome.  It  is super fast integrates excellently with my email, facebook, and twitter.  One thing to note, on Verizon--Microsoft and HTC compromised to please the carrier.  The tap for turn-by-turn directions that were present in all of HTC's Windows Phone 7 devices has been removed.  In its place is a link to Verizon's VZ navigator voice turn-by-turn app.  VZ navigator actually works quite well, but it costs $2 a month after the first 30 days of a free trial.  I'm not sure if this is present on the AT&T; version of this phone, but I know the international (unlocked) version still includes native tap for turn-by-turn directions for free.  Verizon is to blame, but Microsoft and HTC didn't have to let them be that greedy either.As others have mentioned, the buttons are slightly wobbly and could use a little more travel to provide a more satisfying click, but I got use to them after a couple days of use.  All in all I am very happy with this phone.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Actually a Verizon branded phone", "Author": "Thomas Winckler", "ReviewID": "R2C8TIEUYY8N26", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was actually a Verizon branded phone which has pros and cons. It has the international radio so it shows H, H+, instead of 4G or LTE. Speed is good.Pros: Verizon enabled NFC charging and it has 32GB of storage which was never available from AT&T.;Cons: Cannot enable MMS messaging because Verizon no longer enables configuration of the APN. Text messages can be sent and received but not media messages.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone in Windows 8 Space", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3IHWMHW39NONG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HTC 8X is definitely a incredible design and ergonomic. Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC 8x Mostly good", "Author": "Kenny", "ReviewID": "R22RS4461YBLFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like everything about how the phone looks and feels(I got the blue one myself). Its very fast and responsive with windows 8 and just looks great. It also has Xbox integration and I can connect it to my pc to which is cool, the camera is also pretty good not the best but good. The Built in skydrive is also very nice as I can upload pics and such and listen to music on it.There are things that I wish this phone had like a SD Card slot(This wouldn't be a problem if my phone came with more the 8gb), or being able to take out the battery and put in a better one without taking the whole phone apart(The Battery life is ok not great). The marketplace for windows is not as big as Android or iOS and dont get all of those apps, but there still is alot of apps and its always growing.I would Give it 4.5 Stars", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!!", "Author": "Jeffrey G.

I have owned the iPhone 4S and Galaxy S3 recently and the HTC 8X blows these away. The look, feel, and internals are first class. This is a quality looking and feeling phone that fits great even in my smallish fingers. Call quality is very good as well as the camera.The Windows 8 OS is smooth and intuitive however, there are some very annoying omissions which are inexcusable and which detract from the overall experience. Some of these can be easily addressed by updates and new apps on the store. On the upside, Skydrive works seamlessly.Specifically:1. Internet Explorer does not sufficiently zoom in text while keeping the margins. I need my reading glasses to browse where on my Android devices I never did.2. No way to stop chime when plugging in to power source and when received voice mail, no matter what you do in the settings except if you have phone in silent mode. This is a big problem when you have an infant. Should be addressed in settings. Why can't I turn these 2 notifications off without being in silent mode?3. Lack of navigation app. Nokia Drive or something by Microsoft desperately needs to be made available for other WP8. Again, this is not excusable for such an important launch.4. App store is very weak still. It is telling when the top paid  app on the store is a battery level app.Other than these annoyances, the OS works smoothly.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Eh.", "Author": "SixintheNest", "ReviewID": "R1MGUHLH5FDRVL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Things I don't like:No radio.Very small/not noticeable buttons.Very thin phone.

There is an energy saving detail but if you use that then the phone is not as fast and unfortunately that is one of the only things I really like about the phone - the speed.  Finding the on switch at the top is annoying because it is very small. I've figured out how to slide my finger across the top so I'm not pressing all the spots where I think the button  might be (when not looking at it).  When you click on the phone icon, the first screen that comes up is \"visual voicemail\" and you have to enter a password to listen to your voicemail or hit cancel then the first thing that comes up is the missed and dialed calls. With iPhone4, if you  hit the phone icon, it brings you back to whatever you last left it on but htc doesn't do that  When you go to the people list after clicking cancel to get out of \"visual voicemail\" is you find that all the Facebook people show up in your phone list. ALL of them even if you never call them. If you have a ginormous \"friend\" compilation on FB then you will have that list under \"people\"There is a separate \"people\" window on the home page (unless you delete it) which is okay except it continually moves rotating photos of everyone on your FB page (their primary photo on their account) and I'm really not interested in that (plus it drains the battery) but cannot find anyplace to delete that. Also the \"people\" window is not just phone - it's everyone on Facebook/social network sites and Email accounts.  The people list for phone numbers has (as stated above) everyone in FB to include people whose phone numbers you don't have. The other people that show up in that phone list are everyone in your Email groups.  If you have more than one email account with the same people on each email, you HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY combine them.  If you want to know how many bars you have for signal strength, you have to touch the screen at the top at just the right place to get that to display.  When using the phone you have to be ultra careful how you handle the phone because there is a search touch spot at the and if you touch that by accident, the phone will immediately pull up bing. Not only do I not want that to happen, I freaking hate bing. But hate bing or love it, do you really want to barely touch the edge bottom right of your phone to end up on an internet search site? It's ridiculous.  If you are used to fun iPhone applications, say goodbye to them because most of them don't exist for windows and the ones that do are not all user friendly. I went onto Facebook and got into a person's page to wish her a happy birthday but the post button didn't exist (but it exists online and on my iPhone app) so I had to add a happy birthday as a comment under someone else's post.  The photos are poor, especially in low light. The color is completely off and the images are not very good in terms of clarity. I don't expect a phone to take the place of a camera but I do expect a decent photo and this does not deliver.________________________________________________________I keep wanting to hit send then I remember something else I hate about this phone. I started to list my big negatives then realized I was just retyping everything I already typed. The phone is going back. I am having big problems with iphone4 - it's transmitting horrific amounts of data over cellular when it's asleep and even though the house is wireless, it uses cellular which makes all the data (that I'm not even using thank-you-very-much) count against my monthly totals. The iphone4 issue is the only reason I \"upgraded\" to this piece of junk. I'll go back to iphone4 and see if I can tweak it more. If that doesn't work, I'll try the Samsung 3s.Cheers!", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009ESF25C"}}
