Rather than changing my number completely and just doing this simple task I'm not having to buy a whole new sim card and that's just money I could have invested long ago when I Received my iphone, which i'm currrently unable to use to my disappointment. This product alone however is beautiful, runs like a new phone, and slick to the touch. I'd recommend this seller in using phones but beware---cutting a go phone sim card can be costly when doing it wrong. I advise just getting the new at&t; sim card and getting a new number. It'll save much disappointment and money.BIG THING HERE: The seller sent the product on time and earlier than I expected. It arrived in a package and bubble wrap ( love bubble wrap). There were no scratches, or hints of it ever being used---I've read some reviews and said this wasn't so, but on mine it's brand new. No sim card arrives with it, but there did come a cord with it in order for me to connect it to my computer. Didn't expect this so I'm ecstatic! :D", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This product is not brand new, is refurbished and not unlocked", "Author": "Francesco Bocanelli", "ReviewID": "R22TK5GLHII12M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I buy this product brand new, but the phone has come up with some stripes.

Came with United Kingdom wall charger, with USA travel adapter, for use in my country. It is larger than the standard USA wall charger, and not what I expected, but a minor issue. Apple warranty was only for about 9 months, after I checked at the Apple store after buying, not one year like the re-seller said. This phone was fulfilled by Amazon. Check with re-seller (not Amazon) when buying this phone regarding warranty, sealed box, and wall charger type.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Iphone", "Author": "Penny Y.
