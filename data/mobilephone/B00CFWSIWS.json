The appearance is good, the screen and resolution is great HD720 but its not samsungs AMOLED but it is a quad core and its fast and does what its designed to do.  It does have the A-GPS along with a few other things so you have to go and turn off manually to maximize battery use.  I personally do not enable this unless I travel and use this phone as a GPS.  It also comes with 2 batteries.  The cameras work great for quick pics.  It can also support 2 sim cards, one regular and one micro sim and supports up to 32gb micro sd card.  The phone itself has a 5gb storage as well.  The design is of course a little different from the real Galaxy S4 but for the price and my experience so far using this phone has been worth the money without breaking the bank.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "Rashad", "ReviewID": "R2PX9NED0PJ9RM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love My phone, although i cannot buy any case to fit my phone it work fine,I wouldve liked a better camera quality though.
