I did a lot of research into which phones best suited my needs (email, web browsing, messaging) and the Z30 seemed like the best fit.  From the first day I bought it I haven't been able to put it down.  It is by far the best phone I have ever used and I could never go back to using an iPhone again.  The hub is one of the best creations in an OS and organizes your email, notifications and messages in a central place.  It definitely makes me more efficient.  I highly recommend this phone to anybody that is tired of the android or iOS experience.  You will definitely be amazed.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "THE BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "JULIO", "ReviewID": "R2IKPX0ZVVTP4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SUPER SIZE, SUPER CAMERA, SUPER BATTERY, BEST SOUND EVER OF ANY SMARTPHONE !JUST PERFECT!, HIGHLY RECOMENNDED....UPDATED TO 10.2.1, ANDROID APPS OVER WHEELS !", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "victor", "ReviewID": "R3HFU08P89BCCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a blackberry user long time ago.

It is just small enough to manage in one hand while being large enough to read and view the content. It is responsive and fast. It takes a while to gain skill at using only gestures, but after learning, it is hard to go back to other phones. The key apps are available including many Android apps even if there are not a million apps. Great battery life too.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love love", "Author": "s.smith", "ReviewID": "R28VIBBHMVEUV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My phone I think this is the best phone I ever bought while I was looking at phones to buy I settled for this one because all the new phones out there can't touch this one so I'm pleased", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "BLACKBERRY Z30 IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE", "Author": "Elizabeth Williams", "ReviewID": "R1MKYV6SGT613K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HAVE NO REGRET YET USING THIS PHONE AND I HOPE I WON'T IN ANYWAY..I'M SUPER IN LOVE WITH THA APPS, THE BATTERY, THE SCREEN AND ALL IT'S FEATURES", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is The Phone!!!", "Author": "E.Kosh", "ReviewID": "RNL614VPD4YSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone for about a month. And never regretted paying $499.00 at BlackBerry store. Having three IPHONE and two Samsung phones in a family and being old Nokia only fan since 90s ... I can only say that Z30 is all you want in your Phone . Great reception, longest battery life, clear sound - loudspeakers or microphone.  insanely excellent word prediction, well thought menu, perfectly laid out icons, fantastic build quality.Had BlackBerry Pearl in the past and really..had itAfter my old trusty N9 gave up i explored ideas of IPhone, HTC one, Samsung.Was trying to see Z30 before buying. Sadly NONE of Chicago area Verizon stores had Z30 in stock, Leave alone T Mobile pushing Samsung, HTC And I phones.Love this phone, no doubts the best I ever had !!!", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "\u00d0 BEST CHOICE!!!", "Author": "SwAnKy", "ReviewID": "RPCF0KWJY18A1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say at first purchasing this device online i was very skeptical however the experience since doing soo has been lovely!!!Nooooo regrets absolutely none.Phone works wonderful,the speedy,timely delivery was excelllent!!Would most def recommend anyone to purchase this or any other phone from this particular dealer!", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Z30 SmartPhone Black", "Author": "Sri M Wibowo", "ReviewID": "R162ULAF8SDF76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The user feels like the SmartPhone and it has been useful.
