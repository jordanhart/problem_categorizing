I dropped my Galaxy Note II, and needed something to get me thru until its repaired. It works fine- had to get a sim card from AT&T; phone center- (free) because mine has a micro sim card and this phone is just regular. But everything works great. It does come with an Intl plug in cord though, but I already have Samsung, so mine works fine.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": ".", "Author": "Ariadne Bosch", "ReviewID": "R1TL64FNJETUQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great phone easy to use.I bought for my sister and she is happy with her phone and the color too.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Oge", "ReviewID": "R2ML544IWQG5SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this phone for a month. it's a great phone. The camera gives clear picture. So far, everything works just fine. The applications are simply amazing...I don't have to wait to get on my computer all the time, and oh, i love the fact that I skype with it. Highly recommended!!! I couldn't find any reviews when i was making my purchase. I hope this helps someone.Ok, so I've used this phone for 4months and this an update. It still works as I stated earlier, but it suddenly turns itself off and on. At first, I didnt bother because those didnt happen often but after a while it got annoying(note that this doesn't happen very often...say twice in a month.Sometimes, the network suddenly disappears and I have to pull out the battery and stick it back for the network to start working again, but I think this may be a network issue rather than a phone-related problem. Hey, if you're looking for a phone that does skype video call, this is not the phone. It does wonderful skype call but does not enable video calls. I don't expect any other thing to go wrong, and I'm retaining my rating because the phone is great. Btw, i copied this from an earlier review of this phone just so I'd stop getting the prompt to review this product. Apparently, this is my amazon-verified purchase, but i'd reviewed the same phone elsewhere.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "thanks", "Author": "Enrique Garcia", "ReviewID": "R1LPWLXSN5DG2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "everything ok with the Samsung S5360 Galaxy Y Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Smartphone with Android OS . , .v . ,", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love my new phone!!!!", "Author": "Kellys Molina", "ReviewID": "RPYAWB82J14OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love it my new phone because it's working perfect, is beautiful and contains everything about new apps and functions", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great samsung galaxy y phone", "Author": "marlon", "ReviewID": "R1VZS1JRV2Z7LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The samsung galaxy y phone is great 5 star reccomend to any one.This phone is a very popular phone.love it.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "HATE IT", "Author": "shaneelg", "ReviewID": "R3RHT9GZ4GPCWU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hated the service, hated the phone, hated everything overall i had to unlock thee phone myself thanks to no good customer service", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0091WCKME"}}
