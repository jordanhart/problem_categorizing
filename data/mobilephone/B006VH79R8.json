I have Documents to Go installed which I use to edit Excel spreadsheets while on the bus or train. And it works great for that. I have Dolphin HD browser installed and web surfing works good. Not quite as fast as my spouses' Epic 4g but it did not cost nearly as much either. I also use to update Facebook occasionally, watch YouTube videos, play a few games (angry birds, totemo, and age of conquest) currently. Email and Words with Friends and I use Google Play for music and have a bunch of music on my SD card.  I noticed when I updated Google Play and YouTube and a few other things the phone started to lock up and touch screen was reacting very slowly. I uninstalled those updates and everything is working just fine again.-The screen is not the greatest. A lot of pixelation. If you are a heavy video watcher you should not get this phone.-The keyboard is great. I do a lot of entering of data and seller listings on my phone so I prefer a keyboard to a touch screen keyboard. You lose some screen size but when you are using the touch screen keyboard on phones without a keyboard you lose even more screen size.-The battery is about average for a Android phone.  You need to shut wifi, bluetooth, syncing and GPS when you are not using them. There is a great widget that puts big buttons on your home page so you can turn these on and off quickly. Dolphin Battery Manager works well for me too.-Internal space on phone. There is not much internal space on the phone and most apps don't let you install to the SD card. I can have between 5-10 apps installed at a time on the phone no problem. I keep some on my SD card and uninstall ones I am not using if I want to use a app that I don't have installed due to space constraints. It takes about 30 seconds to do. Not that big of a deal.Bottom line for the price it's a great phone. Its a great introduction to Android phones for a smart phone beginner.  And it's made of recycled materials and is one of only a few Green certified phones.

App world is the bomb, providing tons of music, directions, which are real convenient for me. I also enjoy the feel of the phone, it has some weight to it and feels of good quality, that along with the QWERTY keyboard and nice camera make this phone worthy of 5 stars. Also I accidentally locked myself out within an hr of owning but thankfully boost customer service was very compliant and helpful, once I got past their automotive voice mail (getting a phone rep can be a pain).

The phone is fairly sub-par, but I kind of expect to get what I pay for and was willing to take a little inconvenience for lower costs. Unfortunately the phone started having power issues after 9 months. We sent it to Samsung to have it repaired and it came back with the same problem. When I called to ask if there was anything else they could do for me, they said that the only way to fix it was to send it in AGAIN and be without it AGAIN. It is absolutely unbelievable that Samsung doesn't try harder to please their customers when they already tried to fix it once and it is their fault that it is not fixed. I spoke with 4 people up the chain of command and they all offered me the same pathetic options.

Some reviewers forget that most mobile providers subsidize their prices, so the price they paid does not reflect the cost of Hi-Def screens.I have not tried any apps out other than what was included with the phone, but this device was suprisingly free of bloatware. The music player sounds rather good with headphones, which is suprising with very few controls.The camera is great for outdoors or very bright indoor areas, but low light levels tend to wash out all the bright colors.All in all, I have to say that the Samsung Replenish is a great value for the first time Android user.UpdateAfter having this phone for a few months, I have nothing to detract from above. In fact this phone is much sturdier than I expected. I accidentally dropped this phone into a shallow puddle in my parking lot while it was raining, and I thought I might have ruined it.
