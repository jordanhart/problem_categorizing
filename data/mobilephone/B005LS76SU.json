If I could design a....  SMART.... PHONE this is it. Its a cell phone...remember them? And its smart:Android 4.0 upgrade, on line from Sony website. Unmatched picture quality. The only difference between this phone and the newest and greatest phones on the market is \"screen size\". If I want computer to go, I will buy a tablet. While manufacturer decided to go bigger and bigger to push sales,  the next place is the wrist watch phone. This is the size of original cell phones that fit in your pocket. Does everything Samsung and Iphone does, just \"smart\" size and low price and beyond compare display. Add the 'eForCity TPU Rubber Skin Case Compatible with Sony Ericsson Xperia Ray, Black S Shape' for $1.63 and enjoy everything needed for phone and smarts.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous looking phone", "Author": "purplep", "ReviewID": "R2OLH62FM4D91", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for half year. I am writing this review because I really like it.Performance: CPU is only ARMv7 1Ghz single core. RAM is 512MB, 340MB available. Internal memory 1GB, only 420MB available.  but it allows you to install 32GB Mircro SD card. It responds very slow if you open up many applications simultaneously. I would say the performance is in the 50-60 percentile as in 2012. But for a cell phone, I am more concerned with the specs listed below.Screen: 3.3 inch Reality Display with BRAVIA Engine makes the screen super clear. The design is very slim and light weight(100g). The touch screen is very accurate. There is also a protective mineral glass so no need to stick another layer of plastic screen film.Camera: 8 Megapixel, 720p recording. plus the super clear screen (297ppi), picture quality is better than the iphone 4s.Battery life: last about 24 hours, so I just charge it every night. Take about 4 hours to charge completely.Reception and clarity are fairly good.Feature: Walkman music player. Not only that sound quality is superb, but also the music playlist plays immediately when my phone connects to the bluetooth stereo of my car. I can switch songs with buttons on my steering wheel.Flashlight: it's located on the back and I can turn it on with one press.For the price, a couple hundred dollar cheaper than comparable iphone4, it is the good things comes in a small package.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best android cell phone", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "R3H8F3ZOXQGDT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, It's just like the description, and good quality, the price relation with the quality it's the best.
