{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally the proud owner of a Nokia Lumia 920 (international version)", "Author": "Pelico", "ReviewID": "RGHAR1DIOHZ9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 5 stars rating is as much for the seller (Mega Mobile) as it is for the phone. The phone is a true RM-821 (international unlocked). It looks like it came from HK. Everything is in Chinese (even the documentation). Took me only a couple of minutes to remove the Chinese setting, and replace it with English, and another language. It seems that the phone supports just about any language, and it's really easy to change language setting. (for some language, it requires a download, but with wi-fi it's not an issue).What can I say, the phone is incredible, very responsive, has Nokia Drive, Office, a great camera,... ( the list is too long to write here).The phone is great. but trying to buy the phone was a very frustrating experience. Amazon has a page with one phone specification, and several sellers. Unfortunately some sellers try to sell you an AT&T; unlocked for an international version. I found that it's very important for reviewers to start the review with the seller, what was ordered, and what was received. This will tremendously help people who want to buy the international version.I had contact with 4 sellers:1. Hollywood Merchandise (fulfill by Amazon); sold me an AT&T; unlocked RM-820(it was advertised as international, factory unlocked). Returned the phone. Thank to Amazon, the process was painless got my money back right away.2. Mega Mobile; sold me this phone, and it is as advertised (international, factory unlocked, RM-821)In between I was in contact with:1. Tablets Distributors; As per their e-mail to me they sell AT&T; unlocked phones.2. Global Mobiles; As per their e-mail to me they sell international unlocked phones (RM-821) that come from Europe.Their answer came after I ordered from Mega Mobiles.I hope this helps, the potential buyers who like me want a Nokia Lumia 920 international factory unlocked, but are at a loss as to what seller to buy it from.Update 6/13/13: The phone seems to have the latest updates; OS 8.0.10211.204, firmware: 1232.5957.1308.0004.One thing I forgot to mention about the seller, is that since the plug that was inside the Nokia box was incompatible with the U.S plug outlets. he added a U.S. adapter plug inside the box he sent me (nice touch).Update 11/21/13: Several week ago I installed the Amber update. Made a Great phone even better. Can't wait for the next 2 updates which will be available in the next few months.I liked the phone so much that I bought a second one for a family member. This time I bought the phone from 'The wireless circle'. The phone was as advertised (international version RM-821), and came several days ahead of schedule. This time the phone was from Czechoslovakia. Not a problem as it took only a couple of seconds to change to English (I had already downloaded the English manual for the phone), and actually better for me as it came with an European plug (it also have an US adapter in the box).Update 1/16/14: I would like to clarify few things for potential buyers:1. There are no factory unlocked Lumia phones built for the U.S market.2. Due to the above, buying a factory unlocked Lumia phone in the U.S. is buying from a grey market.3. There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market. Plus it will have some built-in apps (put there by Nokia) that target the local market the phone was intended for. That doesn't mean that the phone was used.5. Setting the phone to your desired language, downloading the user's guide in your desired language and removing the local apps is a matter of minutes.6. The plug will be a plug for the intended market, but there will always be a U.S. adapter in the box.  That might one the reason why the box is not sealed.I have bought 4 Lumias (2x 720 and 2x 920) from Amazon (received 6, returned 2 - one was defective, this other was AT&T; unlocked). They came from all over; Hong-Kong, Germany, Taiwan, and Czechoslovakia. I am very happy with my purchases, and will do it again.At $320 the Lumia 920 has great specs and is a great deal.  If you want to buy a Lumia phone, my advice is:1. Buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon. It might be a little more expensive, but if there is any problem Amazon is much easier to deal with (I received my refunded Money before they received the phone), than if you buy it fulfill by any other seller.2. Even if you buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon, contact the seller to make sure that the phone he sells is what is advertised on the web page.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "unlocked nokia lumia 920", "Author": "Ruslan", "ReviewID": "R359MJ783M3KOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered two new unlocked nokia lumia 920 thru Heavy Duty Electronics.I mentioned,when ordered, that those phones where for gifts and should be presented on July 25.Thanks to seller, I have got them before that date.I also asked seller to sell me additional adapter and he sent me before July 25 without additional cost.Thanks again to Heavy Duty Electronics.Great price and service.

The built quality is amazing, and it feels like a tank. Is heavier than most average smartphone (or even some phablets), but when holding it, you know it can't be broken easily.The interface is fluid and fresh, although the customization options are limited to tile size and color.Pros:- Camera: the best smartphone camera I have seen in my life- Nokia apps and services: Specially Maps (Nokia Here) and camera-realated apps.- Windows Phone Marketplace: Many people complains about lack of apps. I found everything I need (mostly free and with no ads).Cons:- No LED notification: coming from BB, this is something I really miss, and I don't know why this is a missing feature on almost every modern smartphone.- Battery: It charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). It took 3 hours to charge from 60% to 100% with a 2 amp wall charger. The discharge rate is more than 10% per hour (with regular use, no automatic backups/updates, low level screen brightness and only 2 backgroud apps running), so I cannot get more than 10 hours of juice.- WP8 still feels a little half-baked. Hopefully MS fixes some glitches in the upcoming updates. For example, inhability to close tasks more efficiently, the \"search\" soft button takes me to Bing, instead of search stuff inside the device, etc.Also, I must say that the seller (Heavy Duty Electronics) gave me an excellent service. The device was exactly as advertised and came in a sealed box, 100% brand new, and factory unlocked.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT SELLER, BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "Olisaebuka Maduka \"O.

They deliver on time, respond to questions, and the phone I received was brand new and in good condition (atleast for this brief time I've used it). And yes, it's RM-821 International factory unlocked!!!The Phone,It's phonetastic, camtastic, fastastic (a speedy little monster this one), strongta.... well you get were I'm going with this. The phone is Amazing, my sisters played with it briefly and now won't let me use it; one was asking how come she has never heard of the Lumia or windows phone before, seeing how great and fluid this phone is. Infact this fluidity is what has quite captivated them, that and the gorgeous user interface & hardware design.This phone was announced on the 5th of September last year (my birthday) and today fate has finally caught up with it because it was always meant to be mine.SUMMARY: A truly wonderful phone.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is an opened AT&T; product - different from description", "Author": "I.

I got mine from Mobicity. The phone came in dutch, but I was quickly able to switch it to english by using the google translator and selecting the right options. I configured the phone--amazingly, the Windows 8 tablet I have doesn't support POP accounts, but the phone does--had to migrate my contacts to the hotmail account to get them on the phone.I used to be a blackberry user, and it was a little painfull to switch and migrate the data. Windows Phone 8 consolidates all accounts and contacts in the people tile and it takes some time to get used to this. I use whatsapp for chatting and there are some options in blackberry that are not found in the Windows Phone version, such as adding a number to an existing contact. One thing that I trying to do with it is change the tile's color, not all of them but individually. For example, I have 4 email accounts and I would like to differentiate one from the others, but tiles can all change from color not individually.Another thing is that the volume buttons control all volumes at the same time, including ring, speaker, notifications, alarms, etc.Still, this phone rocks. When I take it to meetings, people stare a it. It takes the best pictures with low light I've ever seen. The grip is a little slippery. It has gotten away from my hands on 2 ocassions already and I'm actively looking for a cover.Office experience is great, gravity sensor is a little slow as it needs the phone to be at a given angle before it will tilt the screen.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "eventually they ended up refunding just part of my money", "Author": "ernest yomeche", "ReviewID": "R3EWLCNKURLL77", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a nokia lumia phone from on the go solutions. the product came defected. after getting them to send me a return package which I had to pay for postage, they ended up refunding only part of the money I paid for the phone. guess what, on the go solution claim I mishandled the phone and that they will retain fifteen percent (15%) of the money I paid. Surprisingly I returned the phone in the same condition as I received it. I never took the phone out of my room for even a second. to cut a long story short. Be wise and don't be a victim like me.

Firstly it did not arrive by the guaranteed shipping date. It arrived 5 days later. I originally had it shipped to a friend's house but because it arrived 5 days late, he had left the country. So we had to convince the FedEx guy to allow the neighbour to sign for it then ship it to a new address, which had an additional cost attached to it. When I finally got the phone and opened it up, the manual was missing from the box - maybe it was a used phone. When I finally loaded my SIM card and made the first call I realized the microphone was not working. Anyone interested in purchasing this phone, search for forums about \"microphone not working in Lumia 920\" on the internet. Unfortunately I did not pick up on this earlier, the microphone has a noise reduction feature which sometimes cancels out your voice completely so the person on the other end does not hear you at all. Sure it works fine on speaker and videocam because that uses a different microphone. Apparently it is a design flaw in the Lumia 920 and Nokia doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. All those fancy features yet the basic thing a phone is supposed to be able to do is allow you to make and receive calls and the Lumia 920 is incapable of doing that. What a waste of money!

The Nokia Lumia 920 does not disappoint.", "Author": "nic", "ReviewID": "R2N086PH136M88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To begin I read about all the negative experiences with getting the right product.  I did get the expected product...brand new and international. (Ordered from FGS Trading) The only hitch was it was definitely packaged for the European market as it arrived with a charging plug for the European use.  I am in Canada.  I have multiple 3.5 mm chargers so no biggie.Now on the phone. I first powered it on and had to change the language to English.  Took all of 30 seconds.  Holding the phone is a treat.  To people who find this phone heavy.  You should be concerned with the strength in your hands let alone the weight of this phone.  This phone is meant be used with a slim case if any.  It is extremely durable and you can feel the quality it it.  To put it in perspective the famed iPhone 5 is 220 grams when adding on the very popular Otterbox Defender case.  This phone weighs in at 185 grams.  With my Nokia case (17 gms) it is 202 gms total.  This makes that particular iPhone 5 and defender combo wider and heavier.  You will rarely see people put this phone in a case.  In fact there are not many cases made for this phone...maybe for that reason.  Corning Gorilla Glass 2 also adds to this durability.It is definitely a looker.  From front to back it just looks the business.  I got the black matte to limit any possibilities and fingerprints and it just looks good.  Colors are more likely to leave scratches as you can see with the iPhone 5c.  They have the same case.  Funny how apple has to make the iPhone 5c look so similar to that of Nokia colored phones but we will leave that topic alone.The fluidity of the phone is great... and simple.  No clutter to report.  I like having the ability to only have what I want on my home screen with the live tiles.  All other apps are easily reached but tucked away.  The camera of course is one of the most respected cameras on the market as Nokia is arguably the best on the market -  the Lumia 1020 has taken away the steam of the 920 but it is still fantastic.  I have used it for a month and my wife's iPhone does not compare.  The screen is very good...uses the same technology as the iPhone 5s (IPS LCD)I really feel the app bashing windows gets is blown way out of proportion. Reason being is there are a lot of useful apps and its not cluttered with pointless ones (Something I experienced a lot with my Blackberry Z10 on blackberry world).  I have found almost all the apps I would ever need.  The third party counterparts are great unlike in blackberry world.  I personally prefer quality over quantity.  I really enjoy all the in house apps Nokia makes.  Nokia MixRadio is fantastic as is their Camera app. Nokia Maps is very good and on par with Google Maps.  Nokia makes so many of their own apps I find I am not needing to find the third party apps to use ad I prefer that as well.The only things I could think of that I feel could be improved upon is the lack notifications and the Windows keypad is not quite as up to par as the Blackberry10's (nothing comes close...including Apple and Android)  Those are very minor issues and can be addressed with software updates.Anyone who says they are disappointed with this phone is weak handed and never gave it a chance and probably came from using an iPhone or Google and look at APP numbers.  The Apps are coming.  Apple has had 10 years to build up its app market...Windows is on 3.  Its the experience I was after.  I could afford an iPhone or an S4 but went with the Lumia.  There is something about Windows 8 that is refreshing.  Live tiles is a great concept that has potential to be more and who knows what will come with Windows Phone 8.1 update which is coming soon. That's my rant.  If you like having the phone everyone else has stick to your iPhone.  If you like to brag about specs get a top flight Android.  If you prefer to have a lightweight operating system that just feels right...try a Lumia 920,1020 or above.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Formiddable competitor in the cell phone marketplace!", "Author": "knowledge is power", "ReviewID": "R2YQCFBIELCXI3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So it has been about 6 months since I recklessly abandoned my Apple iPhone 3GS (ok, so maybe it wasn't such a reckless abandonment). I feel that now I can offer you a sound review steeped in experience. But let's keep this simple, shall we?PROSLOVE the huge, clear, colorful screen! I like to play games, and not just the Angry Birds variety, and this is the screen for that!Camera is nothing short of awesome. I can zoom in and out, have flash (which is also a neat flashlight if you download the app), and video capability.Apps are generous and there are a significant number of free apps and I have yet to be bored using new apps but, (see CONS)Windows platform feels \"familiar\" and honestly it did not feel like a huge departure from the iPhone if you are wary of a switch.CONSAs the screen is huge, so is the device itself. It is \"chunky\" and feels like a dish-plate is against your face when using it as a phone. My resolution was either to use speakerphone which is loud and clear, or use the ear-buds and microphone I got the last time I dropped my old phone (I was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well with the Nokia). Perhaps a plus here is that it is a solid phone as evidenced by multiple drops with no visual or functional issues, and that in itself is a \"pro\".Though the camera itself takes great photos etc., a flaw to me is that it is challenging to navigate to the camera. Yes, you can click the camera button on the side and go immediately to the take a picture mode, but when you take the shot and want to review it is several steps to do so. Same thing if trying to snap a photo from, say, the texting box. Seems like it should be easier.I mention here again the Apps Marketplace. There are a lot of novel, fun, articulate apps for the Windows phone, however, the apps that \"everyone has\", or even the one that you want for your bank, for example, or EasyShift or whatever, it's not available for this phone. It's a small but annoying thing that and hopefully folks developing apps will begin to identify the Windows platform phones as a focus for development. Though a \"small\" thing it warrants the 4 versus the 5 star review.So that's about it at this point.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone has no warranty in the US, acording to Nokia!", "Author": "local_company", "ReviewID": "RJINLVHBRVF81", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this phone in May 2013 (Nokia Lumia 920 Black Factory Unlocked 32GB phone 4G LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600 - RM-821, Sold by WorldWide Distributors in Amazon.com).

There was no physical damage to the phone, meaning the phone was NOT dropped in ground or water or any liquid for that matter. One fine day, it was totally gone. It wouldn't simply start.On taking it to a Nokia customer care center, It was informed that this was a manufacturer defect and it was something to do with its hardware & software. Poooofff...

Here's a list of pros and cons that I've noticed after using this phone for a few months.PROS:Very sturdy phone, this won't be breaking any time soon.Simple interface that is easier to use than Android.Incredibly good camera, much better than iPhone or any other camera found on an ordinary smart phone (besides the 1020 that is!)Large screen with dense display, perfect for everything.Dolby Audio quality is great! Highs, mids, and bass can be controlled.The GPS is very accurate and easy to use.Pretty fair battery life that gets me through the day.The \"glance\" feature is convenient.It has internet sharing! This is a great feature that you don't find in many phones.CONS:The app market is very sad. Most of the apps that I used everyday are non existent on Windows store.Honestly, I really really love this phone except for one huge disappointment that I had to deduct a star. A phone with such exceptional audio quality deserves a dedicated music app, but it's missing. There is only the x-box music and video app that is so frustrating to manage. For people who use music all day every day, the music interface could be a big problem for you.Over all, this phone can do a lot of stuff that other phones can't. It's convenient and easy to use.

Meredith", "ReviewID": "R190EM7ME4F6HD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone after switching over from Blackberry, and had several problems with it from the start. First, the phone is very large, and somewhat awkward to hold compared to phones like Blackberry or Apple. I found it really uncomfortable to hold for the first few weeks I had it. It is heavy and large. I don't think the user interface is really intuitive. I'm not a tech dinosaur- I'm in my 20s and am frequently trying out new forms of technology, in part because of my job and in part because of general interest. There were various aspects of the phone, such as some issues with the \"start\" menu and messaging services, that I thought could have been laid out a little better. Additionally, I hated the contacts feature. Let's say that you have a few restaurants you frequently call for carry-out with your coworkers. Or you want to have phone numbers readily handy for your dentist and doctor. You can't just add those to your contacts with this phone- you have to create a contact with your email, which in my case was Gmail. So now I have all these extra contacts in my Gmail, including numbers for sandwich shops and my internist. What is the point?I started having battery issues with the Nokia Lumia 920 after a few weeks of use. In the seven months I had the phone, it would frequently go through phases where the battery would drain by up to 50% after being on for about an hour and a half- even if the only thing I had done with the phone was send a single short text message. I spoke with Nokia, with my cell phone provider, and joined message boards for product support, and these \"solutions\" occasionally worked for very short periods of time, but inevitably, my phone would go back to draining battery power at an alarming rate. For most of the time I had my phone, I had deleted almost all the apps, rarely updated the apps I did have (because updates automatically change your settings and would allow the app to run even without your permission), changed my settings so no background apps were allowed to run, turned off the data plan, turned off wifi, turned off EVERYTHING- and I still had problems! What is the point in investing in a smart phone if you're not able to use any of those smart phone functions? And may I add that even if all I did for twelve hours was receive a three minute phone call and send a handful of texts, by the early evening, I'd still be down to about 50% power- at least.Finally, at 7 months after purchase, my phone completely died. I took it off the charger one morning, and it wouldn't come on at all. I did soft and hard resets, changed power outlets, etc. I had to go to work 45 minutes early to use the phone there to call my provider, and was told that there was nothing that could be done. My customer service rep said that I was not the only person this had happened to, but unfortunately could not offer any solutions.The phone is bulky, not particularly user-friendly, and has many, many technical flaws. It's unpredictable and unreliable, and I would never, ever recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best built,  fun phone", "Author": "Ameet Joshi", "ReviewID": "R1CZO0JUB3HVLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome phone,  awesome build quality.

First I am gonna just put my original device review here, then get into this particular posting.April 27, 2013:The phone's review will have to incorporate bits from the OS too, so let's be done with that first. Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there.Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5\", which in my opinion is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. The high PPI screen is a joy to use. It retains Lumia 900's slightly squarer 15:9 aspect ratio, and the increased PPI makes it one of the best display in the market. The curved display's edge meets the rest of the body flawlessly, making the phone a joy to hold. The poly-carbonate's texture is simply luxurious. The material also means that color won't come off even if scratched. Nokia has used a new kind of coating on the logo, and the three capacitive keys that makes it really easy to see them even when the back-light is off. Slightly raised position of the keys is also a very welcome change, makes it very hard to accidentally hit them now. The camera is hands off the best phone-camera out there, nothing more to say there. Although the from camera is less than stellar. A few issues that still remain is that I want the headphone port at bottom and the micro-USB port on top of the device, it has it in opposite order, although to be fair every OEM is guilty of this offense, except only Apple is now putting headphone port at bottom. At least we get a camera button with windows phones. The phone is indeed a little heavy. 900 is my opinion had the perfect weight. While 920 has better ergonomics, I find it a little heavier than I would have like. But given the built quality, OIS camera, display quality, 32GB storage etc. being a little heavy is easy to forget.Present, 05/22/2014:First let's talk about the software. Windows Phone itself has gone through several updates, three small ones (General Distribution Release, or GDR 1,2,3), and a huge one, Windows Phone 8.1. The phone I received came with GDR 1 installed. So being the enthusiast that I am, the first thing I did was upgrade all the way to WP8.1 developer preview. One very good thing about Windows Phone is you don't have to stay in the mercy of your operator, and wait months for an update. iPhone users do not suffer from it, but this issue plagues Android users to this day. A very important addition along with GDR 2 was Glance Screen, a Nokia only feature, that allows you to see your notification without turning on the display. After the last update it shows time, notification, and your next calendar appointment. Coolest feature ever. WP8.1 brings some much needed and requested addition to the platform.1. Cortana. If you've played you are familiar with the name. Microsoft really wants to achieve similar thing here, and they've already succeeded to great extent here. Voice recognition specially is uncannily accurate, even for a non-native English speaker as me.2. Notification center. Windows Phone has lagged in this aspect. But it's finally here, and better executed than iOS.3. Data, Storage, WiFi, Battery sense. Data sense helps you manage your mobile data consumption, Storage sense is for storage, Most curious is WiFi sense. It let's you connect to public networks without having to do anything, and let's you share your home internet with your friends/contacts without actually giving them yout wifi password. Battery sense enables you to fine tune each specific app's background activity preference.4. Universal apps. Chances are you are a Windows user. WP8.1 allow developers to write apps for both Windows 8.1 and WP8.1simultaneously. So you're gonna see a lot of apps crossing over.Point is this phone can be your gateway to this amazing update without having to spend much more on a newer device. 920 runs WP8.1 extremely well, and battery life is still stellar.Hardware is a very curious case on this phone. According to other reviews I gathered even though the phone comes unlocked, they may have been from a carrier. So I was prepared for whatever comes. And sure enough, the one I got is a device from a Mexican carrier, Movistar. But it's default language was English. Phone came with 4 keyboard installed, US, UK English, Mexican Spanish, and Portuguese. Unlocked phone does not necessarily mean unbranded, and the most annoying ramification is the splash screen I have to see if I ever restart the phone, and having updates the phone GDR 1 to all the way up to WP8.1, I've seen that enough for a lifetime. The good part about the device being of Mexican origin is the hardware category. It's RM-820, instead of RM-821 that I had before. It's good because the LTE frequency goes with T-Mobile LTE. It has, 700, 850, 1900, 1700_2100. I don't whey the underscore, but I get LTE now, so I am happy.I do wish the seller would at least separate the boxes based on frequency supported as those are written on the box, but all in all I am happy.

No reason.Pros:* Screen is nice and bright* Camera is nice, but comparable to a nice Android or iOS device camera - so not really a pro.Cons:* Almost no comparable apps for iOS or Android apps. Sometimes there are 3rd party knock offs which are legitimate copies, but mostly they are outlets for spam advertising.*If an app exists, it is typically buggy, or unresponsive in weird ways.* Apps will often be described as doing one thing, and upon opening it you find out it is actually just a spam app that shows ads and gambling images without any actual original content.The native apps by Nokia work fairly well occasionally. Often though they too become suddenly unresponsive, and I have tried other people's devices, the same thing happens. Additionally there will be updates required for the phone that you must download. However sometimes what is in these updates doesn't actually apply any new features to your phone, yet requires you to download and use your storage space for the update. Example: There was an update for a Nokia app that is used by the Nokia Windows tablet and 1020+ versions of the Lumia devices. However it is not usable by this device. Still I was forced to download the app and install the update, despite it having no use on my phone.Dumb.I will never buy another Windows Phone device again, and I would suggest you don't as well unless you hate Apps and love phones that are mediocre at their price point compared to the competition.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I did a review before", "Author": "Ivan O.", "ReviewID": "R3OWWXF4QSGEAZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "but  a few month later my phon is randomly restarting/shutdow i tried all fixes on internet and stil doing it, i got it from Winda USA, i just crashed it on the floor, now it really doesn't work ...", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Windows Flagship Phone", "Author": "Jess Anderson", "ReviewID": "R35PYJW3FE9S2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to rate the phone itself five stars because of the fluidity and functionality, as for the Windows 8 OS, it has came a long ways since 7.5/7.8, but I always hope to see the app gap lessen.

It is very simple to use and highly functional. Also the black and white theme is really my style which is good because the phone has very limited theme options so keep that in mind.Win8 does have some downsides though: The browser and bing search freaking suck. Even if you change your default search to something else the search button still pulls up bing. Seriously stop shoving that down our throats. Luckily there is an app called \"UC Broswer\" and that will greatly improve your internet browsing experience.Other failures include the app market which has very little content right now. I can't even do my banking online with this phone... although perhaps that is my bank's fault for not making the app but plenty of apps are missing from this market. I also didn't see any theme apps or apps to change the tile page itself although there were plenty of tile changing apps.That is the last thing that bugged me was the tile page didn't fit the theme at all and the theme options wouldn't let me change it and no apps existed that would change it. Honestly I would prefer a list version of the tile page instead of blocks. I was able to at least get it in black and white to match the theme though by going into the phone options and turning \"high contrast\" on.This phone is a comfortable weight and size for me and fits well in the hand. Other than my few gripes with the operating system which I managed to work around mostly it is very nice. The hardware is good and the battery life is alright. If you are concerned about battery life it does have power saver mode and you can easily turn off all the power hogs like wifi when the lockscreen is up, location serives, ect. There are a few battery saver apps but honestly the app market is stinky and they probably drain more than the save to manage stuff 24/7.The price on this phone is wonderful for something purchased out of contract too.

Choppy audio, duplicate music files, poor music file tagging, unplayable podcast files from the Store, and buggy SD card support plagued all of them.Some of these items remain with the Lumia 920, but this must have an updated version of the OS, because things are improved. Audio no longer stutters and there are no problems with duplicate music files. Music file tagging is still broken, especially album and artist artwork, but I was able to fix most of the artwork via the MPATool app. The Xbox Music connection option does not fix any of this. It's actually sad that Microsoft's built-in music solution is such a huge step back from WP7, and it remains as my biggest complaint about WP8. Microsoft seems to want you to use their online Xbox Music service instead of CD rips.Podcast files from the Store play perfectly. However, you cannot manually add podcast files to your phone and have them show up in your Podcast section. If you manually add podcast files to your phone, they will show up in the Music section, which is strange. Sorting options are not as varied as it was in WP7.This is one of the few WP8 devices that has 32 gigs of storage, which is great for a guy like me who stores his entire music collection on the phone, and I download a lot of Podcasts. It's a shame more phones don't come with this much storage. I picked a phone with this amount of storage to avoid using a micro SD card.I bought an unlocked version so I can use my T-Mobile sim card. As of August 28, 2013, the phone has not received the GDR2 \"Amber\" update, which is a shame. Nokia's website says it's still in testing, so hopefully this phone will get it soon.Of all of the WP8 devices I have used, this one offers the best experience. The OS has some flaws when it comes to the way it handles media, but you can work around them for the most part. The rest of the OS is exceptional. It's slick, pretty, and has plenty of applications. The live tiles are really cool and give the OS a unique look and feel.The hardware is great. The screen is big and beautiful. The 1280x768 screen is crisp and clear. The phone is rectangular, but with curved edges. It's almost too big to be a pocket phone, but not quite. The 1.5 GHz dual core CPU makes for a very smooth user experience. Compared to my old Samsung Focus, all applications and games are noticeably faster.If this model received quicker OS updates, it would be a serious contender for the top WP8 device.
