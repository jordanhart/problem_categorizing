I it was well packaged and the box in excellent condition when opened. When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised. The contents consisted of, of course the phone, a pair of headphones, the charger with a U.S. adapter and charging cable, the manuals, and the phone charging dock, which was awesome because, that alone I've seen sold on Amazon for $35 or so.But to the phone which is beautiful, by the way. Other than the fact that the phone is a finger print magnet, it definitely has a premium feel. I'm in love with the color and the look and feel of the phone. The sound quality is great. The speaker has a nice sound and the call quality has been great. I'm currently with T-mobile in the U.S. and the LTE works great here in San Diego. The performance has also not let me down. I've been using the phone for games and internet and music and I've had no issues with lagging and the battery life has been pretty good as well. I haven't managed to bring it below 30% yet with heavy use. Great phone.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Aliyu A.

Nothing is different, but firmware is set to Hk and also language at first boot is set to Chinese, no big deal coz can be changed back to English or whatever language required.I do love my Z1;-)", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony Xperia Z1 C6903 (Honami) 16GB Purple", "Author": "Sherry", "ReviewID": "R25E4R9VXPBIAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony Xperia Z1 C6903 (Honami) 16GB Purple is very beautiful.

Seller wasn't the best", "Author": "abbas", "ReviewID": "R17E73VQXCX280", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is beautiful  and powerful! What more would you want?! oh and almost forgot it's waterproof! But the reason why I have it a 3 star was because of the seller. First off the phone on the box was black so that means my phone wasn't sealed from the factory. As you read the other review The guy said he got a dock charger with his phone, the main reason why I bought it from this seller because I wanted the dock charger, but when I opened the box there wasn't a dock charger, but there was a manual on how to hook up the dock charger. So that mean the seller took it out of the box. I connect the seller they said to send it back. I didn't have time for that.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "sony peria z1(factory unlocked) nice phone/ from this selle/ that I, can remember/ thankyou", "Author": "franklin Burgos", "ReviewID": "RFEU3TMHX7MKF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "sony  Xperia z1 ( factory unlocked)  nice phone/ from this stores/ that  I. can remember / thank you/have nice day/", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony Xperia Z1", "Author": "Rick Chavez", "ReviewID": "R16QBWZNJ90NVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great form factor, very nice pictures, great Android device.
