Would be better with ICE 4.0, but the Android 2.3.6 is still cool enough for me, with million of apps in the PLAY STORE.If you don't need a phone with a 2 or 4 cores processor, a trillions of pixels screen, and do not want to pay almost 1000 $ for a phone, i think this is one of the best options in the market right now.Good luck!", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Rodoval507", "ReviewID": "R2ZAIZ3Q7SY6UR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a blackberry user and all I have to say is that this was a big change, although this is a mid range phone its very powerful regarding camera and speed.

Everything works great, it's basicaly just smaller version of the Galaxy S2, however we encountered many problems with wifi. It keeps disconnecting for no reason.

What i really don't like is that it comes with several programs & icons preinstalled that honestly I WILL NOT USE in all my life, but i am not able to uninstall them either, unless i follow some procedures (i have found through the internet) that i'm not familiar doing and i don't like either to do... so i will have to live with these annoying icons in my cell phone.The other con is that it doesn't have a front camera, this was my mistake as i thought by the picture that it really had it.Buyers PLEASE BEWARE: although the description says it is a GT-S7500L model, the seller sent to me a different one (GT-S7500), so the 3G band is different... i originally bought this smartphone for my father, and his carrier works in 3G at 1900Mhz (the GT-S7500L model does it), but as i received the GT-S7500 model, he was not going to be able to connect to 3G because it only does it at 900Mhz and 2100Mhz!!! To avoid all the hassle of returning it, i kept this phone for myself as my carrier does work with 3G in 900Mhz. So, buyers, if you want to avoid problems please find out what band does your carrier work at 3G, and ask the seller which is the real model of smartphone they're selling. The seller in my case was HASSLEFREECELL (unfortunately, it was not hassle free to me).", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "telefono", "Author": "omar uzcategui", "ReviewID": "R3SMMK1T669O3W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "muy buen articulo en excelentes condiciones funcionamiento optimo, una observacion importante es que el cargador vino malo!  tuve que comprar otro aqu\u00ed!", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "this phone will not work for 3g speed in USA", "Author": "Mark A.

To connect it, the seller gave me information to manually enter the APN settings on the phone. I have been able to capture the signal EDGE but no 3G.

The weight is also suitable.Good speed, 3GB internal memory, 1GB for applications.The screen looks great.CONSUnlocked phone for Italian operator \"TIM\", so that the manuals and warranty are in Italian. This applies to the seller \"HassleFreeCell\", I don't know for other vendors.With the operator Movistar in Venezuela this phone does not automatically capture the data signal. You need to manually enter the APN settings.I recommend that if you buy this phone for use with Movistar in Venezuela, you must go to a technical service to configure it.

We have T-Mobile as our service plan...and they wanted my first born, DNA and mention in my last will and testament for a semi-decent new phone.  So I thought, ah, why not?  I'll try it out.  Afterall, it's only $245, it's not like I'm a single mom and live paycheck to paycheck...oh wait I do.  Oops.  Any who, my son opened this gem Christmas morn and his eyes lit up like a roman candle.  He was PUMPED!  A little later, as I was cleaning up the aftermath of my Christmas bonus, he came to me with a very disappointed look on his cherub face.  He told me his new, prized possession wouldn't charge.  I being the mother of the year that I am, took the charger from his little outstretched hand, only to find it didn't look like anything I had seen before.  It looked like the prongs seen on a naughty dogs' collar. But alas, I realized, A HA!!  It's a European outlet prong!  My dear child, please don't try to shove this in your outlet!  It was then he admitted that he had indeed, tried to shove it in his bedroom outlet.  UGH!!  I must admit, the phone DID come with an adapter...more like a cradapter...it didn't work.  To top it off, my poor little baby told me his 3G doesn't work!  He's having to deal with something called EDGE.  UGH!  Seriously!  The EDGE is NOT good enough for my sweet, innocent little baby!
