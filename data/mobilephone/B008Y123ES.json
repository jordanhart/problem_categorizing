Until the screen died. 5 months i purchased it, this phone has died. Started with the screen going black, and having to turn off and then turn on again the phone. This happened more and more often until one day, the screen just wouldn't light back up. The phone is on, but the screen is dead.Got rid of the phone since I could find no place to get it fixed.

There are actually four or five U8800 models. Presumably, this is the U8800-51. There is little difference in Android phones. They are all the same Chinese schlock. A couple of things you should know:There are phones being sold with four different versions of Android; <2.2, 2.2 (\"Froyo\"), 2.3 (\"Gingerbread\") and 4.0 (\"Ice Cream Sandwich\"). This phone runs on Froyo which will run 99% of Google apps. One downside to this phone is that it is probably cannot be upgraded to Gingerbread. For the VAST number of users that will be irrelevant.If you want access to the Google apps market (most of which is free), browse, use email - great. This is also a good media player (audio and video). Oh and it actually makes and receives phone calls too. I am a cord cutter and this is terrific communicator. It plays very well with my bluetooth headset and has a good speaker as well. The camera is good - not great. While it is 5 megapixel, the lens is very wide angle. The digital zoom erodes picture quality. However, unlike many phone in this range it DOES have a flash.One other thing that you should know is that Huawei (sounds like a Hawaiian disease) expects you to get technical support from your carrier. Their US tech support is awful.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "First smart phone", "Author": "philwick", "ReviewID": "RRKJEBRYDRFH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 1st smart phone I have ever owned so I am still learning how everything works.

Schlessman", "ReviewID": "R2YUCSYZY75GAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first smart phone in our household and it we are quite impressed with it. We have Consumer Cellular phone service with no contract and extremely low rates. All I had to do was remove my SIM and memory card from the old phone, install them in my new U8800, charge it and after a few minutes of setup time we were in business. We don't have 3G or 4G available in the rural setting where we live, but it connected to the internet through my wireless router and I was browsing in no time. The HSPA+ phone service worked flawlessly and we even had a much stronger signal connection than our previous Nokia 3C phones had.I ordered two of them but had to use different sellers due to limited quantity. Still waiting on the second one. But we got two of these babies for less than the cost of one iPhone. And my wife is already used to Android due to using a tablet with that OS so the learning curve is nil.Highly recommended!!!UPDATE - After some research I found out that a new tower built last summer a mile from our house does provide 3G & 4G. So I dug deeper online and found out how to enable 4G service on this phone. Had to add two new APN setups on the phone using the following settings:WebName: Consumer Cellular (I believe this field actually can be whatever)APN: att.mvnoProxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comPort: 80Username: (not set)Password: (not set)Server: (not set)MMSC: (not set)MMS Proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: PAPAPN type: default, supl, mms (I'm not positive you need mms here, but it works so I'm not changing it)APN protocol: IPv4MMSName: Comsumer Cellular MMS (Again, probably can be anything)APN: att.mvnoProxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comPort: 80Username: (not set)Password: (not set)Server: (not set)MMSC: [...]MMS proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: PAPAPN type: mmsAPN protocol: IPv4These settings were provided by Consumer Cellular to another customer who kindly posted them on an Android forum.After entering these parameters I cycled the power, enabled the data and it connected immediately. I was amazed at how much faster it is than through the wireless internet service we have. In a week it has used up about 19 Mb of the 100 Mb we have on our monthly plan. But that includes several games that I downloaded for my wife to play while she is on lunch break. I will have to monitor it closely.Needless to say I am even more impressed than I was previously. You cannot beat Consumer Cellular for low price, high quality service!UPDATE 2 - 1/13/2014 - Well, after a year of usage I still think this is an excellent phone for the price, with the following caveats. If you are going to root it and install custom ROMs then the support from Huawei is non existent and any users' support is dated and scattered at best. The community of users is not the most friendly to newcomers. All of that said I have purchased an additional one for a bargain price and am still satisfied with it overall. I customized it, removed the bloatware and could not be more content.I have since upgraded my wife as to a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini because she needs more horsepower than this phone gives.If you only need a phone for call, texting and some BASIC app usage then this one will work for you. Be sure to buy an unlocked version and root it so you can remove the crapware that comes preinstalled.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R11WWMA5D6DSD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone about 2 weeks ago and it has amazed me so far.The screen at 3.8\" is pretty wide.

We live in a global economy and, as with most electronic products these days, this phone is made in China. That might be a detractor to some, however please be advised that this phone is solid, well assembled and very reliable. Because the phone was marketed by ATT as their Impulse 3g model, you may find some feature preloaded on the phone that are of little or no interest to you, and might not even work with your service provider. That said, the phone and the basic features will work on any 3g network (ATT and T Mobile), but will not work on Verizon or Sprint service. This phone packs a lot of features that are good options for the first time smart phone user. The camera and HD video on the phone are superior to what my digital camera offers.

I would say this is comparable to Samsung's Exhibit 4g except for the battery life and the processing speed. I'm not going to use this device for games so processing won't matter too much. The only times I notice the speed will be during boot ups and playing videos and browsing websites that are heavy in flash.The major drawback like I said before is Huawei's support for this device. It's pretty much non-existant. Forget ICS. Forget GB. That is, unless you're willing to void your warranty and \"upgrade\" via rooting methods.I've tested out the wifi and it's pretty good. The one draw back is that it sometimes interferes with video playback so you hear a buzzing sound (maybe it's something else, but I think it's the wifi). I haven't tested the talk and regular internet use yet but I will update soon.Update:Call quality is clear over the network. I haven't tried calling over the internet (don't intend to).Call stability seems fine. 20+ minute calls haven't dropped even at 1 or 2 bars.Reception so far hasn't been a problem even though there's high rise apartments around me, no one has said they called me and I didn't receive the call.This phone is capable of much higher over the network data rates. I have T-Mobile so their \"4G\" isn't that fast. At off peak hours, it's around 1.5mbps/500kbps. Around peak hours it's 500kbps/300kbps.I haven't tried doing too much else with this phone. Typing is fine, just gotta use the sides of your fingers instead of the tips. The camera is ok for today's standards. If you go to a store and want to take down a barcode or an image of an item, it works fine. I don't play games on this phone so I don't know how it handles them.---As a T-Mobile customer, I can get 6000kbps down and 1000kbps up most of the time.

The instructions were very clear even for someone who had never owned a smart phone. I am a Consumer Cellular customer and the phone worked great with their platform. The problem came when the phone would just not seem to hold power. After as little as 2 very short phone calls and a hand full of texts, it would run the battery down. I contacted the seller giving a detailed explanation of what I was experiencing and asking if this was normal for this type of phone or was it a battery issue. They sent back a very unbusinesslike response which simply stated, \"If you like we can send you a new battery at no extra cost.\" No greeting, no closing, no answering of my question. I sent another email asking if that meant it was a battery issue since the question had not been answered. Again I received a similar response stating it was not typical and that was why they offered a new battery and it was being shipped.  Well, Ok. I figured no problem they just are a company who has no business communication skills. Since I've always been in the business world and would never, EVER allow one of my employees to respond to customer questions in such a manner. I let it slide and figured I'd wait to write a review until I received a new battery and everything was fine.

The Impulse is a pretty terrible phone all around.  The processor is very weak, so simple tasks like sending text messages become frustrating.  It's fairly common for me to be typing two or three words ahead of the phone because it's lagging to catch up.  Games that require quick reactions or moderate amounts of memory are unplayable.  Touch screen sensitivity is poor.  It often does not recognize where you are touching or sometimes does not recognize touches at all.  Recalibrating does not help.  Camera is borderline unusable.  It will only take pictures in excellent lighting with no motion, and often times even these are blurry/grainy.  Auto white balance makes every picture come out grey or yellow, and manual white balance is often worse.  Yes, it has a flash.  The flash actually makes most pictures worse.The worst thing about this phone is that it often doesn't recognize my SIM card as being valid.  This is easily corrected by restarting the phone.  Unfortunately, there is no warning when it stops recognizing the card.  It just turns the phone onto airline mode and says \"emergency calls only\".  You will not be able to make or receive any calls/texts/notifications while it is in this mode.  My phone was doing this daily when my wife was 9 months pregnant and there would be times where I wouldn't notice for an hour or more that I haven't been able to receive calls from her or the hospital.Just stay away from this phone.  I love the Android platform, but are so many better phones at similar prices.  Even a previous generation model from Motorola, Samsung or HTC will be more advanced than a Huawei Impulse.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not very good.", "Author": "Ernest F.", "ReviewID": "R2VNQXCDQVWJ7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it due to some of the great feedback.

It has turned out to be a rather difficult one to use. First of all, the screen locks up very quickly and you have to keep unlocking it every time you try to open the phone. Opening the phone is rather clumsy, too, in that you have to press the power button on top of the phone. Neither of these functions is particularly difficult; more annoying than anything. In addition the settings on the phone are lacking in their functionality(more options would be nice in certain areas). Also, I printed out the user guide which turned out to be pretty much of a waste. The instructions were so brief as to be almost useless. Finally, there is no software for this phone to make it useful with a PC unless your bluetooth functions flawlessly. My Samsungs came with software for use on your PC which came in very handy for transferring and working with data.
