{"Reviews": [{"Title": "iPhone 3GS - Buying and using", "Author": "JMark235 \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R6TY2IKAM28M7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you have an iPhone you will need to download and install iTunes (no charge) on your PC in order to be able to add music, photos, videos, etc. to your iPhone. The vast majority of iPhones produced by Apple were locked to a single carrier (AT&T;, Sprint & Verizon) in the US and you will not be able to use an iPhone locked to one of these carriers on the network of another carrier. For instance, in order to use an iPhone 3GS produced for AT&T; on T-Mobile you will first need to have the iPhone unlcoked. AT&T; implemented a new policy on 3/8/12 under which they will unlock an iPhone under certain conditions (google AT&T; iPhone unlock). This type of unlock is frequently referred to as a \"Factory unlock\". The other method of unlocking an iPhone is a software hack (3 steps which are jailbreak, unlock and hactivate). Be very careful of buying a jailbroken iPhone unless you know exactly what you are doing/getting. The later software versions (referred to as the IOS or iPhone Operating System)installed on iPhones have severe limitations at this time in terms of jailbreaking. Most/all of the current jailbreaks are tethered (you can only reboot the iPhone when connected to a PC which has the jailbreak software on the PC and you need to know how to load and use the jailbreak software) or involve loading the iPad baseband (radio receiver/transmitter) on the iPhone. Many of the iPhones with the iPad baseband have severe problems which can NOT be fixed (you can send the phone to China to have the baseband ships replaced) including non-operational Wi-Fi, non-operational Bluetooth, constant rebooting, non-operational GPS and fast battery drain. You will see some purchasers of iPhones claim that they turned on the unit and it was stuck in recovery mode (most likely thay purchased a phone with a tethered jail break which is looking for the jailbreak software on a connected PC) or that the Wi-FI, Bluetooth or GPS doesn't work (almost certainly due to the installation of the iPad baseband.iPhones produced for AT&T; use GSM radio technology while iPhones produced for Sprint & Verizon use CDMA technology. At least for the Verizon iPhones, they also have a slot for GSM SIM cards which requires that the phone be unlocked in order to use it. Verizon will only unlock the phone under certain conditions and requires the use of a SIM card from an overseas carrier. Think of GSM and CDMA as the difference between AM and FM radio. An FM radio can not receive an AM radio program. GSM is used in the US and almost all of Europe and South America while CDMA is generally being phased out and is still primarily used in a few countries in Asia. So, if you want to use your iPhone while in Europe using a SIM card from a European carrier then make sure that you buy an unlocked GSM iPhone.When buying a used iPhone, you need to make sure that it was never reported as being lost or stolen in which case the phone is almost certainly black listed and can not be activated in the US. This can be a problem when buying an iPhone through Craig's List where you meet a guy in a parking lot to make the transaction.If you are handy, buying a used phone with certain types of damage is not a problem. For the iPhone 3G, 3GS, replacing the glass, LCD or battery is of moderate difficulty ($10 for the glass, $30 for the glass/LCD assembly, $10 for the battery). Changing the back cover or battery on a 4 or 4S is very easy ($10 for the battery, $15 for the back cover) but changing the glass requires an almost complete disassembly of the phone. The are many local repair facilites that can fix the damage but they are of course much more expensive than DIY. If buying a damaged unit then make sure you know what the repair costs will be before the purchase.Now a few words about the iPhone 3GS versus an Android phone. Note that there are many variations of Android phones and my Android experience is limited to the Samsung Exhibit II 4G and a couple of other units.The iPhone is generally of higher quality overall and in terms of individual features. Some Android phones will have a higher resolution (480 * 800) but pixel density (number of dots per square inch usually referred to as PPI) is more important to image quality and Apple generall has better. A similar issue exists for the cameras. Although some Androids have better resolution say 5 MP, Apple's camera due to the density of pixels and software frequently produce a better pic. The Androids that I have used have better built in speaker quality than the iPhone 3GS but if using ear buds or an external speaker this isn't an issue. The iPhone 3GS and later models have 1 button voice dialing which was essential for me. You only need to pull the phone from your pcoket and hold the home button for 3 seconds and then speak the name/number to call. With the Android, you need to press the power button, swipe the home screen, enter an unlock code (if you use this) and then start a calling application although some blue tooth head sets on some Android phones permit one tap voice dialing. The iPhone screen is also brighter which enables use in bright sun compared to many Android units which are unusable outside. The Android has more customization settings which can make the learning curve a little steeper compared to the iPhone. Applications are pretty much the same on both platforms. Android does have Google Navigate (spoken search command with step by step voice commands) which is better than the equivalent app on the iPhone. The newer Android phones have as good or better speech capabilities than iPhones. For instance, there is some benefit to have the phone talk to you to tell you that John Smith is calling rather than having to pull the phone from your pocket and look at the display. I'd suggest picking the 3 features most important to you and making a decision of these 3 features alone. If you need one button voice dial without bluetooth or frequently use the phone outside in the sun then my vote goes to Apple. If you need voice navigation on a regular basis or 4G network speeds then my vote goes to Android. If you need to be able to use a phone where cell signal strength is a problem such as in an office building then get an Android which supports Wi-Fi calling (iPhones don't). If the cell signal is weak then your call will be routed through the Wi-Fi connection. Some carriers support this and some don't charge minutes for Wi-Fi calling.Update 6/18/2012Clarification - The iPad baseband was only required to unlock the phone for use with another carrier. The jailbreak is required to install applications not approved by Apple and required to load the iPad baseband.As of 6/18/12, an untethered jailbreak is reported to be available for IOS 5.1.1 and software to rollback the modem firmware to a version which can be unlocked without using the iPad baseband is available.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just like described!", "Author": "Lovely Sam", "ReviewID": "R2ZDI82SEE8HMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this iphone 3Gs 8gb which was supposed to be unlocked and jailbroken and it was!

Way to go Amazon!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Factory Unlocked, Carrier Unlocked, Unlocked, Jailbroken, \"New\"", "Author": "MWebb", "ReviewID": "R11QA4T5ZSUF5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You should be aware that the 3GS was discontinued by Apple when they released the iPhone 5 in September of 2012.You need to read the ads from marketplace vendors and be aware of the various types of \"unlocks\" and what \"new\" means. Not all vendors use these terms the same way (they mostly want you to think it is \"no headaches\" factory unlocked when in fact it may not be).* \"Factory unlocked\" should mean shipped unlocked by Apple itself - after all, Apple is the \"factory\". You should be aware that the ONLY USA-authorized, factory (Apple) unlocked iPhone 3GS was the 8gb model with model number MC637LL/A. If you have a 16gb or 32gb or an 8gb with part number MC640LL/A, they might be CARRIER unlocked, or SOFTWARE unlocked (hacked), but they aren't \"factory\" unlocked. Apple stopped selling factory unlocked, 8gb iPhone 3GS models when they introduced the iPhone 5 in September 2012. The 4 became the new entry-level, factory unlocked iPhone at $450 (Apple had been selling the unlocked 3GS for $375). You might still be able to get Apple refurbished unlocked 3GS's in typical Apple \"new\" condition (albeit factory refurbished).* \"Carrier unlocked\" is not a commonly used term because \"factory unlocked\" is what most buyers want to hear, and if a seller is honest and the phone is carrier unlocked instead of factory unlocked, they will usually just say \"unlocked\" (not say \"factory unlocked\"). Unlocked phones (carrier unlocked) do not require \"activation\" and will take any GSM sim (standard size). The operating system can be upgraded to the latest bug-fix or feature enhanced edition without any risk of \"freezing\" or \"re-locking\" your phone.  Carrier unlocked is perfectly legitimate, but usually encountered in used or refurbished phones since AT&T;'s official policy is to only sell \"on contract\" phones that permit unlocking only after the 2 year contract has been paid in full; even then they restrict unlocking to existing and former customers, and you have to put an AT&T; sim in to unlock it. If you are buying a phone that has been carrier unlocked in this fashion, it is usually not technically new (at a minimum) or actually used in retail service (\"used\"). Some vendors load programs onto their \"new\", \"in box\", \"factory accessoried\" 3GS phones so the customer takes the final step in unlocking the phone, placing it into service only by the customer. Those vendors do not provide step by step instructions on how to activate the phone, but generally you should try putting your non-ATT sim into it and just proceed until you get a message that the phone has been unlocked before proceeding with a factory restore and/or iOS updgrade (your phone, if new, should probably come with 5.0 or 5.1, depending on how long it sat on the shelf). After you get the unlock message, you should do a \"restore\" first, to clean out the OS from junk programs and anything else, then upgrade to iOS 6.0. If you got a legitimately \"carrier unlocked\" phone your phone won't become re-locked to AT&T.;* \"Unlocked\" is an ambiguous term that can mean factory unlocked, carrier unlocked, or, heaven's forbid, jailbroken, depending on the honesty of your vendor. As mentioned above, unless you get a rare Apple online store true \"factory unlocked\" 3GS, it is more likely you will have a \"carrier unlocked\" 3GS, also perfectly valid. A \"software unlocked\" or \"Jailbroken\" phone is a major problem and a misrepresentation (unless the vendor spells out it is jailbroken or software unlocked) - the operating system has been hacked to unlock it from AT&T;, so you have a possibly compromised operating system, and if you upgrade to a newer version of the iOS (which is essential to preserve security) it once again locks itself to AT&T.;  You should not accept an iPhone sold to you as \"unlocked\" if it has been software hacked / jailbroken. Yes, I know that freedom-of-software advocates are in favor of software unlocking to permit wifi hotspotting and non-Apple Store approved Apps, but unless you know what you are getting into - and my point is that you have a RIGHT TO CLEARLY KNOW what you are getting into - a software unlocked iPhone should NOT be sold as \"unlocked.\"* \"Software unlocked\" or \"Jail broken\" phones some in two degrees: a software hack has been used to just unlock the phone from AT&T.; The downside here is you can never update the iOS without re-locking the phone to AT&T.; Unless you are an AT&T; customer (existing or former), AT&T; won't unlock the phone. If the phone has been reported as stolen, AT&T; won't unlock the phone. The operating system has been \"exploited\" by a hack that may or may not leave it more vulnerable than a factory or carrier unlocked phone. Jail broken goes one step further - you can buy apps from outside the Apple Store. In other words, additional parts of Apple's operating system have been hacked. There are tons of people walking around with hacked iPhones, but you have a right to know if you are going to be one of them, and if a phone is advertised as unlocked, it should be factory or carrier unlocked - completely safely, no future headaches unlocked.* Finally, there is \"new\" and there is factory warrantied \"new.\" No vendor I have seen is willing to assure the buyer that the \"new\" phone will have a warranty honored by Apple, since they are essentially being sold as new in a \"gray\" or \"secondary\" market (carrier overstock, for example). I have heard that Apple will honor the warranty based on when the phone was first placed in service - activated - but there could be problems based on the age of the \"new\" phone. A \"new\" 8gb edition is likely to be chronologically younger than a \"new\" 16gb or 32gb 3GS. Carrier unlocked overstock only becomes problematic because you are probably NOT buying it from an actual AT&T; outlet (company or independent store) but from a generic re-seller - so does Apple count it as being \"placed in service\" when YOU activate it, or when  the generic re-seller purchased it from the authorized phone store? If the path from authorized phone store to gray marketer is quick, this might not be a problem, but keep it in mind. This may also explain why the last step in carrier unlocking is often programmed to take place when we, the ultimate user, buy the phone and begin setting it up, instead of when the generic re-seller purchased it as carrier overstock. Also note that some vendors explicitly state that the serial numbers on the cartons might not match the serial number on the phone, due to their need to program the phone to unlock itself when you activate it (carrier unlock request, a legitimate process not a hack). I find that dodgy. The \"new\" box might have been opened, but there is no reason not to put the phone back in the same box it came with.Now that your head's about you explode and you have decided to suffer under a 2 year contract with AT&T;, or buy a $450 factory unlocked iPhone 4 from Apple, there are actually some good reasons for buying a \"new\" \"unlocked\" 3GS while they are available now for about $200 -+ They are a fine iPhone that will run iOS 6.0. They ran 5.1 fine, and my first \"new\" \"unlocked\" 3GS is humming along and making my daughter happy running 6.0. When you are going to give the phone to a kid, saving more than 50% for a slightly dated (but far from obsolete) iPhone is great. She can check Facebook, send messages, check email, browse, using the (presently slow but soon to be upgraded) T-Mobile \"Walmart\" plan for only $30 a month. That's incredibly cheap compared to any AT&T; plan, and even cheaper than the $45 Straight Talk plan. So I save money both on initial purchase price and on monthly fee. If I wanted unlimited talk, text, and messaging, I can get then under the Walmart family plan from T-Mobile for only $50 per month (post paid, so more with taxes though!) or from Straight Talk, which buys their time from AT&T; so you have AT&T; quality at prepaid, $45 per month bargain rates (note that T-Mobile currently only delivers 2G speeds but will be up to 3G speeds by the end of the year or early next year, as they \"re-farm\" frequencies to bring them inline with iPhone capabilities, while Straight Talk uses AT&T; so you get 4g speeds RIGHT NOW - but only 3g on the hardware limited 3GS phone).+ I like the look and feel of the iPhone 3GS - the curves - more than the 4, 4s, or 5.+ Battery life is good.- + Screen is NOT Retina - so I won't be reading books on my forthcoming replacement 3GS (the one I ordered for me) BUT I carry an iPod Touch for that - it lets me conserve my phone battery to have separate devices.- There is no front facing camera, so no FaceTime, but on my wife's 4s FaceTime is herky-jerky anyway so once the novelty wears off, the actual functionality is not good anyway.+ I like the \"lower mugger profile\" of the 3Gs compared to a 4, 4s, or 5 - you can rate each of the iPhones yourself on the urban crime, muggability index of your choice. The 3GS gets the job done without attracting undue attention, esp. overseas for me where it provides slightly less, but more than adequate performance - and let's face it, in Asia the bandwidth isn't always that great, so you are balancing bandwidth delays against operating system/hardware delays anyway.+- The camera is autofocus with a flash, and 3 megapixels beats the .7 megapixel (less than 1 megapixel!) of my iPod Touch any day of the week. If you want pro-level pix, you need the iPhone 5. (The 4 has 5 megapixels, the 4s and 5 have 8 megapixels).I recommend against a used unit. I bought a used unit last year. It was jailbroken, so couldn't be updated from 5.0 to 5.1 without paying another software unlock fee, and it was completely linted up at the earphone - clean glass and back, but obviously used hard, even for its \"like new\" rating (the like new applied to cosmetics not extent of use). For the small difference in money, \"new\" right now, during this brief window when retails outlets are dumping their overstock, is much better imho. The other alternative would be a refurb from Apple, unlocked obviously, or a factory unlocked 4.Finally, my primary personal phone stateside is a Google Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1; I sold my first \"used\" 3GS to an overseas friend, bought a second, \"new\" 3GS for my daughter here last month(the Android system gives her headaches); and the my third foray into iPhones from Amazon is another \"new\" 3GS from Tablet Distributors (Fulfilled by Amazon). (The first \"new\" \"unlocked\" 3GS from Tablet Distributors did not unlock successfully so I am returning it for another).", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Factory Unlocked - Don't take it at face value!", "Author": "Julian D.

They create quickly evolving planned-obsolescence-based products on a locked proprietary technology. Case in point, iphone 3GS released in 2008, now many years old and still being shipped as a \"new\" product at amazon five years later. If all you want to do is make phone calls, ok. But most people pay the hundreds of extra dollars for the icing on the cake, all those fancy apps available only at the Apple store and installable only with the free itunes program.Well, I just happen to have one of them and it is next to useless compared to a current model device because three-quarters of the apps for it give an error message saying that the app is incompatible with my IOS. How did this happen? When new models come out they have a new IOS and developers write code for the new IOS, not the old one when they fix bugs and plan a new release. Well, so what, I already have the app I want and it works fine, right?Way too often the answer is Wrong, How does this happen? Your computer has to be \"authorized\" and if anything happens to the authorized computer in the meantime, like you get a new one or whatever, you can't make changes to the iphone anymore unless you authorize the new one thereby wiping the iphone clean of its working apps. So you bite the bullet and download a fresh copy of your growing list of favorite apps. Getting the idea--most of them are not the same any more, they are newer, \"improved\" versions that don't work on your IOS anymore. That wouldn't be so bad if Apple was willing to supply archive copies of the versions you need, but they don't. Even if your IOS is \"up-to-date\" because the definition of up-to-date depends on your model and you have a five-year-old legacy model now even if you bought it yesterday.How do I know, I just went through this scenario and of the apps I downloaded and expected to work, over fifty of them were not backwards compatible.I am not talking about games or \"fun\" apps, I am talking hard core business essential apps, anything from Google, Adobe, Microsoft, IBM, etc that I tried failed, not even access to PayPal.

Don't buy a \"new\" iphone 3GS if you need any of these, because none of them will work with the most current IOS for that model.Apple's business model may be good for Apple, but is planned obsolescence best for you?Unless you are in the unique position of being an Apple developer with insider knowledge and special tools, you will inevitably notice an obsolescence creep with handheld Touch gizmos from Apple unless they undergo a drastic change of policy.

Even the iPhone box it came in said that the phone is unlocked. To our surprise, when we tried to put a SIM card into the phone it said invalid SIM and the phone was still locked! Couldn't return the phone since my cousin was travelling out of the country so had to pay to get it unlocked.what can I say about Amazon! I called them and told them of the situation and the customer service rep simply asked the cost to unlock the phone (even asked if the amount I gave her was all or if there were more charges!), and she went ahead and processed a refund for the amount. This is the second time this summer Amazon has stepped up when it has clearly not been their fault necessarily.

It was represented as being in \"new\" condition (not actually new, but in that condition). What came was anything but. It was BADLY refurbished- Battery life of one hour, randomly powered off or rebooted, touch screen badly replaced, separating from the phone. After some back and forth they asked me to return it directly to them, not through Amazon. According to USPS tracking it arrived 4 WEEKS ago. I still have no iPhone from them. They have made excuses, stalled, made empty promises and still NO IPHONE. After I got Amazon involved the seller sent a message to contact them if I didn't receive the new phone within 3 days. That was 9 DAYS ago! I have since filed a claim with Amazon. Many times in the process they've asked me for my phone number, promised to call, and then never did. I have asked for my money back from the seller and still no response. I have been a very satisfied Amazon customer of 15 years. The FEW times I've ever had a problem Amazon has has always reacted promptly and professionally. I've never had a problem with a third party seller either. Until now. This is very disappointing. A business transaction is a very basic thing: You offer a product, a customer pays to have that product in the condition you claim it to be in. If it's not, you exchange it and every body moves on. Why these folks at Fiestacellphonestx can't understand this is beyond me. I have tried every reasonable means to get them to do what they are supposed to do- and still nothing. I ordered a refurbished Iphone some time ago from another 3rd party Amazon seller and it has worked beautifully.

Neely", "ReviewID": "R1WI6EAU729RM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying the iPhone 3GS in late March of '10 (unfortunately just before the new model arrived), I am pleased to write a review of such an amazing, affordable phone.  Inside Apple's sleek, stylish box comes the iPhone 3GS, Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic,  Dock Connector to USB Cable, USB Power Adapter, and the usual user guide. I must say, I've never used the dock connector, but a nice gesture on Apple's part. It's clear that Apple spent as much time perfecting their exclusive mobile operating system, as they had on their seamless Mac predecessors. In the two and a half year span I have owned this phone, it hasn't frozen once. The easy-to-use operating system not only requires minimal knowledge of current technology, but protects your phone from most \"freezing\" and \"crashing\" errors you'll find with most competitors. Unfortunately, since Apple themselves do not create most of the applications available in the (preloaded) app store application on the phone, some of the applications are more prone to error. This, however, is for another day. Let's stick to talking about the phone itself.  Since the iPhone operating system is so exclusive, Apple requires you to download iTunes, a free downloadable program which houses movies, music, games, photos, events, and even contacts on both your iPhone and your computer. Convenient, right?  Getting into the more technical specs of the phone, you'll find that the iPhone not only comes with an ambient back-light sensor, but you'll see that you have an accelerometer. First off, an accelerometer is an instrument used to detect the force of motion (either by gravity, or by motion). The accelerometer within the iPhone can, therefore, measure the speed of movement of an object on which it is attached. Using the Nike + iPod sensors when running makes full use of the accelerometer: the attachable shoe-sensors you receive will (based on the amount of time the shoe is on the ground vs. the amount of time it is in the air) convert this information into an accurate measure of your running speed. How cool!  The iPhone has one of the best battery lives of any phone on the market today. From a personal standpoint, I need only charge my phone once every TWO DAYS. Phenomenal. This should be mind-blowing to those of you who need to charge your phone within 6, 4, or sometimes even 2 hours. The iPhone offers its users 30 hours of music playback, 10 hours of video, 7-9 hours of internet use (depending on the network you're using), 8-12 hours of talk time, and a whopping 300 hours of standby (screen off, phone on).  For those of you who may not speak English, the iPhone is definitely a product you should consider. To say the iPhone supports a handful of languages (like most phones) would be an immense understatement. Apple offers you a myriad of options: \"English (U.S.), English (UK), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\"  So regardless of the language you speak, Apple made sure to provide you with the same options given to their English-speaking consumers.  On top of the aforementioned, the iPhone 3GS will come with a 3-megapixel camera, and optional video. It comes with Bluetooth and GPS capabilities, along with the usual 3.5-inch (diagonally measured) widescreen with \"Multi-Touch\" display and a 480x320 resolution at 163 ppi (pixels per inch).

Throughout the years, the iPhone has been renewed and more efficient with its marvelous usages and captivating features; however, even though the iPhone is very useful for mainly everyone, there are some versions of the cellular device that aren't so great. For example, the iPhone 3GS allows its consumer to surf the web, text, record videos, explore YouTube, capture photos, sync music onto the iPod app, etc., but there are some fallbacks to this device despite the many features. Because of these fallbacks, it would be more convenient for the consumer not to buy the iPhone 3GS in order to avoid frustration, and to just go ahead and buy a slightly more expensive iPhone that allows the consumer to do much more. There's no point in buying a cool gadget that won't stand up to your expectations.  When it comes to the iPhone 3GS, consumers expect it to have loads of capacity for their items that they want to store such as: music, contacts, notes, email, pictures, etc. This is not all true because the phone can only support 8 gigabytes meaning there is minimal space when it comes to syncing old stuff onto the new device - there won't be any more room for new stuff. Speaking of minimal space, there are also minimal accessories available for the device that aren't cheap. Since this specific phone isn't as efficient as the iPhone 4, less people are buying the 3GS therefore making the accessories more obsolete. Because the phone is becoming obsolete, there aren't as many choices to choose from when it comes to buying phone cases or other accessories. Phone cases for this phone are very hard to find in a Target or WalMart making the consumer having to buy accessories online, which is an inconvenience, however much cheaper. Not to mention the fact that the iPhone 3GS doesn't have FaceTime, an implanted app on the iPhone 4 that is a convenient way to chat with other iPhone 4 carriers, flash, minimal ways to take pictures, limited space, and the bulkiness of the phone. The 3GS carriers are forced to take pictures one way - the standard way - without flash. They are also not able to face chat with others because there isn't a double screen allowing them to see who they're talking to; the  carrier would either purchase a chatting app and have to face the back of their phone the whole time due to no double screen. The space in the phone runs out quickly making the consumer delete photos, music, or apps to create more space - no one wants make that a habit of. Lastly, the phone is more bulky and round than the other iPhones which makes it harder to find more accessories and phone cases, and even creates an unwanted, large bump in the pocket of the carrier.  Because the newer iPhones are coming out with greater a capacity and better efficiency, they are consequently making the older iPhones more obsolete and forgotten. Not that the older iPhones are horrible and cheapy, but they lack the intelligence that the newer ones have attracting less and less of consumers to look at them twice. No one wants a phone with little space for apps and pictures, cloudy, disfigured pictures, phone cases that don't fit, and a fat phone so to speak. With little need to say, there is no competition when it comes to purchasing an iPhone. All of those who have the 3GS are obliged to admit that their phone is a waste of money because it isn't as efficient as the newer iPhones and that they simply need to upgrade. Despite the higher costs, the newer iPhones are much more advanced and convenient for people to use and cause no problems as far as satisfaction. Consequently, new consumers of a smart phone are to be directly appointed to iPhone 4's to avoid all hassles of the older ones.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Iphone", "Author": "Soro", "ReviewID": "R1SIN9ZB40K8MW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was not what I expected It was not what I expected It was not what I expected It was not what I expected It was not what I expected It was not what I expected It was not what I expected .dthth rgretgre fgd dfg gdr gsdg wtt ggrg gsdgds rgrfgtgrg fdhgdf gg ffds tr fgb hgy dedf jhjhg", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$550.00", "Features": "iPhone 3GS\nSize 8 GB", "Name": "Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB (Black) -(NOT UNLOCKED) AT&T ONLY USA", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UywapRmbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004ZLV50E"}}
