{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sonim XP3300 Force", "Author": "Nikola Novakovic \"Pecatorezac\"", "ReviewID": "RE6AHP36EYYOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very cool rugged cell phone, I also own one XP3.20 Quest but this one has much better features and a bit bigger display. Had a hard time figuring out why I can't get my JAVA apps to work or my internet but turns out that this model works only with T-Mobile's $30 plan, and once I activated that one instead of $10 one that was for basic phones it works great. A few days ago I tried using turn by turn voice guided navigation and I'm impressed with accuracy but I'll have to change the settings because it is set for kilometers instead of miles by default. I'm not one of the guys that will try to destroy it just for fun but I already had it under water because it got dirty and it works great. Had a hard time configuring hotmail on it but gmail works great and it downloads email much faster than older models. MMS works great and the micro SD card can be up to 16GB and I even installed class 10 card and works just fine. Opera Mini works fine but it is a bit slow, but that should be expected from EDGE connection. I also tried to assign caller pictures and I like it because it shows you a picture that is about five times bigger that the one on XP3.20 Quest model when using this feature. Bluetooth works great. Still did not use FM radio or music player so I can't say anything about them. Also on this model you don't have to have your charging port closed when your phone is getting wet, big props for that. The only thing that I could say could be better is ring tones and message tones,for message tone this phone has only one, I guess they think you can customize it how you want and download tones you like, I did that with my XP3.0 Quest. Still don't know much about battery life, first charge did not hold much but I was playing with it the whole time trying to set up all the features and internet, second charge seems to be much better. Usually you need a few charge/discharge cycles to reach full capacity anyway. Overall great phone that can be used under any condition and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a rugged phone.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Gean Boegman", "ReviewID": "R14M2GODH5YEP5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have a look at the Sonim facebook page and you'll see how poor the customer service is on this phone.  It's a great idea backed by a useless warranty.My phones SIM stopped registering after 2 months, this they fixed (I had to pay shipping), then the buttons started pealing, this they won't repair under warranty as it's COSMETIC, now the black bubber started pealing, not just a little, basically after one year of office use and one try in the pool and the phone looks like a 10 year old device.  Poor quality underpinned by poor after sales service.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sonim XP3300", "Author": "Zeus", "ReviewID": "R3AZC87FRM3V0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice phone, in the beginning it seemed to b bit bulky but now its 2nd day and i have got used to it and now fits comfortably in the hand and holds much better than my other phone iphone 4s, (this phone cant be compared with iPhone but Sonim has another purpose and is on top in it), easy to use keypad, and the phone is as described, the features that are mentioned are upto the mark and the phone is really tough, Speaker clarity is good and i can hear even in the most noisy environment, and network reception is good, apart from some limitation in the OS, i liked everything bout this phone,", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "worst customer service ever", "Author": "Nguyen Tuan Anh", "ReviewID": "R3K82ZUTMCUEWZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a XP3300 force. After 1 year the battery can't last more than a day. I checked the website and it actually said accessories like battery won't last more than a year. I did send email to ask about it (to the provided support email) but no one replied. After that I had to call them, but there's no one answer. I tried to dig for more phone numbers (from other countries' support phone number) and finally got 1 number that worked. I talked to a guy and he said he'll send me a new battery, he wrote down my address and all other details, then of course nothing happened, no one sent me anything.I did try to call back but this time no numbers work.The phone itself is ok, but battery won't last, and you can't even contact them to do anything about that so just forget buying it.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004NDPVO0"}}
