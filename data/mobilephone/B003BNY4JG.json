Whenever I found time in office, I used it.If I talk about exteriors, its beautifully crafted in design and aesthetic. Mine is in black color and sliding keypad is in light red color. You'll also get 2 more battery cover inside the pack.Now its time to discuss about some of the cool features of this Phone.Touch-screen: Though its a capacitive touch screen, it has one of the best touch response. Like all touch screen phones, it will vibrate whenever touch screen is used. You can also increase or decrease the intensity of vibration in phone tools.Display: One of the best among its categories of phones. Brightness can also be adjusted per user wish.Keypad: One of the coolest and best feature of this phone is sliding keypad which can be used for chatting, messaging and for browsing internet. Many times when I am not comfortable to use the touch panel, I am using keypad.Sliding the keypad out will also make the screen to be turn over towards the keypad.Sound and Music: Though I haven't used this feature, I heard the ringing tone was loud enough for me to hear the tone from inside the room.Wi-fi: This one really worked faster than I expected, probably coz I have best wi-fi installed in my home. The speed can vary from time to time.Google Maps: I never thought this phone would come with pre-installed google maps. When I opened it, the active GPS located my exact position in maps which I thought would be possible only in PC's.You'll get one battery charger, one headset jack, 2 software CDs, 1 data cable, phone manual, 2 additional battery cover inside the package.I will only say one thing- This phone is a value for money.....", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS PHONE", "Author": "Shalabi04", "ReviewID": "R1U8E8DG8QWEZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is AWESOME as you can read the description on the title of the phone \"Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO Quad-Band GSM Unlocked Cell Phone with Touch Screen, Full QWERTY keyboard, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth - International Version with No Warranty (Black/Red)\"i know that alot of people are huge iphones but i think this phone is better. its a touch screen plus it gots a Full QWERTY keyboardthere are only 3 cons about this product, none nothing really major1: figuring how to use the internet through WiFi is a pain, i still have not been able to figure it out how to do it2: as the title of this phone also describes, this phone does not come with warranty, now you can buy one with warranty but as you know the price of the phone will be a bit higher3: since this phone is not a windows mobile phone it would be a real big pain in the rear to back up your contacts appointments and filesbut besides all of this none of these really concerns me from how much i love this phone", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Alessandro N.

However, it arrived with a charger that would not work in the US. I called the seller, they mailed me a charger which was not brand new and was not Samsung. The charger works, however, when the phone is being charged I can't use it. I have to unplug it.

It worked perfectly, except for the fact that the Spanish language was not available for this phone.  It had English and Chinese.  My Godson was very disappointed because he was unable to use the phone due to the language issues.  The only thing I suggest that needs to be added/changed for this phone is for the Spanish language to be available.  This is a global phone, he was able to purchase a Sim card from Movistar.  The phone worked great on the network.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "Merilin Meite \"merkaaa\"", "ReviewID": "RD6L0NNGH5J2E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought it in March... it works, everything is ok, they send me the right phone so im happy with it BUT it says its 3G but idk if im stupid but i cant figure how to use it or how it works or maybe it just don't work.

Basically the same phone, same model number, but the Candy was only released in Taiwan.  Guess what language the phone I just received today as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old grandson is in??..  I can find no way to make it English, have no contact number for the company that sold it to me through Amazon - OEM, and I now have no gift for my grandson.  Cost me $187.00  and I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  It does say \"International\", but since when is one language international. I have e-mailed them tonight, and if they make this right I will re-post.  It is now December 13th, and I'm wondering how this will be fixed by Christmas.  OEM for Cheap is the name of the company...", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Massala", "ReviewID": "R2SH0UY2E494EZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please do not waste your money on this POS.

Simply Horrible.", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R8A5N14QBPQW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you already like this type of phone then this may not be a big issue to you.  My complaints are:1. Always remember to lock this phone.  Otherwise you will be \"face dialing\" the person you are talking to, beeping constantly in their ear.  Another side effect is you almost always accidentally put them on speaker phone.2.  The software buttons may be depressed 10 or 11 times before they respond.3. Texting is a nightmare.4. I challenge any normal person who just wants to use a phone to dial using one hand.  It is horrible.I would imagine this is not particular to samsung, any similar design may have similar issues.  Little daily annoyances with this phone, nothing huge but they add up.  Wish I had my old razor back.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a Corby Pro (not formated for English Language)", "Author": "Andrew G Hinson", "ReviewID": "RWDTMTOR56WCZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Other reviewers are correct that seller listing as a Corby Pro is incorrect.  They shipped a Samsung Candy.  The phones are identical in appearance and features with the exception that the keys and the language on the phone are in Hindi, not english.  Samsung and the Seller are unable to provide any support for the phone.  Hence the langauge cannot be changed.  The Corby Pro is a phone that was sold in the UK and is an English language phone with correct keys.  Notice that the other reviewers rating this highly are Indian (so it is probably a great phone if you read Hindi)", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dont buy, if you are not Thai", "Author": "Mamta G", "ReviewID": "RY5KMY34HW7LC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I bought this phone, I mean the corbyPro but they sent me Candy 3G, i dont know those are same model or not, they look a like.
