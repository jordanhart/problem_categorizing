Size, weight, and overall sleekness is about as good as it gets. You will be amazed how light this phone is. It's also thinner than a Gs4 and iPhone 5! Glass on the front and back and it's WATERPROOF! The software Ui is very useful and I haven't found anything stock that I can't uninstall completely. The battery life is on part with an iPhone or a Gs4. If you like to play a lot then you better pickup an external  battery like the ones made by Anker sold here on Amazon. I have an Anker battery and it is the best! The screen: I was blown away by the screen contrast, colors, and brightness! The new Triluminous display tech delivers!The ONLY potential downfall of this device, aside from the price, is ironically one of its key features: it's screen size. It is a big phone. Bigger than you expect and I came from a Note 2 so I like the extra room. To offset the shear size of this phone I also bought the Sony SBH50 NFC headset. It is a welcome accessory for calls. I wish I'd waited and bought the SBH52 but it is not currently released yet and I am not very patient. You can write and sketch on it too but I don't do much of that. I will say that the lines produced when drawing are clean and fluid. They are not jaggy or rough at all.There may be a slight lag in the input but it is SLIGHT.If you can live with the size of this gorilla then you have every reason to buy this. It will not disappoint.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great attempt by Sony but still has its flaws", "Author": "JJM", "ReviewID": "R2RLMV5RL0HW66", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently switched from Nokia to Sony due to the vast improvements to their Xperia line up this year. I will mention that I also own an Xperia Z and a Nokia Lumia 920. I bought the Ultra Z to replace my tablet and Xperia Z as an all in one for school since I'm a college student. I will also mention I'm over 6 feet and have big hands so this review may contradict what you have read in media reviews. I will go over aspects of the phone most people are interested in.Dimensions:Yes this phone is big, but I can operate it comfortably due to my big hands. It also doesn't look as funny when I'm making a call due to my height. It fits nicely in my front pants pocket as well.  What amazed me is how thin this phone is!! Yet the shape of the phone is a hindrance in holding it comfortably for long periods due to its sharp corners. To sum it up, this phone is for big people. I highly recommend a headset to use with this phone such as the SBH50 or SBH52.Build:It has a very solid build and the metal edges are a big improvement over the Xperia Z. I even dropped it accidentally on a tile floor a few times and not one ding surfaced. However the screen is sensitive and I did get a few scratches on it. A screen protector is highly recommended. Unfortunately the Xperia Z would get dinged up even if you bumped it against drywall.Screen:The screen is a huge improvement over the washed out screen of the Xperia Z. The colors are richer and the viewing angles are much better. I don't understand why people say the viewing angles on the Xperia Z were fine, but when you compare it to the Ultra Z, its just horrible. Sadly, the screen on my Lumia 920 has better color richness and viewing angles compared to the Xperia Z Ultra. The interface on the Lumia 920 pops out more, but where the Xperia Z Ultra has an advantage is viewing movies and games. Movies look awesome on it and decent on the Lumia 920. But I did notice photos looked much better on the Lumia 920 then the Xperia Z Ultra. Strange.After reading all the media hype from Sony about X Reality, I was impressed but experiencing it really let me down. I feel the XReality engine is a gimmick and didn't see a significant improvement over the Bravia 2 engine. Actually, the Ultra Z came installed with Bravia 2 before the X Reality update. Low grade You Tube videos and movies still looked bad but with saturated colors that made it appear unnatural. Photos on the Lumia 920 still looked much better compared to the XReality processed photos of the Ultra Z.Another downfall of the screen is the sensitivity. Its just too much. Even getting a few drops of water on the screen causes the phone to behave erratically. I don't understand some claims that this phone can take photos underwater. The phone will not operate properly if there's water on the screen!!! I will give a thumbs up to the Xperia Z since it can still be operated with the screen wet.Viewing this device in sunlight is adequate. Its not as great as some media sources claim it to be. (I live in Hawaii where's it bright and constantly sunny)Connectivity and Interface:I will gladly mention this phone is extremely fast. Whether using Wifi, playing games, watching movies, or multitasking with numerous apps, there was never any lag or freezing. Opening web pages and interacting with the GUI was smooth and very efficient. I was very surprised at Sony's decision of using the new Snapdragon 800 and feel it's the best part of this phone.Internal storage is extremely limited since its only 16GB and I quickly consumed 90% of it. An external SD card is highly recommended. Its too bad games cant be saved to the external drive since this will alleviate the small internal storage capacity.Yes, the phone still suffers from overheating, but it takes about an hour or more of web browsing or gaming to notice it. But this is the fault of a powerful processor in a thin body next to a large battery. Not much can be done about it.The battery drains quickly as well due to the processor and screen.(Even when its turned down to its lowest setting) With constant web browsing and playing games, I can get the battery level down to 10% within a few hours. However, stamina mode is a big place and is very efficient in extending the battery life.Sound:External sound is okay but due to the waterproofing of the speaker, it doesn't get very loud. Internal audio through headphones is crisp and clear and having an equalizer is great for fine tuning the sound.Camera:The front and rear camera is another weak point on the phone. Lack of flash and problems with sharpness and color are the major gripes I have. However I wasn't satisfied with the Xperia Z's camera performance either since I used the Lumia 920 before it. (Excellent low light and brightly lit daytime photos.)For both Xperia's I noticed photos had blurry edges, sometimes washed out in low light, and the colors were unnatural when viewed on my PC. However, photos were decent on bright days for both Xperias. The camera interface may be a bit overwhelming for some people due to the plethora of options. But I must say  I lean more towards the Lumia 920's camera due to its simplistic interface, dedicated camera button and excellent low light shots and am being biased about the Xperia Z Ultra's camera.Is the Xperia Z Ultra for the average smartphone user? In my opinion, no. Its more of a niche product for those interested in replacing their phone and tablet with an all in one device. If you spend more time viewing media, gaming and web interfacing and little time on phone calls, this is the perfect device for you. It is also too big for most people to handle comfortably as a phone, but does a fine job functioning as a mini tablet. I may have seem biased by comparing it to the Lumia 920, but Ive read too many reviews and comments which seem to exaggerate various aspects of the Ultra Z and don't represent what I have experienced. There are much better smartphones out there for the money, and unless your a die hard fan of Sony, I cant recommend this for the majority of smartphone users.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow,,,,,", "Author": "Boban mathew", "ReviewID": "RMK781RHLC7W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best one,,,,, and it's just like ur home theater in ur pocket,,,,, value for money.

All of thesewere good on the Notes 2 and 3 but Sony let me down.I was hesitant to try the Xperia Z Ultra because of my experience with the original Xperia Z but I gave it a chance.Z ULTRA:LOVE IT!  Sony vastly improved the battery life (lasts all day with heavy use), the screen is much better, more colors, more vivid.  Speakerphone is not the loudest but it's much better than these other reviews would lead you to believe.It is a fingerprint magnet, but very well built, beautiful design.

I have been using Android phones for close to 5 years, so setup was simple and easy for me.PROS-Easy to use & setup-Very fast-large screen allows you to view webpages very easily-Clear & bright screen-Battery life is amazing for this size phone (I am a texter, emailer, couple of websites each day, but not a streamer person and I will get a day and a quarter out of this thing)  I've never had a phone that got over a day!  There is a power saving setting called Stamina, but when I put it into this mode my alarms won't ring because it appears that the phone can only be woken up with the power button in this mode.CONS:-Memory handling - file explorer shows \"emulated\" \"SD0\" \"SD1\" \"Removable\" and there seems to be copies of the same files everywhere.  I think because I took my SD card from my previous phone without unloading and reloading programs.  But the problem is that I backed up all of my files before switching and none of the programs can find the backups, so I ended up just reconfiguring manually.-It does not come with a file explorer app-It is big (one handed operations are very difficult even if you have big hands like I do-The power button is hard to push if you have a case around it-The power button is a little too close to the volume up/down rocker and I end up hitting that with my thumbOverall I still love it.  Worth $600, yes because it's the only phone on the market that is this big!

Not comfortable in your trouser pocket, but in my opinion no phone belongs there.At first you think this phone is pretty big, but after using it a while you can't go back to a smaller phone.Nowadays how much time do you spend with a phone calling somebody? In fact less than 1%. Most of the time you do apps or surfing or navigation,and here this phone is the best buddy you can have. And if you feel embarassed calling somebody with such a big phone at your ear just buy the bluetooth headset SBH52 (coming soon).The SBH52 can be used in two ways, ear-in or as a very small phone. Easy one touch NFC connection.The phone is a very elegant high quality product and very fast. 64GB SDHC micro is no problem. GPS is found within seconds, even in buildings often no problem.If you don't like \"Gangnam\" or \"Fruits\" I recommend this high-end device not everybody has ;).
