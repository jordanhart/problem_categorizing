{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice surprise package", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "RWXVPVWTRC4QA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a handy little phone that I am growing to like more and more everyday. I wanted and looked quite a bit for the bigger phones - Arc S, SGS2, etc. But for my work, where I am on my feet and about all day, I decided a smaller phone will work best. Quite happy so far. My dad bought an Arc last week, and I played with it as well. Very much the same phone, but the looks, feel and displays are much much better on Ray.Good:- Handy, and although small for my big hands, i hardly ever use landscape mode. thats bcoz i use Swipe, its awesome- Similar to bigger phone platforms- Great display, really much better than the bigger phones generally- Typical users - phone, text, some web, some social networking, some music, some video, lots of photos- LED light; its useful for my situation- Screen off button on top- front facing camera- quite decent battery- integration to social networkingBad:- Screen can be very sensitive to touch- No backlight on back and menu- timescape is ok. but all interface themes (text, music, gallery, etc) are very bland and boring. makes no use of awesome display- too many touches to make a phone call.- only for light/med app users. loading a higher # of apps slows down the phone quite a bit- need customizable widgets, shortcuts, themes, etc.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, some caveats.", "Author": "SylverCloud", "ReviewID": "R32IZP5UHK7PNS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Away from the latest trend of mammoth screens, ST18i caters to those (like me) who need latest technologies in a compact instrument. Big screens are good, but I would prefer them on my TVs rather than on mobiles phones for two reasons: Pocketability and battery-life. Though ST18i's battery life is not great as per specs (only 7hrs), its not too bad considering its size.Pros:1. Not too bad battery life2. Light and Elegant3. Packs a punch with gps and all.4. Good Display5. Great browserCons:1. Touch buttons are not backlit - weird as even low end models have it.2. Touch sensitivity is poor - many professional reviews mentioned this but downplayed it. I find it extremely irksome that on average a third of my clicks go unregistered. Most notably while trying to click 'stop-loading' button on top right corner of browser. I keep frantically hitting it, in vain. Also, it cannot register click by side-wards touch of a finger. I have big palms and tend to use it by one hand and this could be aggravating the problem.3. No Ambient Light sensor - The phone lacks auto backlit brightness. this is absolutely ludicrous as it greatly saves battery. **UPDATE** - There was some confusion over this and I reported no sensor as I didn't see it working. But I just did some tests and can confirm that the light sensor is very much working. Details below.4. Sony customisations lack lustre. No swipe to call/message like in samsungs. Calling user-interface is mediocre. Many of little apps like calculator are also not upto the standard. Not a big deal though as one can get much better ones on android market free of cost.5. Looks like Wifi-hotspot has a bug and Sony CS, as of Nov'11 has no answer.6. Vibration is feeble and I can't feel it in my pocket unless wearing a snugly fit pair of jeans.7. Home screen has 5 preset pages and the number cannot be changed - ridiculous restriction. (I'm using GO Launcher EX which has a lot more functionality than the stock launcher can offer including swipe gesture shortcuts.)8. Though the display looks good, its not as good as Super AMOLEDs of Samsung. The latter are simply stunning, dont understand why SE isn't switching yet.Camera and video are okay, not a great user/fan of those hence cannot comment more. Wifi coonects good. GPS is great. Coming to the hot-spot glitch I'm not 100% sure if its not just my device, but pretty sure. While I'm on 3G HSPA, connectivity is good and I can load pages. But the moment I turn on wifi hot spot tethering, it loads a few pages on my laptop and then data doesn't come in even though network is good. Give it some time may be a few tens of minutes or may be hours and it gets back on. Few more pages and gone again. If I restart the phone its working fine and able to load pages without any interruption. Switch on hot spot and the problem is back. Looks like a serious bug. Customer Service had no idea about a fix.If small form factor is priceless, then this one is to go with. But with caveats. Currently using it on Vodafone 3G in India.**light sensor update**: I initially reported that there is no ambient light sensor despite it being listed in specifications and in whitepaper. I did so as I could detect no change in background light despite good amounts of variation in ambient lighting. With my dad's Samsung Galaxy S, effect of changes in ambient light can be easily felt and I was expecting to see something similar on Ray. When I ran a service test on this sensor I observed that the sensor is not sensitive to a great extent on levels of indoor lighting. It read zero in a brightly lit room and a completely dark room as well. However, when top right corner (location of the sensor) is illuminated with an LED source the value went up to 200. The rate of change is also lethargic. I ran the LED illumination test on home screen and I did observe a slow but steady increase in backlit level. The change is too slow to be detected by an undiscerning eye. Moreover, the automatic backlit doesn't go from 0 to 100% bright, but only enhances backli levelt to a certain extent over the user chosen backlit level in preferences. Some might find this better compared to 0-100% backlight change like in Galaxy S.UPDATE 1: SE Cust Serv said a device they had no issues with hotspot. They advised me to update the phone. After a lot of struggle with the SE PCcompanion software (I'm a geek and pro at these) and spending 12hrs (with a couple of unsuccessful attempts) it got updated. Initial tests have revealed that the problem persisted but looks like it had been mitigated. Now, the phone does drop HSPA data connection but reconnects automatically. It is still an issue as it would mean dropped calls if you are on skype. Need to do more tests including testing on other networks just to make sure there is no network parameter to blame. Shall keep posted.UPDATE 2: I did a \"repair phone\" via pc connection as recommended by SE Cust Serv. I ran a download test for 17min on 3G and NO signal drop was detected. I wouldn't jump to say \"issue resolved\", but certainly am positive about it. I'll  post an update.UPDATE 3: I have been using HSPA (3G) on router mode, browsing on my notebook. It has been stable and I can say that the problem reported earlier got fixed with software repair.Experience after a month of usage: The stock software interface is below par, but most of it can be mitigated with free apps on market. My earlier experience with SEs had been excellent, but this one definitely doesn't live up to expectations of user-interface and battery life. SE just got lost with smartphones. Nevertheless, I have no misgivings as I dont think I have another phone (that rivals ST18i) in the current (late 2011) market I would like to buy. Hope my review helps the readers. Happy buying!More updates - 3+ months of usage: I found FM Radio subpar by quality of playback/sound and the app design. The later is worth nought and lack of 3rd party FM players on android market adds to agony. More irritating is that the radio's heavy noise makes it unusable the moment phone is plugged to charger. I hope this is firmware issue and will be gone with next release - icecream sandwich. Its due in few weeks and sneak peeks give a favourable review.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "SONY ERICSSON XPERIA RAY / ST18i (BLACK) : UNLOCKED INTERNATIONAL GSM ANDRIOD PHONE", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R20JSZO26N63BB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "where to begin, where to beginso i bought this phone and it came in a brown box 3 days after ordering. the box contained the retail box with the phone in it. i was so excited cause i was shaking the box before opening, thinking \"hmmm whats in it ^^\". ok, so in the box is the standard things, the phone in a plastic wrap on top. under you get standard headphones, usb cable and charging thing. the charging thing is ugly. just saying. its this white plug with the black thing with 2 prongs. yea its stupid. it also came with the fcc statment sar information booklet, the getting started guide, and something else i cant remember. it also came in another language. now heres the first disappointment with my order. now on youtube and on this amazon page, you read the the package comes with a 1500 mAh battery. i repeat, a 1500 mAh power battery. i got a 1460 mAh power. of course, 40 mAh difference really isnt much, but i think if a seller is going to sell you or another consumer something, they should sell exactly what you said. but i dont think the battery is that badit did come with a 4gb memory card, but i swapped it with a sandisk 8gb micro sd card. i placed in my sim card (tmobile prepaid in nyc usa) and there were no problems. phone took that signal without a problem. it asked to transfer contacts, choose language, etc. it also also you to disable data usage on the spot, which was nice.  after the phone boots up, it lags a little, but then disappears. i guess it was to load all the stuff it needed to do at first. afterwards, omg the phone doesnt noe how to lag.so the final overview, after many testingspro :battery life is decentscreen is beautiful. it really is.the camera is jaw droppingthe call quality is nice.the speakers with xloud really pack a punchit feels nice in your hands, certainly a 260 dollar phone.i can show it off to people. cant do that with an iphone ;) its not like you can go to somebody and say, i got a new iphone, it can do this and this and that. i mean, everybody knows what an iphone is capable of. so boringit has swype, which is basically you type without having to lift your finger off the keyboard.easy to put music in and out.no video lagfront facing camerai cant think of anything else here, but the phone is amazingcons:the touch screen starts to annoy me if you get near the edges of the screen. everywhere else it response like you want it to. the edges, you should be a little more accurate. but thats okie dokie, since i ive already gotten use to it.ugly charger. seriously, tall and fatno back light on the soft keys.the screen is not really scratch resistent. i place it in my pocket, no keys no coins no nothing. the fabric is really soft to touch, but when i take it out, minor minor scratches. yes they are minor, u cant see them when the screen is on, but still.... it hurts not just the phone, but my heart =(_____________________________________________________________________-thats basically it really, the phone is amazing, im in love with it and im never letting it go. in fact, im going to it right now. baii", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Reply to Sylvrcloud  (sp.?)", "Author": "inj", "ReviewID": "R1YP1OPWFVQORT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: not too bad battery life?? No, I'd say its average like any other phone.BUT:SE has been bigger in the east and the UK too. They are great in combination with services provided by vodafone, docomo etc. I have previously had an SE phone, too and I loved it. The W595. I loved SMS on it, the camera took better pictures than a 5MP cam for reasons I never figured out. It was a slider and so smooth, no, it was well built all together. I never even had any issues to have to go to customer support. My other friends has SE phones (the more advanced ones too) and they all loved them. The phones were favored for their cool factor (backgrounds, SE buttons, lights, everything) and the speakers (crisp and clear). I don't know if the recent events had caused them to use anything different in their factories, but since they were bought out by Sony, I'd say so. They were honestly developing good phones, and I havent had this phone long enough to tell if they did change between then and now. I'm not going to be prejudiced but I am not going to think of SE as a company that made bad phones.But as of my first few weeks,There is an LED button with the home button which lights up when you press it and the other two physical buttons that don't light up are positioned on either side. From the beginning, they are set to vibrate everytime you press them, so unless you turned them off for battery life, theres no problem. And even then, though, how would you miss them? One, on either side.The plastic cover: Am I the only one who likes this?? The aluminium frame is a slightly different color, so there are two shades on the colored phones which show off the slant and general design. The plastic won't get scratched easily, can give that bright amazing color unlike aluminium, and is replacable for any other color for any reason. It also helps the phone with its weight. In fact, when I first took out the phone, since it didn't have its battery, it was way light. I was relieved when the battery gave it some solidity.Touch sensitivity: My other phone wasn't my iphone 4 is (well duh) and yes the iphone has better sensitivity. But let me put it out there that I can't imagine mine missing a third of it. It definitely doesnt happen so often that I am irked, its every once in a while if I was way too light or it was one of the tiny close buttons. The phone is definately not made for larger fingers or palms. The iphone has great sensitivity and still finds ways to lag or hang which bothers me way more than having to put down more of the area of my finger on this. Its very easy for me to fleet and end up barely touching it.Yeah the basic phone app you get with the phone sucks. Agreed. But I'm surprised if you use that if you have more than 5 home screens. I just havent used it much. Talkatone gives you a swipe to answer or reject. The rest of the customizations, the ringtones, the basic feel and design of each screen, I really like and always liked those from SE. Like I said, people loved them back when.FM recepter is in the headphones.The music app though? Its very pretty. No, really. The widget too. My music seems so crisp. I can hear the whispers at the end of the words. I don't really know how else to explain it. But I have my first problem here: It jarrs when you open another app while listening to it loud on speaker, for a second or two. I haven't heard anyone else having a problem with this, so I'll check for viruses then call Sony.I've been using my Wifi since the day I got it so I don't know if thats just your phone.I havent had a need for a lots of vibration, I used to hate nokias for moving themselves across the table everytime they vibrated. But I can understand that part. I think its since the phone vibrates with the key touch. They should put in a different, more effective vibration mode for calls/messages.My point is, this phone was able to fit my preferences. For me it was the best of all worlds. I really don't like big phones. Theyre like little bricks and need a lot of pocket/bag space. if you wear tight fitting jeans, you know what I mean. I have to reposition my hand everytime I need to reach the back button on the iphone. I love having the choice between 12 key and full keyboard because with 12 are larger keys, which I find easier for SMS/messaging. I can use this if I go out of country, too.Edit: Whoops, I misunderstood the FM part.I forgot talking about the price. My W595 was almost the exact same amount when it came out. And even in general, this is fairly priced for what it can do. If taken up by Att or Tmob, it would have been way cheaper, maybe even under 100, but I suspect they didn't because huge phones have more market right now. And everyone's SE customer service issue. To be fair, I doubt the international version phones were made to support all our services. The way the networks work there is totally different. I'm not saying they shouldnt be upheld to fix firmware issues but I think the same software would work atleast a little better everywhere else. Say, the options, call settings, programming in relation to internet and the way it interacts with the newest apps, messaging.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Littlie device rocks on Andriod platform", "Author": "Gaurav \"Gdhakan\"", "ReviewID": "RTRBBJ0AY7OHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This smart phones totally rocks, very light weight, elegant and feels good holding the phone.It does not have a very big screen though, but big screens are not everyones preference. I personally like phones which are the size of a phone and not a tablet as it gets very uncomfortable carrying them.Pros:1. Elegant design2. Very light weight, easily fits in pocket.3. Amazing Sony camera and music player with xloud feature.4. Andriod makes this phone more strong since its the best within market. It has applications that iPhone would not have. The iPhone 4s Siri feature is not the ultimate because google already has google voice feature on andriod phones which is amazing. Moreover they have come out with assistant which is nothing but your personal assistant.5. I could do things such browse any websites, download files, email them or attach to emails, watch flash content etc etc with no problems. However, I tried doing same things on apple products, be it iPhone or iPad, it fails do to simple jobs such as attach file to emails.6. There are a lot other features on this phone  which you might learn once you have it.Cons: the battery runs out fast but I believe this is a problem for all smart phones since a lot of applications are running most of the time I.e. email, personal assistant, gtalk, whatsapp, facebook etc.....All in all, andriod phones are the best, becomes more strong when combined with Sony Ericsson.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautifully designed phone with some livable flaws", "Author": "Josue Fontecha", "ReviewID": "R3GIQFN85XY8YV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Things I love about this phone:- the design: the phone is a real joy to hold and feel in your hand. Sometimes when I'm thinking about a problem, I take it out and just hold it in my hand while running my thumb across the screen or back. Holding it feels like touching a very polished obsidian stone. You can watch a video of how the device was designed by searching for \"sony xperia ray design\" on YouTube- great camera for such a small device- very light- decent battery life- very high density display: 297 PPI- zen like feeling when holding it (seriously)- expandable external memory via sdcard (upto 32gb)- relatively easy to \"root\"Things I don't like:- very low internal memory (<512mb): wish Sony had included AT LEAST 1gb of internal memory on this device as 512mb runs out very quickly after installing just a few apps...- i think the GPS is not the best: (1) it failed on me once while I was out jogging and got lost in the woods in the middle of a really cold winter. To be fair I have no idea what the operating temperatures of the device were/are (2) the GPS seems to not work without a simcard... I think this might be a design flaw as GPS seems to work fine without a sim on my iPhone4- the included music player app should have included an option to at least search what you want to add to playlists INSTEAD of just showing all your songs on one screen. Very very annoying.- no hdmi out: a real shame as this could have been a great device to just plug into your tv\\monitor and watch movies or play gamesOn a sidenote, the phone is not the fastest (it was released in August 2011 though) but it's still very usable.
