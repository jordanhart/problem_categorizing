{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best High End Smartphone Deal In America?", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R1U6TRSKXL1FSN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the first generation Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my \"other\" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say \"Ok Google\" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no \"skin\" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is now how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google \"iPhone Plans Comparison\" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these \"iPhone Plans\" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and \"On The Go\" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google \"Meenova\" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the SPIGEN Google Nexus 5 Screen Protector Clear [Crystal] [3-PACK] **Japanese PET Film** Premium Front Screen Protector for Nexus 5 (SGP10559), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to my RINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The iPhone Killer", "Author": "TheLarson", "ReviewID": "R2UDUTM1RPH0QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone from the Google Play store for $350. I was one of those people who knew it was coming out and waited patiently on the day of to order it right away. I was told it would take about 11 days to show up, however, I received it about 5 days later, including weekends.The phone is great. For the price (and I honestly think that this phrase undervalues the specs on the phone) you cannot get a better deal. This phone goes head to head with every top phone on the market today, and that's something that can't be said of others.I switched from an iPhone to this Android phone. If you are in the same boat Apple puts you in year after year with their controlling updates and seemingly endless process of outdating perfectly good phones so you have to buy their newest one, you should highly consider this phone. Google does an excellent job getting bugs fixed and updates out to you, and they take less than 5 minutes to install. You will be running the latest and greatest Android has to offer, and you don't have to worry about being outdated anytime soon.For $350, you can replace your current phone with the best specs on the market and opt out of renewing that awful contract.

Incredibly fast, light and thin - but is it as good as the iPhone 5s costing more than double the price? Read on to find out.....Firstly, a word of warning. This is a lengthy, thorough and in depth review to compare the two phones - not just trash one or the other. I personally have an iPhone 4S, iPad Air, an Apple TV and several Macs. However, I also have an open mind and limited budget.Display----------The Nexus has a stunning 5 inch HD screen with more pixels on a larger screen, and they're more densely packed. For the techies among us, the Nexus is 1080x1920 pixels and 445 pixels per inch (ppi). This clearly beats the iPhone's 4 inch retina screen at 1136x640 pixels at 336ppi.But what does this really mean? It means you get a bigger, better quality screen than an iPhone 5s (which as a fan of Apple, really surprises me). What it means, is photos and videos just look absolutely stunning, and web pages razor sharp.In short, screen quality on the Nexus is absolutely brilliant, with pure whites and super-sharp text on a larger screen. A clear winner for the Nexus.Speed---------Both Nexus and iPhones are blistering fast. Web pages display instantly, scrolling a breeze, and you can rapidly jump between apps. So not a lot in it. This is an incredibly fast device for the money.It's also worth noting both Nexus and iPhone support the super-fast 4G network as well as existing 3G. You may pay more for a 4G contract (although not from Tesco Mobile or Three), but if you want to get the best out of your phone it's a consideration.Look, Feel and Build Quality-------------------------------------Lets be honest here. The iPhone wins hands down on the top quality, hard edged aluminium industrial design from Sir Jonny Ive. It's lighter, smaller and thinner than the Nexus, and if you have smaller hands (but deeper pockets), it's a beautiful device. A top end BMW 5i compared to a Ford, Peugeot or VW Golf.The Nexus is physically larger with rounded off corners, a lightly curved rubberised back, and tough \"Gorilla Glass 3\" screen. Quietly understated, although the Nexus 5 is (on paper) very slightly heavier, (see specs below), it also \"feels\" lighter - incredibly light in the hand given the relatively huge screen size.I have to admit, the Nexus does sit nicely in the hand, feels light, and the screen is just massive - but if you're looking for top quality Android - you need to pay around double the price, and buy the \u00a0HTC One (M8), but on build quality - the iPhone wins.Camera-----------Considering both have an 8 mega-pixel camera with optical image stabilisation (ie. the camera tries to compensate for shaky hands), the iPhone wins by a fair margin. Automatic zoom on the Nexus is a bit hit-and-miss. I often find you need to use the \"tap to focus\" feature, and annoyingly even this doesn't work perfectly sometimes, especially in low-light conditions where the iPhone wins.Having said that, in normal outdoor situations, it's great for quick snaps, and you can always use a \"proper camera\" if you're really serious about photography.Battery Life---------------Always difficult to tell without a head-to-head test, and even then I think it depends upon how you use the phone. Typically video over WIFI burns the battery and a review (search for \"V3 iPhone Nexus compare\" to see) has helpfully done much of the work for us.Nexus ran 7.5 hours compared to iPhone 5S at 7. So (despite other Amazon reviewer gripes), it's pretty much comparable.Having said that, today I've blitzed the phone today. Downloading Apps, searching on Google, navigating and watching videos of-and-on for the past 11 hours, and it still has 18% battery left.I'll update this review after a few months real world experience.Storage----------Nexus comes with 16 or 32Gb of storage compared to iPhone's 16, 32 or 64Gb, and neither have expandable storage. Having said that, I've lived happily with a 16Gb iPhone for nearly five years without issue, but it depends upon how you use it.Price-------For once it's absolutely black and white. \u00a0Compared to the iPhone - the Nexus 5 is an absolute bargain. \u00a0Fantastic value for money.What about Apps?-----------------Firstly, an App, is a small \"application\" (a program) that runs on your phone or tablet, and there's thousands available from both the Apple and Android stores. Be aware they're \"Apples and Pears\" - an Apple App will only run on an iDevice (iPhone, iPad etc), and you'll need an Android App for this phone.Many apps cost $1 - or 69p in real money, and there's thousands free (frequently advertising funded with an ad-free version for 69p). Here's my favourites:-* Mailbox. \u00a0Incredibly slick mail box app (gmail only - sorry). \u00a0(Free)* Go SMS pro. (Go Chat on Apple) Send and receive text messages. (Free)* QuickOffice. Edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents. (Free)* Evernote. Write and organise notes. Edit them on your Nexus, iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac (Free)* DropBox. Access your files, documents and photos anywhere. (Free)* Tune In Radio. Listen to 1,000s of radio stations world-wide (\u00a32.40)* Spotify. Stream music for \u00a35 a month (or free with ads). Brilliant! (Free)* eBay. Buy and sell your stuff while you're out and about. (Free)* Zite. Online web magazine that learns what you like. Terrific! (Free)* Movies by Flixter. Read reviews of films on cinema and DVD. (Free)* Kindle. Read your books from Amazon Kindle bookstore. (Free)* 1Password (reader). \u00a0Read only access to passwords. \u00a0(Free)Note: All of the above without exception are available on Apple and Android, and some (Evernote, Spotify, DropBox and Box) also run on PCs and Macs.So to my mind - it's a draw. OK, so it's common knowledge that many new apps (typically games) are first launched on the iPhone first, but the market for Android Apps has matured, finally catching up with Apple.Admittedly, I do find iPhone versions of Apps tend to be slightly better versions, as they seem to be launched on Apple first, and Android second, but the difference is not crippling.Viruses - Apple Vs Android------------------------------Unlike Apple who stop you buying Apps from anywhere else, on Android you CAN buy Apps from the equivalent of a \"dodgy bloke in the pub\" - or indeed reputable companies like Amazon. It's up to you really.On Android, if you try to install an app off the internet you get the message \"For security, your phone is set to block installation of applications not obtained from the Android Market\". You can unset this on \"Settings --> Applications --> Unknown sources.In short, if you get a free copy of an App by mail or a web site and you ignore the warnings and install it - you risk getting a virus. It's your call.Operating System---------------------The Nexus runs Android whereas Apple run iOS. Personally I think much is down to taste and what you're used to.Worth noting however, is the Nexus is one of the few Android phones which aren't loaded with additional \"bloatware\" rubbish. Samsung for example, load their phones with a confusing (and unnecessary) \"Touch Wiz\" interface to differentiate their offering. Personally I'd always stick to a Google Android device. As well as avoiding the useless bells and whistles, you get upgrades direct from Google. Other phones often take months to provide upgrades (sometimes never). Worth knowing, if you're considering another Android phone.The statistics-------------In common with Apple, I've tried to avoid quoting \"the numbers\" except to illustrate a difference as pure stats can often misleading. But for those who like to compare:-GOOGLE NEXUS 5OS: Android 4.4.2 (KitKat)CPU: Quad core 2.27Ghz Snapdragon 800Space: 16g or 32gScreen: 5 inch (diagonal) , 1920x1080 (HD) display with 445 pixels per inchCamera: 8 MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 137.9 x 69.2 x 8.6 mm - very thin bezel, almost all screenWeight: 130gAPPLE iPHONE 5sOS: Apple iOS (7.1)CPU: A7 chip with 64 bit architectureSpace: 16g, 32g or 64gScreen: 4 inch (diagonal), 1136x640 with 326 pixels per inchCamera: 8MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mmWeight: 112gOverall Conclusion--------------------Well, I guess in conclusion I bought a Nexus not an iPhone, and that says it all.On balance, the Nexus 5 is:-* Blisteringly fast* Has a beautifully clear, large display (without being silly)* Runs an excellent version of Android (direct from Google so bang-up-to-date and without bloatware)* Runs all the Apps I already run on my iPhone* Is MUCH cheaper!Lets be honest, if I had cash to burn, I'd love an iPhone 5s (or even better a 6). I think the iPhone is a beautiful example of industrial design with top end build quality. Add to that the superb integration with the iPad, Mac and Apple TV, not to mention the security of the touch ID fingerprint scanner, and I can understand why they charge more.If you really can't stand Apple (or think the iPhone screen size is too small. but have the money, I'd also consider the HTC One (H5). \u00a0Apple quality build on Android.However, at this price, it's a steal. Absolutely astonishing value for money, and highly recommended.

Mainly I'm here to report that the first time I dropped it on a hard surface, the screen shattered.  The screen did not touch the surface, I had the bumper case (sold by google specifically for this phone) as well as a fairly pricey Zagg screen protector, but the screen shattered (more further down).The Good: The price is very reasonable.  The screen looks nice.  It is responsive (fast).  The battery life is fairly good;  It lasts much longer than my last phone, but there are definitely days where it runs out faster than others.  Looking at \"Battery Monitor\" app, sometimes it only uses 10% in 12 hours, but other times 20% in 2 hours.  This is not solely based on usage, but seems to be based on a mishmosh of factors including location (distance from cell tower/wifi), settings and recent apps.  I suspect the phone tries to manage connectivity and updates, sometimes doing well, sometimes not.  That said, much better than my last phone.  The camera picture quality is quite good (if you can get the focus).The Bad:  Durability.  The first time I dropped this phone on a hard surface (with the bumper case and a screen protector) the screen shattered.  I know that this is bound to happen, and hey, maybe I just got unlucky on the first try, but I don't think so.  My previous phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) was dropped many times in the years I had it, on various surfaces and nothing ever broke.  The very first time I dropped this phone, the screen shattered.  I think it clearly implies that the case is fragile and/or simply doesn't protect the screen.  If the screen had touched the surface, all bets would have been off and I would not be blaming the phone.  But if the phone, with its own branded case transmits that impact directly to the screen, the first time, it's a poor design.I'm not giving up the phone for this, but one might want (I certainly will) to get a better than average case (not the google bumper case) unless you will never drop your phone.The average: The screen auto brightness always seems to be a bit bright.  The camera seems to have difficulty getting focus correct.  It will go through the focus process and in some situations tend to end up unfocused.  When it focuses, its great, but when it doesn't, its useless.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone. Love it", "Author": "Manu Kashyap", "ReviewID": "R1YKRZ7U3LSD68", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I moved from an iPhone 5 to the Nexus. Got it from the UK-Car Phone Warehouse- no waiting, no Play store delivery issues. Walked out with a 16GB version in 10 minutes for GBP 325.I have used Android phones in the past- HTC Desire and Note 1. Gave up both of them because of unstable performance of Android, bloatware, programmes shutting down etc. Have been using the iPhone since 4 and loved the experience. Have 3 Macs at home so was completely synced. Moving to Nexus (Android) was a long thought out decision and I was attracted by the larger screen and the great reviews it was getting. And of course the price when compared to the 5S was the best.In the 2 weeks I have used it I can say it has been a slow and transitioning love affair. It took some time to wean myself away from iOS. I carried my iPhone 5 without the SIM for a few days but now I am solo with the Nexus 5. The camera is amazing, the interface is great. Yes some of the apps are still unstable- notably the People app but overall the phone is great. The large screen size is excellent. The battery life leaves things to be desired but then everything is not perfect. I do miss a few apps especially Prismatic but I am hoping Android will catch up soon.The most difficult issue for me was to move from Notes, Reminder and iMessage in Mac and iOS. The fact that all the 3 apps are available seamlessly in the phone and the desktop/laptop makes life much easier.Hangout is an alternative to iMessage though you can only message a person's gmail address. It needs to go the extra step like iMessage and get associated with the phone number.For Notes and Reminders I tried out Google Keep but then it doesn't have an app on the Mac and opening drive.com/keep everytime is not my idea of being efficient. I have moved onto Evernote which is great but has one basic shortcoming in the free version- no offline access (in the phone version). I am told by other Android users there will nary be a moment when I am without an internet connection on the phone and so Evernote it is. I still prefer the clean, simple interface of Notes and Reminders of iOS/Mac as compared to the many options in Evernote.This phone is very fast and a pleasure to navigate. I have spent more time on browsing my photo albums in the last 2 weeks than I have spent in the previous 2 months on iPhone 5. One of the best features of an Android phone is the ability to view your Picasa library on the phone. This was not available on the iPhone. Picasa is my main repository of all photographs.The other KitKat features of phone number recognition do not work that much in the country I am in- we don't have a phone book in Dubai so Google can identify only if a business is listed with it in Google Local, Maps etc.Overall I would give this phone an8.5 out of 10.

After that I got the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (Excellent price/quality relation). Now, after testing the iphone 5, Galaxy S4 and LG Optimus G2 I must admit: This NExus 5 rocks!!! This phone is not the best in anything, but is a good all-around phone! Good call quality, normal loudspeaker, great screen (believe me, the N5 screen smashes the iphone 5 retina display). The combination of Snapdragon 800 processor and 2gb of RAM is something from another realm: blazing-fast response, zero lag between application changes, no overheating (unlike all iphones).The camera is not bad, I came from a Gnex and I have tested the Nexus 4 and this camera is way better!!! It isn't a DSLR professional camera but it can do the job (mostly in outdoor enviroments) for parties, reunions, travels and selfies, of course! heheheheheheIf you want a good phone (in all aspects) with a excellent price/specs ratio, choose the Nexus 5.

It seems to be about $50 or more here. One of the only features I wished it has is the ability to display animated gifts in the gallery. I also own the Nexus 10. Excellent tablet as well. The other feature that is missing that I had with the Windows phone I tried out and the Galaxy Note 8 is the ability to set your device on vibrate with just one touch instead of having to lower the volume button all the way down. Other than that, this device is golden. It's fast! The screen is very high res and touch is very sensitive. I like that you can order it in different colors. The sound is excellent although I have trouble understanding the design of a lot of these companies putting both speakers at the bottom instead of each side like the Nexus 10 and other Samsung products as well. How can you call it true stereo when all the sound is produced on the same side? Kind if diminishes the stereo effect. And what's with everyone rating a device low because of battery life? I have to say that I am very surprised if these devices last longer than 5 or 6 hours with constant play. And I noticed with this phone if I am just checking email or messaging periodically during the day, the battery will last all the same day through the next morning before I have to charge it again. Also, if I use it constantly all day playing and making phone calls, as I stated above, it still holds a charge for most of the day. To me, this is excellent battery life. I don't see where most if you think our battery technology should be by now. These devices take up a lot if juice especially while the screen is on. So if you want your battery power to last, don't play games on it all day or use apps that take a lot of memory cycles and keep the screen on. Be sure to charge your device ONLY when it has run down the battery very low and then let it charge 100% before you are on the go again. I know most of us are in a hurry and don't want to take the time to use these units correctly. Then we blame it on the unit or the battery. Use the correct charger also, not just anything that will plug in! I find this phone seems to charge within 4-6 hours and I think that's great for these units. It also has built in wireless charging capability which I have yet to try! You can also purchase the external battery packs that will keep the unit charged when you're on the go. I find those very helpful! So good luck! Personally, I love the phone.

In my humble opinion, this phone blows them all out of the water. I'm not going to get into hardware specs because other reviewers have already covered that, and there's more to performance than hardware specs. Doesn't matter how much RAM and processing power a phone has if bloatware is using up most of it. That was my issue with other Androids.In my experience, this phone is faster, smoother, and less buggy than those other Androids. I prefer it to the iPhone 5 (well I prefer the Android OS) because:-Android has widgets-Androids are very customizable-Android is easier to develop apps for-Seamless integration with my Google accounts (Gmail, Contacts, Calendar, Wallet, Keep, Maps, Finance, Youtube, etc.).I prefer the pure Google UI interface this Nexus uses to Samsung, HTC, and other interfaces. It's just so much smoother and less bulky. The other phones came with so much bloatware. Even after rooting my S3 and deleting bloatware it was slow and choppy. I can't speak to the newer S5.I honestly have no complaints. Camera features and picture quality are awesome for a mobile phone. I especially like that it has photosphere, panorama, and blur modes built into the stock camera app. The screen is beautiful and the battery lasts longer than most other phones I own. I don't need a home, office, and car charger anymore. The Nexus 5 is great for testing apps (I'm an Android developer), although getting the ADB driver setup for testing was a bit of a pain.Ok ok, I finally thought of a negative.

Since it takes 2 weeks to get this fixed, I decided to purchase an auxiliary phone while the ONE was being repaired.  After using  the N5, when I get the ONE back, it'll be the auxiliary phone. The N5 is the fastest phone I've ever seen.  This is running on Straight Talk, and it screams. I just popped in the sim card from the ONE, entered a few lines of network information and was in business.  I had backed up the ONE on Google, and my contacts and many apps were  immediately on the N5.  Life is good. Reviews of this phone from late in 2013 suggested that the display was dim and the camera was slow to write to memory and had focusing problems. The display is plenty bright- you can turn up the brightness to the point it's uncomfortable.  There are no problems with the camera. It focuses fast, and memory writes are very quick.  Frankly, I have been using real cameras to take photos for 60 years now, and I don't use cell phones for photography. Using a cell phone for photography is like taking a knife to a gun fight.  But I did try the thing out, and it's better than  the HTC ONE camera. Further, this is an unlocked phone, there is no bloatware, yes it pushes Google services, but Google services are OK in my book. The voice quality of the calls is as good as there is in any cell phone I know of. My only, really minor gripe is that comparing this to the HTC ONE, the N5'stransceiver is not quite as sensitive as the HTC ONE's.  This is based on dropping calls in marginal signal areas in which the HTC ONE had very poor reception, but the N5 has none. For example, the HTC ONE would answer a call in my bedroom, but I couldn't understand  the conversation without going to another room.  The N5 rings, but when I answer, there is no one there. Neither phone displays any bars in this location. The N5 is thin and light in it's plastic case. I find the N5 interface easier to use the the HTC ONE's interface. The N5 touch screen seems to interpret what my fingers are asking for better.  Also, I like the simplistic contacts application better.

Since my previous phone was an Android too, my new Nexus 5 just automatically synced and picked up all the apps I downloaded to the previous phone, and I thought that was pretty smart.  Can't really tell what difference Android 4.4 makes as opposed to the really old 2.3.X that I had before, but I suppose it has better compatability with certain apps.Now the complaints, there aren't many.  I do not appreciate being forced to use Google Hangout as the source of my SMS (text message).  Once I enter into a chat, I am having a hard time telling whether I am chatting over text messaging, or a web source.  In my opinion, Hangout is a pretty versatile add-on tool to Chrome, but it has a poor user-interface.  I think the phone version of Hangout is actually a bit easier to use; the one on PC is almost impossible to use.  Great for video conference calls, but very difficult to find or add new contacts.  You basically have to type in the exact e-mail address in order to find the right person.  TMI on how I feel about Hangout, but that is why I don't like it to handle all my text messages.  I am also having a hard time figuring out how to remove apps from the phone w/o having to go through the Play store.Battery life seems moderate, definitely not impressive.  Can't comment on useful life since I only had it for a week now.  One thing I don't like though is it does not allow you to swap the battery which is the most consumed part of a phone.  I don't see how it's going to survive two years (my normal cycle for a phone) without a battery replacement.Overall, I think it's an amazing phone for its price.  Never had a top-of-the-line phone like a Samsung Note 3 or iPhone 5S, but they can't be twice as good like their price tags suggest.  Final note - you are better off buying direct from the Play store, they sell the 16GB models for $349.99, and you pay about $385 after tax and shipping.

Also, don't be fooled and think there are two; the other one is actually the phone's microphone.-Camera is good but not great.I can't recommend this phone enough, but I would recommend buying it straight from Google as it will save you some money and give money right to them instead of padding the pockets of a reseller.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great as a 350-450$ phone, not good as a premium phone", "Author": "King James", "ReviewID": "RZVYSBFRC9X8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me just say this up front.  I don't like the fact that Sprint and all the other carriers are charging 450$ for a phone that Google on Google Play is charging 350$.  This is another way for these cell phone companies to keep the consumer under their thumb.  But, with that being said, the key word for me \"price,\" and for the price I really do like the Nexus 5, although I do have a few complaints about it.  Let me begin by saying that the white version of this phone and the black version are surprisingly distinct from each other.  I had believed that the white and the black version were the same exact phone just like every other black/white variation of every phone.  But they aren't.  First, they come in different looking boxes.  Just something that I'd thought i'd share.  Secondly, the earpiece (where the ear is when taking a call) on the white version is white while the black one blends into the black borders of the phone. Moreover, the white Nexus 5 is glossy around the sides whereas the black Nexus 5 has dull black sides,  Something to think about if one really cares about fingerprints on their phone (personally, I like the white version).  Now with that out of the way, the things that I do like about this phone is that it is very snappy and quick when swiping and bringing up applications, more so than some of the better spec phones such as the Note 3.  Another thing I like about the phone is it is light but it doesn't feel cheap.  It has a build that feels good in your hands.  And, the resolution on the screen is pretty damn good.  I am pretty impressed by the definition and detail when looking at the screen, and colors look great.  Now that's good news, but here is the bad news.  One of the first things that I've noticed when using the Nexus 5 is that the speaker is pretty weak.  It is not loud at all, and at full blast I couldn't hear the person on the other line when I was out in public.  Another thing that this phone is not good at doing is staying alive.  What I mean by this is that on one full charge, the phone will last about 4 to 5 hours max with regular usage.  If I don't use the phone much I may get a few more hours of standby time.  This bothered me because I need my phone throughout the day and I'm not always near an outlet, plus there's no way to open the phone and throw in a replacement battery. So, that definitely is a large negative for me.  Finally, another weak point on this phone is the camera.  Although the phone has a decent 8 mega pixel camera, the pictures I take in good light are not of great quality.  The pictures seem to be not of the right colors and it seems to dull the light out a bit.  Furthermore,  I can't take rapid fire pictures as each successive picture taken requires a about 2-3 second delay between each other.  But, the camera is surprisingly good at taking low light pictures.  As a matter of fact, the Nexus 5 camera in low light is better than some of the more premium phones with better cameras.  This is something that I really enjoy about the Nexus 5's camera.  Overall, if I was to rate this phone as a regular priced phone, (650-750$) or 200$ with a 2 year contract, I would probably give it 3 stars due to all the flaws (camera, speaker , battery life) the phone has.  But, for a 450$ phone or 50$ on a 2 year contract, this phone is exceptional.  It is exceptional because it functions very well as a smart phone (the touch screen is very quick and responsive and on 4G the internet is quick) and it has great screen resolution.  Personally I bought this phone outright for 450$ and I am happy with it.  But, I think I wouldn't be as happy if I paid 700$ for it.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever had", "Author": "Jasper62", "ReviewID": "R36H60BDIIYIBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had iPhone and more recently had the Galaxy Note 2 before coming to the Nexus 5. This phone is great. I inserted my AT&T; sim card, turned it on, signed into my google account and it was all ready to go within minutes. I won't do an in depth review of all the specs since you can easily find that on many websites.What I love about the Nexus 5 is it is the best of both worlds. All the google apps work together so well and the phone seems very simple and efficient. I like to think of it as an android iPhone. You also don't have to deal with any extra manufacturer or carrier apps. You will always get the google updates when they come out and not sit around for a year hoping your phone will get an update.Google now is awesome, I was amazed by how much stuff it will display on that page. It actually got the tracking information from my email and told me that my package (the nexus 5) was delivered. The voice recognition is superb, I can be in a noisy room and still give voice commands. I actually do most of my google searching with google now (using the \"ok google\" hot command).The screen is stunning, very crisp. Makes reading easy and watching videos enjoyable. However, the speaker isn't anything spectacular but I rarely use it anyway. It works just fine for notifications, ring tones, etc.The overall build of the phone is great. The phone is thin, light, easy to hold with one hand, and I actually like the design. It goes along with the \"simple\" theme of the phone. If you want a phone with all kinds of bells and whistles, look at a samsung phone. But from my experience I never used 3/4 of the bells and whistles.The camera is an area of controversy from what I've read. Supposedly google will be fixing the issues with a software update. If they actually do I think it'll be great. The camera itself can take great pictures and the video quality is very nice as well. The camera app itself can be slow at times but once fixed it will be on par with any top smartphone cameras.I could go on and on. Yeah there are some things I didn't like at first but mostly they're just things I need to get used to like with any new phone. If you are a google user at all though I recommend this phone. Especially if you integrate yourself into google and really start using the apps, this phone is perfect to be the hub of it all. The iPhone is great but the apple ecosystem is very limited compared to google. In my opinion the N5 is one of the best android phones you can get if you are a google user and probably the best off-contract price you will find for a flagship phone.

Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review!In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone.

Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5  has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

It weighs hardly anything.2. Good screen size. My iPhone looks SO SMALL now. I could never go back to having a screen that size.3. Not only is it a great size, the clarity is fantastic. Great display.4. The android software. MUCH MUCH better than 2-3 years ago when I last had an Android phone. It really has caught up to iOS. No complaints really.5. The speed. Takes no time at all to start up after you turn it on. Processing time seems very quick too. Makes my iPhone look slow in comparison.The ok:The camera. When the lighting isn't good, the picture doesn't generally come out well.The somewhat frustrating:The battery can quickly drain. This is usually due to an app I'm unaware of running. The easy solution is to stop the app obviously but if I'm not using my phone, it is sometimes an unpleasant surprise to see my phone battery has drained significantly in the last couple hours I haven't used it at all. Never had this problem with my iPhone...Also, there are a couple apps that I had on my iPhone that are not available for Androids. Not the phone's fault obviously, but it is a small price to pay for having an Android phone.Overall it is a great deal. I bought it from t-mobile for $376 (including tax and shipping), which is about what you'd pay buying it from Google (which is $350, but you pay for shipping).

So let me elaborate...My previous phone (not counting the Note 3) was a Nexus S, one of Google's earlier and not-very-widely-adopted phones. Although made by Samsung, it was a pure Google Android phone with none of the bloat-ware associated with some manufacturers. And with none of the multiple account sign-ups (Google Account + Samsung Hub + ???). I did like the pure Adnroid experience then, and I like it now on the new Nexus 5.Although I missed out on the Nexus 4, two family members each picked up one of those popular phones when Google slashed the price prior to launching the Nexus 5. While those we're outstandingly good value purchases, I'm glad I waited for the Nexus 5 myself.The Nexus 5 is slim and stylish in a very understated way, like a little black dress (but I'm not a girl). Out goes the bling, and in comes a slightly rubberised back which is way nicer than it sounds... and reassuring to hold. The screen is a pleasure to look at, because you can't see the individual pixels, and it's big enough without being a \"phablet\". It's fast and responsive, 4G-ready, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, and very good value for the price I paid \"in store\" soon after launch (hence not a verified purchase here on Amazon). Documentation is scarce, so you may have to do a lot of experimenting or reading around on the web, but there is always The (Unofficial) Google Nexus 5 SmartPhone Book : The missing manual for LG's Android 4.4 KitKat phone.It really is no exaggeration for me to say that I have been telling all my friends that \"this is the best phone I have ever owned\".

Setting it to \"auto\" pretty much fixed the charging issue. Oddly, the phone didn't charge quickly before changing the brightness setting even when the screen was off... Go figure...I've had my Nexus 5 for about two weeks now. It's been a huge improvement over my Nexus 4. Specifically:1. I like the \"plastic\" back. It feels less delicate. The Nexus 4 has a glass back that breaks easily.2. Not sure if it's KitKat or the new hardware, but the phone is much faster. Apps like Foursquare pop up instantly.3. LTE FTW!!! I use T-Mobile's $30/month prepaid plan. I got a huge upgrade in bandwidth!4. Works much better with the Google Nexus Wireless charger. The charging circuit is higher on the back of the phone so the bottom of the phone just touches the desk when charging. No more sliding Nexus!5. Screen is super bright and sharp as a razor.6. It's lighter!Drawbacks:1. It seems to charge SLOOOOOWLY... especially when waiting to board a long flight.2. It cost $150 more than my Nexus 4 (but still cheap for an unlocked phone of this caliber).", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its big brother of iPhone (5s) literally, best nexus phone and best smart phone period", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1TVZG1IYC6113", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One short and sweet one liner -> Nexus 5 is literally a big brother of iPhone 5s. Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 5 = smooth, fast, solid, Great, pure Android", "Author": "Ivan", "ReviewID": "RZYYD68UCQM1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, no problem,Special Design,  100% recomendNice!!,  you can customize this smartphone xda developers in android development and sustancial performance agree", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT!!!

First, let me be honest and say that not everything on the phone is \"high-end\". The camera isn't the greatest, it's decent, but its just perfect enough for you to take pics that you can upload to your social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It does record in 1080P HD video (rear camera) and 720P HD video (front camera). Other phones like the Galaxy S4, LG G2, Note 3, iPhone 5S take much clearer pics but also cost twice as much. The speaker is not the loudest either, but it does get the job done and hearing audio from video,music, and speaker calls is fine.Display quality is sharp with the 1080P HD IPS Display. Colors could be warmer, but its still a beautiful screen nonetheless. Reading text is easy and flawless.Now, you are not paying for this phone for the camera or speaker quality, but rather the \"total Android experience\". Android Kit Kat 4.4.2 is by far the smoothest most enjoyable Android experience out there. Everything is straight to the point and just gets the job done. The phone is extremely snappy thanks to pure vanilla Android with a 2.2 GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB RAM backed up with Adreno 330 graphics . There is not one hiccup I have experienced with this phone. As you know, you will always receive the latest and greatest from Google since this is a Nexus device. You don't have to wait unlike some manufacturers that have to go through carrier approval before putting the latest version of Android on their phones.Build quality is good and the phone feels solid. Buttons are properly placed and accessible. They have good feedback when pressed.Battery life for me has been great. I average about 13-14 hrs of battery life per day on my Nexus. The most I have ever gotten from the battery was 17 hrs (it was on 4%).  It gets me through the day with no problems. Of course, this is contingent on how much you use the phone. I use my phone moderately. I don't play games on it, so that helps a lot with battery life. If you use your phone heavily then you will see a decrease, and may get around 7-8 hrs per day.For $349 (Google Play Store), you really can't find a better Android phone with the latest processor, great build quality, and the latest updates from Google. I highly recommend the Nexus 5 to anyone.

They are all so smart devices, so quick and, even the Nexus 10, so compact and slim. Put them all side-to-side each other, and they do look good. I have waited years to get devices like these and, even tho I have also got the iPads, I can honestly say these Nexus devices are the best I have ever seen...I'm really impressed with all of them.I had an old Ericsson phone, it must be, almost 10 years now and thought it was time to replace it for a smartphone.But I wasn't too keen on the iPhone as my sons got the iPhone 5, so when I saw Google was bringing the Nexus 4 out, I decided to get that but I never did. I'm glad now that I waited for them to bring the Nexus 5 out, becaz I understand its slimmer and a lot more compact, also the camera is better than the previous model.This is the best phone I have owned, it's even easier to use than my land-line phone....I'm not technical at all.The dial pad is terrific and so simple to use,and the volume is crystal clear. I love the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the phone nearer to the loud speaker and micAlso, becaz iI have never used a smart phone before, I'm amazed just how quick it charges and if you compare it to ordinary mobile phones that aren't Smart, I'm extremely impressed with the battery life.The camera is amazing, I have never seen a camera so precise and the pictures come out so clear and sharp, it's just as tho you are seeing the real object and not seeing it through a lens. Front and back camera I found really good, but for obvious reasons the back camera is a lot more sharper, giving a cleaner photo all round.I haven't text on the phone yet......Google sent me this earlier to show me how to do texting - SMS - 'HANGOUTS'[...]Went on the net earlier and just like the other two devices, it's so quick. Browsing and Emails, I couldn't ask for a faster smart-phone...it's so genius, clever.Also, I have played a couple of my games that I got from GooglePlay, played 'Tilt 3d Labyrinth' where you have got to get the marbles across the board by 'tilting' your device and make sure they dnt drop down the holes.So touch friendly -it honestly felt like I was playing my nexus 7 or 10, obviously apart from the size difference, I'm still amazed that it was a phone that I'm using.When I got the phone from GooglePlay, I should have asked them about the sim becaz unfortunately I didn't realise it was a Micro-Sim, so I had to wait a few days for my Mobile Operator to send one. But at least I was able to still use it as a small tablet whilst waiting for the Sim to arrive.I downloaded the Amazon AppStore onto my Nexus, which I can't understand as it says iv got the max amount of devices - 10.- and I have only got 3 devices, I dnt even think I downloaded the AppStore onto the 7...so it might just be just the two devices, so where's the others come from??I also downloaded the Amazon Music Player and, even tho I haven't downloaded any music onto the device it self yet, playing the music from the cloud was really clear.I will add more into this review, but I have only just started using it...but overall I'm extremely impressed with my new phone - Tablet.Also, one reviewer I have noticed has given this amazing device such an appalling review just becaz there's no 'paper' instructions.We are 'trying' to be Planet Friendly and so the best way is to reduce the amount of paper that's used. All the instructions can be found via the internet, just Google Nexus 5 or phone Google themselves as they have a dedicated help-line. But, like I have said I'm not technical at all, so if I have no problems anyone can work this device out and that's not even getting advice. It's so simple to use.I have just received an Email regarding instructions on how to get started with the Nexus 5, including some really useful tips also[...](I also need to add that I'm reviewing the Nexus device and not the seller, as I always buy directly from the Manufacture whenever possible)", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Came as advertised.", "Author": "Shane Bovell", "ReviewID": "R8NG7A64B16Q2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was abit skeptical at first but when it arrived all my fears were allayed.

After calling the Google support team, they referred me to the manufacturer, LG, who had stated that I need to send the device in to get repaired, at my own expense (shipping is also on me). The total cost to get the device repaired is around $200, including shipping.Why should I dish out $200 for them to send me the same poorly-built product? The screen will continue to break.
