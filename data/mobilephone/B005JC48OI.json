{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone.", "Author": "Biswa", "ReviewID": "R3KHKKEPX3EZS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HTC Titan is Full touch screen phone with 3G experience. It operates with both of the networks 2G and 3G with the bands GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 and HSDPA 850 / 900 / 2100 respectively.Size: This HTC phone is having the dimensions 131.5 x 70.7 x 9.9 mm with 160 grams of weight.

For playing audio and videos there are music players which can playa number of file formats.Camera:It is having an awesome 8 mega pixels camera with 3264\u00d72448 pixels with LED flash, autofocus and Geo-tagging. This cam can capture your sweet moments in the high quality images. This can record videos too at 720p. The most liked thing in 3G phones is secondary camera and I am happy to letting you know that this phone has 1.3 mega pixels secondary camera to enjoy the video calling feature.Memory: It has 16GB internal memory with 512 MB RAM and there is no external memory in this cell phone.

If you read a lot, watch a lot, play games a lot, surf the web a lot, you are definitely going to benefit here.- Few people may find the phone big to carry if your hand is small :)- Memory should have been expandable but still I say 16 GB not less.- As for whether or not this impresses as a Windows Phone 7 device, it is one of the top WP7 smartphones on the market and goes as far making Android and iOS dull by comparison. We love the social aspects, we love the interactive feel of the device, and how everything is brought to life by the OS, oh and that screen.

Recommended buy!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"BS101\"", "ReviewID": "R1XL1YNNOUG2NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great buy if you are in the market for a new smartphone and don't have any preconceived notions about the superiority of one platform over another (Android, iOS, Windows Phone 7). The features of the Windows Phone 7 operating system (this phone has the Mango build aka WP 7.5) has been documented on many websites, blogs and videos. I am not going to repeat all of them here.The Phone Hardware -1. HTC has created a phone that is (very) large but holds well in your hand. The phone is not too heavy and does not feel uncomfortable even for the times I am in the \"single hand operation\" mode.2. The display is clean and the default theme looks sharp.3. The phone that was shipped to me was targeted at the UK market and the system settings defaulted to UK. It was very easy to change the region, keyboard and search settings from UK to US.4. The battery holds charge very well and lasts an entire workday (12 - 13.5 hours) with my heavy data and phone use.5. The camera takes good pictures but can underperform in low light inspite of the dual flash. The camera comes with a panorama mode that allows you to stitch 3 photos to form a wide angled view. I am not sure if this is a default OS feature or that of HTC but it should allow for at least 8, like some other phones.The Phone Software --1. The best feature of the Windows Phone OS is the Live Tile. The tiles allow for a \"glance and go\" operation and serve as a great notification tool.2. The integration of Facebook, Linkedin, Messenger, Google allows for unified contact management. This may not seem useful in the beginning and I too was a sceptic but it has grown on me to the point that I cannot do without it. I can swtich between SMS, Facebook and Messenger chat on the same thread!!!3. The Windows MarketPlace app store has all major apps that most people would need. There may be some apps that are missing but I doubt it will be a dealbreaker for 99% of the folks. In fact, in the past 2 months I have seen a sizeable increase in the number of mainstream apps.4. Integration of Bing Search (available as a standard key) is very useful. Bing has voice and visual search integrated. It takes away the need to have Shazaam (for identifying audio tracks) or a separate Bar Code reader.5. Bing Maps is good within the USA but I use gPro Maps (a version of Google Maps) as it has additional detail when I am traveling outside the country.5. The keyboard is nice. Types really well and your speed will improve as you start using the word suggest feature.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is a SHAME! I feel CHEATED!.

When my iPhone's lock and home button broke for the second time, and the speaker stopped working, I decided to stop wasting money on it and began searching for a new phone. Android devices seemed a little unusable for me, so I looked through Windows Phones, which is something I normally wouldn't do, as I don't like the Windows desktop OS very much.Knowing I liked HTC a lot, I decided on the HTC Titan (Ultimate) after only a short while. Upon receiving the phone, I was hesitant, because I had never used a Windows Phone before. But after a few minutes, I was in bliss. Not only is it 10x faster than my iPhone 4 (which came out in the same year), but the simplicity of design of the Windows 7.5 Mango interface is amazing.HTC also has a reputation for well built and strong phones, and this one is no exception. With an aluminum enclosure and a huge screen, this beast of a phone dwarfed the small iPhone, which is especially helpful when reading a constant flow of emails and text messages. If you're in the market for a very reasonably priced Windows Phone, look no further. The HTC Titan is the top of the line!", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for email only - if you have reception", "Author": "George E. Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "RN63VTDKGL0K0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my Titan for a week now - and I'm pretty happy with it.  Pros:  large beautiful screen which is especially good for my poor eyesight, nice interface and very smooth operation - with no lockups, and I don't think MS snoops in all of my email the way G**gle does!!  The build quality is very nice - this isn't a cheap plasticky phone.Cons:  I have tested my Titan against five other phones - in the same location and same carrier - and the Titan has the poorest / worst cellular reception.  It simply cannot hold onto a connection where the other phones could.  Also, so far it is not eligible for the upgrade to WP 7.8 - although that \"upgrade\" brings little to the table.  Not the Titan's fault but the Windows Marketplace is still seriously lacking.  And, even though the screen is pretty nice - it is a low resolution screen thanks to Windows Phone's hastily rushed to the market OS (only one screen resolution available on WP7).Other:  The Titan was sold as unlocked but it arrived locked to AT&T.;  To their credit, the seller was very responsive in getting an unlock code.  The box was obviously used and shopworn - and the Titan itself has a small blemish on the metal near the screen.  I suspect it is a refurb but I can't prove it.  That being said, it is a very nice phone and I am keeping it.******************** Edited on 24 MAR to add comments *************************This phone continues to not impress me.  To it's credit, the screen is large, bright and easy to read.  And, it runs smoothly and quickly.  When it is able to receive a celluar signal, it quickly connects, updates and downloads e-mail.  But, the key term here is reception.  I just tested it again at my place in Germany.  I have seven active SIM cards (Germany is pre-paid Heaven!) so I took the Titan and my iPhone4 to the basement laundry room where I live.  Both phones had a chip from the same carrier - LeBara - which uses the Telekom network here.  The iPhone4 - not 4s - had three bars of signal and cellular data worked.  My Titan had no signal - no nothing.  I wish I had known about this before I bought it.  And, I want to again warn anyone who might read this - closely check the seller's rating before you buy a phone here that is NOT shipped and sold directly by Amazon.  I'm pretty sure my phone was a return or refurb or at least a blemished model - and it was sold as new.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone.

But I did want a phone that looks nice and has tools that are of good quality.  To that end, I was looking for an unlocked phone to use with my prepaid T-Mobile sim that has a nice features.  What I liked most about this phone is the gps that works offline.  The HTC Titan is supposed have a very good GPS compared to other phones.  Thus far, my HTC seemed to have no problem picking up a satellite in a short amount of time.  There are free gps apps.  But I decided to get Navigon for about $30 because text to speech and spoken street names not available with other gps apps.  In addition, Navigon does not need a data connection to work.  Unfortunately, the Navigon maps are a bit out of date.  So I had to pay an additional $30 for updated maps.  The Location setting needs to be turned on before getting the gps to work as well.Wifi also works.  But you need to turn off the Cellular data connection.  Otherwise, the cell phone will think you are trying to use the data connection associated with your service provider and give you problems.If you don't have a data connection.  You need to put the phone on Airplane mode and set Location On before starting your GPS application assuming you have an application that does not require a data connection.Your choices of apps to download to the Titan can be found either in the Marketplace tile or you can shop on the larger screen of your PC on windowsphone.com and then look for the app on the Titan.Initially, I was concerned about the size of the Titan.  But now I actually like this size.  The larger than an iphone looks is a perfect size for me.  In fact, after owning this for a couple of weeks, I now perceive the iphone as a bit too small for my tastes.  I also like the feel of this phone.  It's thin body has a very solid look and feel to it.Quality of the camera is nice.  Digital zoom works great.  I love the panoramic feature of this camera where the camera takes multiple pictures and stitches them together into one picture to get a panoramic view.Bear in mind this phone has Windows 7.5 installed.  Titan II has Windows 8 installed.  This may limit the applications you can install on the phone.

I lost that phone and I needed a replacement and since I didn't want to fork over another $160, I got a cheap Android Froyo device.  WOW, I was so miserable using that thing that I regretted not getting a quality device!  Enter the Titan.Obviously the screen size is the big feature (pun intended). You can feel how it affects the user experience in a very good way when using the keyboard, the dial pad, and apps because it feels more natural and easier to navigate and touch. Viewing and taking pictures on it is just stellar. The HTC also has very good looks and if you have an eye for design it does not disappoint.  It sports a rugged yet minimalist style. I couldn't help but compare it to a miniature iPad 1 because of the defined edges and curves on the back.  Even with my medium to small sized hands, the HTC still feels great to hold because its so well built. Overall I'm impressed and I don't think pictures do it justice.The Titan comes with other features that I didn't expect simply because I thought all WP7 phones were exactly the same with the exception of the casing and maybe a few spec bumps but I was wrong.  The device comes with built in SRS sound enhancing (a hugely pleasant surprise for me personally), a feature called \"attentive phone\" which changes the behavior of the phone when its in your pocket or when you get a call, and tons more tones to choose from compared to my old Samsung.  One thing that I should highlight is the battery life.  The battery life on my old Focus was awful and was probably the only drawback it had but the Titan, despite its larger screen and more horsepower, manages to hang in there steady for longer times.
