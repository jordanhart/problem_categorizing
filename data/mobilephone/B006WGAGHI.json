I purchased this item as a gsm only phone and here i am opening this product with a huge verizon logo on the phone. Powered it up and \"bam\" thats what greets me. A verizon logo.That advertisement on amazon was so miss leading. I purchased this product hopping that it was a gsm phone with no logo.Herein this phone was purchased from verizon and unlocked and sold as factory unlock. misleading. I checked the unlock status MEPD. I will never purchase from king again. i don't recommend anyone purchase a bold from this supplier.I give them zero stars because of their misleading advertisement and then sending a total different product. I will keep the phone because where I am presently it will be a hassle to send it back. Step up to the plate King. Should have bought from another supplier.Blackberry Bold 9930 GSM Only Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band, Touchscreen, OS 7, QWERTY Keyboard and 5MP Camera - BlackWell finally I have opened the phone and put in a sim card. The advertisement said the phone could not work with verizon or sprint and there is a verizon logo upon start up. Please. On top of that all I get at the top of the phone is activation required. Please do not buy from this supplier cause you going get scammed. The phone is a Gsm CDMA a type. There is a verizon logo on the phone, as it needs to debrand. If you are looking for a 9930 for a good price please look elsewhere.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "incorrect advertising", "Author": "javito27", "ReviewID": "R2D16PHYZACONO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When announcing that is only GSM, no, actually it is selling GSM and CDMA, so functional for use in other countries.Only phones AT & T and T-Mobile are GSM only.With this announcement induce buyers mistake.

After six months experience, here are my thoughts.I have relied heavily on my PC and a dumb cell phone for more than 20 years, but I finally decided to get a smartphone.As a user I like the Samsung least in terms of its user interface and focus on advertising stuff.  The Nokia 920 has a brilliant screen and the best graphics for games and movies.  But as a communicator, the BB 9930 is the best!To quote a line from the movie Star Wars regarding the Millennium Falcon, \"it's got it where it counts\".  If your focus for a phone is (1) phone calls, (2), SMS, and (3) email, then Blackberry is the best.  Virtually no advertising fluff is imposed on the user.  I have not personally owned the BB Q10 or Z10, but based on my study of published user reviews, it's clear that the BB 9900/9930 is preferred by many BB users.As I said, I wanted a phone, first and foremost.  However, you might be interested to know that it is also a brilliant MP3 player.Sorry this posting is so long, but I hope some readers find it helpful.P. S.  My service provider is Telna, which I have used for years.  Their pay-as-you-go, no-subscription-contract (for voice, SMS, and data) is brilliantly cost-effective!  Their GSM sim card interfaces perfectly in the Blackberry 9900/9930.P. P. S.  I read the reviews of some users who have encountered SETUP PROBLEMS.  As I said above, I have an unlocked Blackberry 9930, an unlocked Nokia 920 and an unlocked Samsung Galaxy 4, all purchased from Amazon.  Please be aware that all unlocked phones have setup challenges that will be  \"learning curve\" for the new buyer.  Here is some help for the BB 9930/9900.I believe most of my comments below would apply to 9900, but please be aware that the 9900 does not support CDMA; the 9930 is both GSM and CDMA capable.If you are getting the \"ACTIVATION REQUIRED\" message at the top of a Verizon BB 9930 that is supposed to unlocked, the message is misleading.  I eliminated this message as follows.There is a CDMA screen for the 9930.  You can access it by dialing ##000000 from your Blackberry 9930, which will take you to the \"CDMA Service Edit Screen\", where you can edit some settings.Edit the \"Mobile Directory Number\" there (it may be blank or the some vestigial Verizon phone number) and enter your phone number that you are using with your SIM card.  This eliminates the \"Activation Required\" heading at the top.  Be careful not to change anything else on this screen.INTERNET BROWSING is accomplished as follows.  First, you must specify your APN for your service provider.  My service provider is Telna, and their service is very cost competitive and works very well with the BB 9930.  Goto to 'Options' on the Home screen.  Goto to 'Device'.  Goto to 'Advanced System Settings'.  Goto to 'TCP IP'.  Enable \"APN Settings\".  Specify \"APN: \" with the URL from your service provider.  In my case I did not check \"APN Authentication Enabled:\".  You probably should leave blank \"Username for APN:\" and \"password for APN:\"Browsing the internet works quite well as follows:  (1) Use the native BB browser for web access via wifi; the BB browser will refuse to connect over GSM.  (2) Use Opera Mini for web access over GSM; Opera Mini will refuse to connect over wifi.  Install app \"Opera Mini\" as a browser using \"Blackberry World\".  Note, you must be connected by wifi to use \"Blackberry World\".  Search for and install \"Opera Mini\".  (3)  To minimize data charges, I keep \"Data Services\" turned off.  I turn it on only when I want Opera Mini to use GSM, and incur data charges.  From the Home screen, goto \"Manage Connections\", \"Network and Connections\", \"Mobile Network\", and adjust the setting for \"Data Services\".BLACKBERRY 9930 MANUALThe online manual is excellent.

When purchasing this phone be aware that although it says it will function on the AT&T; and T-Mobile networks because it supports GSM .. in reality it is a Verizon phone that has been unlocked. Voice calls work, text messages worked (after some configuration changes) and internet access works although you will not get 3g or 4g service from T-Mobile. Visual Voicemail will not function as the phone is hard coded to work with Verizon's implementation of that service. In addition it is hard coded for Verizon voicemail .. had to reconfigure the voicemail number and the APN to get this phone working with T-Mobile. Also had to apply 2 BB OS 7 patches to get it to work properly with any of our Blutetooth ear pieces. Make sure you either know how to make the needed changes yourself or know some one who can do it for you. The only way to make this a totally functional AT&T; or T-Mobile phone would be to root it and install a BB OS image configured for those carriers.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "the phone not describe properly", "Author": "Joanne Jeffrey", "ReviewID": "R26E1JUZP88P6C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I like that the phone came on time, but the phone cannot work with any other company but Verizon and when I purcd it it said unlocked but when I got it was saying VERIZON on the phone which I took to someone to check for me and it was useless.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone is fantastic", "Author": "marie lebrun \"mlebrun\"", "ReviewID": "RSUQQBSVSG0V8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone was purchased as a gift to my husband, and I can tell you, he's in love with it.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "THE BLACKBERRY 9930 IS BRILLIANT.

It is and does exactly what I expected it to be and do - no more, no less. A true professional phone, no gimmicks or gadgets, no sliding to answer the phone or other silliness. Activation was super-easy on-line at Sprint, and as far as I can tell, Sprint did not charge me an activation fee (yet?). Setup was a breeze using Blackberry's desktop software, which allows transfer of all contacts and data from old phone to new phone. Had a Blackberry 8330 before. Was 4.5 years old and for the last 6 months or so got stuck more and more in hourglass mode. The 9330 is much faster, better keyboard and has WiFi. Hourglassing happens very rarely and when it does is very short. I guess that is just a fact of life with a Blackberry. Touch screen is there when you want it, but otherwise is mostly unobtrusive, allowing use of the optical touch pad and keyboard, as one should with a Blackberry. Only additional item I bought was leather pouch. The holster it came with is great, too, but I am a pouch person. Oh and yes, e-mail and everything works just fine, no connectivity issues at all.
