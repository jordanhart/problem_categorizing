Really the task killer is for obligatory downloading.-the camera is bad, but if you want a camera, buy a camera.so, in final words, i love this phone :) very recommended", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Pia C.

I have had many, many, many phones in the last few years......very much a tech and cell phone junkie. I love android and wanted something that is not the norm amid the sea of iphones and large 4.3in screens. This fits the bill. And the best part is since its the North American version, its gets 3G / HSDPA with AT&T.;", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "All is well until a glitch overseas!", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R2BDJZEMJF4YVE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had to buy this in a hurry as I had taken an instant decision to buy it before I left US for good.Major PRO's: The package was delivered real fast considering I ordered via standard shipping (Thanks to Amazon for that!). It was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it! Touch-screen is highly receptive and the orientation change from Potrait to Landscape occurs in a jiffy. Battery life is top-notch and the unit looks really cool. It fits well in a palm and the texture doesnt make way for a slip. These are all the major CON's that my wife figured.Major CON's: It was supposed to be an International version but I found a few glitches using it overseas. Once the unit loses its coverage area (say network) inside a lift or so..communication network doesnt come back on its own so it has to be re-started to make it operational. Hence I termed this as a 'glitch' and not a 'problem', though it causes utter dis-satisfaction. Another concern was the Wi-Fi, not strong enough in detecting available networks...again using overseas. I didnt experience any such faults/issue when it was used for a short period of time in the US.Overall...Pretty Good!! I would rather give a 3.5* but Amazon doesnt allow me ;-) so I'll give a 4*!", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "My last sony ericsson phone", "Author": "Bugzee", "ReviewID": "R1TS17YLHFKVMW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone early in the year and only a few months later have difficulty using it.
