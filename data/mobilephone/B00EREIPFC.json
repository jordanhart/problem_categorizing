I tested it extensively before I left to ensure that everything worked well here in the States.  Everything seemed to, so I used this number for my emergency contact number while traveling.  I first tried it in Frankfurt, Germany, and it sent/received texts and phone calls OK.  But, that's were the fun ended!  When I arrived in Poland, nothing worked correctly...no incoming phone calls, texts or outgoing texts.  Outgoing phone seemed to work OK and it seemed that voice mail worked.  I corresponded with customer service and they first \"recycled\" the sim card, but then incoming voice mail no longer worked.  I corresponded with customer service again, and they responded that they fixed the problem, but it was never fixed. I tried several different cell networks in Poland, but nothing helped. Maybe just my phone...maybe something special for Poland, but I was left without communications during my 2-week stay.  I feel like I got scammed out of the money I paid.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EREIPFC"}}
