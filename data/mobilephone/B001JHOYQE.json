{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great WM Touch Screen Phone", "Author": "J. Faville \"defacto\"", "ReviewID": "R173YIHW96IONL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not sure what the other reviewers are comparing this phone to, but I can say this is the best smartphone I have ever owned.  I've been using the phone for four months.  Here is what you should know about the phone:1) Phone sports a beautiful 800 x 480 touch screen.  The touch screen is very responsive compared to other touchscreen phones I've used, with the exception of the iPhone -- which is the gold standard in touch responsiveness -- but doesn't have nearly as many features.2) The Xperia is infinitely customizable.  The panels allow you to quickly switch between home screens for Search, Facebook, Skype, Weather, Photo Slideshow and many more.3) I also love Windows Mobile.  The phone can do almost anything.  All of the features of the most advanced smartphone are available; MMS, Video recording, File Explorer, Micro SD Card, Cut & Paste, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth and the best Exchange E-Mail integration available.4) Although the OS is a bit dated, there are thousands of third party applications developed for it that anything it cannot do out of the box can easily be added to the device via third party software.  A couple of applications I could not do without are SPB Mobile Shell, eWallet, Google Maps, Astraware Solitaire, Opera Browser, Live Search, WMWifiRouter not to mention the native Microsoft Office applications -- Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint.  All of these applications run perfectly on the Xperia X1.5) The only things I'd like to see changed on the device are a bigger screen and improved keyboard.  The screen size is 3.0 inches and I'd prefer 3.2 or 3.5 inches.  The keyboard is made of flat steel keys in a small form factor that my fingers slide to easily over.There's much more to the phone than I can give credit to in this forum, but I have been using Windows Mobile phones for about 9 years and find the SE Xperia X1a the best yet.  The phone also comes with extended service and support that blows away anything offered from competing manufacturers.

Truman", "ReviewID": "R2EBDH45UY0DJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this pocket PC to replace my iPAQ 6945 because I wanted a higher resolution screen, the sliding keyboard & more convenient size and design.  The Xperia is a well built, high quality machine with a metal case.  The computer and internet capabilities are my primary concern but the telephone & messaging systems are very good.  The blue tooth tied in flawlessly with the on-board telephone controls in my BMW and uploaded my address book to the car.  It has superior signal reception and connected into my AT&T; hi-speed wireless network without a problem.  Same with the WiFi networks in my office and home.  Activesync works well and it is easy to set up your POP3 email accounts.  This is a very versatile machine with an extensive list of features.  The manual controls allow you to navigate without the stylus and include a touchpad you can use without opening the keyboard.You will not be disappointed.  Be sure and order a case, it doesn't come with one.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE!!!!!", "Author": "V. M. Davis \"lawchick01\"", "ReviewID": "R3DOVKTKW76BYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE! The phone is sleek and it stands out in a crowd. It is a conversation piece. At least until the X2 debuts:) I like being different and this phone fits w/my personality.BATTERY: I heard there were problems so let me tell you how I dealt w/it. I got the phone and charged it per the instructions. I then let the battery die completely...which it did within 1 day. I charged it and let the battery completely die again. After 2 full charges and draining the battery twice, the life of my battery improved exponentially. My phone can now go 3-4 days using internet, panels, and regular usage.PROS- I love the panels but found the spb mobile shell (which is free) is really the only panel I need. The facebook panel gets some usage as well. I'm going to try the spb mobile 3 and the phone suite and see what it has to offer. I really love all the customizable things you can do with this phone. The spb panels add alot to the X1. I love the Oxford Italian language download which allows me to learn Italian on my own. The battery life is not an issue since I did the steps mentioned above. Connectivity is not a problem and the programs run flawlessly. I love google maps and used it to find my way home after getting lost. It was a life saver since I was in another state. I have had no problems w/the camera or taking pictures. I found that by using mobile windows device on my laptop, I can go into my phone & storage card and put pics, music and anything else where I want it to be including making new folders if needed. Making videos has been fun and the quality is great! The picture quality is amazing w/ or w/o the flash.If you are going to get the phone get the spb mobile shell...it brings the phones best qualities to light and puts them at the touch of your finger w/o tons of searching. I LOVE THIS phone. I haven't registered this phone on the AT&T; network but haven't had any dropped calls. That says alot since some of my classes are underground where lots of people get dropped calls. The only deadspots I experienced were in the backwoods of Tx somewhere between Houston & Hooks. But I've been told the moment I register my phone, it'll be on the 3G network and will work in more places. The phone shows I am on an \"H\" network. The sound quality is good.CONS- For most people the price is a con but since I keep a good phone for 6-9 years, it is not overpriced. It does not have yahoo IM. I hate that there is no \"vibrate during appointments\" profile like the HTC Touch Pro because I have to remember to turn off my phone when I go to class.  You cannot turn off the SMS notification for sending messages which can be annoying. You can only see the weather for 1 city and the forecast only goes to 4 days. It only has 3 alarm clocks to be set. The font is small but it can be changed using the spb free mobile sheeHowever, I think most of these things can be fixed w/spb downloads (weather, travel, time, diary, etc which are mostly available for a 15 trial period). The keyboard is a little weird at first. It actually hurt my fingers during the first week on use. The keys are almost flushed w/the keyboard and the keys are kinda small for my big fingers but after a week these become minor, if noticeable, points.I'm not sure if I covered everything about the X1. If I can think of anything else, I will definitely write back. I'll write another review after the trial period has ended for spb mobile 3 & sbp phone suite.This phone is worth the money and is AWESOME!!!!! The cons aren't and shouldn't keep anyone from purchasing but beware...the X2 is on its way:)", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "The king of the hill", "Author": "John Hajjar \"John H.\"", "ReviewID": "R24VNKQ55QNN8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Phone is called in many forums of WinMo products and hacking as the king of the hill. Maybe because is simply the most integral of them all.It has EVERYTHING, i mean, theres nothing missing from it.

The screen and its resolution is awesome (it stablished it as an Standard for newer WM Phones) Its keyboard, nice!

However, compared to other phones now a days it tends to lag a bit.

Don't believe the hype even Sony would not help me, all they kept saying is contact your service provider, and my \"service provider\" said call Sony. Across the globe there is a lot of support i.e \"hacking, modding\" but in America there is none, Sony turned there back on this phone to support the new Xperia x2. even most of the panels you can download are for Europe, or they say coming soon. (that was over 4 months ago). The support for this phone state side is hard to find.

I absolutely love the P990i.  Unfortunetly it is no longer available.  (If someone knows where I can get a new one, please let me know).I purchased two of these Xperia phones for my wife and I and I am sadly disappointed.  When they do work, the functions are slow.  The instructions and \"intuitive\" feel that the 990i and even the P1i had are gone.  Nothing makes sense on this phone.  Sync software works sometimes, most of the time it does not. I have downloaded, re-downloaded and removed, yadda, yadda, yadda.  I even reset my phones.  Nothing.  I had to add my contacts, all ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO OF THEM manuallyThe marriage of anything microsoft (microsoft has their own issues) to the sadly inadequate chipset\\firmware in this phone is a marriage destined to make you pull your hair out.  To add insult to injury, I was browsing the web for help and came across a video at a tech fair prior to the launch of the Xperia.  The demonstrator was having similar issues - slow response, not really sure where things were in the menu, etc (I wish I had seen that video before I sunk $1300 plus into these two phones).I have gone back to Nokia after more then ten years of owning Ericsson phones.  I for one will never buy another ericsson phone again.  We had a bottle of wine and took pleasure in buring them both (you are just adding insult to injury trying to find a fix for these things.  Tech support is never really there).This is my experience after owning seven ericsson phones.
