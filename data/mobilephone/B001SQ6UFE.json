It took time to get used to it, but I liked the display, the operating system and nice exterior quality.  However, in less than six months the Bluetooth function failed.  Bluetooth will not enable. I spent many hours researching this and it seems to be a problem generic to this model.  Fortunately, I bought extended warranty coverage from the vendor. They know about the problem with 8220 and they do not recommend replacement or repair, but will refund my purchase.For me, malfunctioning Bluetooth renders the telephone useless.  I use the phone exclusively in my automobile and hands-free communication in automobiles is the law in most jurisdictions.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Forget the Androids!", "Author": "ralfeeee", "ReviewID": "RRB2P94MK2IY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had one of these phones For about 5 years. The only problem I had was the Bluetooth stopped working on my last phone and the price is more than reasonable. I would replace it again if I had to because this phone has value to me which is reception. I have tried several of the new Android phones and they are worthless because they can not perform the most important function. GREAT RECEPTION! For me the most important part of a cell phone is being able to talk and hear clearly. My Blackberry Pearl Flip 8220 might be considered old fashioned and outdated by some but I will keep replacing this phone if I have to for as long as I can find them available.This phone has better reception than my land line.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mad as hell", "Author": "Franklin Aghahowa", "ReviewID": "R2X1CCXR47CRMF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On 1/16/2012 l purchased unlocked rim blackberry pearl flip 8220 smart cell phone-Red as advertised with order#104-6479347-2854615. When the phone was viewed before purchase, it has a mixed color of black top and red bottom, just like the one l had that need replacement. Instead of receiving the \"red\" cell phone with mixed colors as described above from the seller- Wireovia (Amazon Dept). I was sent the cell phone in black. I contacted Wireovia about the wrong item and was asked to mail it back with the address given to me. So, l mailed it back to Wireovia on 1/24/12. Unfortunately for me, the item came up missing with the USPS and Wireovia never got the item l sent to them. I made a missing item complaint with the USPS. After 16 days of investigation by the USPS, the item was located and returned to me on 2/9/12. The black cell phone was once again mailed back to Wireovia on 2/10/12 and this time Wireovia received the item. After all these time of waiting patiently to receive the actual product l purchased from the seller, l received the wrong item once again on 2/18/12. This time around, l was sent the cell phone in solid red which is completely different from what l viewed, ordered, and purchased. I am very very angry about this.UNLOCKED RIM BlackBerry Pearl Flip 8220 Smart Cell Phone - Red", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unlocked Blackberry Pearl flip phone 8220", "Author": "Donna L.
