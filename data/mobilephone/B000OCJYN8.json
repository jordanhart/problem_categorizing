{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good phone indeed!", "Author": "Alpha \"Alpha\"", "ReviewID": "RKVZ4GD1X856Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alot of people have written reviews about this phone before me, and I must say none of the people on Amazon who wrote a review got anywhere near the truth.This phone is indeed slow. The Symbian software has it's flaws, but this is nothing to take seriously. This phone does everything it says it does, and better than it assumes.The bluetooth connectivity is one of the fastest I have seen so far, and I have owned 7+ phones. Infared has become obsolete, but is a nice gimmick for those with an infared port on their PC or laptop, although the data cable is faster, it might also be one of those thing you forget on your travels abroad. And at those moments I am sure you will very much apreciate that little black square at the bottom of this device.So much for connectivity, for those are the only options.Th keyboard is so pleasant text messages and emails will flow from the device within a minute or so, as I have experianced.It also does everything a computer can: numbers, symbols and letters are all included of course, but even things such as ctrl+c to copy highlighted text, and ctrl+v to paste. Highlighting is done by pressing the ctrl and the upwards arrow (located right next to it) at the same time. Very pleasant indeed.The joystick work excellent and makes navigating much easier and controlled.The screen is vibrant and very clear even in broad daylight. Bad thing about the screen is that wallpapers do not cover the entire homescreen, as I would have liked to see. A complete log makes up for that however, and a large clock makes for easy time reading.The possibilities are endless, it can and will open all Microsoft Office document, and has simplified applications wich can be compared to all major Office tools.Mobile internet looks and works the best I've ever seen. No longer will you jump from line to line, but a full cursor is available and works just as well as the one on your laptop/PC. On top of that websites load fairly quick, even though I am a GoPhone user.Pictures look gorgeos, videos look well but are a bit jittery, music plays well and loud through the integrated speaker and the voice recorder works well also.IM works just as good as on any other mobile device, although the keyboard makes typing much easier.Google maps are a nice addition. But maybe not suitable for GoPhone users as it sucks up your money like a crackhead.The signal is pretty good, not worse or better than other phones and the battery life is truly amazing. Using no push-email this baby is very carefull with it's juice, and does not spill any whatsoever.Various ringtones, wallpapers, videos and games may be downloaded from sites such as Zedge, and the phone will store quite a few before a mini SD card is needed.I am very happy with this Goliath (sizewise), even if it doesn't have wifi or even a camera for that matter. Most of it's functions and it's striking versatility make more than up for it. Especially for 50 bucks on eBay. A very handy thing to have if you run a store or are a bussines person who needs something that can (but not necessarily has to) replace a laptop for conveniance.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "BAD service and BAD results", "Author": "M.

Here you have a resume of what happened:I bought the cell phone on Nov 6th 2009 on the following link:http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Bluetooth-Slot-U-S-Warranty/dp/B000OCJYN8/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s;=wireless&qid;=1257517626&sr;=1-12it is important to let you that I'm from Costa Rica but what I did was to send the cell phone to a friend address in NY and then she brought it to me here in Costa Rica.First of all when I try to charge it nothing happen. Then I contact a friend that has a cellular support business here in Costa Rica and he told me that the battery is damaged. Then we try to buy that battery model here in Costa Rica but it was impossible.Being advice of this situation we send a email to the seller on Feb 8th 2010 but at this moment I haven't receive any response yet and because of that today Feb 25thI bought another battery in order to make works the cell phone that I bought since November 2009 hoping in God that with the new battery the cell works successfully.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "A smart phone done right.", "Author": "Vedran Simic", "ReviewID": "R3GRM8Q4BV67RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to own this phone about 3 years ago. After it finally decided to go bad on me from it being dropped so many times, i went to another provider. After my contract ran up, i went back to my original provider and I bought a iPhone 3gs which was a big mistake. I mean i don't want to bash the iPhone, but it does everything but be a phone (correctly i mean). So when i saw this phone, i immediately bought it because i remembered the quality that Nokia puts in their phones.As a smartphone goes, it is a bit slower then an average phone, but i personally didn't mind the speed difference. I love the menu and the ease of use. Since i had good past experience with Nokia, it was pretty much a no brainer. Plus its unlocked too :D.I do recommend this phone to anybody that wants a quality smart phone.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like what i like", "Author": "wolverine", "ReviewID": "R60JA7V61CAXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone before-some years ago...I enjoy it am satisfied with it [that's why I purchases again].The one thing I'm not founf of is the inablity to delete several old texes, numbers at oncel", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia E62 Unlocked Phone", "Author": "J.

The phone being unlocked may possibly get around the java restriction imposed on the locked Cingular version, but the processor is very slow (slow menu transition and limited 3rd party app use), the Wi-Fi has been removed from this version, and it's not a 3G phone.

Also it was nice that one could select arbitrary mp3s as ringtones.The keyboard it has is fairly useless but a bluetooth keyboard eventually fixed that.  However, getting notes and docs out of this thing is difficult.  Drag and drop is not implemented (God knows why).  Exporting text thru Outlook is the ONLY option as far as I can tell. major PITA.The sound quality is nearly incomprehensible, the only way it works well is on speaker phone.The operating system runs at a snail's pace, startup and tasks are very slow.To listen to MP3s on it, one needs to purchase special headphones.It has a tendency to freeze.  Once it does, the only thing to do is to pull out the battery, replace it, and restart the phone.This is the worst phone I have ever owned.  I will never purchase a Nokia again.
