{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A few specifics -update", "Author": "Solom01 \"software user\"", "ReviewID": "RK27CPG21VSBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to try to rehash what other great reviews on this product have said so well, I just wanted to add a few specifics:(1) For people who plan on using T-Mobile:(a) At least in my case, this phone works with the grandfathered tzones plan (for those who don't know what it is you get unlimited internet access for $4.99-$5.99 a month).(b) It works with T-Mobile's strange 3.5G bands, which is used only by T-Mobile and, I believe, a few Canadian carriers. While I was visiting the Atlanta area I was getting download speeds of over 12.(2) For people who have not purchased an unlocked phone before:(a) This phone is not sold in the US so it will be a phone intended for another country (in my case, Colombia). This means that you do not get a warranty in the US so it is essential that you try it out when you get it to make sure that it is working well. I purchased mine from HassleFreeCells and based on some conversations with the seller I have no doubt that if there is a problem when you get it they'll take care of you - even if they charge a few extra bucks it's worth the peace of mind.(b) The fact that it is a foreign phone doesn't make too much of a difference EXCEPT for the fact that Nokia sets up updates based on your phones country code. For example, Microsoft is making some of their programs available on Belle.  It is already available for the UK and some other countries, but not Latin America so I can't get those programs yet.(c) Even though this is a phone intended for Colombia you can select multiple European languages including US English, so that isn't an issue.(3) For people who own other Nokia phones:(a) Besides this phone I also have a C6-01 which has a clear black screen whereas this phone uses an ips screen. The screen on the C6-01 is brighter and has better colors, contrast and blacks, but the screen on the 701 is much more viewable outside.(b) This phone comes with Belle from the start (although as soon as you start it it requires an update). Compared to running Belle on the C6-01 (which was updated to Anna from Symbian3 and finally to Belle) this phone is faster and more \"fluid\". I'm assuming that is because this phone has a faster processor and double the ram, so if that's the case the same should be true for other older pre Belle Nokia phones such as the E7 and N8. Belle is a mixed bag. It has more eye-candy and is more up to date in the sense that it resembles Android and iOS5, but it gives up tons of features such as folders, etc. that made Symbian seem much more like a real operating system. Also be aware that as always in Nokia land the switch to Belle has created tons of problems. Lots of older apps such as QuickOffice (one of the few Office compatible programs) no longer work with Belle and some newer apps such as Moodagent are having issues.  Since Symbian is a dead operating system walking the incentive for programmers to update their programs to solve this issue is lessened.In sum, I gave this phone a five because the price is great, I will be able to use it in 98% of the world with local sim cards and have local maps and 3g coverage, it is easy to use and has all the functionality I need.  If those are your needs this is a near perfect phone.  However, if you have never used an unlocked phone or a Nokia think carefully before buying it.  In terms of support you are basically on your own, you have no factory warranty, and the app selection for common apps on other smart phones such as Netflix, Pandora, etc. is non-existant. Although Nokia has stated that they will support Symbian until at least 2016 you can't expect much interest in an operating system that has been thrown to the curb - and given that Nokia's market share is in free-fall at the moment there is even a real possibility that they won't be in any position to offer even limited support in the near future.Here's an update on my 701.  My daughter needed to borrow the phone so as recommended in the manual I attempted to do a factory restore from the menu setting - huge mistake. The phone got stuck in a loop and 2.5 hours later it was still in a loop, even after removing the battery and reinstalling, trying to connect to the pc, etc. My only option was to do a hard reset which besides loosing a bunch of the factory installed software (no big deal) did not allow active exchange or the Nokia store to work anymore. I tried reinstalling my backup (as suggested by Nokia support) - did not work. A quick look at the internet forums showed that the 701 needs to be reflashed if you do a hard reset and since this is not a US phone you're basically on your own.  Nokia did offer to \"downgrade\" it to a 700 or C6-01 which is actually quite nice since this is a non-US phone, but I sent it to a third party Palco Cell Phone Repair where they say they can reflash it for $42 (we'll see). What it all boils down to is that I went ahead and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Nexus for just a bit more which is unlocked, pentaband GSM, 4.65\" screen and so forth for just a few bucks more with a US warranty.  It really is absurd to sell a phone that can not be restored to factory in an age when tons of your private info (including cc numbers, etc.) is stored on the phone. Although I still like the phone, and will keep it as a backup if it gets fixed, it's time to leave Nokia behind. Unless you're willing to settle for a WIndows phone Nokia has nothing left worth buying in the US anymore.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Spectacular phone, as always from Nokia", "Author": "J.

Cate", "ReviewID": "R33FWY2I7H73HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For under $300, this phone provides all the functionality that you would need in a communications device with speed and elegance.The OS is fast, fluid, and very energy efficient. Once you get the hang of the OS, there is no friction with what you want to do with the phone. More importantly for me, the phone lasts about a week between recharges for the kind of light usage I put on it.The product pictures, which somehow show the phone as a large generic lump of plastic do not do justice. In person, the phone is relatively small with subdued but elegant looks. Although parts of the phone are made of plastic, it exudes such good build-quality that you feel content about your purchase. The IPS screen very good, even when compared to an AMOLED screen.All said, you should interpret this review in the context of using the phone as a communications device and not as a general purpose computing device. What I mean by communication functions are voice, messaging, email, Internet, GPS Navigation, and Social Network access. The 701 does all these with flying colors.For the latter purpose, it may not compete well with the likes of beefed up phone-computers such as Samsung Galaxy II with their quad core Cpus, 5\" screens, and 4-hour battery life. Or with the so called ecosystem devices that give you access to millions of Apps most of which try poorly to replicate functionality of a PC that most people have easy access to.I switched to the 701 from an Android device which is inferior in about every aspect except the size of its App store. On top of that, with the help of Android, Google spied on me, collecting data about anything and everything I did while connected to the Internet. The CarrierIQ fiasco just added insult to injury.Currently the 701 is ranked practically the last in unlocked Phones category at Amazon. The top 100 in this category includes many outdated Blackberry and Android phones at maybe slightly cheaper prices. That is just laughable and shows how much perception and reality are misaligned in this product category.Finally, as with all complex electronic devices, except maybe with magical ones, you have to be patient initially and spend the time and effort to learn it. For example, after the initial boot, the 701 behaved erratically, until I rebooted it. I did not get the unbelievable battery life until configured all the appropriate settings. If you expect that you will turn on this device and start using it right away with everything to your satisfaction, you may be disappointed. Only a magical device can achieve such a feat, for which you would have to pay through the nose.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "superb device", "Author": "bucky11", "ReviewID": "R2Z86KU7O2AJLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a screen crack accident involving my Nokia 5800, I read reviews, visited phone stores, ordered two and sent them back, and then decided to try the new Nokia 701.  I had spent several frustrating days with the 5800, sorting out the symbian software, even with prior experience in linux distributions.  There is no comparison.  Nokia would be incredibly stupid to drop symbian now that they have just about got it right.  Even on the 5800, once I got the phone tuned, so to speak, symbian becam an incredibly precise and reliable operating system. Now, symbian^3 in the anna and belle iterations has become an easy, beautiful and flexible system to use.  Stick with it, Nokia. And, with google notoriously betraying users, apple apps leaking user info like mad, it seems simply prudent to stay with symbian.And now, the phone.  Simply a beautiful object.  Unlike many expensive phones I picked up, handled- this has true gravitas.  Nothing, nothing \"plasticky\" about it. almost corner to corner gorilla glass. I assume those smooth bumper corners must be plastic, but there is no thinness to it.  The metal battery cover, the precise latch mechanism, lead to the beauty inside- the machined metal frame.And the functions. First- in review after review,  I encountered mediocre to poor call quality mentioned as an afterthought- IN A TELEPHONE.  None of that here.  Nokia builds phones, and the phone radios are great.  I use AT&T-; sorry Iphone owners, it was not the service provider.  Those calls you lost were your appliance sucking.The 701 also has an FM transmitter.  This means that all the music it can store- and it accepts more memory than any sane person could fill- can be broadcast to any nearby FM radio.  No wires.  It works.  Just went through the drill. Of course, gps, internet, games, blah. blah.Nokia was rumored to be dying.  I have seen the competition, the phones, the OS- I say Nokia is on a roll. The windows alliance may help in the US, but the new symbian- and the sheer beauty of the phone- will appeal to those who admire design, execution, and intelligence worldwide.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Careful who the end seller is", "Author": "Wade Smart \"Wade Smart\"", "ReviewID": "R16HP78L93C3VF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive spent a lot of time researching my Nokia options and the 701 is the only phone that really fits my bill.

It uses the Symbian operating system, which is supported only through 2016 (though exactly what that means is not clear), but you have a web browser, email, music, a decent camera (except for the fact that you can't take closeup shots), and a full navigational system with maps stored on the phone (means you can use as a GPS even without a network connection, unlike Google or Apple Maps). You do not have apps for every conceivable service and business, so if you rely on a particular app for banking, etc., you're probably better off with another phone. On the other hand, the phone is not constantly monitoring your whereabouts and activities and uploading the data to Google or Apple, so it's possible that you have somewhat more privacy.

I am quite familiar with Nokia's Symbian OS variant, so there was no 'learning curve' in my case. In fact, Symbian's well-known software and hardware efficiency (read: great battery life!) was a primary reason for my return to it after using a rooted HTC Sensation 4G, (its only real problem being that it would typically be close to shutting down with barely any use well before the end of a given day.) All of the 701's software works as it should, with the 1 GHz processor easily outpaces my wife's former daily use phone, the Nokia C6-01.The phone has a great screen (Nokia's ClearBlack technology really does help with outdoor viewing), TV-Out, OS-managed connectivity (WiFi, GPS, mobile data all only when needed :-)), Nokia Maps offline GPS Navigation is still second to none....And yet....The earpiece on the first 701 would emit static to the point of drowning out the other party, and the static would persist on the other person's end even more loudly, regardless of the phone's manufacturer/carrier. I tried all recommended solutions (hard reset, GSM/3G toggle, SIM swap), but to no avail. I returned it and bought the second one, hoping for a better experience. And, initially, it was.Then I started to miss calls....I glanced at the phone's notification bar one day, when I noticed that the signal died, and would not return unless I restarted it. Every single time. Another standard troubleshooting process, another persistent problem. In the end, I kept it. But I've also returned to the Sensation (and added an extended battery) for my daily use.Nokia's support for Symbian is steadily winding down, and with Microsoft's purchase of their device manufacturing division looming large, I couldn't be the only one that suspects that the end of support for their mapping service on Symbian devices may not be far behind. After trying two Windows Phone devices from Nokia,(Lumia 620 (unlocked), Lumia 521(T-Mobile)) and returning both after noticing a hardware problem on the first and hardware/software limitations on both, it looks as though Google's Nexus phones might be a better future option, and for now I may simply use the 701 and C6-01 as a quick media-to-TV output device and for navigation during trips.In any case, please be wary if you are considering this phone and expect to use it as such.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "its symbian but its ok", "Author": "sergio", "ReviewID": "RJDG178BAUMQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i only bought this phone because  the fm tramsmitter but it has a lot of useful features like the good camera and the fast modem", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product ok but different color that i\"ve ordered!", "Author": "Frare", "ReviewID": "R1K3J9SGWHRR64", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im satisfied with the product everything is working perfectly but the only problem was that i received a black one instead of the gray...", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia 701", "Author": "J.Linares", "ReviewID": "RFZKV8TCYDHF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a good choice if you want a product of Nokia, a super fast smartphone with an amazing OS.

I have to give Nokia credit and say that maybe I have a bad battery - but as is, this phone is a no-go as far as I am concerned.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$239.99", "Features": "8MP Camera\nSymbian Belle OS\nNFC\n1 Year warranty with Nokia", "Name": "Nokia 701 8MP, 3G, WIFI, 8GB, Gorilla Glass Display, NFC Unlocked World Mobile Smartphone (Gray)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AWlXt4VxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0061RADBW"}}
