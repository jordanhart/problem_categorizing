Just think back to when touch screens didn't have the typical android or apple feel, and this is what this phone is. It has a browser, it takes decent pictures, even has A2DP streaming for bluetooth. Does everything fine. Great phone for the price, which is about 1/10th the price of Apple phones, especially if you buy it from the sellers selling new phones as refurbs or used because Amazon makes them. Overall great little phone.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect replacement phone!", "Author": "Spencer", "ReviewID": "R3QV7ZTCAZD4H3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything I need and at a great price!

Carroll", "ReviewID": "R1F9WZ1J0JS4T0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There's a lot of things I don't like about this phone. The touch is too sensitive, except when I accidentally call someone and want to hang up before they answer. That's when it seems the touch feature doesn't work right, but that's the only way to disconnect the call. As a secretary, I send a lot of group text messages, but this phone makes that difficult as well and it caps the number of recipients at 25. I would not buy it again or recommend it to others.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy.", "Author": "Gina Monti", "ReviewID": "R24BEENQKWPY80", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bank account was never credited the amount.
