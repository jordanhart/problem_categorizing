Instead of the usual Tracfone PIN card, there was an 8x11 sheet of paper with instructions and a label affixed to it with a Tracfone PIN printed on it.  Entered the PIN and a promo code into my phone and within a few seconds my phone beeped and the time increased for the correct amount of time.  Walmart charges almost $40 for these cards and then there are taxes and 911 fees, etc.  Even after paying $5.00 for Priority Mail, buying a PIN number online saved a good chunk of change.

Last Time I ordered it, I got a regular card, this time it was a xeroxed page with a Pin # sticker. Good news.. The pin # worked, and added the appropriate time for my plan. The second \"problem\" though, was that I must have tried at least 12 non-expired bonus codes before finding one that tracfone would accept..
