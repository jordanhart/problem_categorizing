{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Daniel Lee", "ReviewID": "R2FTDHYZ6XH3WI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a little over a year now. I absolutely love it. The camera has great quality. If only it had a flash. This is a very customizable phone. I probably have over 50 themes on it and even more games. One of my favorite features about this phone is that you can control other bluetooth devices with it. You can use it for presentations or hook up your computer your home theater and use it to control iTunes. There is just one thing that i wish this phone had that it doesn't, and thats EDGE. If your with t-mobile and want to use the internet this isn't the phone for you. Other than that it is a GREAT phone.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
