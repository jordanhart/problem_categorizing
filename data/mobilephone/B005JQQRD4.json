This is a huge problem for me and it really stinks because I would love to have an alarm on my phone that works. Obviously, this isn't end of the world stuff, but how hard is it to make a phone start making noise at a certain time? This technology is only what, 20 years old?There are a few other things that bug me, like the camera button for the horrible camera being really easy to turn on, but oh well.This is obviously a fairly low-tech phone, with very few bells and whistles, and in that capacity it does just fine, I suppose, but if you need a phone with an alarm, stay very very very far away.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is what it says...", "Author": "Shauna", "ReviewID": "R2YTNRCWEYKMJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband wanted just a basic phone for talking and texting without buttons on the outside and the Gusto is just that.

I have been through 3 Gustos with Verizon, all with the same alarm problem.  The 4th phone is in the mail to me, and I don't hold out much hope.  If you buy one (but don't), try it at 6AM for instance.  None of mine have worked at 6AM.  I seem to be stuck in a \"do loop\" with Verizon and can't get out.  The phone equivalent of \"Charlie on the MTA\".Also, the \"USB\" port really isn't, and you can't get your pictures off.  Like a fool, I didn't know they made such phones.

IMO its a good, basic, compact phone.  Since then I have replaced it once (when the battery gave out) and have another in the drawer ready to go if/when this one goes.  (The fact its been available this long says something about it IMO)Though capable of text, internet, and e-mail I've never used them. I suspect they're primitive by today's standards.  Have played with the camera a little, but only to set up page backgrounds. It is capable of GPS location, I keep it set to \"E-911 only\"Likes:- Smooth and compact, slips easily in and out of my back pocket- Durable, except for external display (see below) Has twice survived  brief dunkings (under 2 minutes)- Can understand voice commands including number dial and phone status- Bluetooth compatible- Speakerphone is usable- Customizable quick menu- Announces incoming caller by name (contacts only, I believe)Dislikes:- Alarm doesn't work- External display damages easily- Does not support Verizon contact backup/transfer appComments:I stay with this model because it meets my modest needs and can be replaced at reasonable cost ($20 at Walmart) without having to learn how to use a new phone.Minus 1 star for alarm and display issues.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R2SVLJ9AK4CA7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a phone that has no bells and whistles..this is the phone for you.
