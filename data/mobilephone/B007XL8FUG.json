I like the GSM functionality which includes the use of SIM card that provides the maximum in operational flexibility. The LCD displays are very bright and clear. It also should be noted that if the need arises, I can add up to 16GB of additional storage by the simple process of inserting a MicroSD card costing less than $20; this is a marked improvement over having to decide upfront what memory capacity is needed and then having to shell out hundreds of additonal dollars for permanently installed memory, which is the practice for at least one other major manufacturer of cellphones. Similarly, this same manufacturer requires that the replacement of the battery to be done by returing the phone to them and paying a significant amount for this time-consuming process; on the other hand, I can simply buy a new battery and install it easily in the cellphone. I have to admit that this is the first cellphone that I have purchased (although I have occasionally used my wife's flip-phone in the past.)  For the price, this unit fits my needs quiet nicely; it provides very good quality voice communications, as well as texting if I decide to use this feature. Additionally the built-in calculator, timers, camera, notes, and calendar provided are useful auxiliary features on the unit.

If the first one didn't get broken by some one else I wouldn't of had to buy a replacement one from Fast Lane Wireless which lasted me about 3 years.  With T-mobile during a snow storm when the electricity goes out it doesn't work.I bought a used one , the Nokia 6350 AT&T; cell phone a red one from CD Phone Home Inc., it didn't work very well.  My review on that one is under the red phone on the amazon web site.This phone I like it very much.  It has the same features I have been looking for.  Good sound quality, A scientific calculator, The address book in it is great, you can see the names and addresses full view.  The ringing is loud but could be a little louder especially if you have it in your pocketbook or coat.  No dropped phone calls at all.  I know during a snow storm when the electric goes out the phone will always work.If ever you want any tech support or questions about the phone just go to the closest AT&T; store and they will help you with your phone as I was told by them.  I plan to go there soon, as I have some questions and concerns.  I will write an update as soon as I can.UpDate: 1. Yes it was a great phone, I did like it but there were a few things wrong with it.  I realized it was a used one, as when I opened it there was a spinning circle and half of the wall paper showing before it became full screen.  2. I couldn't find the feature to have it come to the main screen when I closed it after I used the calculator.  3. There was a small delay when I wanted to get into the address book and other features.I believe there was something wrong with the phone as it wasn't new as listed from Orient Trade.  I really should rate this item not five stars but 3 1/2 stars, It was definitely a used phone.  I am glad that I lost the phone.
