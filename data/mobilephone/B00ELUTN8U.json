Each phone I've had- and I've had many, seemed to just crater after awhile, or after an update that was meant for that phone. I've never rooted my phone, pirated any software associated with it, and I followed updating instructions to the letter. Still, they just seemed to function less and less. The last phone I used, the Galaxy S2 (keeping in mind, of course, that I never dropped any of mine, got them wet, etc), I updated a couple of months ago, after it told me that one was ready. It never worked the same after that.So, I decided to try something new, something fresh. I read that the previous Sprint Windows phone was pretty slick, and had some very good reviews. I wanted to wait until the ATIV came out, since it was the newest Windows phone that Spring had to officer.I just got it today, so my review score may change, but this is my raw, \"virgin\" experience.It seems to be a simple, no-bs interface. What you see is what's there. Tiles for the home screen are interesting, and function much like that of the latest Windows desktop OS. I used to hate the whole tile thing, but hey. That's the way technology is going these days, so fighting it would be futile- just roll with it (remember when DOS was THE thing, then Windows game out? Sort of the same scenario) because there's nothing you can do.Settings are easily accessible and provide some decent customization. I did find myself a little lost at times, but that was because I kept thinking \"Where would this be on a Doid phone...\" and again, you can't think \"Droid\", because it isn't a Droid. Reformat your thought process lol.I ran into a snag the first setup, however. I was all set up and ready to rock and roll, but the phone wouldn't let me download any apps whatsoever. Simple fix for me, just reset the phone completely and re-setup the phone. Voila, now I can do what I want.Just remember this one thing, and you'll be golden: TILES ARE YOU FRIENDS! Use them! I have my music, text, phone function (obviously) and settings as the top tiles, so the most common are right there at the top with the rest near the bottom.Phone seems solid, so right now I'm looking at a protective case for it and possibly a screen protector.. something about my oils wearing away the middle of my Galaxy S2, leaving a permanent smudge just..doesn't appeal to me with a new, nice-looking phone.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The better Sprint WP8 device", "Author": "Quentin \"Q\"", "ReviewID": "R1QVPJMSVFA2I1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for a little more than a month now, so here's my experience...Look & Feel:This phone looks and feels about like any other Samsung device, which is expected. No major surprises here. It feels good in the hand for being a 4.8\" screen size, and feels pretty light. It's not as brick-like as some of the Lumias but seems pretty durable, although I'm not about to test my luck - I usually take very good of my phones and avoid anything that would break them.Display:720p resolution on a TFT screen instead of AMOLED. This is a step up from the 8XT's sub-par 480x800 resolution. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss regarding the TFT screen is about. The screen and colors are bright and clear, and I honestly can't really tell the difference. Viewing angle is very good no matter how I'm looking at the phone - the backlight seems to help. At the time of release, it was the largest screen for Windows Phone available, at 4.8 inches.Battery:The battery is removable on the ATIV S Neo (another plus for this WP8 device), and lasts a pretty decent amount of time. Nothing out of the ordinary for a smart phone. I don't intensively use my phone for battery draining tasks like playing games 24/7 or Netflix - those are just occasional things. If you moderately use your phone for texting, some web browsing, standard tasks, etc. you won't be let down. I was able to get a single full charge with moderate use to last me about 2 days with the battery saver on. This is what I'm used to on smart phone devices. Nothing disappointing, but nothing absolutely stellar.OS & Other Features:Specs are pretty standard. 1gig RAM, 16GB internal storage, 1.4GHz dual-core processor. Nothing that'll blow you or most windows phones away, but I'd say those specs are about as good as any Lumia 920/x with maybe some very miniscule differences. The performance and Windows Phone operating system on the ATIV S Neo is snappy, responsive, and just works as I'd expect it to. The App selection on Windows Phone 8 is obviously improving. I'm not a huge app junkie, but the ones I did use on Android were easily replaced on WP8. One final point I'd like to make is that the storage space is expandable via SD card slot, up to 64GB. This is great, and should be a standard on smart phones by now. If you gave me a 32GB internal storage device but it wasn't expandable, that, in my opinion, isn't as good as 16GB with SD capability.Camera:The camera is 8MP, which for me (and most users, probably) is just fine. I don't need a 41MP camera, as I don't take pictures that often. Photo quality as far as I can tell is OK - it's decent. I don't think it holds a candle to the Lumia low-light photos that they rightfully hold the quality title, but if a decent camera is just a bonus for you on a phone, the ATIV S Neo's 8MP camera is certainly good enough. It's a lot better than the 5MP camera I had on my 3 year old Android phone before switching, so I'm happy. Nothing that will absolutely blow you away, but you won't be let down by crappy pictures either.Sound & Call Quality:I'm no audiophile, but as far as I can tell the audio quality is good. I've asked those who I've called about the quality and they say it's pretty good, and sounds better and more clear, with less background noise than my old device. Calls are A-OK. I'm also not one of those people who blasts music on the speakers of their phone, but I tried it out just to see how well they do. Analysis - pretty good. Once again, an upgrade from my old Samsung Epic. Sure, it's probably not as awesome as the HTC's BoomSound, but I have no real complaints. Headphone quality seems pretty good too. My only minor complaint is that the phone seems pretty quiet in general unless I really boost the volume up high.Now if only it was slightly cheaper to upgrade... Seeing as how it's almost the same as last year's ATIV S, it could have done with a better price, but some of that blame lays on Sprint, not just Samsung.TLDR; If you're on Sprint and want a WP8 device, this is the one to get.

I didn't buy it on Amazon because I already had an iPhone 4S and didn't want to upgrade it to iOS7. I love this phone, having used already been using Windows 8 & 8.1 on my convertable tablet which is a Samsung.Needless to say the apps are different but so far I've been more than able to find ones which do what I want.  I love the ShopSavvy which will scan any barcode or qrcode and find comparisons online very quickly!!  I really also like the Scout navigator.  I upgraded to the subscription to get the voice navigation commands.  Much better than google maps for me.As for the phone, the navigation is simple once you learn it.  It is consistent for all the apps as well as the UI.  It took me all of a day to become comfortable.The syncronization with my POP email account was a bit tricky since I access it via Outlook in Windows 8 but once I learned how to set up the Exchange ActiveSync connector, it is much better than iCloud.I am pleased, I hope you will, if you take the leap...  mike", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "EDITED: Samsung Ativ S Neo - Average at best, know what you are getting into", "Author": "Ken \"alero2137\"", "ReviewID": "R2192ADVD8SE0D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Windows Phone is a great platform, with pros and cons like everyother phone OS. It really depends on what you can live with and what you can't. Sure, many people will say you don't \"need\" a phone - true. But I know I am not going to pay for something that doesn't satisfy what I want.I know the frustrations of trying to find out if the Windows Phone experience would be good for me after 2 years of Android, and I wasn't really able to find good answers to many of my questions. I felt that the good points of the OS outweighed the negatives, so I took the dive. You may not feel the same way.As an FYI, if the new Blackberry were on Sprint, I would have given that a good shot of becoming my new phone OS as well. I believe that the more phone OS's, the better competition and we (the consumers) would win out.First, Amazon gets 5 stars automatically. The product shipped when it should have and arrived on time. I have never had a product arrive late or have any issues with the shipping, and that continues. Plus, Amazon has consitently had a competetive price on this phone.UPS gets 1 star for leaving it on my driveway where anyone could have taken it - you guys couldn't have even slid it in between the storm door and regular door? It fit, because I checked.I would rate my Sprint services in the Twin Cities as 4 stars. Sprint has worked well the 4+ years that I have had them now everywhere that I have been (mostly Minnesota and parts of Oregon). However, as they say, your mileage may vary. Currently, Sprint is upgrading their network, and there are definitely growing pains. Where I can get 4G, such as work downtown St. Paul, speed and reliability have been good. Likewise for 3G at my home. In between, however, it can be hit and miss, but I presume that this will be fixed in the near future when their upgrades are completed. Phone calls on the phone are great, as are text responses - no lag in turnaround responses. I had some issues with activating my phone, but a call to the Sprint CS got that fixed in less than 15 minutes.Samsung - phone design - overall gets 3.5 stars. The large battery that lasts 7 hours while streaming music throught TuneIn and the large 720P screen is great. The slippery backing and lack of accessories is not good. I have dropped the phone a couple of times already because of the slick plastic that Samsung uses. Further, the screen, while large with good resolution, is not an end-to-end screen, and I feel there is a lot of wasted screen space. Probably a design decision, and one I can live with to have the larger, removable battery.Now to the phone as a whole - the rating really depends on what you can live with and what you can't. For me, the Windows Phone experience is 4 stars. There are pros and cons, and right now, the pros outweigh the cons (and I am actually optomistic that the cons will be fixed through Microsoft updates, which have already started to rolled out [GDR 1,2, & 3, with WP 8.1 coming in the future])Why is my rating so high? I was not too integrated into the Google services with android, so I do not really miss them much. I used Google Plus a lot, and only really miss this because of the people I met through that service. Android was often buggy, and even my phone, which was only 2 years old with decent specs ran slowly. I didn't root my phones, and just wanted something that \"worked,\" but that I could customize if I wanted. After 2 years, I was ready for a new experience.Some of the pluses of moving to Windows Phone:1. The modern \"Metro\" UI is beautiful, and really shown off in the Microsoft Corp. Apps, as well as some of the dedicated 3rd parties (TuneIn, Weave, NBC, Best Buy, and Speedtest are great examples). The greatest thing about this is that Microsoft took a leap and created a system that was unique, and not a clone of their previous desktop experience, nor an iPhone clone like google - icon city.2. The phone is set up to work right out of the box. \"Fluid\" would be the perfect word to describe the base OS. Anything done in the OS (and not apps - more on that below) is simple and shows no lag whatsoever.3. Customization is front and center. Themes, lockscreen photos, and Live Tiles beg to be changed and customized to what you want to see on your homescreen.4. Integration with Outlook.com. I had never used Outlook (aka, Hotmail) but may give it a shot now. It seems to work fairly well, is available on all platforms (whether I stay with WP or not in the future), and is very simple and \"clean.\"5. Work. Some of us utilize our phones for more than just play, and some of the integrations with Microsoft Services are nice to have. I am not hooked up to my organization's SharePoint or Lync, but the ability is there. I have used One Note and Word already for some work things, and it is nice to have if ideas come to mind when I am not in a \"Work\" mode and not near a computer.Some cons of moving to Windows Phone:1. I am not sure if Microsoft was to busy looking ahead to what people might want and what could be different from other OS's that they left out some basics, but they did. Doesn't seem to be a way to have the alarm set to blaringly loud without also having the phone set the same - ??? I want to wake up when the alarm is set, not when I get an email at 2 in the morning!2. Some apps are just buggy. TuneIn is the biggest examplet I can think of. Whenever you want to start playing a new station, you have to start it a second time -stop the stream and press play again- the first just continues to load, but never go anywhere.3. Notifications on the phone are horrendous. If you are a power Facebook user - well, might want to keep Android. I got FB notifications the first day I owned my phone, none afterwards. FYI - I did not integrate this with the \"People\" hub, I straight use the App, for privacy reasons. Not only that, if you do not have a live tile on your start screen, you may never know what an alert was for if you ignore it for a few minutes. In 8.1 or GDR3, they really should think of a way to fix these.4. I am not sure if it is the phone, the os, or apps, but sometimes the touch screen just will not work until you lock the phone and unlock it again. Since I have not really heard of this from other WP hardware, I assume it is a Samsung thing. Annoying, but this happened on my Android too, but not as often - just figured I would put that information out here in case anyone who subsequently buys this phone encounters it.5. The Xbox music is terrible. In fact, I can't believe this came from the company that brought us Zune! A couple times now in the past 2 weeks of ownership my SD card \"ejected\" itself, causing my to formate my card. Gone were the few photos I took (leading me to reason why we get 7 GB free of SkyDrive), and my music had to be added again. After this, some songs just won't work (yes, even after formatting and reloading!).In conclusion, I can live with the cons, with the hope that they are fixed as Microsoft appears to be trying to fix a lot of this already. The major cons they definitely need to fix for my continued usage include the music and notifications. But, I am patient. I can live with the phone the way it is, because the pros outweight cons at this point. Besides, I know if needed, I can go pick up an HTC One if GDR3 and 8.1 (aka, \"Blue\") do not bring at least some fixes.If you need your phone for a certain reason, your current phone OS works, and it would be financially difficult to get a new phone if it doesn't work out, stick with the phone that works. If you are looking for a change, willing to try something new, and have the means to switch out even if it means a big hit to your wallet if you find it is unpleasant, I say give Windows Phone a shot.PS - I left a lot of local apps when I moved to WP (Kare11 TV is the major one); however I found out that the mobile websites were as good, if not better, than the app. Something to keep in mind.Below Edited 11/9/2013 *****************I am changing my rating, knocking off a star. There are multiple things wrong with some of Microsoft's services, and their shift to supporting other platforms (Android/iPhone) ahead of their own kind of makes me angry, seeing as how I spent the money for -their- phone.Outlook email - Why does the drafts folder not sync?!?! I start an email on my computer, realize that I need to get other information, go to my phone, and my saved draft is not there, even after refreshing my sync.Error notifications - I don't know if this is a network issue, or WP8 one, but multiple times I get \"administratively denied\" error notifications. Like actual notifications - vibrate and ring like a text message or phone call - even though they just give me a number code, and I can't stop them.Notifications in General - I get notifications for text messages and email, but that is about it. Facebook, missed calls, etc - nope, none. Ditto on voicemail. If you want to get back to the cell experiences of 2005, get this phone. If you rely on notifications, like I did, stay clear of WP8.SD Card - 3 times now, the phone has corrupted my SD Card. Have to format, put all music back on, and then insert into phone. I never had this issue with my Amazon 16 GB card in my old phone, and do not believe that this is a card issue.Lag - As stated in my original review above, I noticed some lag on this phone. Again, no Idea if this is a network, samsung, or WP8 issue, but it has gotten beyond the point of annoying. Scrolling along fine, when all of a sudden I can't for about 2 seconds. What causes the most frustration is that whenever you try to scroll again, the phone seems to think you are \"pressing,\" so it opens whatever your finger touched last when it allows touchscreen input again! If you ever hear anyone say \"WP8 doesn't crash like Google does,\" well they are right - at least with google, A RESTART FIXED MY ISSUES, MICROSOFT.I also must caution people not to get this phone unless they really need Office, or the other Microsoft services on their phone. I myself signed a new contract to get this phone, so I am going to wait for early next year when 8.1 is released. I give Microsoft, Samsung, and Sprint until around my birthday in January to release this and fix the issues with the OS, phone and/or network or sadly I will have to migrate back to Google's Android :(PPS - Oh, one more thing. At NokiaWorld (Late October?), there were major app announcements, such as Instagram, Vine, and FlipBoard, \"coming soon.\" Don't pick-up this phone in anticipation of those Apps. Back during summer, when the Lumia 1020 launched, Vine, FlipBoard, and Path were all announced as \"coming soon.\" Notice a pattern?", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid choice", "Author": "Thomas Brian Burns", "ReviewID": "R2PX87AR8IV9HY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Three weeks on with my new ATIV, and I'm pretty happy. That's the short version. For those interested, here's the longer version:Sprint: My family's been with Sprint for around ten years, and our experience has been a generally positive one; I don't in any way dismiss the concerns of the many Sprint customers who seem to be having large-scale problems, but so far we've been lucky.Upgrading: My HTC Arrive was still performing well after nearly three years, but some hardware issues (among other things, it was no longer possible to charge the battery inside the phone, which meant always charging batteries externally and swapping them back and forth), and the need for a larger screen (it's just become too hard to read a small screen without my glasses) prompted my decision to upgrade.OS: I've been very happy with the performance of my Arrive for the most part, so I was looking to go with another Windows phone. Nothing against Android--I use my Nexus 7 tablet constantly--but as a phone OS, I really like Windows. The specs on Sprint's only other WP8 phone (the HTC 8XT) didn't blow me away (and it's surprising how many early reviews mistakenly thought it had no micro SD expansion, which was one reason I wasn't considering it at first), it seems to me that at least 16gb of built-in storage should be standard, and I do like having a replaceable battery. Cost was obviously a factor, and I'd never have paid the $149 that Sprint still(!) wants for the phone, but when Amazon offered it for $39, I decided to upgrade. Mine came with the latest update (2216.14.01.2 1) installed.Form Factor: While I wanted a larger screen, I also prefer a phone I can use with one hand, and the ATIV (just barely) qualifies on that basis. It did help that I got a rubberized plastic slim case for better gripping, without adding much bulk to the phone's basically slim profile; fits nicely in my pocket. One note for anyone coming over from another Samsung device: I also have a smaller Samsung Galaxy media player, and the button layout is just different enough to confuse my fingers when I go from one device to the other. While the ATIV is much lighter than the Arrive, it does have some of that same feeling of being just heavy enough to feel substantial rather than flimsy. \"Flimsy,\" though, is how I'd describe the little wafer of plastic that covers the physical \"Windows home\" key; I much preferred the capacitive one on the Arrive. I generally prefer the design of HTC phones (I gave serious thought to moving over to Android and getting the HTC One), but I'm liking the clean simplicity of the ATIV. I do miss that fantastic slide-out keyboard on the Arrive, but the other slider keyboard phones currently offered through Sprint didn't appeal to me.Performance as a phone: Seems fine: I can hear people, they can hear me. The setup was smooth and familiar, and things like custom ringtones were even easier than on WP 7.5 (Sprint and HTC never offered WP 7.8, and I didn't feel like rooting my Arrive). The screen is very sharp and clear, and easy to read in daylight. And while it's no substitute for the Arrive's physical keyboard, I prefer the WP virtual keyboard to any Android keyboard of this size that I've used.Performance as a mini-computer: Obviously, the specs mean that pretty much everything feels zippier and smoother than on my Arrive; again, setup is pretty seamless. I'm not really a game player, so I can't speak to that, but video and audio, whether streaming or playing locally, are (as is so much about this phone) smooth. I don't watch a lot of video on my phone, but I did try some of the \"March Madness\" live TV streaming app, and it ran fine (slightly better than on my Nexus 7 actually). For some reason, Samsung has included their fairly decent SoundAlive audio equalizer on Sprint's ATIV Neo, but not on AT&T;'s version. As for external storage, I've had issues with SanDisk 64 gb class 10 cards in other devices, and after reading comments about them being problematic in the ATIV, I settled for getting a 32 gb class 4 card, and so far it seems to be working fine. Another WP8 plus is the ability to use the phone and card in mass-storage mode, rather than having to do everything by syncing.Camera: The camera's a secondary consideration for me, but the one on the ATIV doesn't seem to be much of an upgrade over the one on the Arrive, despite its superior specs: in good light, for a stationary subject, it's fine; anything else is hit-or-miss. It does come with a few more settings and features than the camera on the Arrive (including front-facing camera), and with WP8 you can use Microsoft's Photosynth panoramic app, so it's possible that more dedicated shutterbugs than myself can get better performance out of it than the default. The \"Manga Camera\" lenses are good for amusing 9-year-olds.Battery Life: It may just be the fact that I'm coming from a phone that was using three-year-old technology, but I'm impressed to be getting two full days charge out of my ATIV, whereas the Arrive would just about get to the end of the day (and sometimes not even that) before I had to swap batteries.Network: This was the area I was most concerned with, as my Arrive only had 3G, and the horror stories I've heard about Sprint's LTE certainly gave me pause in terms of stepping up to 4G. So far, I've been surprised by how much 4G I'm able to find here (mostly the Peninsula of the San Francisco Bay Area), and by how fast it is; if I'm in an area that shows both w-fi and 4G, I'll often disable the wi-fi to get better performance from the 4G. If I need to use 3G, it's still sluggish by comparison, but the phone's improved hardware specs mean that even 3G seems to work better than on my Arrive. No real problem with dropped calls; there are still patches where I can't get effective signal (including parts of my house and most of my office, though my coworkers tell me that this building is a problem for all the major carriers), but they're the same ones there have always been.Apps: Like a lot of WP users, I've rarely felt that the relatively small number of WP apps as compared to iOS and Android was much of an issue: I've always been able to find what I need (getting Office and 25 gb of [Sky]OneDrive storage for free, plus an extra 3gb for photo backup, helps). I have to admit, though, that I had sort of expected that WP 8 would have begun to narrow the gap a bit more than it has: news aggregator apps like Weave, Bing News, and News 360 are not really up to the best of what's available elsewhere (like Pulse or Flipbook), though the WP8 version of Rhapsody is a vast improvement over the WP7 version (i.e., it actually works, though it still can't use the external SD card for storage). The various directional/local search features seem to work about the same as their precursors on WP7. Some apps do take a bit of hunting: for example, the QR/UPC reader that used to be under the \"search\" menu on WP7 is now buried in the camera settings. I was also a bit surprised at how small the Samsung App collection on offer is, considering the vast number of Samsung-branded apps available on my Galaxy media player, but there's not really much I'd miss. I am disappointed that the WP calendar doesn't seem to have been improved at all: it still won't let you actually read anything in month view, and despite following all the directions, I've never been able to get it to sync to more than one Google calendar (I replaced it with an app called Cal, which did that very easily, and has a few other nice features).The app that seems to be giving a lot of Sprint customers trouble is Visual Voice Mail. Up to this point, I haven't really had a problem: I still wish we could just have the little VM icon on the Phone tile, as was the case before, but I do get (incredibly tiny) voicemail notifications on the VVM live tile, and I get my \"toast\" and audio alerts; so far so good. I turned off the text transcription option after a day or so, but while I had it, the transcriptions were hilariously inaccurate, and frankly useless.Overall Experience: By today's standards, the ATIV's specs are pretty middling, but the Arrive was my first smartphone (I had an LG Lotus before, which was sort of a \"slightly clever\" phone), so by comparison, the ATIV is much faster and smoother, while still feeling familiar and easy to use.But boy do I miss that keyboard.UPDATE: NO FM Radio. Not a feature that I used much on my old phone, since I have several other devices with FM radios, but I just today noticed that the Sprint version of this phone has no FM Radio (not sure about the AT&T; version), and this is evidently a hardware issue, and not something that can be fixed with a firmware update.I wouldn't really downgrade my review for that reason, but it does seem odd to remove a feature that used to be standard on their Windows phone.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "GJD", "ReviewID": "R1YG04FRU6TWD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first smart phone was a WebOS device and I loved it.

It doesn't.First the positive.  It's a decent phone with a great screen, sound and battery life.  I like the Windows 8 operating system, but this phone operates in a vacuum.  With Sprint, they don't even provide their own app, Sprint Zone, for this device.  I've called for six months and no one there can give me an explanation why an app to check your Sprint account is not available for this Sprint phone. And the browser on this phone doesn't render the Sprint mobile site at all.  Very disappointing and frustrating.Microsoft is no better.  This phone is not recognized on my Windows 8  laptop after spending hours with support downloading new drivers, etc.  Even the Windows 8 App for desktop won't work with this device.  And support seems to be in the dark with this phone altogether.I gave it a 3 based on the singular device, but the support behind it is non existent.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows Phone 8", "Author": "David Olson", "ReviewID": "R1NJ3GAO6TU6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is just a quick review after 1 week of ownership. Switched from an HTC EVO 4G Android device. It really does take some getting used to the Windows Phone way of doing things; but nothing bad. As for the available apps, there are a few that I would like to have, but my chief complaint is the lack of truly free apps. Or maybe the ads are just more noticeable / annoying. The only app that I would like but is not available would be Quicken and in this oday of insecurity, that may be just as well. I have also noticed that the applications and OS performance is fast, but the network bandwidth, both 4G and wifi, are seemingly very slow.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving this phone", "Author": "Super Shopper", "ReviewID": "R39SK3O51OVKCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just switched from Android & after about 3 days, I've pretty much figured out the phone and have things where I want them.  I would prefer to give 4.5 rather than 5 for a few minor things:1) all sounds are set at the same volume, ringtone, message alert etc...2) you cannot add your own custom notification sound3)cannot create & sort albums or photo galleries.Some complain about the lack of apps available.  I have found suitable replacements for the apps I was using on Android & many of the Android apps are also available on WP. A few app issues:I cannot find is a monthly calender app that is large enough to read. The built in calendar is great if you are looking at the daily agenda, but the monthly view requires a magnifying glass! WP8.1 has a new & much better calendar, so I will be happy when that comes out.  Perhaps there are some paid calendar apps, but I'm paying enough every month for the phone & service, so I stick with free apps.I would also love to see a keyboard & sms messenger.  The built in keyboard is ok, but I do miss my highly customized ai.type keyboard.  The native messenger app is ok too, but again, I miss the highly customized Chomp SMS.Eye candy is not what makes a great phone, it's the OS & I'm very pleased.  The nice thing about WP is when there are updates, the update ALL phones. They don't pick & choose like Android. So by this summer, this phone will be operating on 8.1 as that is when Sprint is rolling out the update.Calls are crystal clear & apparently quite loud on the receiving end (my daughter has to lower her volume when I call), Bluetooth in my car is also loud & clear.I haven't used the camera too much, but the few pics I've taken are much better than with my previous phones. I find the dedicated camera button tricky, so I just use the screen. The nice part is, you can touch the screen anywhere & it will take the picture.

Fast, easy to navigate the menus, Bright display, Easy swipes and clicks. Audio good out of phone. Transfer contacts through Bluetooth quickly from another phone.Apps available on Microsoft Store. 4GLTE is fast enough for me. Text to audio is a great feature. Fits in my hand. Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) apps already installed. Has available SD card slot.Cons: Cannot be used as modem. Sprint extorts $20 from the customer to use phone to connect to their computer as a router/hotspot. I already pay for my unlimited data plan and they extort another $20 a month to connect to it. My Android connects as a modem for free.Audio from callers is a bit weak through the Bluetooth to the earpiece at times. Limited cases are available. Screen is hard to write on to sign documents. Can only install apps from Store. Go back a screen button is hidden and not illuminated most of the time. It works once you learn that it is dark most of the time.

Of course a horrible relationship (Billions of $$$$'s) with Apple is a main reason. They push Apple products at every chance while truly hiding any Windows device (they sell two) down on the product page. The Sprint Stores don't push them, the salespeople don't push them or know anything about them... Sprint then claims that WP8 sales are horrible, that no one wants them. Sprint doesn't push updates to their phones (HTC Arrive) and leave it the enthusiasts to seek out other forms of updating the OS to the latest and crossing their fingers that the hardware will work with the updates. This phone is nice. It's not flashy, not beautiful and not something a teen would be showing off. It is a very thin, large screened, FAST phone though. It's a mid level device but thus far it has performed perfectly and there is little lag time. The color of the case is not bad; much better than I thought. It is a blue patterned case. I bought the Body Glove case from Amazon and it fits and looks great on the phone. Even with a protective case the phone is thin. Microsoft has recently offered UPDATES to folks that want to get them before they are released. It's part of their Developer program but is open to ANYONE. This is great for many reasons. The main reason is that you can now update an official OS to your phone even though Sprint does not offer one (they may on this model?). You must do research and read reviews BEFORE you do this since this is strictly an OS update and has nothing to do with Samsung's device software. The update works great thus far according to many of us that have updated to the latest OS via this program. All in all a good choice since Sprint does not offer Nokia branded items. The phone has stellar review everywhere and if you like Windows Phone simplicity and speed and are on Sprint; this is a safe, decent priced (now), solid (even though it feels a bit plastic) phone. All you have to do is search the web to find out all you need to know about this device.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enjoying it", "Author": "jwbphx", "ReviewID": "R34K91ZP1Q6F8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great for what I use the phone for, it connects well with the windows computer I use each day.

I'm coming from an android (galaxy S2), and I got more and more frustrated with it. It started having hardware issue (couldn't locate itself for maps...) and software issues (it suddenly couldn't create a blacklist for incoming calls, stopped being able to sync with my computer, started running slower with each patch, randomly deciding to turn itself off while it was in my pocket). I wanted something different. Also, Android, as an OS, never really spoke to me.I like the touch and feel of the windows phone. I like the graphical style, I like the flow between the pages, I like the concept of the active tiles.So I bought it.And... I discovered a host of little things that disappoint me:I can't rename or recolor individual active tiles; I don't get to have \"personal email\" and \"work email\", I'm stuck with \"google mail\" and \"google mail 2\". Small thing, but stupid that it's not customizable.A couple of the apps that I used most aren't available, and won't ever be, because they're used to access \"adult\" sites. I can use the browser (which seem to be pretty nice so far), but I find this ridiculous. (If I can browse to any site, including p***hub, what's the point on stopping specific apps?)I use gmail. Most of my friends use gmail. When I moved to this phone, I lost gchat, including video gchat (I'm using IM+, but it seems to lose server connection every now and then), and that nifty new gmail feature that separate incoming mail as Primary, Social, and Promotions (all because of the google / microsoft war).Speaking of email, I can set my phone to check for mail up to every 15 minutes. I'm not sure, but it certainly seems that my android checked for gmail continuously. (Anyone know for sure?)Other things:Even the official apps seem a wee bit wonky. The Pandora app is really beautiful, and shows the current song on the lock page. But yesterday it simply stopped in the middle of a song, and I had to reconnect the station. Erm?The kindle app failed to sync when I opened my current book. The next time I opened it, it opened to a blank page. I had to go forward several pages and then back to actually be able to see text.On the galaxy, voice supported turn by turn navigation was supplied free out of the box. The cheapest one on the Windows phone is, um, $9? Trivial when compared to total cost of ownership, yet a little annoying.All that being said, I still like this phone, mainly because of the feel of the user interface. It feels less like an OS with a bunch of Apps stuck on top of it, and more like a cohesive unit. I need to decide in the next week or so if I'm going to keep it. I don't know yet.Update: After a week, I sent it back. Once again Pandora just stopped during playback (and I had to restart the app); the you tube app wouldn't work consistently (clicking it, it would look like it would start, then I'd be on the Tiles screen again), and Fandango wouldn't accept my zip code. I love the feel of the phone, both the OS and the physical, but I just can't imagine trying to use it for two years. I'm not a power user, but I want the things that I like to work cleanly and seamlessly.
