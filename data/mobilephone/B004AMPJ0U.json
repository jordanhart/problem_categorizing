It takes great pics, which I can't send, even though I've tried to play with the settings. The software doesn't even work most of the time, so I can't upload them to my laptop either. I will be replacing this phone.As for calls, the phone works fine, except that you can't hear the thing ring, even on its highest setting. It did vibrate at first when a call came in, but won't do that anymore either.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Rey", "ReviewID": "R2FYFVVRGA68KI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this model 10 months ago and I am very pleased with it; 3G signal works great, the camera takes great day pictures and the flash is very good at night. I like MP3 the player sound and the earbuds happened to be just awesome. Battery life is very good. I did not use  the LG sync software that much but I do connect the phone as mass storage to the PC in order to transfer files. WIFI is OK but the web browser does not support flash. I really like texting becausse I can use my two thumbs easily.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome service!!", "Author": "rita faye", "ReviewID": "RAWHVQLQ3FP1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "at first i was being frustrated beacause of the product that i was received,but then amazon take an action right away,they send me a brand new one..Good job guys, keep it up! tnx", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great if you want freedom", "Author": "krissy", "ReviewID": "R1LYO9NG55Y2PE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for an unlocked phone with wifi that I could use overseas.  This one fit the bill quite nicely.The only weird thing is the ups that you use to charge the phone with the computer doesn't actually connect to the computer.  This could be because I'm on an Apple, not a Windows OS, but I'm not sure.  The one cool thing is the blue tooth capabilities make it easy to transfer files (songs, pics, etc) from the phone to the Mac and likewise, the Mac to the phone.Pros:Bluetooth capabilites with ApplesUPS charger and wall charger (nixes the need for an additional adapt or)Camera's pretty cool, it wasn't a necessity for me, but definitely a bonusAT&T; told me I had to get a dataplan when I took the phone in to get a simcard.  They lied, you can cancel it easy since it's not one of their phones.  I found the best places to get the 3G coverage usually had wifi, so I got rid of that one.Clear communication, works great for international callsCons:Hard to find accessories for this in the StatesPhone arrived in Spanish w/ Spanish manual.  Not a terrible thing, but if you don't know anything about the language, that could have been a trip trying to switch to English**Not a US phone, so if you need any tech support, go through the UK office (I discovered trying to get a manual in English)Voicemail is set up to a UK number, which is weird.  I'm not sure how to fix the default (Haven't read the manual ;-) ) but haven't really needed to.  It still goes through my phone number, I just can't hit speed dial 1", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone with Class", "Author": "Mr Blister \"Mr. S\"", "ReviewID": "R31FXYWSFUH52Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After figuring out the phone, it turns out to be a very powerful and beautiful phone.The 8MP camera is able to be used in different modes, and takes really nice pictures.The camera is nice to look at and comes in a very fancy box.I use it with AT&T; and the settings for internet are below, but it can be used with T-Mobile or other GSM carriers as well.Phone Setting>Connectivity>Access Point: (Data Setting)Title: AttBearer: GPRSAuth: PAPUser: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (all caps)Password: CINGULAR1 (ALL UPPERCASE)APN: wap.cingularBrowser>Settings>Profiles: (Internet Setting)Service Name: Media NetHomepage: [\u2026]Connection mode: TCP without proxyIP: (blank)proxy: (blank)Security: (blank)Access Point: ATT", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Thanks for the service, is very good!", "Author": "Angel Clark", "ReviewID": "R2LKO8P80G44ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks for the service, is very good!The product buy is of good quality, y  arrived in the estimated time, I'm very happy with the service ...
