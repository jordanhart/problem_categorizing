Nice speed.Good video quality.Great Camera.The \"huh\"?These are specifically directed because this is a Docomo version:Many of the icons, system notifications and of the assorted functions are in Japanese. If you don't read Japanese, this may be a small problem. Most of the functions are not critical. Selecting a different language works for the important functions. Selecting autodial functions automatically add Japanese international calling codes to the phone number (which can have unexpected and unpleasant results I would imagine if you don't catch it in time...calling Japan...to your phone bill). Most of the icons I imagine are associated with Docomo, which is the Japanese equivalent of Google. The phone also has Google functions in parallel.The negatives:Android 4.1.2 isn't as advanced as I would have imagined it would be. Its quite similar to the V2. Doesn't seem to be a fantastic upgrade.Call sound quality...too quiet. Slightly muffled. The sound quality is slightly better on the X10, and was much better on the LT18i.Waterproof? Well...the external speaker for phone ringer and application sounds was quite good. Then, while testing out the waterproof claims of the phone. Now the sound on the external speaker is nearly non-existent. Too quiet to be heard from my pocket (which is where it should normally be). Now the external speaker is not quite useless, but close enough while its in my pocket to make the phone useless. No warranty, not that it would cover water damage anyways? So, I have a useless $1200 phone. I had to have the one that wasn't black or white and order it from Japan. I have checked the settings. THe XLoud function doesn't seem to be working. Its activated, but it doesn't change the volume of the phone anymore. For those of you who own one, I made sure the port seals were all in their proper sealed position (but the external speaker is nowhere near any of the open ports). Initially, the external sound quality was SUPERIOR. Now, its way below average.The network coverage on this phone is merely adequate. It seems to have a My Xperia X10 gets and holds signals much better. Somebody mentioned that it doesn't pick up 3G, I never tested that extensively, since my areas don't have great 3G or 4G coverage.Only comes with a 2GB MicroSD. Switched my Xperia X10's 8GB MicroSD with it. (Um...is that an upgrade then?)Uses micro Sim. You might have to upgrade your SIM...I wasn't prepared for it. I had to wait an extra week for a new SIM. I resisted my friend's recommendations to just \"cut\" the standard SIM. :)Overall, I am pissed that I am dealing with a phone that's external sound quality is now poor. If it gets better when it dries out, I'll update this review. However, I won't trust the waterproof nature of the phone again, even if it does \"come back to life\".Update: It dried out. External speaker is working fine again...Still have to ask...if its waterproof, why does it stop working?", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C15MXYS"}}
