The screen is capacitive, unlike the previous Samsung star, so it's really easy to use. The music player is great, and the phone supports multi-tasking (though it drags the performance down a bit). Perhaps my favorite feature about this phone is the WiFi. For those of you who don't have a data plan, and don't plan on getting one for the future, the WiFi is a really nice touch because it allows you to browse the internet without being forced in a 2-year contract. Most of the phone that have wifi are smartphone, which carriers are requiring a data plan with, but this phone is a feature phone. wifi is a great \"feature\" on a \"dumbphone\". The only problem I have with this phone is the annoying QWERTY keypad while texting. The keys are really small, and I frequently press the \"back\" key instead of the \"backspace\" key.  I'm getting used to it though, and it's also helpful that this phone has a feature that is similar to android's \"swype\", where you slide your finger across the keyboard to type. the internet browser is good, and the phone supports youtube videos. the quality isn't the greatest for videos that have a lot of action, but for the occasional stand-up comedian video, this phone performs sufficiently. the phone sports a micro sd card slot, so I can load all my music on the card and play it on the phone. I have at&t; in the us, and the phone started working immediately after i put the sim card in it. the batter life is above average, but it doesn't blow you away. overall, i'm very happy with this phone.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Maheswar Vayugandla", "ReviewID": "R17APLN5AE16XR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is very good. It is very light weight, look and feel is very good. I wanted a modern phone with wifi. After reading positive reviews here on Amazon, I ordered the phone and it arrived fast in 3 days. This phone worked perfect for me. All I had to do was just popup in my AT&T; SIM card and it worked right out of the box. The wifi feature is great as I don't need a data plan. Internet, email, Google Maps (It is under Games) and youtube applications worked fine after configuring wifi. But I had trouble getting facebook and twitter apps to work. It was displaying message to configure network settings. I posted the issue on a cellphone forum and I received a response which helped in fixing the issue. All you have to do is to create a fake network connection profile by going to Settings -> Connectivity -> Network -> Connections. Just enter some name (no need to enter any other data) and create. Voila, facebook and twitter started to work after this. I love the music player too. I bought 16gb micro SD card to go with this phone to store music, pictures and videos. The camera is nice too. I am so glad I purchased this phone.Update on May 16th ....After just six months of use, the battery died. I have ordered for a new battery yesterday . I was having problems with phone getting switched off all of a sudden from past 2 months. From couple of days, the battery was not even holding the charge for few hours (even if I don't use the phone for talking or texting) and now it is completely dead.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Useful Phone", "Author": "Kuba8823", "ReviewID": "R267CWD3I9BVFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased this phone knowing that all I want to do is make phone calls.

But, ours came with a German manual and we couldn't send or receive pictures via text.  So, for the manual -- go to the German Samsung site, click on Support, search for \"GT-S5260,\" click on any of the phone options, and then you'll be able to choose and English manual download.For the sending/receiving pictures via text, you have to enable MMS (multimedia sending) and pay for text messaging with your provider.  To set up MMS,  you go into Settings/Network and create a new \"Connection\".  For T-mobile, you use the specifications from www (dot) tmoatt (dot) com to set up this Connection -- go to the link for \"How to configure the Picture Messaging on a Samsung GT-S5230 (Tocco Lite).\"  Then, you go into messages on your phone, click on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen, go into messages settings, and select Multimedia Profile, and select the MMS specs that you just set up with the new Connection.  You'll also most likely have to turn on data packets - another feature in settings.

The phone arrived promptly, in its original retail package.  The phone came with a European charger, but without any converter for US outlet.  Luckily, I happened to have a converter that I was able to use to charge the phone.  When I powered it on, everything was in German.  I used Google translator (from German to English) to figure out how to navigate through the Settings menu, and was able to change the language to English.  Next, I put my T-Mobile SIM card in the phone and powered it back on.  But I kept getting the message \"Phone Freeze SIM unavailable. Contact your service provider.\"  I tried several other T-Mobile SIM cards as well as an AT&T; SIM card.  Same result.  I got fed up and called BLUETEKUSA Customer Service.  They were not very helpful.  They claimed that this was a known problem, and was reported frequently by their buyers but it was always because of the buyers' SIM cards.  They suggested that I contact T-Mobile to replace my SIM cards (even though I told them that I've tried 3 different T-Mobile SIM cards and 1 AT&T; SIM card).  I did not believe them, but there was nothing else that I could do.  I was ready to ship the phone back for return.  But since my daughter desperately needed a phone right away (her old one stopped working), I've decided to take a chance and ordered an unlock code for the phone through one of those web sites.  Cost me $30.  I provided the IMEI number, phone manufacturer and model, and voila an hour later I got an email that contained the unlock code for my phone (with instructions).  The unlock code worked like a charm; I applied the unlock code, and the phone recognized my T-Mobile card right away.  So buyers out there, please beware that the phone sold by BLUETEKUSA may not be unlocked as claimed.A few comments about the phone itself:  After 3 days of using the phone, my daughter loves it.  She said the screen is sharp, the WiFi works great, and all the functions are basic but useful.  The calls are clear.  The touchscreen is a little slow in responding, and the buttons are very small.  Camera image is sharp.  The casing for the phone is all cheap plastic (unlike her old Samsung phone which has all metal casing).  But this makes the phone much lighter than her old one.  Overall, she is happy with this replacement.  And I am happy because I don't have to start another 2-year contract with T-Mobile, or add a data plan to her phone.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It Didn't Work For Me", "Author": "Deborah", "ReviewID": "RDSKOHX698L3H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sorry to say this phone didn't work for me.

Got the same message on all three, even after a tech from the seller told me how to reset the phone.  I even called AT&T; and to my surprise, the lady I talked to said that my sim card should work in any phone.  Wish it had worked, the other features looked like it would be a fun phone to have.

It comes with some widgets, mp3 music preinstalled/ringtones,SD card slot, and on the menu you have(face book, twitter, youtube etc...). It is wifi and that is what I truly love about this phone. The set back for some folks may be the screen sensitivity and since my hands are not small, I found myself hitting other keys(I believe this would be the case with many newer cell phones).

The phone is very reasonably priced for what it can do and offer. It has good clear sound when conversing and works well as a phone. The speakerphone is understandable and has good volume control. The touch screen is very responsive, but does take some getting used to. A person is definitely not going to be a speed dialer using it but it can be mastered even with one hand, if you are patient. The screen is a viewable VGA resolution and even though small it is very readable, even with my OLD eyes.It has many great \"features\" that makes this phone a useful tool. The main feature that attacked me to this phone was the fact that it was WiFi capable. Very few feature phones had WiFi. I wanted to have a means to check my emails throughout the day when I was away from home and not need to carry a laptop all the time. (And I refuse to pay the extra expense of data fees.) Once you learn how to use these extra features effectively it can be a great device to have. The Google map App is great and I like having that to use since I do not have a GPS in my car. The camera, calendar, calculator, voice recorder and other tools are fairly intuitive and useful.Cons:Unfortunately the manual does not cover all of the feature nuances a person needs to know, so it has taken me about two months to find them on my own. The manual explains the obvious functions and then has nothing on the invisible areas that help keep your systems cleaned-up and working. The Widgets are worthless because even though they look nice, they use too much on-phone memory and I have found no way to turn them off once turned on. And you don't find that out until you are forced to shut down all Apps due to insufficient memory.Using the WiFi is great but it is at times frustrating that even though the WiFi symbol indicates a signal and you have checked the access of the device is open, you may still not have a good connection and it states \"DNS Failed\".The built-in web browser works very well but you better not browse a large data content web page. The phone will not have enough memory and force you to shut down the open Apps, including the browser.One of the biggest drawback is that you can only access the optional memory card from the computer cable link. You cannot transfer, edit, or modify any of the in-phone memory locations, especially the contacts listing. The only way to transfer contacts from an old phone were through the SIM card, and doing that looses ALL of the \"personal\" information of each contact. (SIM cards will only hold name and phone numbers.) So you end up re-entering email addresses, and etc., etc.Another drawback is the limited amount of on-phone memory available for the use of Widgets, web browser, and email. Too often I am finding myself stalled when wanting to hold more than twenty moderate sized emails on my phone, or I web browse to a site that has a lot of pictures on it. Then I see a message stating \"Not enough memory, you must close some applications\". Then it shows a screen to allow you to turn off some of the open Apps only to find it will not respond. The only thing left to do is to select the \"Close All Apps\" and then start all over. It took me quite a while to figure out why I kept getting this message when all I had open was email and all previous emails deleted. When you delete emails they are not removed from the phone memory! After much more investigating I find they are moved to a deleted file folder, which you cannot access from you email App.Installing the additional memory card does not allow you to offload that needed extra operational capacity to the memory card. Why do I need a 16GB memory card if it will not help the operational capability of the phone's features?Conclude:Now don't get me wrong, overall this is a great phone. I know you are saying \"WHAT?\". Yes it is. It has a lot of nice features and when they work, they work well. The problem is that it was not very well thought out for use of multiple features at one time. Allowing the expansion memory card to take some of that capability would have been the right idea.So I have had to learn to make-do with what I can use of the features (one-at-a-time and hope you do not find a big loaded website).The instruction booklet is terribly insufficient on how to [continue] using the features effectively. It does not explain how to completely erase deleted emails. It does not tell you where to find them to erase them. There are just so many other things you need to know to keep the \"Features\" working for you. I still have not found how to access a draft email I created so I can send it to someone, even though I can look in memory and see it is still there.

Perhaps a Little Overpriced.", "Author": "Tech Nutz \"Ontario\"", "ReviewID": "R1U6GJKJQ537KZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SAMSUNG STAR II GT-S5260I purchased this touch screen `phone, to replace my antique Motorola flip phone.  It's not a \"smart\" phone, but rather what's known as a \"feature\" phone.  This product was first introduced by Samsung onto the European market in early 2011, so it's not the newest technology.  I've had it for about a week, and thought I'd pass on some quick first impressions of a senior's initial step towards the world of \"smart\" phones.- Capacitive touch screen.  Seems preferable to a resistive touch screen.- After inserting the SIM card, quickly locked onto my Canadian cellular provider, with decent reception.- Sound quality during a call is quite good.- As mentioned in other reviews, the on screen keyboard has small letters, difficult but not impossible.  The number pad for dialing a `phone number seems a little more manageable.- Rotating the `phone 90 degrees will bring up the qwerty keyboard.  But with the same small letters.- Could not find this model on Samsung North America web site.  Had to go to Samsung U.K. web site to download software.  I also downloaded the operating manual as it's much easier to read on the P.C. rather than the miniature product manual included with the phone.- Downloaded Samsung KIES software to my IMAC, but the computer and/or software would not recognize this `phone model. Fortunately I still had my \"old\" Windows P. C. and was able to use it with KIES software to update the `phone's firmware to the latest version and to download music.- Some screen functions seem to require a heavy touch.  For example to confirm power off I feel like I'm pushing on the screen instead of just a light tap.- The wall charger supplied is a European model with an adapter plug to convert to North American electrical receptacles.  Pretty cheap looking.  I've ordered a new one.- Some reviewers mentioned that their 'phone came with a foreign language instruction manual and/or on screen displays in Italian or Spanish.  No problem with that.  Both the 'phone and the manual were in English.I have not tried connecting to the internet yet.  In my opinion this `phone is too small to comfortably send/receive E-mail or read web pages.  I prefer my tablet for that.  Bottom line it does the two things that I wanted well. I can make and receive telephone calls, and upload my favourite music so I can leave my MP3 player at home when I travel.
