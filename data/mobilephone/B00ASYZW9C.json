{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So much better than expected (and a great T-Mobile phone!)", "Author": "Tariq Gibran Hamid", "ReviewID": "R36XDVKIXSCUUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a pseudo inexpensive replacement for a broken Nexus 4.  Frankly, I wasn't really expecting much but I actually prefer this over the fragile (screen) Nexus 4.  Yes, it is a two core vs four core processor but in normal use, I don't really experience much difference.  All of these phones have gotten so powerful that at this point, anything from the past year or so has more than enough speed/ power for most users imo.Anyway, a few things I really like on this phone over the Nexus 4 are:1) Much more ergonomic in use as far as comfort when handling and holding.  The curved, textured back of the Xperia TX is the main reason.  The Nexus 4, like so many other newer phones, is a flat slab and, because of it's rear glass surface, is also very slippery to handle2) Much better built in camera with a dedicated physical shutter button on the side of the phone.3) Removable back with removable battery (for easy replacement) and a micro SD card slot.  I currently have a 64GB card in mine.  I really despise this current trend of disposable phones with non removable batteries and full reliance on data/ info from the cloud.  It's nice to have additional on board storage for music, movies, maps, photos and so forth.4) Sony's skin/ interface.  My wife owns a Samsung Galaxy S3 and even though I'm really knowledgeable about all things Android, I'm absolutely lost when she hands me her phone.  The interface on Samsung's is really busy and non intuitive imo.  She loves it so perhaps it's just something one gets used to.  The Sony interface does not stray too far from basic android and where it does, I find it an improvement.  Very intuitive.  In fact, I often root every phone I have owned in order to run a better, more featured custom rom but the Sony rom is so nice, I really did not find it as necessary.  Nova Launcher is all it really needs for me to be happy.5) Fairly simple to root out of the box.  I did end up rooting but really the only thing I did this for was to be able to install Titanium Backup.  There is also a very good sound mod (Acid sound mod) which dramatically improves sound (adds Beats audio and so on) and also a Cyber-shot mod app that adds quality and features to the built in camera.  These are not really essential imo but do add to the user experience.In my research on this phone, I came across a few points I will mention here.  First, battery life.  I don't find it terrible but it's not great either.  I think one can probably easily expect a days use out of the phone.  Second, screen quality.  There were apparently two screens offered at one time.  I have the later one which is supposedly worse than the first.  Anyway, I find it great myself.  It does suffer from a narrow viewing angle/ washes out at extreme angles (it's not an IPS panel) but viewed normally from the front, it looks terrific.So, if you are on T-Mobile and are looking for a very nice phone at a decent price, look no further!", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "tobybear", "ReviewID": "RI3NLVEF7623P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HSPDA+ is fast on T-Mobile.

If you're looking for a well-made phone, I'd definitely advise looking into the TX as a possible contender. The pictures the phone takes are of good quality to my eye.

This was my second sony xperia t and both had similar issues... the screen turns off but at least once a day I wouldnt be able to turn the screen on again. Even with the battery partly charged. Shame shame because I loved the phone and its other features.  Great camera.  Skype worked fabulously.  Prety ok battery life. Problem could have been worse if I had the Xperia without a removable battery to be able to restart the phone but either way... Ive been reading on forums that this is a pretty common issue with Sony phones. Shame on them for not fixing this problem and continuing to sell this expensive product at its original price. Returned the phone and for 60 euro more got the samsung s3 which is a really amazing telephone and piece of technology. Would not recommend the xperia t until this problem is fixed.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jeffrey H.", "ReviewID": "RDZG0S07OTOYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this one for my wife. I was well impressed with the quality of the construction, speed, and display. The camera is good and my wife gets good quality photos most of the time. We've had a few occasions where the picture washed out due to poor lighting conditions. But, I was buying a phone and not a camera. However, my wife seems to use it more as a TV. The display was a little small for my taste, but fantastic picture. But I was so impressed with this Sony phone, that I bought the monster sized Xperia Z Ultra.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "exc", "Author": "LEONARDO", "ReviewID": "R2CUHMW628SGMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love it, excelent cel phone, camera 13 megas pixeles, 1 gb ram, it runs like a horse, android jelly bean, excelente phone , love it. shipping fast, low price", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone but I'm not entirely sure", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R2CLEAWDZ67OG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sometimes turns off by itself, I have to remove the housing and remove the battery to turn it back on, I dont know what happens ??Greats,EDUARDO C.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "beyond expectation", "Author": "gilbert rodrigues", "ReviewID": "R1BC704V5T6EKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this product is amezing the design is very beautiful buy this product because this one is more tougher than samsung", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Firmin", "ReviewID": "R2J27YNG98D51L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is freakin awesome.
