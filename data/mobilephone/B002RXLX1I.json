{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally An Affordable GSM Phone From Nokia That's Not Ugly", "Author": "Caramalizer", "ReviewID": "R2WL02EELYQTVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia 2700 is a basic GSM phone with next-generation Nokia styling--sleeker, more sophisticated, and no longer reminiscent of LEGO. For people upgrading from an older phone, the screen is gorgeous, displaying information large and clear with the help of tasteful wallpaper and themes. The classic user interface and shortcuts are carried forward from past Nokias I have owned, and it has been pretty easy for me to navigate.Of course economics dictate that a phone this affordable comes with trade-offs. For starters, the one-piece back that gives access to the battery and SIM card is about as easy to open as a secret passageway. Apart from vague instructions on exactly where to press, the phone's all-plastic construction belies the force required to open it. The SIM slot does not pivot up like my previous Nokia, so inserting and removing cards is a pain. For people staying with the same carrier, this is a one-time inconvenience and not an issue. But given that this is an inexpensive quad-band phone (no US carrier uses all 4 bands), I'm thinking most buyers are going to want to swap the SIM for a local card in another continent. To be fair this phone is actually not sold or supported by Nokia USA, so was not intended for this market. One thing I am still trying to get used to is the screen going completely blank when the backlight times out. I've not found a way to customize how many seconds it stays on, but the printed manual--which states it is an abridged version that does not cover all features--has not helped. The 2MP camera is barebones, and I'm going to take the word of an outspoken European reviewer on YouTube that the video quality is pretty atrocious.Nokia allows the 2700 to operate even without a SIM card inserted. This could be useful, especially when I want to move my SIM to another phone and possess only one card. I personally do not plan to use the built-in instant messenger, web browser, media player, micro USB port (requires cable purchase and is not compatible with Mac OS), download apps, or upgrade the capacity of the micro SD card (although latter is a nice feature). I am not even sure if these 'classic' capabilities can satisfy a user who really wants a smartphone but can only afford the 2700. Battery life is OK with a recharge required every 3 days if used sparingly and left on 24/7. I'm not sure if riding the subway 1-1/2 hrs a day causes the phone to hunt for a signal and drain the battery faster.At the end of the day, this is a smart looking phone at a very reasonable price. For someone like me who uses a phone mainly as a phone, and wants it to be a 'candy bar' type that is not ugly, it fits my bill perfectly. T-Mobile works on it right out of the box, and I have yet to experience any reception problems in and around New York City. Well done Nokia. 4.5 stars.THREE MONTH UPDATE:It turns out the back cover is easier to remove the 2nd and subsequent times, and it's actually not too hard to swop SIM cards. As noted in the comments, Nokia sells the 2730--a similar model for the US market.So far, I have been pleased with reception and sound quality.  No doubt about it, the battery lasts a couple of days longer--4 days in Asia and Europe vs. 2-3 days in NYC, despite more talking and texting overseas. I can't figure out why. Signal strength? Charging voltage? Some frequency bands draw more power?Because it comes with a non-US power supply with round prongs, a cheap adapter was provided by the seller. When I plug it into the wall, the whole assembly droops and charges for only a little while before the connection is broken. I have taken to recharging from a power strip on the floor so the prongs point downward, but it's still a balancing act. I may have to bite the bullet and buy a US charger from Nokia.The membrane keypad is low profile enough that I no longer lock the keys before putting it in my pants pocket. People with longer finger nails may leave permanent dents in the membrane surface. This, and the fact that the keys are close together, means it is not suited to heavy text messaging. The rounded square navigation ring works well for me.I'm still very happy with my 2700. I know the profit margin is way better on smart phones, but Nokia, please keep offering these well-designed classic phones for the rest of us.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good, affordable unlocked \"world\" phone", "Author": "R L", "ReviewID": "RZ9TJ3OSUECGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sometimes the signal seems weak on this phone for AT&T; in San Francisco.  My old Nokia seemed to have stronger signal.  But overall, I think it's a very good unlocked, world phone for the price.  Easy to use with a nice, clear graphic interface.  I'm looking forward to trying it while traveling abroad and using foreign SIM cards.The phone I received was slightly different that the product photo.  My phone has some Chinese-looking characters on some buttons of the keypad.  But it's subtle and looks ok to me.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone for International travel", "Author": "SaphronSpice", "ReviewID": "R1P07HWWUHXYVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this phone for travel outside of the USA.  It worked perfectly for us.  All we needed were SIM cards for the countries we traveled to and we were set.  We saved ourselves from paying international phone rates within the countries we visited.  Our families could call us from the USA by SKYPE or other methods and we were easily available to them.  This phone will be with us  for future travel as well.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have had it for some 2 years, outstanding value!!", "Author": "KoKy_the_rock_maniac", "ReviewID": "R22AG12F8I04GU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This mobile phone was exactly what I needed!I'm currently not into some fancy touch-screen Androids, that pretend to take over some functions of your home computer or laptop.I'm better off using a real computer for my comfortable browsing, facebook and email stuff.1) The first thing that I demand from my mobile phone is reliability. That it doesn't let me down in a crucial moment.Therefore, the battery is No.1. condition, for me. Nokia 2700 classic has extremely good original battery (BL-5C), that will rarely let you down even if it is on the red light. It still gives you a plenty of time to use your mobile, until you recharge it again.Not the case with chinese copies of BL-5C from eBay. They last much shorter, and when the red light comes, your mobile is shut down in very near future. Still I carry one of these in my wallet, just as a backup.I'd say with original battery, 2700 will hold up to 3-4 days of regular use, or ~2 days when listening heavy to music and using WAP internet.2) the second thing important to me is the music player. I always wanted to have a good mp3 player built-in my mobile, so I don't go through a hassle of having a separate device, with it own cables; a hassle of forgetting to take my mp3 player with me.....no problem any more! this mp3 plyer inside 2700 is a very good one. Probably not the best, but I'm deeply satisfied... and I'm a rock musician, who plays electric guitar. I always set my EQ settings on \"Pop\", which imho sounds the best in most of the cases. Especially for rock/pop/metal.Provided headphones are decent too, I'm pleased with them. They have a solid bass response, and good headroom overall, but you can still hear your environment. Built-in microphone is very good, you can talk \"hands-free\" without a need to crank your chin towards your collar.The headphone jack in 2700 is regular 3.5mm, which is cool, and you can use tons of other headphones with it.I haven't tried WH-701 headphones for Nokia yet, they have even more options and in-ear extensions.Oh, by the way, the loudspeaker on the back of the phone is very good. If you play some music (without heavy bass lines like techno music) through it, you will be really pleased. If you listen to it in your bathroom or car, sometimes you have a feeling that much bigger radio-device is playing. It handles treble and middle tones exceptionaly good, but - of course - not the bass ones, since it's too small.3) WAP internet is pretty good, for ocassional use. I use newest Opera with it, and works like charm. Facebook application sucks on this mobile, but Opera is really really good. I use my mobile phone internet mainly for ocassional wikipedia and google searches, for checking email and facebook, and reading some news-portals. But like I said before, it's not meant to replace your computer, not even close. But it's still decent and does its purpose.4) Photo camera is decent, too. If there's a plenty of light, you can shoot some really beautiful pictures with it. Much more nicer than with my previous, and more expensive, Nokia for business people (I forgot the model, E-something..). The resolution is 1600x1200. No flashlight. Tip: if you remove your back cover of 2700 before taking a shot, the resulting pic will be much more clearer and crisper. In mountains it can take some very nice landscape shots. Video mod is a complete garbage, and I never use it. It's just no good. I guess you can't have all, can you?5) Built-in radio is good. Voice recorder too. Calendar is very simple and intuitive, and the phone also has notes, calculator, to-do list, countdown times, stopwatch. BlueTooth connection. Everything that you need, in one place. At least to me.6) This mobile is very simple and beautiful looking, it somehow reminds me of iPhone by its looks. You won't be ashamed putting it on a table during a coffee time with your friends, for sure.I upgraded mine 2700 with 8Gb memory card, and now have a tons of mp3 music on it. I just copy the music to my phone, as to a simple memory stick. Much more simpler than having all the hassle with, let's say, iPhones' iTunes.Now, at the end, some cons:- video mode is not good, it records crappy clips - both soundwise and picturewise- the silver metal finish on the edges of the mobile's mask can peel off pretty quickly, especially if your mobile frequently drops down.- there is no option to regulate contrast and lightness of the LCD screen. This is, in my opinion, the largest con of all. That's why I always keep it at \"Dark\" theme - it has the best light/contrast ratio, and doesn't fatique your eyes. And it gives your 2700 that \"iPod\"-esque look.- Maps function is useless, since 2700 does not have GPS support. If that's important to you, you can buy its upgraded version Nokia 2710 Navigator edition, whish has GPS and specific support for the Maps function.Hope you liked my review. My only motivation to write it down was because I'm very happy user of 2700. One of the best gadgets that I've ever owned, was not expensive, and still serves me very well.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good cell phone", "Author": "Ronald", "ReviewID": "RXIZK7CSPTMP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I liked about this website is that when I paid for the shipping to happen in 3-5 days it actually was shipped the following day and arrived just two days later, that really left me satisfied.
