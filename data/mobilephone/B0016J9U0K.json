However, when it arrived, it contained a European charger. The scary part was that the Motorola sticker on the box actually stated \"euro simple pkg\". You'd think that this would have caught someone's attention.In addition, after working with both the phone specialists (plural) and customer support, Amazon was reluctant to return my money for these phones. Their site states that cell phones are only eligible for replacement and a refund option is not provided. The phone specialists apologized and emailed me a return RMA and UPS sticker. I promptly returned the phones, both the original and the replacement. I received email confirmation of receipt of both returns. Both emails, however, stated that no monies would be refunded due to replacements sent. There was no second replacement/third phone involved. They now have the phones and were stating it would be 3 to 4 weeks for the refund to be researched. Finally, after contacting a supervisor, my refund was processed.On the upside, I placed another order for the silver razr v3 and it was the correct version. It arrived promptly and worked great out of the box.Word to the wise!", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Phone not US version, charger is European", "Author": "Randall F.

The phone arrived and I set it up somewhat easily, that is, after I guessed how to go through the menus and change the language from Italian to English.After two months of use, the phone started acting up and cutting off when carried.  I contacted the vendor, UnlockedCellPhoneKings, to inquire about replacement and was told that they only cover the phone warranty for thirty days.  The balance of the year is Motorola.  When I see a 1 year warranty in the main sales title, I thought it was from the vendor.  Oops!Anyway, upon further inspection, I was able to put pieces of paper between the SIM and the backstrap holding the SIM to the contacts and it stopped the turn off failures I was experiencing.

It's even cheaper and it came with a charger that works in the U.S. and SE Asia.Reading the reviews makes it obvious that there ARE no more NEW V3s anywhere; they're all gone! If you're not used to the Motorola V3, there is no reason to consider this item.P.S. The sole reason that my new AT&T; V3 died after only one year is absolutely because of this junky holster which dropped my phone on the pavement whenever I got out of my car. I couldn't always remember to take it off.UPDATE: I am overseas now and it worked, but it broke the first time I dropped it!
