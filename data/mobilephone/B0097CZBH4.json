It was expensive back then.  So, in comparison, today's prices really are not that bad.  So my thoughts on the iPhone 5 are:1) Retina display is awesome.  Everything looks more defined and sharper.  It is like wearing glasses for the first time!  There is much color and clarity out there... or should I say, in those digital images and videos...  needless to say, the camera as well captures great images.2) Call quality is excellent, no issues at all.  I also like the new earbuds better.  They fit my ears better and call signal is very good.  By the way, the packaging of the earphones was A+++.3) Build - same as all previous iPhones, maybe a tad sturdier.  I dropped my phone last night when I got off my car, so it now has a skid mark one of the aluminum corners - boy am I happy it was just a ragged little nick on the outer antenna (corner).  The glass did not shatter or crack.  The aluminum back wasn't scratched.  Of course the way it fell may have mattered, but still, a drop on our concrete garage floor is a drop.  The experience speaks well of Apple.4) Size and shape - this is where I took out a star.  The increased screen size looks good.  But a longer, thinner, \"uniform-flatness\" shape - although indeed a great form factor visually - does not translate into a comfortable hold.  I feel like I am holding on to only the right and left side of the phone, almost daintily (like holding a small teacup with your little pinky upturned).  My thumb on one side, and my pointer and third finger on the other.  The back does not even touch my palm.  I am not sure how others hold their phones, but I feel a little awkward with this one.  I am tempted to but a bulky case (like some ugly Otterbox or one with extended battery) but then it wouldn't look as trendy.So I leave it at that.  I love my phone and I use it a lot, mostly for communication purposes, and not for entertainment.  But I am still adjusting to how I am supposed to hold this neat little thing comfortably.  iPhone 4's shape was better, in my opinion, but everything else about the 5 is better than 4 or 4S.To each his own!

The GSM model is designed to support LTE in Asia (including Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea). This GSM iPhone will also work on LTE in Australia, Germany, and the UK on bands 1, 3, and 5.The CDMA version of model A1429 works on Sprint's and Verizon's LTE networks in the US, along with the KDDI network in Japan on bands 1, 3, 5, 13, and 25. The CDMA version also supports GSM bands, making the CDMA iPhone 5 compatible with GSM networks. However, the CDMA A1429 will not support LTE on GSM networks in the US.Full specs from Apple:GSM model A1428: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 4 and 17)CDMA model A1429: CDMA EV-DO Rev.

If like me you have owned and continue to own previous versions of iPhones, iPods and iPads, and have several chargers, Docks, car connectors and car chargers etc then this new design is really frustrating.The real reason that Apple changed the design is surely so that everybody has to go out and buy outrageously overpriced adaptors or new leads. I have read that Apple pays less than $0.6 for these leads, yet charges it's customers \u00a325.Apple have also put a microchip in their leads that the iPhone is set to recognise, without which they are rejected by the iPhone in order to prevent third party manufacturers from producing leads that work properly, hence all the terrible reviews for these 3rd party products.It's just another of Apple's underhand money making exercises at the customers considerable inconvenience and expense.It's taller than the iPhone 4s. Some may like this, but I don't. The 4s sits comfortably in your hand and my thumb can reach the top of the screen on the 4s without having to change the position in my hand. I have bigger than average hands too.It is faster than the 4s, only a little, but it is faster. But this is the only improvement in my eyes.Battery life is poor, another sacrifice made to the god of (pointless) thinness. It feels cheaper and flimsier than the 4s too.Maps are a mess. Google maps was so much better on the 4 and 4s.Instead of this ridiculous connector fiasco, why couldn't we have kept the old and perfectly good connector and had wireless charging too? The technology is there, and would be a great improvement over the current system.A more robust design would be nice so that they didn't have to live in cases, and a dust and moisture resistant design would be very welcome.iCloud is fantastic, and so I can't imagine changing phones to another manufacturer until someone else comes out with something at least as good as iCloud.But when they do, I'll be more than happy to switch allegiance, despite twenty years as a loyal Apple customer.Apple can only push their customers so far, and I'm becoming more and more fed up with the way Apple is treating it's customers with regard to their infuriating thinness campaign with their phones, iPads, MacBook Pros and iMacs, at the expense of functionality and in a blatant attempt to corner the market and limit customers buying choices in terms of leads, adaptors, connections, music purchasing, app purchasing etc, as are many many other people.Apple is a great brand and has produced many fantastic products, but the iPhone 5 is not the leap ahead from the 4s that customers had hoped for, and this coupled with frustration and expense incurred by the connector design and the thinness over battery life and durability make it for me a 2 star product.If you own the 4s I'd suggest hanging on to it and waiting until Autumn for the next hopefully much improved iPhone, or Samsung, or whoever the Apple slayer will be.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "All accessories non-original and the phone is not good condition some time the signal is dose not works..", "Author": "Mohammed Alrageeb", "ReviewID": "RYQJUQTPAXLLJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All accessories non-original and the phone is not good condition some time the signal is dose not works and the WARRANTY is not apple care ..", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I HATE THIS SELLER", "Author": "Giovanni Capasso", "ReviewID": "R9PA4UKLU3XXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THE WORST BUY IN ALL HISTORY OF MY LIFE...

I told them it was a reception issue, not a phone issue--my iPhone worked fine elsewhere. T-Mobile insisted. I swapped out the phone for the one they send, and I still had lousy reception in my house, just as I told them I would.When T-Mobile got my phone back, they charged me $250 for \"liquid-damage.\" The iPhone has built-in gizmos that supposedly detect liquid damage, like if you drop your phone in the toilet. This one week old phone had never gotten wet, and it worked fine. I learned from a little online research that these liquid damage indicators DO NOT WORK correctly--they often give false positive readings, so much so that Apple just agreed to pay $53 million in a class action lawsuit. Of course, as lawsuits go, this one had a cutoff date, and my case is too late for it. But Wired Magazine and others have demonstrated that Apple has NOT solved the problem and continues to peddle these bogus, non-functioning indicators. And customers like me continue to get screwed. So--buy one of these things at your own risk.The sad thing is that Apple used to position themselves as the scrappy \"outsider\" company, the anti-corporation, anti-Big Brother--and now, they have turned into Exxon Mobile, or British Petroleum--remember the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?

The iPhone 5 is longer, sleeker, has a turn-by-turn navigation, and is faster then the old iPhones. This product is supposed to be an all around better quality product that zips through the market with its speed and overall appearance. Most users think that Apple has outdone themselves this time.  The quality of the retina display makes watching videos more superior  then before.  From the alarm application, to sending e-mails, playing games, and checking your bank account. This product can do more than you can even imagine, with the new IOS7 update, it can also do virtually everything the 5s and 5c can do, so I say save your money and just get the 5.  There are however some flaws to this product, for some of the devices the lock button begins to stop working. There have also been complaints with the IOS7 about the apps looking like toys, as well as the phone restarting. However, If you take the iPhone into Apple with any of these complaints they will gladly replace your iPhone, or do everything they can to fix the problem.  Compared to the Android and the Samsung the screen is a little smaller, but with these phones side-by-side users say that the iPhone 5 is clearer, easier to zoom in and read text, and overall a good size to hold in one hand. Overall the iPhone 5 solves all the problems users had about old iPhones and other phones on the market. It has the perfect combination of stealth, light weight, user friendly applications, and overall a good product. The only downside seems to be the poor battery life, and the occasional device disfunction.

I would stick with the iPhone and will probably sell my GS4 when the next iPhone comes out.### Details:For each topic above, I have included details for each:# GS4 Pros:Better Screen* The larger screen really is wonderful to watch and use* GS4 makes TVs and you can tell. The blacks are blacker, the colors more vibrant than I had on the iPhone 5.* People keep saying wow to the screen when they see it. Or they ask me to dim it.* Games are amazing on it due to the size and colors.Better Text Messaging* If you don't hit send on a message, that contact shows *draft*. I have MANY times had unsent messages in my iPhone I was unaware of.* Swype is a game changer. I used to want to throw my iPhone into a wall when typing, which I do a LOT. Swype allows me to type data in MUCH faster. Guinness World Record faster. And Swype FIXES capitalization for you!! I use this constantly! And it does select all, copy, cut, paste as well with a single keystroke. Fantastic.* The GS4 has text templates pre-populated with a message. I use this a LOT. iPhone doesn't have it.* On the iPhone if you have a single unread text, it automatically opens it. Sometimes, you go to text someone you were just texting, but the phone switches you to the unread text and you don't notice and BAM you text the wrong person. I've done that LOTS. Not so with the GS4.* If you have more than one number or an email and a number, the iPhone just says the contact's name at the top. You have to click it to see what is in blue to know where the message is going to go. The GS4 shows the number or email at the top with the name.* It is easier to place a call from a text. Icon always visible at the top.* If you are doing an iMessage you do not get a character count even if you have the count setting on. Also it doesn't show till you hit 160 characters. The GS4 count is always present.* You can change the font size of a text by hitting volume up/down.Higher Wow Factor* Nobody ever says \"wow, you have an iPhone!\" to me. But in three weeks at least a dozen people have said wow to this phone for various different reasons. And that feels nice.Great Back Button* Still missing from the iPhone architecture are a menu button and a back button. Always in the same place. Makes for much easier navigation than on the iPhone.Easy to add free custom ringtones* No need to buy ringtones. Add your own tracks and edit them smaller.Videos in Play Store* The play store allows app sellers to include a video of the app. This is AWESOME as you can really get a feel for the app without installing it first. On the iPhone installing is always a gamble.* Set a custom font for everythingI set the font to a comical one and it is EVERYWHERE. I love it.# GS4 Cons:Horrible NotificationsNotifications are how I keep up to date with EVERYTHING. The iPhone sorts them by app instead of by time and maxes out at five in the notification center. But this is STILL better than the GS4's approach. Example: If I am showering and hear my iPhone, I peek out of the curtain and there on the lock screen is the latest notification. If I click the button I can see all of them on the lock screen and get the gist as to if I need to dry off and respond or wait till later. With the GS4, they appear at the tippy top (like they do on the iPhone when turned on, not in lock mode). They go by very quickly so by the time you peek out, they are long gone. And YOU CAN'T CLICK ON THEM to read the details!!! I thought for sure Air Gestures would let me preview them without touching the phone. Nope. Further, with the iPhone I can get a ton of details without opening the apps. With the GS4, I constantly have to dig into an app to get the level of information I really need. That's a whole LOT of touching, and takes a lot longer to do. iPhone notifications are far far easier. And faster and more accurate. I used to hear my laptop and my iPhone chime together whenever I got a fb alert. The GS4 chimes when I don't need it to, doesn't when I do need it to, and that little blue light is always flashing when nothing important has changed...Won't Sync Outlook MemosSamsung tech support is AWFUL. On hold three hours. Clueless reps who are trained to say \"I'm sorry to hear that\" 20 times in a call, then not actually fix anything.  Their free outlook sync app, Kies says it does memos in the help, but the tool is missing that feature. They say it is Verizon's fault, but it is their own software that is missing the feature. And the old software didn't have it, so this is most likely a regression error (it went away again by accident). Most of you probably don't care about this one, buy I have over 500 memos I use all the time and need them on my phone. They are my memory.Visual Voicemail NOT FREEOn the iPhone you have all your voicemails as little files. You can pause, rewind, delete, recover etc. The GS4 requires me to CALL MY VOICEMAIL!? This is dinosaur archaic. Hit 3 to delete this message??? No slider bar... c'mon. On the GS4 voicemail window, I can opt to pay $3 PER MONTH to get visual voicemail from Verizon. Disgusting. Give me back my iPhone.No Successful Air GesturesThe commercials are all about the air gestures. Showing people with dirty hands who take care of business anyway. This hasn't worked ONCE yet for me. Many of the air gestures and air views are turned off by default. When you finally get them all on, they still fail to work. And even if they work as designed, which so far they haven't, I *expected* that if I got a text, I could read it without touching the phone. Negative. Even when working. You can preview one once you are in the Text App, but getting to it requires much screen touching!!! Defeats the whole purpose. I call this absolute false advertising compared to how the commercials make it seem.Multiple Restarts RequiredEvery day, my sound goes out. You can set silent, vibrate or sound on from the power button. My sound goes out and the button does not change it. I use the power button to select \"restart\" and the sound works again. Ok, maybe not every day, but at least twice a week.Clumsier App SwitchingI can switch back and forth between two apps on the iPhone by double clicking the home button and the last app is always the first spot. The GS4 requires a long press and it is the last app is actual the second one up from the bottom. This takes a bit longer for each step than on the iPhone. Just a minor annoyance.No Silent Text Tone Per ContactWhen Amazon or my bank send a text alert, I set those contacts to silent so they didn't disturb me. They still alert me, but quietly. Real people honk with happiness. Oddly, you can't do this on the GS4! Nor can I create a silent tone to add myself! So I had to find the quietest tone I could for these. Lame. Why can you so easily customize ringtones, including silent, but not text tones?Awkward Power Button PositionThe power button is directly opposite the volume buttons. And volume overrules power if you hit them both. I rarely change volume on my phone, but always hit power. And nothing happens because it is quite awkward to hit it without hitting the opposite side volume buttons. Especially one handed.More Accidental Screen TouchesThe screen size is wonderful, but I find myself activating it by accident ALL the time when trying to use it one handed. Over and over. iPhone is definitely one hand friendlier.Too Many App StoresI have like seven app stores on my phone instead of a single one on the iPhone. Which should I use? Why have so many?? Playstore, Amazon Store (and they have like four different kinds), Samsung (and they have multiple too)... Just too much. I created an appstore folder and there are 10 icons in it.# Other:Camera is great on bothThe GS4 seems to be better, but actually I think they are very similar but the GS4 screen is so great they look better until you put them on the same device. The v has amazing editing onboard, but I don't use that and the iPhone will have similar ones onboad in a couple of weeks. Oddly, the GS4 will shoot one randomly blurry shot about once in five to ten shots! I am not touching any settings, it just comes out very blurry. It happens enough that I noticed the pattern and I've never seen that on my iPhone.Neither allows a ringtone per groupI like creating groups with one tone. Besties. Lovers. People to avoid. Etc. I hear the tone and I know if I should run to or away from my phone without even looking at it. My Palm phone did this. Too bad none of these phones do.Neither phone flips screen upside downOddly the iPad does! Why did they not allow that on the iPhone. Why does it matter? GPS or Pandora in your car cup holder while plugged in. I had one iPhone GPS app that DID flip 180. I loved it. Plug in phone, put upside down in cup holder, map flips over and you are good to go.SummaryThe GS4 has lots of great pros, but if I can't fix say the first three to five of the cons above, I'll be heading back to my iPhone when the next model comes out.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent seller", "Author": "Daniela Torres", "ReviewID": "R2VFCA8OHUC2LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No problems at all with the seller.

It wasn't a drastic switch at all, it's the same phone through and through, but there are some nice improvements Apple and Verizon made.The 4G LTE network is amazingly fast in comparison to the old 3G network.  However, upgrading to the 5 forfeits your unlimited data.  This is my biggest qualm, because now I'm always searching for WiFi so I don't exceed my 2 gigabytes a month.  It hasn't been a huge problem, it's just annoying.Second, the screen is bigger.  I didn't think this would be a huge improvement but after using the 5 for a few months now and looking at someone's iPhone 4 screen, I can't believe I ever used it and didn't have an issue with the screen size.  The screen has an incredible resolution and makes all pictures and apps look awesome.The speed of the phone itself is a big improvement.  All screens switch faster and everything feels like it's processed faster.Overall, I love this phone, it was a great buy, but man, it sure is over priced.

Some love it, some think it makes it feel cheap. I carry my phone when I go biking, walking, or running, so I for one welcome the new design. I think the favorite thing for me about the new screen is that it can display an extra row of icons, which means your folders can fit more, and you can have more on one screen. I like to keep everything fitting on one page right there for me to access. The screen is brighter, and color saturation is noticeably better, blacks are blacker, colors are more rich. The phone has LTE which means it will connect to networks faster, and it has 3 microphones, and noise canceling for better audio. The new earbuds are improved (mostly in design, not sound quality) I do wish it came in more colors, but black and white are essential choices, and will do. Hopefully they will bring out more choices, at least Red and Silver.OS/Interface:This is the iOS you know and love. Fundamentally the same, but with new features (Siri, Panoramic Photos, Facetime over 3G) Some people complain that it hasn't changed enough since the first iPhone. It's essentially quite simple, which is the aesthetic that defines Apple. How much has OSX changed in the past 7 years? Not much either. If one wanted to change the style of the icons and fonts, they do have the option to jailbreak. What I like about iOS is that there's only as many menus as there needs to be. With Android you will see redundant menus, and see settings more than once in several menus. Also I was peeved by the back button and the way it serves a different purpose depending on the context. Will pressing it take you back to the apps main menu? Or will it close the app? I dont know! Press it and find out! The fact that they made the iPhone work fundamentally with just the one home button is a feat of itself. Widgets are cool to have, but I always ended up disabling them to conserve battery life and cut down cpu/ram usage. The notification menu, and icon badges suffice for quick indications.Apps:While both Android and iOS have far more apps than any human could sample in a lifetime, what matters most is quality, not quantity. iPhone has all of the best apps at its disposal, many of which do not exist on Android. Games like Infinity Blade II, SF Volt, Chinatown Wars, Fairway Solitaire, music apps like Animoog, DM1, iKaossilator, and Rebirth, and essential apps like iTunes U, Pages, and iMovie. When I switched to Android, I found that there were a lot of great apps I missed that were not on Google Play store. Since i've switched back to iPhone 5, I did not notice any key apps that are on Android but not on iOS.Performance:The first thing I noticed on this new model is how snappy everything is. Tasks are executed fast. Launching apps, pages loading, switching through menus, it does it in a breeze. iOS runs smoothly because it's coded in C, while Android is coded in Java, which has a lot of inefficiencies. I've heard people complain of laggy performance even on the new S4. I believe the overhead of Android's coding is creating a bottleneck, which is why even with a quad core snapdragon, you can still have performance issues. Software is just as important, if not more important, than the hardware. My SamsUniversal Content/Sharing:I have an iPad, and iMac. If I play a game of Vice City on my iPad, I can continue on the same save on my iPhone when I leave my house. If I made a note with some important info on my iMac, i'll have it on my iPad to refer to, no 3rd party apps needed. If I purchase a universal game, I get it on my phone and tablet. If I am having a text conversation with a friend on my iPhone, I can continue on any other device and see all previous messages. Photos and videos are shared among all the devices as well. I also like that I can facetime with all my friends and family who have an iOS device. When I had an Android phone, I couldn't get everyone to create Skype accounts and get the app.Reliability/Warranty:The iPhone has been smooth sailing. With the two Android phones, I had a handful of issues. The phone would often freeze, and I would have to restart. Icons would disappear. Keyboard input lagged. Screen brightness would adjust itself, even though auto brightness was shut off. The only thing i've experienced is the occasional app crashing, which is often the coding of the app itself, not necessarily an iPhone issue.I like knowing that if I have an issue with the phone, I can go to my local Apple store, and they will either fix it, or replace it with a new one there on the spot. With other manufacturers, they either contract their repairs to a 3rd party business, or they require you to go through the RMA process, ship the phone to them, which can take weeks. If you have an issue that can be resolved over the phone, you will be surprised when you call Apple support and have your call answered by a human being, who's a native english speaker from the United States.Other:Being a musician, I like that you have the ability to plug in an instrument (guitar, piano, bass) and use recording, modeling, and effects apps, this opens you up to a whole world of music production. One of the deal breakers with Android is that you can't connect a music instrument due to the latency inherent in the software (maybe this will be resolved in the future). This means apps like GarageBand, Ampkit, Amplitube, JamUP, Nano Studio, are not possible on Android.I also like the aluminum body, and the distinction that it's currently the only phone that's not plastic. The HTC One claims to, but it's actually an overlay, fused with plastic. Another thing I appreciate is the lack of bloatware. iPhones come with a higher percentage of free space than Android phones, and considering that some of the new Android phones don't have SD card slots, it's significant. Some of them even have 7GB of used space out of the box.  Also, Apple products have the highest resale value of any brand. If you do end up deciding to sell your phone in the future, you will get more for it.Drawbacks:Screen is smaller than the competing phonesNo SD card slot for expanding storageCamera not equal to some of the other top phonesSpeakers pointing down is not a good designApple Maps still has issuesBattery life could be better (like all smartphones)Design could benefit from a refreshAlso iOS does not have a lot of the software features that the new Android versions have. Some of these features are useful, some of them are more of a novelty that look good on paper, and some you will probably never use. But it's nice to have these options. Being able to choose a different default browser, using hand gestures for phone functions, being able to do multiple attachments for emails, these are the more useful ones.Summary:This phone is what is best for me, but not everyone of course. We all have different tastes, preferences, and uses. For me, it's the integration with my iPad, and iMac, the integration with my friends and family who have iOS devices, and it is the ability to plug in an instrument for practicing, sketching songwriting ideas, and recording riffs. Also, i'm a semi avid gamer, and having access to the best library of games is significant to me. I also value simplicity, reliability, and smooth performance, over options suited for \"power users\".  In my humble opinion, iOS is a better experience for me. With the past 2 Android phones, I would get enticed by a new model, enjoy them for a 1-2 month honeymoon period, grow disillusioned by it's shortcomings, then go back to an iPhone. I need to stop doing that, as it's not very cheap!Lastly, I think everyone should try both, before deciding on what platform is best for them. With that said, the iPhone 5 is a good place to start.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not drop ever.  Screen cover is real glass", "Author": "M.

The 5 seems to solve almost all the problems that the previous iPhones had. I have been an iPhone customer ever since the first one was announce. All the old iPhones were plague with problems such as limited App support, slow browser, poor camera, laggy Apps, weight, low resolution, etc. The 5 have none of these problems. The only problem the iPhone 5 have is poor battery life.I mostly use this phone for lightweight computer stuff like browsing, YouTube, movies, music, word processing, email, camera, and phone stuff. It does everything better than most devices out there while staying very portable. Smoothness and stability have always been the hallmark of iOS which is the main reasons I never switched to other phones. Of all the years that I owned the iPhone, and of all the Apps that I've gone though, only a screen or two worth of Apps is useful. That said, not even useful most of the time. The Apps that I use most often are the ones that came with the phone with the exception of the Chrome browser. Everything is butter smooth especially with iOS 7. There are no Apps right now that lags on this phone.The size is perfect for watching movies, but not so big that it will feel bulky in your pocket. The speakers are decent enough to listen in a small room or watching from a distance. I do still prefer the headphones jack on the top like the older iPhones since it doesn't get in the way with my palm. The edgy shape of the phone does not feel nice when holding, but the phone is small and light enough so that you can put a more comfortable case on it.The camera shoots fast and is very clear and colorful, but focusing is still too slow. While the camcorder doesn't come close to the real thing, it is still far better than many mobile devices especially with stabilization.The display sharpness is still standard retina quality, which is optimal as suggested by Apple. It was good the first time I saw it on the iPhone 4, and if they made the pixel any more dense, I doubt there will be any noticeable difference. Otherwise, the screen is bright enough for sunlight and colorful as usual. I have seen better colors on other phones though, but the iPhone 5 screen is still spectacular. The iPhone 5 is much lighter than the older iPhones and it is also slimmer too, this will let you put on many cases without adding too much bulk.The larger screen is welcoming. The only thing bad about the large is that it is harder to reach the home button. I often have to tilt my phone to reach it. However, I watch a lot of movies on my phone so the larger screen is a great addition. The screen does feel significantly bigger with more viewing space, but most importantly, the phone itself doesn't feel bigger. It will still fit well in jean pockets. I know changing the screen size is a risky design change, I hope they don't make the phone any bigger, but I'm glad they did.The lighting connector is great too. It is slimmer, you can connect it any way you want and it feels quite durable for its size. However, I get a lot of disconnects with the lighting connector during sync, especially when I'm transferring large files. This is probably an issue with the lighting connector since I get the same problem with the iPad Mini which also uses the lighting connector. However, I have not notice this problem anymore, or at all, after the iOS 7 update.The battery life have always been a big problem with the iPhone. You can always buy a battery case, external battery, or carry the charger everywhere since there are outlets pretty much everywhere and the charger is no bigger than two ice cubes. The phone charges fairly fast, almost 50% per hour. I also want to add that iOS 7 have reduced the battery life slightly, but noticeably.Now that the 5S is out, I feel that it is not worth the upgrade from the 5. Practically speaking, the only major difference is the fingerprint reader since entering the pass-code have always been annoying. As for the camera, I don't see much difference in the outdoor picture quality, and the flash on the 5S is just an improvement from what was already bad. Low-light photos and slow-motion camera is something I can live without. A7 and 64-bit Apps are still far from the horizon. Remember, last year's iPad Mini is running on the A5, two generations behind yet still a fairly new product compared to the iPhone 5 which is running on the A6. You will only benefit if you are doing major video, photo, and sound editing on your iPhone, which I hope you are not.The iPhone is an excellent phone, but my next phone will probably be an Android. The old Android phones were beyond horrible, but they have improved so much that I must give them a try.PROS:PerformanceWeight and sizeLongevity supportHardware/Software designLarger screenApps Apps Apps!CONS:Battery (Worst with iOS 7)Wish the camera focus faster", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It does what it is supposed to", "Author": "Christopher Alexander \"Christopher Alexander\"", "ReviewID": "R38JX6E77S7IPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long-time Droid user, but opted to advance to I-phone 5 after Verizon pitched me a good deal (Phone = $225 if I sign up for two more years; since I'm not changing plans, I thought, why not).Having used an I-Pad for the past several months, the I-phone feels familiar, as the apps and operations are similar.

I currently own an iPhone 5 as well as a MacBook Pro. It was up until I essentially understood how to operate the company\u2019s products that I disliked it. Once I understood how to successfully use the products, I realized that they were actually a walk in the park to use. I have owned the iPhone 5 for just over a year now and I have never had any problems with the phone itself. This phone is available in either black or white. The phone\u2019s structure is very lightweight and easy to put in your pocket. Some well-designed qualities this phone has include: front and rear camera with 8 megapixels for clear photos, music player capabilities, and also internal memory storage. This phone usually has very strong service and also has an option to use Wi-Fi. All in all, it is a phone to own if you are either hi-tech or low-tech. Although, the sleek look of the phone is still a trend, I have grown very fond of the product and the simplicity of its design.Unfortunately with advances in technology, everyone wants their products to be running at the best of its ability, thus, iOS 7 was created. iOS 7 is a easy to use, efficient operating system, but it has one major flaw: the battery life of any iPhone that is not an iPhone 5S is very poor. This is because iOS 7 was created specifically for the iPhone 5S, therefore, all other iPhones use their battery life to keep up with this software. I would recommend the iPhone 5 to anyone who likes to stay connected with the world through social media. If you are a business person, I would recommend choosing something more along the lines of a personal assistant that would have better battery life.

I personally feel that while the iPhone has not added any drastic new features, it has almost perfected the ones that are familiar to past Apple customers. The device is very sleek and well-built. After two months of regular use, it still appears to be new. The screen is fingerprint resistant unlike many of the past iPhones. The camera is excellent (not to say that past iPhone's haven't been able to take good images). It can take panoramas--a very well done effort by Apple to take existing ideas from third party applications and perfect them. The main disadvantage of the iPhone 5 is the lack of good maps support. However, given that Apple is the most valuable company in the world, I am confident that it will spend a portion of its wealth to perfect iMaps in coming iOS updates.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "nothing special", "Author": "harriet", "ReviewID": "R20COKMGWOBRJX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned products from this company since the beginning of the 1990s. Love the company. The computers are MUCH better than the phones! The 5 is very average. It is lighter than the 4 & 4s. When holding a 4  and 5 in separate hands, the weight difference is amazing. The camera and video functions work well. The panoramic function is fun, but does get choppy, even with a consistent hand. Still, it is a fun feature. I wish the phone had a coating on the screen that prevented scratches, but this feature would cause all cell manufacturers to lose big $, so I will not hold my breath. The battery life on this phone is THE ABSOLUTE WORST of any cell phone I have ever used. It is beyond awful. I do not used my phone more than the average cell phone user, so that is not the cause. Nor do I use apps. The problem is simply that the battery life sucks!!!!!! This is the worst feature of the phone. I do not find the phone to be any faster than other smartphones. I think most are comparable. The touchscreen is problematic, as oftentimes touches are not recognized. As for Siri-she sucks! I do not know one person who has said otherwise. Siri does NOT recognize what is spoken to her more than 5% of the time, and that 5% is generous!! The voice recognition on the iPhone 5 is subpar. I do not think it is worth wasting my time trying to use it, as I always have to correct it. It is much easier to pull car over, go to Safari and type in the info I want & go from there. DO NOT depend on Siri or voice recognition for anything. When Siri does understand what you say, she can get you the info requested, but is more likely to frustrate you. If you do use the keypad for typing, always check before you send! The 5 is notorious for mistakes because the keys are so small the user will hit many wrong keys, resulting in unreadable text. It should be noted that I have very small hands and fingers. I cannot imagine what it must be like for those who are larger. Another problem with the typing is the tendency to hit the space bar instead of the bottom row on the keyboard. It makes for strange texts, but when people find out I have an iphone 5 they almost always understand. It is a very common problem. As for problems or glitches, every phone will have some duds. My friend bought the 5 and after having had to go back to the store 3 times in 6 days & exchanging the 1st phone for another she returned it and got a Samsung. She wishes she never got rid of her Blackberry, but is much happier with the Samsung than the 5. Several friends have had problems with the notifications not working. Sometimes the 5 simply shuts down and a reset has to be performed to turn the phone back on, which is very annoying. However, this is not the only phone for which this happens.Basically, this is an average phone. I think I am rating it higher than I would if I was not such a Mac/Apple fan.It is not worth the hype and certainly should not be seen as a status symbol. Why people think having a certain phone makes them better than those with other phones is beyond me, but that is what some believe. Of course, this does not apply to all users, those who do know who they are. In my opinion there is nothing special about the phone.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Designed in California but made in China", "Author": "Geezup", "ReviewID": "R292C4Q230LLSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is it me or the commercial that represents the apple products being designed in california as a failed advertising gimick.

After drying it off there was still water seeping out from inside the phone. I did the old rice in-a-bag trick, which often works. My iPhone is back online, with absolutely no side effects from the submersion. This demonstration of quality compelled me to write a review for once.On top of the many minor drops, sweaty runs, overuse, and general carelessness - the fact that it can recover from water submersion, to me, is a sign of a basic level of quality I need in a phone. Apple could probably manufacture these to fail under that level of mistreatment, so that we have to buy another, but they care about the performance of their product (in this case). So 5 stars for the iPhone 5.Oh, by the way, the rest of the device is great too. Camera's nice, lighter than older models, quick LTE speeds, blah blah.

I tried the Galaxy S4 for a couple weeks, wasn't happy the way it handled multiple email accounts, messaging and basic functions which required multiple key presses to accomplish. To add to this, the phone lagged between screens and apps and after reading forums online, I found I wasn't the only one experiencing this. I returned the phone and tried the Blackberry Z10. Their new \"Hub\" feature was nice, however the OS just didn't flow too well with BB's new gesture commands. Navigating through screens was not a pleasant experience. Perhaps with software updates, BB's new OS will come together someday, however, as of now, it's lacking quite a bit, especially in the app space.Unfortunately, in my haste to sell my iPhone 5 immediately after purchasing the S4, I realized I had made a grave mistake. To correct this, I purchased another iPhone 5. After experimenting with the other OS's out there with the exception of the Windows phones, I found that no other phone had everything put together as well as the iOS iPhone 5. iOS flows very well and especially with email which I depend on heavily for corporate as well as personal use. The iPhone excels in many other areas in comparison to other phones such as messaging, web browsing, camera features, music and so much more. People criticize the iPhone so much for the lack of a removal battery, expandable storage, lack of customization options and so much more, however the battery life on the i5 is amazing with wifi, BT and apps running 24/7. As for storage, just opt for a larger capacity. I feel like the prodigal son who just had to see what was out there in the world but in the end, came back home to the iPhone 5.

It is smooth and easy to deal with, unlike my older htc. I don't have problems, my battery seems to last great, it looks and feels good.  Another reason is that at least some of the iphone is made/designed in the United states and Apple is currently planning on building a manufacturing plant here. In our times, when technology is taking jobs, when corporations aren't hiring even though making gains, it doesn't make sense to buy something made completely elsewhere. Especially when there isn't a technology superiority.

I have never owned an iPhone before, so I cannot comment on it's worth compared to a previous model. However, the processor and RAM is very fast, making transitions between apps and videos/pictures smooth and fast. The screen is amazing to look at, and I like it has a larger size, thus being able to fit another row of apps on the home screens.The speakers sound great, and so do the new headphones included. They are no longer the standard white earbud headphones, the new ones are a different shape and have a more full sound.I have owned an iPod 4th generation previously, and I am glad that they have finally moved the headphones input to the bottom of the phone--finally it matches all other devices I have ever had.Siri is amazing to have. I love the intuitiveness of responding to and answering my commands and questions.One of the cons compared to an android phone is the lack of a quick shortcut to be able to turn off 4G and 3G when out of wifi range. You have to go into settings and then into a couple other areas to turn the 3G, 4G off. However, I have found that if you double-click the home button it will bring up recent apps or the settings panel, and if you press settings, and the last settings you looked at was the toggle for 3G 4G then it will bring you directly to that page.Battery life is competitive compared to other phones I have used.Lastly, consider buying the AppleCare Protection instead of the Verizon monthtly warranty. The AppleCare is only 99$ compared to the Verizon $11/month. The AppleCare lasts two years and the deductible for a replacement phone is around 49$.

The screen is bright and crisp not fuzzy at all, downloading is very fast no matter what you need done. I also was about to purchase a MP3 player because I wanted to watch and download videos,and my G2 phone did not download videos from different websites, so instead of paying another $100 dollars to &300 dollars on a simple MP3 player that probably would stop working or become very slow, I decided to buy this IPhone instead.

Just as I guessed it, someone was paid to bad mouth the iPhone 5.  The issue my iPhone was having was an issue that is addressed at the Apple Store but not at my carrier.  Apple told me the iPhone 5 out of the box has all of its functions turned on to be seen and appreciated.  However, no one utilizes all these tools at the same time.  Take for example cell phone networks: the iPhone comes out of the box searching for 1/2 dozen networks. But since it only needs to find your network, all other searches are a waste of power.  So you need to turn them off.  This goes for WiFi as well.  Out of the box and its hunting for WiFi, Bluetooth, everything.  Turn everything you are not using off and your phone will last all day.  And that goes for apps and other noticeable tools.  Then you can set your screen display brightness, for office, sunlight, etc...  The brighter the screen has to be the more power it uses.

Not to sound like a conspirator, but with these phones, it just makes it quite easy for big brother to track you with their built in GPS devices etc. Most people I see are using the phone for music and gaming and perhaps some streaming when home, (video without WiFi is just not practical). The solution to the social disease, well with this phone Apple offers something a lot more practical the I Touch 4th generation or the upcoming fifth. The device has 32 GB or 64 GB as opposed to 8 or 16. The battery lasts approximately 2 days. It has WiFi and all of the same apps as the phone. It is lighter. You can purchase one for 280, and pay nothing month to month, and save yourself a ton of cash with a regular phone no matter who your provider is! So if you want to be fiscally smart, stay away from \"the Smart phone\" because with Apple there is no advantage- just inconveniences, such as a poor battery, discourteous people in the gym who can't go a few hours without speaking to someone, and a fortune in battery replacements, and having to charge it every five hours. So if you are an Apple freak get the I-touch save yourself some money and carry a cute little flip phone around you'll have more money in your checking if you do.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 of 4 phones purchased broke.

She  had been using a blackberry.  I bought the IP5 thinking that Apple would be easier for her to use then her BlackBerry. the first thing we noted out-of-the-box was that you cannot use the phone at all without joining the Apple fan club. That's right, after purchasing it from Verizon, handing over several hundred bucks and signing a 2 year contract this was not enough. The phone will not function at all until you agree to join Apple and give them a ton of personal information and a credit card. Ouch!  I have never seen this with any phone purchase in the past!!!I must admit I almost sent the IP5 back right then but it would've spoiled the Christmas surprise and left our moment wanting.  She loves Frank Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" as her ring tone and I've always set that up for.  on her blackberry or my android it takes me about 2 min.  Christmas morning after hours of work we still don't have Frank Sinatra's fly me to the moon playing as my wife's Ring tone and I'm an electronics engineer for a living. I cannot believe how poorly the IP5 is designed and  how shutdown and xenophobic everything is. There is no access to anything. On my droid i just surf to the NAS drive on my net and add anything i want to the phone without leaving my chair.  With IP5 You can't even plug the USB cable and drag a ring tone file into the ring tone folder, or a picture file, or a music file or any other file. You must go into iTunes first which means you do have to download 100 MB of awkwardly coded data and load a music program fraught with forced advertisements to put in a ring tone? Ouch!!!!! Apple is easy? LOL, I don't think so.  Apple free and open, no way.  she's getting used to the phone and after buying an app and searching the web for additional tech support i did get \"Fly Me...\" on as her ringer.  if I had my way we'd send this thing back and get a phone that doesn't require big brother looking over my shoulder to change ring tones.

Number 1 I like to have more than 1 battery because 4G will eat away a battery life. Secondly these batteries will lose close to 20% of its max life every year. in a couple years you really will feel it and would be useless by then.Selling someone the iphone now since you may want to upgrade they will have to send it back to apple and pay a outrageous price to get the battery changed. I don't believe in non removable batteries. I don't support that rubbish. My Galaxy S2 has removable battery and the casing goes back on as though it was never a removable battery to begin with.I know rubbish phones like Motorola Atrix 2, the back cover tends to feel flexible and wobbly giving it some nasty cheap feel but samsung has no problems with this you can't ever tell if its removable or not, its that sturdy.The reason I still buy a samsung phone and not other phones anymore is simply for the battery.Secondly the Iphone still uses ancient LCD display. The samsung phones uses Super AMOLED + display. Organic LED is the future and anyone who has seen it in real life would know just how advanced it is.

My wife and I have excellent cell phone service with Consumer Cellular (CC), a no contract provider. I had bought her a Motorola Bravo from them and they sent a regular size sim card which works perfectly. My wife's Chrysler 300C was starting to require many repairs and she was wanting to replace it with a Jeep.  I bought her a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited but her Motorola Bravo is not compatible with the Jeep Voice Command System. I decided to go all out and bought her an unlocked iphone 5 which I expected to be compatible with both the Jeep Voice Command System and with our carrier, Consumer Cellular. My only concern was how to get the regular sim card in my wife's Motorola Bravo cell phone down to nano size to fit the Apple. However, I figured that CC would have a solution such as sending a nano sim card and deactivating the Motorola Bravo sim card. As I wrote, I just took it for granted that this allegedly latest and greatest engineering wonder (according to the ads) would be compatible with both the Jeep and CC. So I ordered the outrageously priced unlocked iphone 5. As usual, Amazon quickly processed my order and notified me that the phone had been shipped.I called CC to request a nano sim and was told by two different reps that the iphone 5 is not compatible with their service. I decided that I would keep CC as my server but when the iphone 5 arrived I would take it down to Walmart and sign my wife up for StraightTalk which is also a no contract server and which advertises the iphone 5 in their ads. The phone arrived in a small box, the kind that has a tear-off strip along one edge. There was no packing in the box. One end of the box was open and the cellophane wrapping was torn and disheveled. I had no way of testing the phone to check for internal damage and I had enough drama so I sent it back and bought my wife a Samsung Focus 2 for about one fourth the price of the iphone 5. I called CC and they shipped a micro sim which should arrive in a few days. Obviously CC must believe that this phone is compatible with them but as for the jeep it is anyones guess.This is where my soap opera ends as far as this review is concerned. The moral of the story is that it would behoove anyone who is in the market for a 2014 vehicle with Voice Command features or is considering a new cell phone which would be used with your existing carrier or would be paired with your vehicle to do a thorough amount of research to avoid duplicating my experiences. One final note. My cell phone is a Sony Xperia P which I bought from Amazon. It works perfectly with CC and pairs and connects perfectly with my wife's Jeep. If her Samsung has any compatibility issues I will end the drama and give her my Sony. Then I wil punt.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "preguntas", "Author": "miguel", "ReviewID": "R1GK04ACX6YEPJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good morning I am interested to buy iphone 5 am from Venezuela want to know which version deveria use here in my country and I'm online movistar q and q I have understood the t-mobile version does not lift the 3G network would like to know who should buy await your response thanks", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I buy .", "Author": "T.
