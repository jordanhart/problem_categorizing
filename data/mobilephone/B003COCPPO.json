I have an old school phone plan; I don't use the internet or check my email. I only use this phone for calls, texts, and pictures. For these purposes, this has been the best phone I've had yet.I don't have any trouble with the battery- I charge every three days or so. It has frozen up a few times in the course of two years, but it wasn't anything removing the battery didn't fix.I like the user interface, it has convenient shortcuts, even a set of programmable shortcuts along the left side of the screen.Camera works well, enough quality that I can upload pictures online and they are normal-size and clear, but no flash.Touchscreen is great, I don't have to recalibrate often. And QWERTY keyboard is good also, it has auto correct so you don't have to type exactly right.Only complaint is that if you don't get the lock button pushed before dropping the phone into your purse or pocket, its easy to get into screens that accrue data charges. Its happened three or four times.Overall great value for what you get out of it if you aren't one of those people who never puts their phone down and uses it for everything under the sun.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid and dependable phone - with many fine details", "Author": "Danny Yu", "ReviewID": "R2O2F0GKMYL73I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung Solstice is a touch screen phone that tries to make leaps towards features of a smart phone. In summary, the Solstice is a slim, dependable, and easy to use phone.My thoughts:- I like the touchscreen. It's generally very reactive, just off by a millimeter or so sometimes. Very responsive and becomes second nature after a while.- The main screen lets you put your favorite apps on a bar that acts like the taskbar of a PC. You can also drag the app icon onto the background for ease of access. The charge meter, network indicator, and time are all generally lit well and easy to read.- On idle mode, it's difficult to pocket dial and mistouch something, as long as you lock the phone each time. It's very simple to use and becomes an easy habit after a while. Almost every phone has that option. If you don't lock it, then it's your fault, not the phone.- Design is very nice, actually. The back button is the center on the bottom, with the dial and end call buttons on the left and right ,respectively. The lock and unlock button is subtly placed on the top right, which is very convenient. On the left side of the phone, there's the volume control, which also is slim enough that you wouldn't accidentally bump it. The battery charger and usb slot has a cover that is attached to the phone, preventing any dust or debris from damaging the phone.- Camera is fairly good. 2 megapixels is enough and the pictures are generally clear.- Call quality is fair. It's certainly not optimal, as you may get some bad signal sometimes. However, more often than not you'll have a good experience. A caution though, is that the phone can become obscenely hot after talking, even for as little as 10 minutes. I'd recommend a bluetooth or headset.- I like the ease of connectivity between this phone and PC. You'll need a USB chord, and I recommend getting the Oriongadgets Sync & Charge USB Cable for Samsung Solstice A887 (Black), or any compatible chord. It's a simple drag and drop into this phone's folder. I've easily uploaded songs and pictures.- The texting interface is solid and generally responsive. You may have some typos, but with some careful practice, it's fairly easy. Everything has a learning curve, so give it some time! However, you may only text up to 7 different contacts on a text message.* * * *Some counter arguments against existing reviews:- A reviewer said that the battery life was horrible. Not for me, and others. Me and other Samsung Solstice users have no issue with the battery charging. On estimate, I'd say a fully charged phone can last up to 3-4 hours of talk time. The battery charging is good, but the battery life is definitely sub-par. I'm able to charge every couple days, so it's not that bad.- Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze. After some simple instructions, you'll be connected in no time. My Samsung WEP460 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] works perfectly with this phone.Overall, a solid phone that is capable as an all-purpose daily phone and tries to have features of a smart phone. Also, as a word of caution, it seems that the not so favorable reviewers of this phone just simply had a bad luck experience with this phone. I'm sorry to hear that, but there are plenty of happy Samsung Solstice owners like me, my brother, and several friends, but they just haven't expressed their satisfaction here on Amazon. The people whom had bad experiences just seem to scream louder. Anyways, don't let that prevent you from buying this phone. Highly recommended phone.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Watch out for charging problems!", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "ROJH6VSSDB08M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This seemed like an Ok phone...for the three hours I was able to use it. It arrived with an initial charge on the battery, which allowed me to play with it for a few hours and test out the features. The touch screen worked well, but the qwerty keyboard was very small, which made texting difficult. I'm sure this is less of an issue once you get used to it, but I have pretty small hands/fingers and had to correct one out of every four letters while texting, so if you have large fingers, this probably isn't the phone for you. Other than that, it is a good basic phone. I don't use my phone for internet, email, or social networking, so I didn't try out these features. If you care about those features and like to customize your phone, definitely read the reviews. I noticed that a lot of people complained about not being able to change things like the screensaver - I don't care much about that, but some of the pictures that pop up on the screensaver are truly cheesy. I didn't care for the standard ringtones on this phone, but I'm sure you can download something.The real problem to watch out for is charging problems. When the initial charge died and I tried to charge it for the first time, I got an error message saying 'charging stopped due to irregular battery.' I tried it with several different chargers in several different outlets and got the same error message. If I tried charging it when the phone was off, I got a different error message, saying 'charging paused. Phone temperature too high or too low', though my phone was at room temperature. A new battery did not solve this problem, so I sent the phone back. In the course of trying to solve the problem, I did some searching online and discovered that many owners of this phone had the same problem - some when the phone was new, some after a few months, some after the phone went for a swim. The phone I purchased was supposedly brand new, so it should not have had any swimming experience. I guess I'm thankful that the charging problem occurred immediately, when I could still send it back, rather than randomly after a few months like some of the reviews I have read.I don't ask much from my cell phone - only that it work when I need it, send and receive texts when I need it to, and hold a charge reasonably well. Unfortunately, this phone didn't measure up and I'm not ordering another one. It's just not worth the hassle.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever!", "Author": "salylimon67", "ReviewID": "R34PCDJUU9R4JW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely loved this phone! Unfortunately it has perished, but that is my fault entirely. Apparently it doesn't like swimming so people, no toilets! It lasted me two years and would of lasted much longer I'm sure if I hadn't killed it.The texting was hard at first, but after a week, I was pro with a record of several hundred messages a day. I never had a complaint about my phone except maybe it not being water resistant. The battery would last me two days which is a lot considering I hardly put it down.I always had my phone to lock in 8 seconds (you can put more time, or make it manual) so I never had data charges for throwing it in my purse unlocked and having my mascara do some web surfing.I always had signal, and the touch screen always worked just fine.Honestly, it was the best phone ever. I never had internet or all that fancy stuff though, I've heard it's not the best phone then.

I've dropped it countless times, I actually threw it at the ground yesterday to show my friend how durable my new case was. It's great for the price my only annoyance is the touch screen freezes up sometimes when texting and then types it all at once really quick so it throws me off", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Good Phone for Texting", "Author": "greendog47", "ReviewID": "R3RI8KLMJQRLCV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had purchased this phone through AT&T; on August of 2010. It has been roughly been two years before this phone has started glitching.It has problems with me texting and sometimes even receiving calls, the screen has gone blank a couple of times when someone was trying to call me. Yet, considering that this phone has lasted me this long it has been a good phone.Texting is responsive and when you hit the letters it vibrates, which is a nice feature of the phone that I loved and that I'm having trouble finding with recent phones today. I never worked with the internet as I didn't get a plan for web access so I can't give a review on that.But the phone is durable, I have dropped it a couple of times and it keeps going, with no problems and it has a really long lasting battery life.Charging is pretty quick and it takes just a couple of hours. They only thing I would recommend is that you must by a plastic screen cover as the screen does scratch really easily and put the phone on autolock as the Widgets on the side bar will move on their own in your pocket. Overall, this Phone rocks and it's compact, being able to fit in your regular jean pocket without taking too much space for Wallet or other things in your pocket.I'm seriously considering buying this phone again. Oh the only thing is that there is no room for a MicroSd card and the internal memory might be small for some people, and you might need a special cable they sell on amazon to transfer your pictures.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "samsung solstice a887", "Author": "Denise Konvicka", "ReviewID": "R1AHBTWIHPU0MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, and  fingernail friendly.Wish they would  make more phones this way.

It lasted me my two years of the contract (even with my brutal use of it) and I was very happy with the quality of it. It is far from a smart phone, but if you are looking for something reliable then this is the phone for you. It survived the corners being crunched, buttons being scraped, and a countless number of drops. The battery life also runs well with having to only need to be charged about once overnight and will last for about 36 or so hours. which by my book is pretty good.Only con is its speakers are not the loudest.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only OK All Around", "Author": "JGA", "ReviewID": "R55TCKNZH3Z0M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone has excellent audio - both transmit and receive.  It takes excellent pictures.  It is small and light.  It has two serious flaws.  I use the phone for talking and texting and that's it and had to have ATT Store disable the Internet capability. It was too easy to activate when you aren't even trying and you can rack up some data charges quickly.  It's worst fault for me is the Qwerty touch-screen.  I have large finger tips and you must hit each letter on its top left corner or the letter immediately on the the right side shows up. To make matters worse, I have to use a stylus to send a text message and that is not error free unless I creep along.

Unfortunately I wish I would have bought a different phone because this ranks among one of the worst I have ever owned. Although the touch screen features are nice, what good is your phone to you if you have to charge it TWICE a day, EVERY day, regardless of how much you use it???For example, I left my phone on the charger for approximately 10 hours during the night. I took it off the charger when I left this morning for work and I had a full charge (five bars). I placed two phone calls, both of which lasted only 10 minutes each. Four text messages were sent (no multimedia texts by the way), and now it tells me four hours later that I have one bar of battery life. Ridiculous. This has been an ongoing problem since I got it. Just read the reviews and you will see that others have the exact same problem. And don't even think about trying to talk on the phone while it's charging because it will get so hot that you can't hold it.The call quality is terrible as well as my mother tells me I am the only one she has trouble hearing when either of us call each other. And as one user mentioned, you can't get rid of the vibrate mode for messages if you want your phone to be completely silent.The only pros to this phone is that you have similar \"smartphone features\" without having to have a data package, which if you threaten to leave your current cell phone service provider, they will drop the data package requirement even if you have a smartphone, just fyi.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can AT&T; actually make a functioning phone?", "Author": "pobby", "ReviewID": "R4NMQE06XOYVK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is just terrible.  I'll start with the pros:-Text messaging interface is nice, considering that you can read the conversation continuously.-Takes decent pictures.-Decent speaker and microphone.The cons:- Numerous accidental pocket dials.- Very easy to accidentally answer calls.  Pressing the call button answers a call, whether it's locked or not.- The phone likes to power cycle randomly.- The phone often loses it's connection to the AT&T; network.- It will run out of battery with little notice.- The widgets are awkward, and basically a joke.  The only one I use is the call center interface.  There are several redundant ones, and there is not one for an alarm.- The alarm is buggy.  Sometimes it just flat out doesn't go off.  You get annoying error messages when trying to set alarms too.- The applications are a joke.  The map/gps application is not intuitive, buggy, and has limited functionality compared to free things like google maps.  Oh yea, it costs ten bucks a month to use.  Basically every application on the phone comes with a monthly fee of 2-15 dollars.  This functionality is duplicated on many other phones for free.  Oh yea, the apps actually work half way decently on other phones.- Texting is nearly impossible.  In the keyboard mode, you are guaranteed to make several typos.  You can turn on T9, but it's poorly implemented and causes the phone to lag.- The phone possesses almost no memory.  At around 200 texts, you will get a horrendously annoying message: \"memory full, please delete some texts\".  You select ok, try to navigate to the texts, and it comes up again.  You'll be on the phone, get a text, and then hear a beeping every 10 seconds because your memory is full.  There is an auto-delete when full option, but guess what: it doesn't work.- Setting it up to backup files on your computer is a difficult and bug-ridden process.There's more, but that's enough for now.

I have three different quality bt earpieces, but none have even tolerable quality when paired to this phone.-Even though I save messages to my 2gig card, phone frequently tells me I must delete, usually after 300 messages or so.-phone menu is preloaded with (Locked in) applications that add $$ to your bill if you are not a net user.Honestly the crashing and the LONG time to send text messages are the BIGGEST turnoffs about this phone.I would not have even gotten it if it wasn't the best of the \"free\" phones available from my provider.This phone causes daily frustration.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bluetooth connectivity Problem !", "Author": "Amazoner", "ReviewID": "R1E35TM7SQVMP7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We live in Washington DC area where the ticket for driving on cell phone is $150.
