Signal is great on T-Mobile network in the area where I live (refarmed area). 3G and LTE both work out of the box.Battery life seemed less than what I was expecting at first.

It always has between 200-300Mb of RAM free. It can handle your DualShock 3 natively. Xperia settings has screen mirroring, Xperia link and a new option MyXperia!!

It may not be the lightest phone it's the quality that matters and Sony has always made good stuff -- It feels like a real phone... Not as big of a screen as like the Galaxy 4s but big enough...Battery life is amazing. I usually put the phone on charge each night but the battery is usually still around 60-70% by the time I head off to bed. I could probably go two days without a charge. I use it for Strave, facebook, some music, email, and maybe 20-30 minutes of talking a day.For the Camera this is important! There is a separate button for the camera and it's a button where you press it half way and the phone will do it's auto-focus and stuff so when you fully press there isn't any shutter-lag... Great when you are trying to capture action-style photos.  This is where those galaxy phones cannot compare...Also, prepare to get your scissors out because you probably will need to trim your sim card down to the mini size. I have straight talk and all their sim cards will work but the wrong size... So don't freak-out that the card won't fit at first... Download a template or just eyeball it...One last thing is a peeve. The on/off button is right smack in the middle of the side of the phone. Good luck not inadvertently turning it on all the time from just holding it or picking it up.

Out of the box, the phone has a great feel and size. I spent a week researching a GSM phone with LTE that I am able to use oversees. After looking at the usual phones, (Samsung, HTC, Apple, etc.) I decided on the Sony Xperia SP. The initial setup of the phone went smoothly, however, as soon as I turned on \"Wi-fi\" to update my Android Apps, that's where my problem started. The phone immediately went into \"reboot\" mode. It wouldn't stop re-booting, I immediate called the Sony Technical help line. Tech Support walked me through and was able to shut the phone off after about 30 minutes of constant re-boot. He had me do a reset to the phone since he said it was a software glitch. He then emailed me a link to a file that Sony uses on their products in order to update software. I did that. The phone accepted the update and the phone re-booted as normal. I re-inserted my sim card and did the normal \"new\" phone setups. However as soon as I turned on the wi-fi, the phone did the same thing! I immediately goes into re-boot mode.I called Sony since I bought this product directly from Sony dot com and they told me to return the phone for a replacement. If you buy this phone, please research the Xperia Model you intend to buy for wi-fi problems on the internet and you'll find this is an issue with these phones. If you decide to buy this phone, make sure you have the option to either 1) return the phone for repair 2) have/buy a warranty and 3) the patience to deal with Customer Service", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but with some memory issues...", "Author": "J.

While it is tons better than my old Nexus S, it has one fundamental flaw. that my Nexus S didn't. While the Nexus S had the same amount of ram as the Xperia SP (16 GB), the Nexus S would allow me to move programs from the main phone memory to external phone memory. Something about the way that Sony handles their memory will not allow that to happen. I verified this on both my phone (Xperia SP), as well as my friends Xperia Z1. Then I tried to download about 4 or 5 apps that will allow this increased functionality. They all failed, and came up with either an error message, or the section that would allow you to manage the memory was faded out. Sucked! Great phone otherwise, oh and the other issue is that the camera seems to have issues focusing.

Thankfully, there is Sony, which not very many people knew that they still even makes phones.I started using Sony Ericsson phones since 2006 and along with Nokia, they were the best phones ever made IMO. I didn't go with a Nokia Lumia model is because I just can't get used to Windows Phone OS. I did try one for 2 weeks and just couldn't do it.The build quality and functionality of the Xperia SP is top notch. Not to mention the design and engineering of it itself. It's strange to me as to why people would rather shell out money for Samsung Galaxy S1,2,3,4, which I think is extremely unattractive due to the oval body, than purchasing a Sony mobile phone. This SP has awesome call quality, fantastic battery life, and excellent construction. I have had it for almost a month and so far it performs very well for my needs. I should mention that it is used on US T-Mobile LTE network and I get signals everywhere; even in remote areas where our other HTC would have absolutely no chance.First and most importantly: Call quality is superb. Caller on the other end have reported significant better sound and clarity from HTC and Samsung. On my end, same thing.Secondly: Graphics and everything else. The screen is very clear and color is crisp. There is no lag in the touch screen and all apps booted up very responsively. Out of the box, there is not a whole lot of useless bloatware either, so that's definitely a plus.Also: Battery life is very good as I had expected. Without the STAMINA mode phone lasts an entire day with moderate usage. With STAMINA mode on, a little over 2 days. Which for a screen of this size, that is pretty darn good.Extras: I especially like the LED light strip on the bottom which allows me to know when and what notification just came in so I don't have to always turn the screen on. It also illuminates accordingly when viewing photos and playing MP3 with album art. Camera is okay for a 8mp phone cam as no one should expect DSLR image quality. For that, I have my Canon 5d Mk3.I have not had any issues to Wi-Fi connectivity or phone randomly rebooting as mentioned by another reviewer. If that does happen, I'd say to get an exchange from Amazon as it is probably a bad copy.At the price point, I would highly recommend the SP. If you have another $150 to spare, you might want to get the Xperia ZL (model #C6506 LTE). The Xperia ecosystem has many models that can often be confusing so be sure to check out the whitepaper document on Sony Mobile's website for specifications.

Pretty fast with only slight lag when heavily multi-taskingWorks well with t mobile 3g hspda and lte in the US.When purchased price was $235.  The main competitor at that price point for unlocked phones with LTE was the 4g version of the Moto G at 220.  Has similar specs, feature sets, and build quality. Light strip is a cool feature as the led color can be changed for different kinds of notifications.  Audio quality from the jack is decent as expected from sony.  Aluminium border makes the SP heavier than the G for a more solid feel.  The SP is dual core compared to the G's 4 core,  but clocked higher, which means that single apps run better on SP while multitasking is a bit better on the G. The SP's gpu is much faster so gaming performance is better. SP is only 4.3 while G is 4.4 kitkat though an upgrade is possible.  Sony's skin is pretty decent and isn't too far from stock android.I chose this over the G for the better graphics performance in games and the heavy aluminum frame, which i felt sufficiently justified the $15 premium ove the 4G Moto G.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Sony Product", "Author": "ryan", "ReviewID": "R2CHI3RMTHQVFF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for around 7 months. Since I have received it, it's gone downhill fast. I've had to uninstall nearly every app and widget that I have just to be able to open my phone from the lock screen without it freezing up on me. After around 2 months is when I started having problems such as google chrome not responding, my messages not wanting to open, not being able to receive emails, and the list goes on. It finally reached the point that anytime I received a message or email I would have to wait anywhere from a few minutes up to half an hour waiting on my phone to unfreeze itself. I tried rebooting, connecting it to my computer and anything else I could think of and nothing would work. I love every Sony product I've ever bought except for this one. I would advise saving your money and investing it in another phone. For the price that I originally paid for this phone I could have gotten a Google Nexus 5. But as I said, I've had great experiences with Sony up till now. I don't know if I may have just received a \"bad apple\" or what the issue is. But based on the other reviews this product is working great for others. I just wanted to share my experience with this phone since it has by far been the worst phone I've ever had.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really sleek but a little slow", "Author": "ZAC RICCIARDI", "ReviewID": "R30UIJSLAMONJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I bought this phone after reading that it would have 4g coverage in metro areas.

I didn't want one of these big tablet sized phones that seem to be popular now but I needed it to have a useable screen size. I also prefer the squared look rather than rounded corners of the Samsung look alikes. 4G Lte was available and the price point was in that $250 - $300 sweet spot. This phone fit the bill in those areas.So here's what I found after using the Sony Xperia SP C5306 for a couple months:PROS:- The screen size is perfect for my viewing & operational needs, exact ratio for HD & widescreen movies.- The phone size is not too big for one-handed operation - something I find indispensable when I'm on the move.- 4G LTE capability with all the GSM carriers - I've used it with AT&T; and T-Mobile so far, and got excellent LTE connection.- Android 4.3 OS- Dedicated camera button with shooting capability while locked. Very useful- Camera is pretty sharp with a good feature set for shooting options.- Operational buttons are ergonomically well located. Charging port is not.- Ability to disable some native apps that cannot be uninstalled. More a feature of the OS than the phone.- Speakerphone is quite loud with the xLOUD feature - much louder than other phones I've used.- NFC (Near Field Comm) feature actually works.CONS:- 1 GB RAM is not sufficient for this phone with all the bloatware- Lots of Sony & Google Bloatware. Disabling any Google feature requires a cache- Fixed Battery with mediocre capacity. I dont think android devices should ever have fixed batteries until the power consumption efficiency is up to par with the iOS mobile systems. This battery lasts 1/2 day and requires repeated charging throughout the day . Of course, its going to become the single suckiest annoyance 9 months from now when the battery's efficiency naturally drops to half its capacity.- Does not boot quickly - takes about 2 - 4 minutes to completely find itself.- WiFi & Bluetooth dont play well together. I sometimes have to disable one feature for the other to work. A rather frustrating problem as I need to use both constantly.- Bluetooth is flaky with multiple devices. In my car it bounces back & forth erratically between my headset and the car system, rather than just locking on to one. Or both, like my Samsung does.- An annoying lack of small but important feature: the restart option. In order to reboot we go back to the old method of waiting for shutdown & if you remember, hard bootup again. Just a personal pet peeve.- Screen brightness auto control does not work well and does not keep its settings. It drains the battery if not monitored constantly.- Cannot truly turn off the large notification light at the buttom of the phone to save power. This flashes for all messaging & call alerts even when the alerts are turned off. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt...there doesnt seem to be consistency in its operation.- Charging port is peculiarly located. At first everything seemed to be in the opposite positions than I was used to on my other phones...like driving a car in London. But I realized that the charging port, which has cables hanging weirdly from the top left corner of the phone, made it difficult for a right-hander to handle while charging. Which happens often.- Sound volume on calls is disappointing especially when the Clear Phase feature is turned on, which ironically is meant to improve sound.- Sonys UI leaves a lot to be desired in many areas. The messaging applet is simple, cannot be reconfigured and lacks many useful features. I installed Handcent third party messaging app just so i can text normally.Overall the Sony Xperia SP LTE is a very capable mid-level phone at a very good price point that attempts to imitate its more capable (and much more expensive) sibling the XPeria Z. The slower processor is really what makes a significant difference in the experience. Despite the flaws i like it. But I know it will become a useless brick in 13 months after the fixed battery loses most of its charge capacity.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's lighting up blue", "Author": "NYCTechie", "ReviewID": "R2DSEA9E185GD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I really like the phone.
