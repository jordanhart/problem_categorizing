This is one of the worst phones to date. I only got it for the Andriod OS and I have regretted it since. Extremely slow to the point where you miss calls tapping unresponsive buttons then have to wait another 10 minutes to call back because it froze. Forget about internet,apps or anything else this phone has to offer. I'd prefer my very first brick-like flip phone over this. The interface is slow and cludgy and everything takes a long time to start up. In 2011 there's a wide variety of phones that are 100x better.

I was shocked to see this phone come in a very generic box with a plastic insert that didn't really go w/the pieces inside.  What was extremely disappointing was that there was some kind of gunk all over the front of it - and then the ear screen [where you put your ear] had some kind of gunk over the screen.  Then the clincher -- although you could hear the other person on the line, they couldn't hear you.

I learned the hard way that this phone will never be updated past the 2.1 operating system, so it can't take advantage of most of the features and apps coming out now.I've also had problems with performance since day one. Even after wiping the phone to factory and installing no extra apps or widgets, I continued to have trouble with it. If I'm reading an email when a call comes in, the phone will freeze and cause me to miss the call entirely. Similarly, there is a long delay between the time that I initiate a call and when it starts dialing. Sometimes it even calls someone a second time to interrupt the conversation I'm already having with them. I had no idea that was even possible.Since making and receiving phone calls is the most important part of a PHONE, I find the Eris severely lacking. I recommend spending a little extra money and just going with one of the proper Droid models from Motorola. I carry a company Droid X during the week, and I very rarely run into a problem with it.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "They should have named this phone the HTC Eri-tating!", "Author": "TW", "ReviewID": "R1EDY6XJRU8LG8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is one of the worst I have experienced.

I got the Droid Eris back a few years ago through Verizon Wireless when I was eligible for an upgrade and this is when I first heard about Android phones so I picked it up and thought it was a good phone but this is the worst phone that I've ever owned. It's very laggy and the phone can't keep up with my fast texting. Also, at random times when I go to any screen that has items to scroll down to, it will automatically scroll down to the bottom of the screen and when I try to click on an item to open it, it'll open up another application. This phone has caused nothing but headaches and frustrations with me. Also, navigating through the applications and from screen to screen get's very laggy and is very frustrating. The OS on the Droid Eris for default was the 1.5 Droid and it was junk but even with the updated 2.1 Android OS it's still a laggy phone, the Droid Eris just can't keep up with the new OS because the processor is garbage. The internal phone storage space has only 512MB but with all the applications that are on there as default, you only get about 130MB of storage space and the phone gets very bogged down. Even with an 8GB SD card, you can't store any applications in the SD card so the phone can only handle so much before it starts to lag very badly. Also, with the texting on the phone, I have to constantly delete my text messages if it gets to a few hundred because the phone will be very very laggy. Again, do NOT waste your money or time on the Droid Eris, I'd prefer a simple flip phone over this piece of junk. There are plenty of other newer Android phones that blow this phone out of the water. The Droid Eris wasn't even on the market that long because new Android phones came in and knocked this one out!Pros: Nothing!Cons: Lags too much. Not enought internal storage space. Slow processor. Camera takes pictures too slow and the pictures come out blurry if you move just a tiny bit.Overall Impressions: Horrible phone. Waste of money. Very frustrating to work with.

Takes some getting used to with the touch screen, especially after having a slide out keypad of last (non-android) phone.  Internet is pretty quick and it picks up wifi signals easily.  Highly recommend searching forums as there are many background apps that run the battery down quickly that you wouldn't normally think about.  Once you shut off things that you aren't using (like wifi and bluetooth), the battery lasts a day with normal use.  Fun free apps available from the \"market\" that are timely and easy to use - depending on what you are looking for.  This little phone packs a lot of things in its little size.  Once your eyes adjust to using a screen that size (3.2\"), and your fingers adjust to the keypad, it's easy to navigate.  I'm not sure if I like the suggestive typing feature but it does make lengthly conversations quicker.

The phone runs Android 2.1 and I would prefer Android 2.2 Froyo and later because I would like for the phone to share memory space with the sd card.

It has a very poor camera. If I even just have it in my purse all day and don't touch it I need to recharge it by the end of the day.

You can't sync it with FB contacts or else your memory is gone also. There's no way to store apps and games on your SD card or any data aside from music and photos (which thank god go on the SD card or you couldn't save a single contact.) I thought it was nice when I got it, but as the android family grew my phone stayed the same and it's only good for making phone calls, texts and getting email notifications. not a very \"smart phone\" Don't waste your money on this junk. there are better deals on newer models that can handle a lot more than this piece of poo. The reason why I gave it an extra star is because It's in awesome shape. It might just be because I took care of it, but it looks like it's still new after 2 years and it works.

Some how I didn't get one of those, I got the old operating systems.  When I download an application from the app store it stores on my phone and does not allow me to download to my SD card.  I have tried everything, so now I can only have a limited amount of applications on my phone at any given time, which is not what I need.  I need to be able to access my school from my phone and cannot because of limited space on the phone for applications.  I cannot use the wifi on it because if I do the app store does not work and I cannot access the internet apps either.  I have to use the 3g and data on my plan to go online which defeats the point if you are supposed to be able to use wifi...that is what it is there for.  Just a real bummer for me when I had such a great phone and was told this was an upgrade.  Boy were they full of it, the phone is a downgrade.  It is a smaller and thinner phone, but the other one I had was able to do so much more.  This is a great started phone for your teen, but not for a mother of two, full-time student who is using her phone on the go to keep up with school and her family.  Not to mention if you are wanting this for it's camera and video it is not good at all.  The joy stick on the phone does not work like it is supposed to and the pics always come out blurry.  As someone who has an expensive camera and takes millions of pictures it is a bummer to have every picture on my phone of my children come out blurry.  I miss my droid 2 global.  Will probably buy another one of those and sell this one to a teen so I can have a fully functioning phone.  Wish the post on this would have been a lot more honest about what you actually are getting with this phone instead of trying to pass it off as a \"new\" phone.On a positive note, the touch screen works great and there is plenty of space for whatever you choose to have on your home screens.

Android 1.5 was horrible, but had potential.  When the update to 2.1 was rolled out, I thought, \"Cool\"...  Nope.  Phone was still laggy and ran out of system memory with TOO MANY APPS...Solution?  I rooted it and installed CyanogenMod7 with great fear and trembling...  What if I turned my phone into a brick?  It turned out well, though with lots of help from various users.  And so...  How does it work now?  Well, I was able to overclock the processor to about 700+ megahertz, which helped.  I could now move apps to the sdram card, which took care of the memory problems, and for the most part, the phone stopped locking up.I lost the HTC Sense UI, but all in all it was an excellent trade-off.  Oh yeah, I did buy the 3300 mAH battery which means I often can go two days without a recharge.So, considering that this was a relatively inexpensive smartphone and a very early edition, it ain't bad.--Jerry", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$458.46", "Features": "Android 1.5-powered smartphone with 3.2-inch touchscreen and easy access to your Favorite contacts, YouTube and Facebook\nAccess a wealth of Google mobile services including Google Maps for turn-by-turn directions, Gmail, Google Talk, Calendar and more\nGPS-enabled for location services; Wi-Fi networking (802.11b/g); 5-megapixel camera/camcorder; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD expansion slot.\nUp to 3.5 hours of talk time, up to 373 hours (15.5 days) of standby time\nWhat's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, wall/USB charger, quick start guide", "Name": "PHONE VERIZON HTC ANDROID ERIS 1.5 OS; GOOGLE EXP DEV DUALL BAND CDMA 2000 1xRTT/1xEVDO/1xEVDO Rev A", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BLIplYyFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003W0G73Y"}}
