This replaced my LG Prime GS390, which this phone seems to be the successor to. Overall, it's a welcome upgrade. The UI is more intuitive and the camera is better.Only complaints. The camera is not very good for indoor photos - they turn out too dark, even when there's ample light in the room - though outdoor daylight photos can be quite good. Also, the touch screen is not as sensitive as my old LG GS390. I occasionally have a hard time selecting the letters in the drop down of the address book - which was never a problem on my old phone with an identical menu.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally a great phone!", "Author": "Nichole", "ReviewID": "RGU6ZHAIWLLJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone! i have not had any problems with it at all.

Get. This. Phone.", "Author": "Dolly", "ReviewID": "R2DOUYTRDVXU69", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I mean it. Like a previous reviewer, I absolutely LOVED my LG Xenon. This is a poor imitation. My biggest problem isn't the timestamps, I actually hadn't even noticed that. No, my biggest problem with this phone is the touch screen. Not nly do you pretty much have to pound on the thing for it to register touch, especially in the touch calibration, but the inaccuracy is laughable. Somehow, they have managed to make a phone that, when you hit the M (bottom right) it will register a T (top middle).. the letters aren't anywhere NEAR each other! It took me about 20 minutes (I am not exaggerating this) to text \"Do you have a vacuum?\" Because I had to backspace every letter, and half the time, trying to hit the backspace just hits another letter.This phone is terrible. It's not worth $20, let alone $100. Do yourself a favor and buy a phone that actually works.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "common error this phone has", "Author": "kaoshinkai", "ReviewID": "R1I01GN4YZ1HFL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Encore timestamps my txts 6 hrs off from the time they actually come in,there is no way to fix it. LG says they are working on a patch for it and have been since 10/2011. If you are new to touchscreen phones just at least dont get this one,having actual buttons are much better in general i find.

Overall, it is a great phone and I have enjoyed it. It is great for talking, texting, and listening to music. The only cons of this phone are:- The touch screen is not always responsive. You will tap an icon on the screen and it will not respond immediately. Also, the touch screen doesn't always take gestures accurately. I tried re-calibrating the touch screen and it didn't solve the problem.- The time stamp on incoming texts is five hours behind. The guy at the At&t; Store said that this was a network problem.As a whole, this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone", "Author": "lewis5263", "ReviewID": "R2FGPZTENATILJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, easy to move around from one app to another.

The LG Encore is great for phone use as its 3G coverage by AT&T; is terrific. My Sprint 2G Sanyo SCP-8400 coverage out here in the Chihuahuan Desert gave me 1-2 bars inside the house and 0-1 bars walking in the desert. The LG Encore with 3G (with goPhone coverage) gives me 3-4 bars in the house and 4-5 bars walking in the desert!! It also has a great MP3 player along with excellent Bluetooth support.This phone is considered a \"feature\" phone and NOTa \"smartphone\" as it does not use an operating system like Android, Windows etc. Thus, really no \"apps\" for it. It is small and light, making it very handy to fit in your pocket. On the other hand, it's relative small screen (compared to a smartphone) makes going on the internet kinda cumbersome. I just use it myself for when really necessary rather than surfing. Still, with the AT&T; goPhone $50.00 unlimited plan you get unlimited internet usage without needing an additional data plan. (Feature phones only)On the downside, it uses a resistive touchscreen. Resistive type touchscreens require much more pressure to activate than capacitive touchscreens. Thus, on occasion it does not initially respond to your touches. Resistive also makes doing text more difficult. Not a problem for me as I do not text much. The backlight timer has a max of 60 seconds. Not enough for my tastes. Standard internal memory on it is also low along with no flash or autofocus on the camera.Still, with the minor cons, all in all, this is exactly what I need in a cellphone for now. Battery life is pretty good too.Tip-you can also use Mini Opera (version 7 or 4.4 (make sure when downloading you select \"other options\" and \"all certificates\") as an alternative Web browser.Update-after almost a year of use, this phone has beenproblem free save for an occasional freeze/lock-upwhereby you have to remove the battery and put it back in, to get it going again.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Regret It", "Author": "annacat", "ReviewID": "R22HKAWVJHTM2X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I thought a touch screen phone would be great!! I used to text on my IPod so I was used to it. BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. You have to pound on it for the touch screen to pick your touch up.
