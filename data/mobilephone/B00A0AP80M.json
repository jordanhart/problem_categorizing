What 's  the good of having a phone if I have to charge it every 6 hours ??- the phone gets hot (sometime very hot) after only 10 min when the screen is working on anything ( internet , game, local application, camera ..). It get too hot on back top of the phone and on the screen, this problem look to be common for sony smartphones..- the charger cable is \"too\" short (about 20 cm), what were the constructor thinking when they set the cable length ?? The only way to charge it easily is to put it on my computer desk and connect the cable to any usb entry ..I was looking to change my \"HTC one S\" with this smartphone but I admit that I'm really disoppointed", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cell, great format Sony!", "Author": "josell63 \"JoeBArg\"", "ReviewID": "R5LX9CDK1GLBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used it without problems.
