{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unbelievably bad camera, flimsy switch broke rapidly.", "Author": "no so-called", "ReviewID": "R5WC3FR9SVM3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1) The camera is astonishingly bad, incomparably worse than any phone camera I've ever seen. It is not fit for purpose. If light conditions aren't absolutely perfect (and sometimes if they are), the autofocus spastically hunts around for several seconds, frequently ending up extremely blurred. To have any hope of getting a picture that's in focus, you MUST double-tap the screen on a chosen focus point, and wait while it thrashes around for much longer than is normal for phone cameras. You then often have to repeat the process a few times before it is finally able to focus. I know phone cameras don't have great auto-focus, but this takes literally ten times as long to take a picture as any other smart phone I've seen -- including the previous Motorola Electrify M, which I owned and liked. It's not a small difference. It happens when I'm taking a picture where the center 50% of what's in view is the same distance from the camera, and it ends up focusing on nothing. Literally nothing: Not one object in view is in focus. This is not occasional or sporadic, it is normal. Two out of three times I take a picture, it is a long and frustrating struggle.2) The on/off/wake-up button stopped working after six months. I usually keep phones for years. I've never had this happen.Worthless junk. Don't buy it if you use the camera in your phone, or if you are in the habit of keeping phones for longer than six months.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Riley Seier", "ReviewID": "R20M205NT9SZRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone works great and was almost like brand new.

NEVER WORKS.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RT6HR5WNO74PE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I HATE this phone. It drops calls, freezes, the screen hardly works, and I did purchase it brand new from the US Cellular store.  Out of every 5 calls I attempt to make, only one call goes through. Speakers freeze up, so i canot listen to music, hear the other person on the end of the line, or go to speaker phone. No, I did not drop it is water, or drop it period. I got it 2 for $99 worst deal of my life. You can't take out the battery and restart it because you cannot open the battery case!  I hate it. I am now going for iPhone5.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BQGRBHC"}}
