{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good one!", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R25M9CA13JPXNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this one to replace my big-screen (5.5\") no-name Samsung clone. Cubot GT72 turned out to be a very good phone. It has very good reception in places where my old one failed to get any. Extremely good battery life (take that with a grain of salt since my previous 5.5\" phone needed to be charged every day). I tried to use GT72 only as a phone, with occasional picture/movie taking, and the battery lasted for over 10 days. I tried to push it harder after the next charge and was able to go for about 13 days and 10 hours on one battery! After that I bought Cubot (a different model, though) for my wife. Would recommend it to anybody!", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$85.98", "Features": "High performance dual core MTK6572 1.2GHz processor Android 4.2 operating system to download apps Supports Wi-Fi, G-sensor, Bluetooth, and FM radio 0.3MP front camera and 2.0MP rear camera Supports an external TF card up to 16GB", "Name": "Cubot GT72 - 4.0 Inch Android 4.2 Smartphone 1.2GHz Dual Core Dual SIM&Camera MTK6572 Bluetooth WiFi (Black,white)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PZ-Q31WJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DW580DY"}}
