I loved that phone, and the only reason I gave it up was because I got the iPhone 3G S Which I will say was a mistake. The propel did everything I needed it to do. It was always fast, and I don't remember having any complaints about the product. It was very durable, and there was little to no damage when I stopped using it.

I couldn't get another one from the at&t; store so I went with the AT&T; Evergreen , I didn't like it at all so I went to a Blackberry.,though that had some VERY real strengths to it it still wasn't for me.I then resigned myself to an AT&T; go phone . Someone suggested that I look around on Amazon for any spare Propels lying around and by golly I found some. I got 2 of them for 50 bucks each and couldn't be happier. Its easily opened and closed with one hand and my screen wallpaper is a photo of a fluorescent light . Its bright and white and when I slide my phone open its bright enough to read by.An EXCELLENT makeshift flashlight and though this phone doesnt have the latest bells and whistles (and there are some awesome ones out there) I am VERY happy with it.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great unlocked phone", "Author": "carmen garcia \"carmen\"", "ReviewID": "R1D2WAWOF7Y2K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a replacement.
