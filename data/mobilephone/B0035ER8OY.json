{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Biz Person", "ReviewID": "R3IS7H2OH8ZKYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why buy this top-of-the-line phone?I wanted the latest Android phone with fast processor, robust 3G where my laptop could tether to it and support for local WiFi hotspots.  The screen had to be excellent quality (this one is OLED!), fast touch interface for easy typing, 5MP+ camera (I have a SLR so this is just for back-up; I felt 5MP is fine because there is no point getting higher MP in a cellphone camera because the lenses are poor) with focus by touch and a built-in flashbulb, user-swappable batteries and memory cards.  And HTC was first preference due to the HTC Simple interface which is quite a slick addition to Android including superb Facebook and Twitter integration if you like that.  Oh and by the way, the whole phone should be ultra lightweight (the HD2 looked humongous to me and the Motorola Droid was both big and had a mushy keyboard) and normal use battery time at least a full day.  Furthermore, it had to have quadband since I travel all over and unlocked so I could swap in local SIM cards and get realistic data and calling rates.This was a lofty list, and the HTC Desire met everything on paper - I was excited to get it about a week ago.In hand, the HTC Desire has lived up to *everything* and surprises with decent voice quality, much faster responsiveness than I expected, a built-in FM Radio for kicks, easy Calendar and Contact synch with Outlook, haptic touchscreen, and longer battery life then I had expected easily covering a whole day or more.  Typing on this touchscreen is pretty nice.  It is also super lightwight and pocketable.  Wow!  HTC has done a first rate job.Flaws:  the whole front is a piece of glass so recommend you buy a scratch guard.  The back is simply a piece of plastic that you peel off to access the battery; do this too many times and I think a replacement back might be needed after year or so but so far no problems and it looks pretty secure.  The speaker has limited volume before it starts to clip - it's OK for speakerphone but no portable boombox.  The camera is OK not great image quality; you have to push in the little silver round joystick button to activate and I have had some camera shake trying to use this so it will really be last ditch... although one cool thing is really easy upload to Facebook and it has geotagging - again wow.No iTunes of course so you will not be able to port 'Protected' files without the 30-cent upgrade; after that try iSynch and you get songs and playlists too.  On the other hand, Android has tons of apps and a much more open environment for future app development.This only has one camera, whereas the EVO has a front-facing camera phone for video calls.  I guess the next-generation HTC may have that, but I needed a new 3G unlocked phone now and the laptop already has a webcam for Skype video so not really missing that feature too much.Caveats:  I have not had a chance to try the EDGE service yet; waiting for the right carrier SIM card; WiFi gives great results.  Note that I could only see 802.11a networks and not b/g/n... not sure if that is a hardware, software or user issue though.  I think that is the lowest common denominator standard and should work in most hotspots though.Overall - this is every feature I wanted and more in a sweet design.  Count me a satisfied - even thrilled - customer.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent for internet browsing, but has trouble with battery life", "Author": "Tolvanen Perttu", "ReviewID": "RGBDJYOGKVQHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose HTC Desire instead of iPhone4 since the open Android market seemed more interesting and active than the controlled Apple Store approach. After few weeks of usage Desire seems to be pretty even with iPhone4 in terms of usability and applications. The best feature by far is the great internet browsing experience. I am not surprised that few reviews even say that Desire is better for internet browsing than iPhone4. Desire really works for users like me who spend a lot of time reading blogs, news etc. with their phone. The screen is great, phone is fast, responsive and zooming works well. Only some really heavy sites are slow or have trouble loading.The only downside of the phone is the horrible battery lifetime. I cant really get by even a full day without recharging. The phone really needs a second battery to go with. For me this is ok since the same problem seems to be with every smartphone right now. And with Desire I can atleast buy the second battery and a loading station (which does however add around 50 euros more price).Besides the second battery Desire also needs an additional memory card (eg. 16GB card which can be around 50 euros as of this writing).", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "HTC Desire A8181 Android Smartphone", "Author": "CM", "ReviewID": "R20X4W4RBPBNNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good phone with all the modern features that a modern executive needs.

Only complain is that screen is hard to read in the sun.

Mohammed \"almmohd\"", "ReviewID": "R1W41B1GUHV7XJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a replacement for my iphone 3g, so I bought this phone. It's great, the screen and colours are beautiful. The phone feels a little heavy too. It's fast though and movies look crisp and pretty. It's as good as the iphone in every respect and with the added features of froyo it's even better. A couple things to keep in mind, the iphone's app store has it beat still, the email app could be a little easier to use: iphone's is better, I have a 16 gb card in it, the card has 5gb free but the phone keeps telling me it has low space because the internal memory is nearly full. They say that in time more apps will have the ability to be stored on the sd card, this only became possible with the new OS froyo. Oh the live wallpapers though are excellent, I have downloaded a number of the free ones. My favourite is a fish wallpaper, when you tap the screen the fish get fed and they look so real, I just love that. The 5mp camera takes great shots and is very clear, better than what was on the 3g and I didn't have to jailbreak it to take video: YOU HEAR THAT APPLE!?!", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "A.

But to be honest my Android experience has bee less-than-spectacular. I have found many aspects lacking in email support on Andriod (2.2). First, the Active-sync abilities are poor at best. Most users (me included) report that they have numerous problems with Exchange email sync. I personally have not been able (despite many attempts) to ever get a clean sync. Another issue is the lack of HTML support in email. if you like plain text email then you will like Android.I have decided to go back to Iphone as the Active sync with Exchange works very well and the HTML features in email are very pleasant and similar to using your laptop to do email. By the way I have also attempted to try two other Androids after the Desire (Dell Venue and HTC Inspire 4G). Both are Android 2.2 phones and both has similar issues with email.Bottom line...If you are needing Exchange support from your mobile phone you may want to skip Android.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "3.7-inch AMOLED display\nGSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, HSPA/WCDMA: 900/2100 MHz, Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 b/g, Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP for wireless stereo headsets, GPS with A-GPS support.
