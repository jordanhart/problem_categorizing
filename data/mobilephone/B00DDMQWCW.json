Since I shall be traveling to Europe eminently, I wanted to be able to access the Internet for international information and communication. I am a novice with cell phone technology and am attempting to learn about my first smartphone,  required SIM connections, and information available with apps via the Internet. The satelite reception for my area is poor to non-existent, so I have not rushed to purchase a smart phone.  I received my package promptly. However, I thought I had a problem since both the T-Mobile sales person and I were unable to power up the phone.  I'm unsure as to the sales person's problem.  Yes, I was blonde in my younger days.  And there is a steep learning curve for us old folks with technology.Troy with TechCell2013 very graciously offered to exchange the phone for another, pay for the extra shipping, and include extras for the inconvenience.  Troy found that the phone did indeed power up and he re-shipped the phone after turtoring me with the location of the power switch.  There was an unexpected delay in the re-shipment.  Troy explained that he had a family emergency that detained the preparation and re-shipment.  I can recommend both the Galaxy S4 unlocked phone and any purchase from TechCell2013.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DDMQWCW"}}
