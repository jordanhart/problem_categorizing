The only real complaint I have is that you can't zoom when recording video.  But to have unlimited talk, text and web plus the Android OS for $50 a month (or less if you sign up for automatic monthly payments), I really can't complain.Regarding the other reviewer who called this phone crappy and only gave it one star, I don't understand why hers doesn't work, because my boyfriend and I each got one of these phones and we love it.  I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smart phone without a contract.EDITED after I had this phone for 11 months (1/13/2013):  this has been a great starter smartphone for me.  I love it and now that I've had it for a while, I decided two things I will get with my next phone:  a front-facing camera and a phone with more internal storage.  This one doesn't have a lot of internal storage space but again, it's a great little starter phone, and I use my SD card to store most of my apps.I will also make sure my next phone has a newer version of Android as this one only runs Gingerbread and I don't know if it's due to the OS or the phone itself, but I can't install Adobe Flash Player on this phone, which limits some of the things I can do (although it really doesn't impact my daily life).  Some newer games aren't compatible with the phone, such as Bad Piggies, but I can play all the Angry Birds games so I'm okay with that.I went from using a flip phone that only made calls and texted to this first smartphone for me and it has been an enjoyable experience.  I only pay $45 a month (plus tax) since I signed up for the auto-pay on my monthly bill and I've been really happy with this little phone.  I've been looking at other prepaid phones and even almost a year later, this one is hard to beat for the price.  If you want a bigger, better, phone you are going to pay more money to get it and I didn't want to pay more for my first smartphone.If I had to do it all again knowing what I know now about this phone, I would definitely buy it again.  My husband and I are both happy with these phones.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A note to customers", "Author": "Nicole Marie \"NM\"", "ReviewID": "R36YQ0M5PD3P0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone works great and the phone service is great. A note to customers, if you go from a SIM card phone to the android which does not have a SIM card(and this can apply to any Net 10 phones) it will take 2 business days to transfer due to some complicated issues moving your current phone number to the new Net 10 phone. The negative reviews all seem to be about Net 10 customer service and not the phone itself. If people have patience and realize that customer service provided by a company is not the product, the reviews would be more positive.

Aside from that, this phone is the best Net10 has right now I'd say. No additional smartphone fees like there were when I had AT&T.; However, within about a month of having it, the battery life greatly decreases. The phone requires a charge every day, which I find annoying. It crashes a lot when I'm sending or receiving a text message. Sometimes it even shuts down and starts back up. But, I can put all my music on it, thanks to the micro SD card capability. It comes with a 4gb card, but you can get up to 64gb I believe.

Well, thank God this phone isn't a person, because I have nothing but bad things to say about this phone. Let's start off with the super-bad, and go from there.1) This phone only has .20G of memory. That is a period in front of that 20. That means there's 213 MB of free space. Now subtract the Google Play Store (10MB) and the new Google Play Store Services (7MB). Now let's assume that you can't live without Facebook (24MB), or your non-google Email Client (at least 5MB). Oh, and also let's say you don't like your launcher, so you install ADW Launcher (4MB) Suddenly, you're looking at only 163MB of free space. That's 1/15th of a Gigabyte. Most phones, even some of the other phones on Net10 and Virgin have 1, 2, and 4 GBs for roughly the same price.2) Now let's look at the RAM that this phone has. A \"whopping\" 397MB. Most phones come standard with 512MB. But don't expect to be pushing this phone to the max. Oh no, the phone starts stuttering and freezing at about half that, at 170, 180MB. Now, part of that is due to the proccessor of this phone (which I honestly don't know what kind of processor is in this infernal thing), but if I have almost 400MB of RAM, I expect to be able to use a bit more than half of that.3) I know this is a small caveat in the Android Prepaid world, but this particular phone only comes with Gingerbread 2.3.4. At the time this phone was released, 2.3.6 had already come out, and that release had some major security fixes involved. I'm not asking for ICS right out of the box. I'm just asking Net10 to release major bugfixes. (Also, don't try to update it via LG's version of KIES, because it won't work.)4) There's something faulty about the chipset in this particular phone. I have had Sprint phones before with no problems whatsoever. On this phone, it cannot for the life of itself, keep a steady connection, be that 3G, 1x or no internet, or even any connection at all. This phone is constantly, *constantly* fluctuating. It's infuriating.Let's just say that I'm really glad that I'm getting a new phone soon. You can be sure that after I get my new phone, this one will have a lovely encounter with the sidewalk.Don't buy this phone.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R1LXIR821ERVYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So finally into the modern world with a smart phone.

Net 10 seems to have coverage where others do not.  i have never had trouble switching phones or phone numbers.

I just pray I dont have to use their cust svc they do put U on hold for painfully long times, I usually end up losing my temper after I hang up or jst shortly b/f, b/c of their ignorance.  BUt I guess it is their job to burn up as many minutes as they can if u have the unlimited plan.  IF u do, unless u direly need them u wont hold.  THat being said I once was going to be given 30 min credit for my complaining (this was b/f I puchased unlimited obviously) & I held for 20 min & she was still working on credit & saying ever 5 min or so 'one moment'  finally I hung up as it would have taking me 30 min to hold for my 30 min credit.

For the price you can't go wrong. For most tasks it works great and I haven't had any problem with the basics. Do note that if you want to run the latest apps, some won't work. But most will. This phone runs Android 2.3 \"Gingerbread\" and may be considered to be a bit dated compared to the newest Android versions, but for a first time smartphone user this isn't a big deal. It runs well and doesn't seem slow to me. Browses the net, plays online videos and streaming music, plays MP3s, whatever you need. It also recognizes voice commands and you can talk instead of typing and have it convert your speech to text. There really isn't much that this phone can't do.My only complaint is that if you like to play with it a lot, keep the charger handy.  Internet browsing and streaming media will sap the battery life quickly. I like to play Pandora in my car and games on it at work, and as a result I have to charge it every night.

Last week, I placed an order for the LG Optimus phone, which the customer service said would work in my area. I recently moved to another state and need to keep in touch with my parents, so a WORKING phone is important! The day I got my phone in the mail I activated it. In order to active it, though, you have to pay for the airtime. The phone I got requires the $50 unlimited plan, so I forked out the money to get it activated that night. I ended up calling Net10 in the morning because I was getting NO RECEPTION for my phone. The customer service representative was awful. She asked me the same question over and over again. \"Do you live in areas with trees?\" \"So...when is your phone dropping calls?\" It was as though she didn't even know the product or the service they were offering. After answering these questions repeatedly the line would go quiet for 5 minutes. She'd come back and say \"Give me a moment while I help you.\" She ended up telling me that there was an outage in the WHOLE state of Missouri (I asked for clarification, because it's weird that it encompasses the entire state and not just my area) and it would be resolved in 48 hours. I called back after allowing time for the \"outage\" to be fixed. I asked to speak to a manager this time because it was my second time calling customer service and not having anything resolved. I was very polite with the manager, up until she started acting like I was obnoxious. I explained to her that my phone wasn't working. Could barely HEAR her because she was talking quietly. My phone volume was all the way up (was using an alternate phone to call). She told me, again, that there was an outage in my area and that it would be fixed within 48 hours. I explained that the phone doesn't work and that the previous associate told me it came from Sprint. I'd actually called Sprint itself and they said their towers were experiencing NO issues in my area. I asked the manager if they could refund me for the $50 I cannot use because the phone doesn't work. She said, \"Our company does not do that.\" I asked her if she would be willing to make a one time exception and she said no. So just to let people know, Net10 is having you pay for service they will not deliver. Their customer service is horrendous and I am fed up. Will be moving to US Cellular. If you want terrible service, money stolen from you for un-serviceable phones, then choose Net10. If not, you're better spending your money elsewhere.

I did own the new galaxy S from verizon and i thought that I was getting a great deal but I was so wrong. This phone has EVERYTHING that any other smartphone has, it is very fast, like 2 seconds after clicking a youtube video it is already playing the video with no lag, and I only have 1 bar of service at my house cuz I live next to the river! when I leave my house I get full service though so it's not an issue with the phone just where i live. with verizon I couldnt get service in my house so this phone is so amazing. it has the full android market and can download any app from it. it comes with swype on the keyboard <3 comes with all the live wallpapers that most smartphones come with and even comes with several very nice regular wallpapers. the camera is a 3.2 mp which isnt as good as the ones on the new smart phones because most of them are 5.0 mp but it still takes amazing photos unless you are in the dark then it sucks because it doesnt have a flash. but other than that, the no flash is the only negative thing about this phone. everything else is great. the 3.5 in touch screen is extremely fast and very responsive with no lag. AND the best part about all of this is I only pay $50 a month for unlimited text, talk, web, data, etc. with verizon I was paying over $100. I could not have asked for a better phone and I am sooo glad that I bought it.  BUT before you buy this off amazon call net10 and make sure this model of phone id available for the area you live in because when I tried to activate mine it asks you to enter your zip code and mine wasnt covered in my hometown so I had to keep entering in different zip codes and finally I entered one of a city close by and it worked but be careful doing that because you might not get good service.

I bought this device during one of the holiday 'doorbuster' sales for about $30, so I figured the worst that could happen is that it would suck and I'd just dump it and go back to the old one. But I've been pleasantly surprised. The call quality is good and the 3G service is decent. I've read some complaints about its 800 mhz processor, but I haven't noticed any major problems with its overall speed. Negatives: It only comes with 4 gb of external memory, so you'll need to buy more if you plan to download additional apps. It's a serious power-gobbler. Whatever claim LG makes about standby time is nonsense. Even after eliminating unneeded background programs, I'm having to power it up once or twice per day (and I'm not the kind who's on it all day long). It also feels a little flimsy and fragile, so I bought a case for it right away. Note: I have phone service with Net10, and it's pretty good. But I had a problem when I switched my number from the old phone. I have unlimited talk/text/web service for $50 that I bill monthly to a credit card. When I did the switch, everything worked fine for a few days. Then on the day my account was due to be rebilled, Net10 cancelled it for some reason without notifying me, leaving me with no service. After a 30-minute wait to speak to their customer service department, they reconnected me. Keep this in mind if you're in the same situation with Net10.

NET10 PHONE EVER!!!!!!", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R1PMBWPDA6289W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is really cool. This is the best phone from net10 I think yet. This phone to be completly honest ONLY takes the $50 unlimited net10 card...not the other airtime minute cards except the $65 International card. This phone has a GPS navigation, Android market to download apps that has over 250,000 apps, five home screens, download music, wifi conectivity, and more. However,this phone does not have a front facing camera, it has a 3.5 megapixel back camera along with video recorder. This phone comes preloaded with youtube aswell. The screen sensitivity is really good compared to the older net10 models. The phoene is made from LG and services of Net10. It has different locks (pattern lock, password, or just the plain android unlocking screen.) Supports live wallpapers and regular walpapers. Unlimites entrys for the phonebook. Uses of email/Gmail. Internet capability. Has built in video search for google and the phone. Has a scroll up and down screen for the menu. This phone does not comewith a built in slinding keyboard, but has a keyboard that supports android keybored, swipe, and others. This phone does not exactly have the best battery power but in a slip found in the net10 phone box when you get it, carries a paper that tells you keys to your phone which includes a key on how to maintain your battery power. This phone has sync power. The charger comes with a USB and a wall connecter.Now I will talk about the Net10 service... The service is not the best I have to say. It takes a while to get on the phone with a representative and sometimes the representatives do not speak very good english. The plus side is that they do get the problem fixed with whatever your problem is. The phone comes with a one year warrenty I believe from Net10.The phone uses an unlimited airtime card as I said earlier. The cards are found in most stores like Acme, Walmart, Bestbuy, Target... usually any store that sells giftcards or prepaid cards. The card is around $50 for unllimited talk, text, internet, 411, data, and more for one month. There is also an international card for $65 witch includes unllimited internation talk, text, internet, 411, data, and more for one month. To put the airtime into your phone when activating, call net10 (1-877-836-2368)and start activating your phone... during activation, the voice will ask you for the card (if you do not have the card when activating, your phone will not activate until the airime card is put in so after buying the card you will need to recall net10 and try activating it agin with the card. However, if you already have the phone and need to add the airtime card either go on the net10 website and click \"add airtime\", or call net10 and follow the instructions to adding the card to your phoen.Overall, the phone is a really great phone and a really great phone if your looking to buy an unlimited android smartphone plan for chaep and not have to worry about hidden fees or late fees.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "No coverage", "Author": "Enigmas", "ReviewID": "R1G96PK2R83N3M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well how can I put this...I purchased this phone, I even purchased the black plastis cover.

Decent phone and to be fair, my wife has been with Net 10 for awhile and with no problems. But be prepared if you ever have to call customer service, it is lousy. The reps have been courteous, but their technical understanding is limited and their answer to everything (after an hour on the phone) is to send you a new phone or sim card. This is the following letter I sent, take it with a grain of salt as this may not be the typical experience, but for me it has been a nightmare! I have never dealt with such a high level of incompetence from a large company. I am sharing the letter I sent them as a way to offer a review of the customer service you can expect should you ever have an issue with your phone.To Whom It May Concern:  I am writing this letter to let you know how highly disappointed I have been with the service I have received from Net 10 in the last 45 days after starting out initially with no problems.  The level of difficulties I have had recently with just getting basic service has grown to ridiculous proportions.  I have never experienced anything like it and am to a point I am about ready to discontinue my service and make sure everyone I know hears about the lousy service I have received.  I believe after detailing my experience below any consumer would rightfully understand my level of frustration with your company right now.  My wife has had her phone service with Net 10 for several months now without problem.  Several months ago she convinced me to switch my service from AT&T; and bought me one of your phones.  The price was good and it cut my phone bill in half and so I was pleased to give it a try.  I was even able to bring over the phone # which I have had for the past 5 years or more with AT&T.;  I activated my phone with you under the $25 a month recurring plan for 750 minutes. I had no problems keeping my old phone#, it was ported over from AT&T; without incident. Every month Net 10 charged the credit card I provided and my service continued uninterrupted.  Everything worked fine for the first few months, my service was great, you automatically charged my card, and my service continued with no problems.  In October when Daylight Savings Time ended, for some reason my phone's time did not update with the change.  My wife has the exact same phone and service with Net 10, and her phone's time updated.  Mine did not.  I turned the phone off, took out the battery and reset it several times to no avail.  Still the time did not update. I waited for about a week and continued to try to reset it and nothing.  This is where everything went downhill.  Because I feel that the moment I contacted your customer service, instead of the issue being fixed it was made worse by the customer service reps who do not seem to understand how to fix the issues that come up.  I thought that maybe all that would need to be done is they could send a signal to the phone or something to make the phone update the time.  However, after spending roughly 1 hour on the phone I was finally told that I would have to be sent a new phone.  Fine, I thought, it was no charge to me to send a new phone, I was even told I could still keep my phone # (remember, I had this # for the last 5 years or more and a lot of people I have given this # to know this as the only way to contact me).  When my new phone arrived I followed the instructions to activate it.  I went to your website to activate the new phone.  When I did so, I was given a new phone # !!!!!  I did not want a new phone #, I wanted to keep my old # and had been told I could keep my old #.  And since I was able to bring that old # over from AT&T; with no issues, I did not understand why I would not be able to just transfer the same # from one Net 10 phone to another Net 10 phone.  Does it not stand to reason that if you can bring the # from one carrier to another, then transferring the # within the same carrier should be just as easy???  I called to find out why my phone # did not transfer to the new Net 10 phone and spent an hour on the phone while the representative tried all sorts of things but didn't seem to have any answer or even didn't really seem to have an understanding of what I was asking to do.  She did some things on her computer and then told me it should be working finally, to turn off my phone and turn it back on right away and it should have my old phone # on it.  I did what she said, but nothing.  Still had the new # that I did not want.  She advised it could take 30 minutes, to wait and check then.  So I hung up and waited an hour.  Still nothing.  The phone still had the new #.  So I made another call to your customer service and wasted another 2 hours of my life being transferred from one representative to the next when what one would try wasn't working.  This happened three times before I finally told the third representative that all she was trying to do was the exact same thing that didn't work that the previous 2 tried to do.  All I wanted to do was find out how to resolve being given a new phone# when I was told and supposedly the phone that was sent out to me was supposed to keep the same #, it was just supposed to be transferred to the new phone.  Nobody seemed to have an answer and would give me some code to enter into my phone and tell me to turn the phone off and turn it back on.  Nothing worked.  Finally I was transferred to a \"supervisor\" who told that my old phone # belonged to AT&T; and that the number had \"expired\" and I could no longer keep that number ????  This made no sense as I had been able to port that number initially from AT&T; when I switched my service to you and it was only as a result of having to be sent a replacement phone that my problems with trying to keep that phone # began.  What I really suspect is that one of the customer service representatives may have not done something correctly in the course of trying to assist me ( this is actually a recurring theme every time I have called customer service in which in trying to resolve issues I feel that they are made worse!!)  I finally accepted that if I had to have a new # then fine, I would just have to update all of my accounts, acquaintances, etc with my new phone #.  An inconvenience, but I could manage.  However, in the course of trying to wrap up the call, another issues arose with them trying to just activate the replacement phone and I was advised that I would have to be sent a new sim card for the phone.  When I received the new sim card I called to activate that and attach it and at this point I was once again given a new phone # !!!!!  I have now had my phone # changed twice from what it was originally!!!  I won't go on with all the details of that call, but once again it was at least an hour while the rep fiddled around with things.  However, I made it very clear in activating everything that I was on the monthly $25 plan for 750 minutes with recurring billing and I wanted to remain on that plan.  That was a month ago.  What has prompted me to write this letter is that at this point I feel that customer service issues are the norm with your company as it has happened once again and I am losing confidence that anyone there knows what is going on or how to resolve issues.  My phone service should have continued uninterrupted as I was on the MONTHLY RECURRING $25 FOR 750 MINUTE PLAN that automatically charges my card each month ( and yes, there was more than enough money in my account to cover the charge ).  Well...... I try to call home on my way home from work and am told my service is discontinued and I need to call customer service to purchase more airtime ?!?!?  Once I arrived home I immediately got on the phone to customer service ( and once again spent an hour and a half ).  I do not believe that the rep understood what I was trying to explain.  All I wanted to do was have my service reactivated on the same $25 for 750 minutes monthly plan that I was on.  Well, she fiddled around on the computer and couldn't seem to get anywhere and kept telling me that my phone was deactivated and I would have to reactivate it first.  So I said ok let's do that.  Then she said I would have to buy an airtime card in order to reactivate it.  I don't buy airtime cards, I am on the monthly plan.  I did not have to buy an airtime card the very first time I got a phone with Net 10 so none of this was making sense ( actually everything I have ever been told by your customer service people does not make sense ).  The rep advised that for whatever reason she could not just reactivate my phone on the monthly plan, I had to first buy an airtime card, and then once that was done she could reactivate the phone and then I would be able to enroll in the monthly plan after that if I so wished.  So I finally agreed and just said I'll do the $15 for 200 minutes airtime card and gave her the card # I have on file with you.  The charge went through ( I verified it on my bank account you charged me $16.39 ), and it was approved.  However, there was some problem ( gee, at this point that is no longer a surprise, of course there was a problem!!! ) and she was unable to reactivate my phone!!  She had to transfer me to a supervisor ( by the way, she was a supervisor that I had been transferred to previously ).  This new supervisor fiddled around on his computer before finally telling me he was going to have to send me a new sim card ( is this your answer to every issue, we'll just send you a new sim card and cross our fingers that you won't be calling us back at least for 30 days ?? ).  I was told that I would have to once again get a new phone #.... apparently if I wanted to keep the phone # that I now had the warehouse was going to have to match the phone # to the sim card and this and that, and the fact that the simplest of tasks have been messed up constantly by Net 10 I did not want to complicate matters anymore and said fine, just give me a new phone # once AGAIN, and let's keep this simple.  In the meantime, while I wait for this new sim card to come out, I am without phone service!!!  My children, my wife have no way of getting ahold of me and I have no way of calling.  This is a huge inconvenience.  What is more, after my experience of the last 45 days with Net 10 and the mind boggling ways in which you have been able to completely screw up my service, I have very little confidence that this latest fix is going to resolve anything.  I'm sure my phone will work for 30 days but when it comes time to renew my MONTHLY $25 FOR 750 MINUTE PLAN ( not airtime cards, your monthly plan ), that I will probably go through the same problem once again.  I am giving Net 10 one more chance to resolve this and make it right.  At this point I am regretting having switched my service from AT&T; and realize that I guess you get what you pay for and I shouldn't have expected much.  I really did not expect a whole lot, but would have been perfectly happy just having a phone that worked and a plan that worked the way that it was supposed to.  I know once I receive my sim card I am going to have to call to activate my phone, and to be honest I am dreading that as it seems every time I have called, someone has found a way to mess my service up.  I'm sure I am not the only one experiencing these issues and I would hope that you take serious consideration into the quality and training of your support personnel. Their demeanor has been very courteous and I have nothing against them, but in my several interactions with trying to resolve my issues I get the impression that they are probably trained and able to handle the most basic and routine tasks, but that you do not have a system in place to handle more complex issues that are out of their realm, and by them trying to tackle those issues, they make matters worse.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Im about to get one.", "Author": "Goose", "ReviewID": "R32RUNN8STST9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So im looking on this site for reviews on this phone, but I keep hearing bad views of Net10 not the phone.

But when the phone arrived we saw that it was necessary to put $50 unlimited plan for activating the mobile. We thought that is for only first time to activate. Also that plan was good 3g was working great. But i dont need 3g. So for the next month we thought to put that $30 but it was not allowed. Only $50 or 65 unlimited plan is allowed. we were totally disappointed. They should have mentioned it in the summary of the mobile. Also it is CDMA mobile. They didnt mention about this in any summary mentioned online for the mobile.Also the mobile is very slow while playing game like Angry Birds. If you start playing Angry Birds in this mobile you will be got frustrated.
