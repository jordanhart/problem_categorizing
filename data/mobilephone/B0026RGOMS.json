The phones goes dead in the middle of calls, the camera freezes, and the WiFi only works if you are no more than 10-15 feel from the WiFi access point.  Forget dreams of free calls over free Wifi.  At this point, I'll probably cut my losses and just pay the 200.00 excess profit cancellation fee and get a cheap phone.  I just can't afford the time to keep this thing going.

HANDS DOWN.", "Author": "Brian Park", "ReviewID": "RUZGSROFEWL26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this Curve for TWO FULL YEARS. It has another SOLID TWO years plus of life left in it.Quite frankly, this has been the best phone (not to mention the very first PDA I've bought) that has served me very well since 2007.Reading the reviews below me, there are a whole lot of negative reviews, and I actually understand why people have had such a hard time with this phone. This is a smart phone; it's kind of like a computer. You NEED to update the software (Operating System) on this phone in order for it to function properly, much like how Windows XP/Vista/7 or the MAC OS's periodically have fixes they suggest you download and set up.However, it's hard for people to know when to update their OS, and the solution is simple. Google. A good website [...]. They literally have ALL the information, OS updates, and features posted on that site. During the first 4 months I've had the Curve, I had problems left and right. The phone would freeze all of a sudden with that eternally spinning hour glass, or sometimes it would just shut off by itself, other times applications just would not work.The fix was simple: update the OS, do some research on the internet, and don't trust the tech support from whatever carrier you're using, b/c they're just as lost as you are. The original OS on the Curve was a 4.2 version; the buggiest of all. ALL you needed to do to get your Curve running PERFECTLY was to update it to 4.5. Ever since I did that, this phone was fail-proof.I have used this phone everyday for two years. I've made regular calls, Wifi calls, browsed the internet, downloaded many useful applications, took this phone with me to four different countries, dropped this phone on carpet, concrete, plastic tables, and on one occasion, a steel wall. I've taken this phone with me during my time in the Marine Corps when I was driving tactical vehicles around. This phone has survived a 6' drop from the driver's side door of a Oshkosh MTVR onto hardened dirt on the grounds of Ft. Knox.I've used this phone through the heat, humidity, rain and freezing cold.This phone is still in my pocket, ready to go at a moment's notice. Everyone's experiences and reviews may differ from one another, but for me, this phone is good to go.Once you have updated the OS, this phone will serve you well.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry doesn't work before a year of use", "Author": "Monica Derizans \"mde\"", "ReviewID": "R20PLIFRJRY0XK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Incredible !!!!
