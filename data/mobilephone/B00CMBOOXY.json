Gone is the hourglass timer of death. Slight learning curve but easy to figure out (very much like the BB playbook), If you get lost just swipe up from bottom of screen to minimise and start over.Terrific keyboard and predictive text, bye bye typos. One of the few smartphone to have a replaceable battery, A BIG plus. Still the most secure email of any smartphone. I wish they would come out with a touch only that looks as great as the Q10, the Z10 is kind of boring.

I love it!", "Author": "Andreas Hartmann", "ReviewID": "R14HGV3A4A6DTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "but I hate the store who sold it: It labeled it \"NORTH AMERICAN LTE VERSION (SQN100-3) BLACK\", I specifically asked for the SQN100-3 and I got a SQN100-5. I DON'T WANT SQN100-5 but SQN100-3. that's why I double checked. I better be able to return this and get the right one without restocking fee and stuff. not happy.---OK - update on this review (now 5 stars, you noticed): Eventually the SQN100-3 arrived. After some getting used to it not having a decent menu and back key, even worse, a physical or optical trackball for moving around the mousepointer (there is no mousepointer anymore!!!), I'm slowly getting use to it, and do like some of the things indeed. I still believe that the core-users of Blackberry phones are folks like me who don't like typing on a screen-keyboard, simple because no physical key-feeling/feedback. Blackberry should not do the 'me-too' option as far as navigation with gestures on the screen, should instead combine the features of a SQN10 with trackball for moving a mousepointer around the screen more accurately, and not having to touch and smear the screen. It's beautiful crisp, high-contrast screen is not made for touching & greasing...Side note on the store - the first SQN100 I got was missing the headsets I noticed after getting the new one. The box had these nice headsets!!! So if you're getting a BB, make sure it comes with the headsets out-of-the-box!!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Efficiency and ease.", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "RE5IJ33JQFID7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Q10 is the best communication device for more the market today!

Not user friendly at all and not anything like the previous version.Second- The Blackberry Desktop App for my Laptop does not support the Q10. As a matter of fact, it couldn't even recognize the new phone. If RIM was really pushing their new phones, you would have thought they would have built a computer package that would sinc with the new product.I spent a day trying to like this new BB and finally gave up and returned it.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$584.99", "Features": "blackberry q10 factory unlocked\nq10 unlocked", "Name": "NEW BLACKBERRY Q10 NORTH AMERICAN LTE VERSION (SQN100-3) BLACK", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mGYbEA2NL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CMBOOXY"}}
