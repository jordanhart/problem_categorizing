I dont want a data plan, and was having a hard time finding a phone that was just a phone with txting. The texting is easy, and my only complaint would be that the T9 words will choose G instead of I every time and I haven't figured out how to override it yet.The camera take OK pics. Not great, not terrible.The video is not a good quality when not viewed on the phone. On the phone its great.The call signal/clarity is great.The battery has held up WONDERFULLY.Overall - this phone is absolutely worth the price and is not causing me any issues or undue issues.

Lowder", "ReviewID": "R13665A8V8I0I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a pretty phone with an ugly soul. The user interface does not register a \"keypress\" if you linger a millisecond too long (for example, you press a button DELIBERATELY or EMPHATICALLY). It only registers a glancing tap. Then it takes so long to get to the next screen that I find myself tapping the button again-- at which point the phone goes to the next screen, registers a press on the \"back\" button (which is placed in exactly the wrong place) and jumps back to where you were. And sometimes it doesn't respond to any touch at all. Then I have to remove and replace the battery.When one is on a call, one must press the keypad button to go to the keypad for navigating phone menus. To hang up, one has to press the hide keypad, then press end. If you press the master menu button (physical button at the bottom), you have to hit the \"return to call\" bar that appears on the bottom of the screen to hang up a call. Is there no more elegant way?When the phone rings, you have to drag up the bar and jab \"answer\", which almost always fails to respond, and which is really close to the \"ignore\" button. I can't count how many times I've hung up on my wife this way.Every time I pull it out of my pocket, it is about to sign me on to some internet service that I didn't order and can't afford. It also infrequently pops up with random ads.Finding the PC software has been a wild goose chase. The battery has to be removed to get to the SD card-- well, maybe that's not a bad thing, but it was hard to find it...On the plus side:The phone is pretty and fits well in a pocket. I also got it at a bargain-basement price with a Verizon subscription.The voice recognition is activated by a button on the side (too close to the photo button, but not bad). Voice recognition works most of the time if there isn't too much background noise (but it has more than once interpreted \"no\" as \"yes\"). Scrolling works ok, and menu options are not bad. The packaged games are okay, but there is very limited compatibility (what IS this OS?) and you have to pay after 3-4 plays.In short, this phone makes me want to go back to phones with physical buttons.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple", "Author": "Sanman66", "ReviewID": "RGSQG1FVVYK29", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone for my 16yr old son as replacement for his old phone He doesn't have a data plan He just uses it to talk and text that's it.

It makes me want to roll over and die. It can handle one word in a text. Sometimes, even two. Once you reach the third word, the phone acts like you just pulled a gun on it, freezing for around 5 seconds. Then, it throws a random-ass letter in, whether it has been typed or not. The equivalent of throwing its keys at me, after I've held it at gunpoint. I hit backspace, to get rid of the gibberish letter. It blacks out, deleting all of the letters in the whole text. I slap it awake, rinse (waterboard) and repeat the entire process. The only thing I have found that helps with this phone (bane of my existence) is that when it begins to freeze as you type a text, if you punch the phone with about twenty pounds of force, right in the middle of the screen, it will accept the letter.

Loving the Jest, I decided to get another phone from Pantech--and I'm never doing it again. I absolutely hate this phone. As another reviewer said, \"it's slower than than Pluto's orbit, and at least Pluto is doing something.\" This is absolutely HORRIBLE! Texting is a disaster! If you text at a normal, non-97 year old person speed, then only about 12% of your letters will show up, and about 67% of that 12% will be the wrong letter. I type fast, but not like...EXTREMELY fast. It barely picks up anything I type. It's like this...*Touches Letter**Letter shows up 1/2 a second later**Touches another letter**Wrong letter shows up 2 seconds later*Then when typing normally...*Tries to type \"Gtg right now, in a hurry\"**Instead, \"Gg rht njwn sh ry\" shows up*Also, the touch screen is horrible. You have to forcefully PRESS the screen, not touch, to make it do something. Also, there is extremely limited customization. Their idea of \"wallpaper\" is the lock screen. (You can't change the main menu wallpaper) Battery life is horrible. Also, if you do decide to spend about $2 on data and download something like Social Beat, it doesn't truly close the app. It continues to use your data. I had to lock certain things on the phone because of this. The internal storage is crap for media and you run out of text memory a LOT faster than you should. I have to erase my messages every few days and I'm not text-crazy like most teens.OVERALL, I absolutely hate this phone and will be ordering an LG enV2 from Amazon shortly.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE!", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone Sucks", "Author": "Vanessa", "ReviewID": "R2F7KQUIEOVLR3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So i decided I would ignore all of the negative comments and get the phone so i did.

This concerned me because i could need it quickly for something, but it would freeze and i wouldn't be able to use it! So the Verizon store recommended that i call customer service and see what they had to say. So i called and they took me through at least an hour worth of button pressing and resetting and all that jazz, one week later it freezes again!! So i call again and they send me a new phone! This was exciting because i was sure that it would work and i would be much happier when this one does not freeze on me! Well it doesn't freeze (which is wonderful) but the vibration can totally broken! I checked every single setting and nothing will make the vibration work again! That was very upsetting because have your phone on vibrate is great when you are in a library or a place that requires you not to have sounds going off!
