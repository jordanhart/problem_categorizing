Lee", "ReviewID": "RKBML6A3OAYV5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i got this phone hoping the nokia brand would give me better reception in the office: it's mildly better than the last verizon phone i had.  i was disappointed: compared to my last 3 nokia phones, the sound quality on this phone lacks.the keyboard is great: rarely hit the wrong key. the twist feature is awesome, auto-locks the phone when you close it, and displays your choice of screen saver, with option to unlock and view messages, ignore or silence (but not answer) incoming calls without opening the phone.also disappointing was the lack of memory allocation control.  you have a limited amount of text memory, with no option to copy texts to micro-sd.  music player and speaker were FABULOUS but speaker quit the first time i dropped the phone, with a hard case on.  i've dropped other nokias tons of times (in water too) without a case and they remained undamaged.the software is ok at best, not very intuitive at all (symbian was very intuitive, even more than the iphone software, in my opinion).  you definitely have to hunt through some menus to change options outside the norm (eg, ringtone, etc), and the graphical interface is klunky, especially when it comes to texting, which is a shame given how amazing the keyboard is.all in all, if i were a teenager and didn't require much from my phone, i would be very happy with this one: it's cute, small, unique, has avatars, adequate ring tones, great screen and keyboard, easy to text on.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid phone!", "Author": "Grayson Hary", "ReviewID": "R1DQDMQELG2GE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by first saying this: The operating system that Verizon put on this phone, it is not bad itself, but it is awful looking. Horrible GUI, and a somewhat lackluster degree of organization. I think my Shih Tzu might have been able to create something more tasteful (ah, but I jest, she is merely a dog).Now, for the actual review. This phone is solid. I have dropped it, easily, thirty or more times, and it has yet to break! I was afraid that the pivoting design might be very delicate, but, having owned this phone for nearly four whole months, and having dropped, thrown, and scratched it a whole lot, it is still running strong.The only downside to the hardware is that the back doesn't really seem too well thought out, which is unusual for a Nokia device.Overall, but it, love it, show it to your friends, your mom, and everyone who walks by and says \"IS THAT A PHONE?!?!?\", and than proceeds to grab your phone and oogle and drool over it. BAM!", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Have loved this phone for 4 years", "Author": "DivaMommy", "ReviewID": "R1PGENR80HPGES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others I was warned by the verizon sales rep about this phone but fell in love with the shape and size. 4 years ago I had a baby on my hip and wanted something that would fit in most any pocket or be carried around my neck (the hinge is an open hole that I put a sunglass holder thing through.)  This has been dropped by me and my now 5 year old probably 100 times and the worst thing that happens is the battery falls out and I have to insert it again and start it up.  Recently I lost the mirror backing after dropping it and not realizing it but they included at purchase a second backing in midnight blue so I just snapped that on.  I've never had to service it and never had a battery life problem. I bought it at the Verizon store and it didn't come with a car charger but I found one at a gas station and then a second one for my husband's car at Big Lots for 4-7 dollars.How many phones fit in your back pocket completely?  While I don't text or do email this serves its purpose for me by being small, working constantly and dangit, just looking so darn cute.  I'm now looking to get a second phone on Amazon as Verizon doesn't sell this anymore and I'd hate to switch phones.  This week I think the snooze button didn't work once and twice this month the phone didn't ring but sent the calls eventually to voice mail so my little baby might be in her golden years and need to be put out to pasture.  But how many phones that have been dropped repeatedly would still be working after 4 years?UPDATE: It is with great sadness that I announce the end of my 5+ year old Nokia twist.  On vacation the joint-hole loosened and you can pull the two pieces apart about an inch, but they are connected still by a flat electrical tape-like cord and even with this tape half out and CRUNCHED between the two pieces when shut IT STILL WORKS! Its simply amazing and a true work horse.  I didn't buy my replacement twist as planned when the price shot up but now its more reasonable and I'm calling Verizon to confirm that they will set up my service on this.

Many basic phones can optionally use V-CAST data resources such as ringtones, etc., but not wanting them, I have always made sure that my plan with Verizon disallowed this sort of data use.

The battery still has a lot of life after a night of charging. No complaints at all.I had to add something to this.This phone is a beast. I dropped it in water...I really need to watch what I am doing..but I got the battery out really quickly. Dried it the best I could. Let it sit with the battery and back off. Phone works just as it did from day one! I really would recommend this phone for durability. I have dropped it running, multiple times. My umbrella cockatoo has gotten a hold of it...cracked by the \"ok\" button. I am amazed of the endurance of this phone....NO smartphone I have seen can withstand what this thing does.

Well, I like unusual, and I played with it at the store for a while, and liked how it felt, how easy it was to use, and how solid it seemed. I was not disappointed. The hole in the swivel area made it perfect to go on my keychain, where I never lose it or leave it behind. It has taken a LOT of abuse. The swivel hinge is solid, no wobbling or breaking. I tend to fidget with it a lot, flipping it open and shut, open and shut. No problems. No looseness or wobbling. Good reception, good sound, good software. Battery charge was awesome when I first got it, now is just average, but hey, it's 4yrs old on the same battery. I had an issue where I thought it wasn't charging anymore, turned out it was the CHARGER that wore out, not the phone. I just use my kindle charger for it now, and it works fine. I still get a good 2 days on a charge, with average usage. Less if I use bluetooth or have it on vibrate. Lots of useful features, well organized menu, and able to change around the menu to fit your needs. I have only one complaint, and that is verizon, not the phone -- due to an update with vz navigator and mobile email features, they're no longer accessible thru the main menu, they have to be accessed thru get-it-now. I created shortcuts in my shortcut menu, but still.... Occasionally also, since an update to the browser, it locks up when trying to reach a page that takes a lot of memory. never did that before the update. Verizon keeps trying to get me to get a new phone, but I haven't found one I like as much as this one though, for as much as I beat it up.

Over all I like this and think i was a good purchase, however it has a glitching problem that started late November. Every 3-4 sent/received texts, the screen will freeze black or it will simply not allow me to access any messages and I have to restart it. The glitch is inconvenient but can be worked around and considering the low price, not having to pay for a data plan or sign up for a new contract, and that it has worked well for me for over a year, I'm not super devastated about it. I think this phone would make a good short term replacement phone.Pros:+ QWERTY keyboard that is reasonably sized (great for people who dislike touchscreen)+ Easy to set up and navigate+ It's Small and easy to take with you.+ Doesn't scratch or break easily, and can stand a little rain.+ Attractive design and neat features (great for preteens/teens)+ Relatively Inexpensive (great for everyone but lets say parents and college kids like me)Cons:- You are unable to turn off the LED functions. For Instance, its super-bright flashing when you charge it, will keep you awake if you charge it overnight. It does this regardless of the phone being turned off.- Glitching problem within 1 1/2 years. Again, it's navigable, but time consuming and inconvenient.- Oversensitive touch buttons even on the lowest setting of sensitivity. Again navigable but annoying.I would say that this is an over-all decent product. I wouldn't buy it again but I think it's a viable option for people depending on your situation and what you're looking for. Even though, in the end, it was hard to deal with, I don't feel any buyers remorse toward the purchase of this product.

I wanted to find a unique Verizon phone that would be easy for texting and phone calls.  Through the reviews and pictures, I found the Nokia Twist to be extremely cute and functional.  I was right about one thing: it's a cute phone.  But, I'm afraid everything else about the phone is not up to snuff.  After just one day of having the phone, I became completely frustrated with the touch-sensitive buttons to the right and left of the 'ok' button.  They were constantly being pressed- even though I was no where near them- and I couldn't even enter my contacts without problems.  The battery only lasted half of the day, even thought I had charged the battery as soon as I received it.  Overall, I was disappointed with the Nokia Twist.  Here's my list of pros and cons:PROS-  Keyboard is nice, Design is very cute and unique, very compact for easy pocket storageCONS- Battery life is terrible, touch-sensitive keys on the front are annoying and don't work correctly, sorting through new messages is a pain (the 'sort by contact' option does not work)Take what you will from this review, but if I had to make the choice again I'd say go with another phone.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "eh", "Author": "Sami", "ReviewID": "R28GBKHFXQKNDV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Is awesome for the most part, however the quality for phone calls is dreadfully awful.
