{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good 4G LTE Phone, But...", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R3RT4786YDC721", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG F3 is one of the best small, light 4G LTE phones on the market. However, Sprint contract customers are offered several better phones at the price of one penny, including the LG Optimus G. For one hundred dollars more, contract customers are offered phones that are vastly superior that will have $200 trade-in value two years from now.The LG F3 truly shines in the pre-paid, off-contract market where it sells for $150 to $200 at MetroPcs, T-Mobile, and Virgin Mobile. The MetroPcs LG F3 phone combined with their $60 per month (all taxes and fees included) plan with unlimited calls, unlimited long distance, free wi-fi calls, unlimited texts, and unlimited 4G data is a huge bargain, half the price of a two year contract when all fees and taxes are factored in.So, while the LG F3 is a very good 4G LTE phone,  customers who are signing two year contracts are paying premium prices and should select premium phones such as the LG Optimus G that will have high trade-in and resale value two years from now. The LG F3 is a good buy ONLY when you buy it off-contract.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone for kids", "Author": "Frank Irvin", "ReviewID": "R302DYZDVEDLC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my daughter.
