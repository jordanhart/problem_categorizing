{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Red Nokia Asha 303 - excellent feature phone", "Author": "joel \"jk\"", "ReviewID": "R20IHVZ0PI3V22", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My parents were trying to find a phone with unlimited calls and SMS, a physical QWERTY keypad, and data that wouldn't break their budget.  I suggested Nokia's Asha 303, and my mom got the red one.  She loves the keys (having had the Nokia E75's sliding QWERTY before), and says typing is a bit faster than on the E75 since her fingers don't have to move as far.Overall, the phone has a solid build quality.  It comes with an FM radio receiver (the headphones are the antenna) and a decent internet radio app.  It handles phone calls exceptionally well, is a breeze to send SMS or multimedia messages, and has a decent web browser.  Access to the Nokia Store allows you to download and install additional S40 touchscreen apps.  You can customize the favorite contacts list on the home screen, and then can call or SMS simply by tapping their photo.She also downgraded from the E75 (an S60 smartphone) to the Asha S40 feature phone to avoid AT&T;'s mandatory $15/month minimal smartphone data charge.  She has the $50/month pre-paid unlimited talk, text, and non-smartphone data.  However, because the Asha 303 isn't officially supported on AT&T;'s network, she hasn't been able to get mobile data working on the phone, so she only has data via wifi.The only other two features she misses from her E75 are the far superior camera, and Jan Ole Suhr's excellent Gravity application (combined client for Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks).", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a Smart phone.", "Author": "9th year teacher", "ReviewID": "R2MKDS01ZORJE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Obviously!  Yet the touch screen interface makes operations easy, along w/the QWERTY keypad.  It has WIFI, and works w/social networking (for all the FBers out there).  It's a great buy for someone who can't spend the pretty penny on the smart phone, but still wants a communications device for texting, calling, and updating status.  The camera isn't anything to talk about.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "not what I expected", "Author": "Sandra M. Spannheimer", "ReviewID": "R2BUZTRI2Y9RXC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "bought this item as I am not a big fan of touch screens when using the phone for texting/emailing. However I got disappointed when it didnt have skype and the download told me it wasnt available for my device (will try again to find a solution) and that there is no easy way to turn off the internet when at my old model I could simply check to which internet it was connected (wifi or paid for) and disconnect it with a couple of clicks. Now it seems not even possible when signing up with whatsapp for example...Nokia really needs to work on the ease of using their phones as there is a lot to be considered", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Set to a different language", "Author": "Mrazivy", "ReviewID": "R2CXI5C0YLQAJE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was really happy with this phone until the first time I tried to compose a text message. The keyboard is apparently locked on Portuguese and when I when I try to use the shift or function keys to place punctuation into a message (such as : , ; ' etc.) instead it inserts special characters from the Portuguese alphabet. I referred to the manual (RTFM, right?) to correct the problem but closely following the instructions didn't help. Searching online for a solution only ended in further frustration. The vendor never responded to my e-mails. To make matters worse, the phone came with a European-standard charger despite being described as the US version (and the box was labelled \"Levantine\" so apparently it was originally destined for Beirut). One last word of warning: the number keys have very, very small labeling and are in an odd layout. If, like me, you like a physical keyboard on your phone, avoid this phone. I'd also advise you avoid this vendor.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I need.", "Author": "Flaming Horse", "ReviewID": "RTRTSFHZ07P20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone has a decent enough touchscreen. The home screen is super-customizable. The QWERTY isn't actually as bad to type with as it may seem. It just requires a few minutes to get used to it. With the small form factor, it's really easy to type with one hand, except for me since I have itty-bitty hands.If you're a regular Nokia user (not Lumia), it would be much, much easier to get used to the works of the user interface. The camera is only 3.2MP without flash, so don't expect SLR-quality photos. At the right side of the phone are the volume and lock buttons.By default, there are certain button which access common features, like when the space bar is held down, the wi-fi menu pops up. At the top side of the phone are three holes: charging port, USB (not exactly sure how to connect it as the product doesn't come with it, but the common Mini-USB to USB OTG doesn't seem to fit), and 3.5mm audio jack. When you're charging, don't be afraid to force down the plug into the phone until the white ring touched the top side of the phone.A good phone overall for one who isn't into Instagram and wants a touch phone that also has a physical keyboard and that won't hurt your wallet.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A hybrid smartphone that covers the basics", "Author": "ShotokanKid", "ReviewID": "R3QOFYLOVMJXS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Nokia Asha 303 is a wonderful little phone. It is like the Nokia E6's younger brother. It has the basic smartphone features to tide me over, good call quality and signal, very fast and stable wifi, responsive capacitive touchscreen, well-arranged qwerty keyboard, very clear display, excellent battery life, and a robust and quick-responding OS. Also it has a whopping 1Ghz CPU which allows me to enjoy many open apps without crashing or hanging. I feel that it is a better deal than the Nokia E5 Nokia E5-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, IM, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, Ovi Store with Apps, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black). If you want a versatile mobile phone for calling with a bit of \"smartness\" in it, consider the Nokia 303.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "BAD!!!!", "Author": "JUDITH ALTUVE", "ReviewID": "R2MRYXOPDUQUS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "APPARENTLY THE PHONE IS REBUILT TO JUST TOUCH BECAUSE YOU ARE FALLING KEYS!

I ordered this p hone on another site, sorry Amazon, because it was actually $10 less than what amazon offered it for.  And I got just in the  nick of time..on Christmas eve.The phone looked a little cheapy looking compared to the other attractively designed phones but I could live without that because the features on this phone is great for my needs!I love the fact thta the phone has both touch screen and keypad facilities.  It is simple to use and less distracting that the other smart phones out there.  I have two smart phones and somehow, I just like simplicity.  This phone is just good enough to do the basic things like calling someone, texting, setting an alarm and reminders. ...and the battery life is far better than those other smart phones that seem to last for just a day before you have to charge it up again.One thing I did not like though is the charger that came in the box was basically European with another socket to use for american outlets, however it was flimsy and not very secure when you put it in  an outlet to charge.  thankfully i have other Nokia charges that I could use with this phone so I am not complaining.I love NOkia and hope they don't go out of business because of the increasing competition.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great battery life", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3VWHG6UQJFU31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We wanted a non-smartphone for my son so we could avoid expensive data-plan fees and we could be sure he wasn't facebooking his friends when he is supposed to be in class.Pros: No data plan required. Drop the SIM card in and it works.  Battery life with WiFi off is amazing; my son gets over a week between charges.  Great Nokia hardware design with radio reception far better than most smartphonesCons: The screen resolution is low compared to the high resolution displays out today, but it is very usable.

But back on point - this semi-smart phone fulfills my needs at a good price.After the ordeal with my last phone, I realized all that counts for me in a phone is to be able to make calls and text.  I'm getting used to the mini keyboard and the smallish touch screen to get around the many features.  I was able to sync with Google contacts and setup my email accounts easily (although I did have to take extra steps to setup my Gmail because of security).  I'm able to access pics, videos, and music with the microSD of my old phone.  Even though the Nokia store is lacking, at least there were offerings of Facebook and WhatsApp.  Kinda wished the other apps I liked were available for Symbian S40: YouTube, Yelp, and Google Maps.  An unexpected plus is the phone's dataplan-saving features.  For example, it connects to recogized wifi sources when detected, converts and truncates emails to text with the option to view more, and asks you to confirm if you want to use your data plan to access internet items (which you can turn off, btw).  This is much appreciated as I only have a 200 MB 4G data cap.  To be honest, I probably would not notice if I was switched to 2G with this phone because it's so stingy with accessing the internet with my data plan.The battery will last more than a day if you don't keep checking Facebook or turning the screen on every 15 minutes.  The body feels a little flimsy with texture like a wet bar of soap, but adding a case and screen protector solves those issues easily.  With that said, it fits my hand and pockets nicely.Make no mistake, I'll probably get the next latest and greatest smartphone when it's convenient (iPhone 5S), but for now this phone fits the bill nicely for my needs.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Efren Aliendres", "ReviewID": "RM3X5Q4Q18SM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A pesar de lo mal que le ha ido a Nokia como compa\u00f1ia el producto se adapta al usuario.
