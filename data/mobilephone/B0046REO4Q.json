{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Bad, Save For Crippled Internet Access", "Author": "MyBeesWax \"A Music Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R1HY186VFCDS6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Target after I inadvertently cracked the LCD screen on my LG 300. This phone has some very nice features: Bluetooth, Digital Camera (1.3 Megapixels), microSD Card Slot, MP3 Player, and FM Radio. It also has a Browser, but you can only access the Net10 site with it; access to all other sites are restricted.I'll briefly touch on each of these and other features:- BluetoothThe bluetooth works surprisingly well. I can connect the phone to my iPAQ 111 Pocket PC using bluetooth for transferring files between the units. I also have no trouble connecting the phone to my Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS unit and my Plantronics Headset. Once my Nuvi is connected to the phone, I can use the Nuvi as a speaker phone. I can also use the Nuvi to dial and receive phone calls. SWEEeeet!- Digital CameraThe quality of the picture taken with the 1.3-megapixel camera is pretty good. Each JPEG file is typically less than 100 Kb.- microSD Card SlotThe microSD slot will only read a microSD card (2 GB or less), not a microSDHC (microSD, High Capacity - 4 GB or more). If you insert a microSDHC card, you will get the message: Please remove card and insert again.- MP3 PlayerThe sound quality through my Sony earphones is decent enough. The MP3 player, unfortunately, doesn't have an equalizer.- FM RadioThe FM Radio reception is as good as any portable radio. Since your earphones function as an antenna, the FM Radio won't work unless you have your earphones plugged in.- BrowserInternet access is restricted to only the Net10 Web site. (Interestingly, some people reportedly have full (unrestricted) Internet access on the browser.) I tried a few URL's (e.g. google) but each time I got the error message: HTTP error - forbidden.The Net10 Web site has links for Sports, Weather, and News. The page loads are excruciatingly slow! It can take a few minutes for a page to load, if at all. Sometimes, the page just hangs. You would have to be pretty desperate to want to use the browser!- e-mailI tried to e-mail an attachment a couple of times but had no success with it. 3.5 minutes (1 minute standard rate + 2.5 minutes e-mailing rate) were deducted from my account on _each_ attempt, even though the e-mail failed to get through! The error message: Sending failed: Connection error.o Miscellaneous FeaturesThe phone has all the \"standard\" features that come with most cell phones: polyphonic ring tones, games (e.g. Need For Speed - Carbon), and tools (e.g. calculator and alarm clock).o UsabilityService: The standby battery life is about 2 to 3 days. Cell phone reception from the Net10 service is decent enough (Net10 actually uses the AT&T; network). It comes with 300 minutes of free airtime (a 30-d0llar value).Volume Control: I really like the volume control buttons on the left side of the phone. You can quickly set the phone to Silent, Vibrate, or one of seven volume levels without having to wade through the menus.Form: The phone is very compact. It is the same size as the LG 300.---The biggest gripe I have about the phone is the crippled browser. Other than that, I don't really have very much else to complain about it. For me, an absolute must-have on a phone is bluetooth - and this feature works flawlessly on the EM 326g. Overall, I'm quite happy with it. For the price, it's really not a bad deal. If you're looking for a prepaid phone, this one's definitely worth consideration.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good Phone", "Author": "OnlineReviewer \"OnlineReviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R2GI7PKQGXQ1YV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Net10 LG300's keyboard died so I replaced it with this phone.

I also wanted it to have a standardized charger so I wouldn't have to lug any extra cables around. Here's hoping I'll never have to use it, I'll just throw this in my bag and forget it's there.This is a rather \"old\" phone in the world of cell phones. But if you needed something as a backup or a phone for a child or a person who needs a phone just in case, it's a nice phone, and at under $7 the price is great.MP3 player: Haven't used it yet, but it will accept up to a 2GB Micro SD card. Few hundred songs at the most.Camera: Better than VGA, but at 1.3 megapixels don't expect much.FM Radio: Surprisingly nice. You do need to plug in headphones to make it work (They function as the antenna). But once you have the headphones in, you can set it to play through the speakerphone. I haven't listened to FM radio in years thanks to Sirius and Pandora but the few minutes I played around with it I was pleasantly surprised with the reception and clarity.Voice recorder: Works as you'd imagine.Flashlight; What they call a lantern is actually just the screen of the phone turning white. Might help you find your keys in the dark, or serve as \"something\" in an emergency but it wont light your way down a path or anything like that.I didn't experience any SIM card issues as others have noted, but I didn't try to activate it either. If I keep it charged it'll dial 911 in an emergency and that's what I need.I deducted a star because the back was very hard to get on. Might be just my phone, but I've had dozens of cell phones through the years so I do know how to pop the cover on the back, but this one would just not go on.

NET10 won't refund for the purchased plan.", "Author": "reviewman", "ReviewID": "R1X9H0JHFOYW8Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used NET10 phones in Florida with good experiences (owned two phones) a few years ago. However, this Motorola phone I purchased through Amazon does not even activate as the other reviewer noted. It displays incorrect SIM card. I called the customer service after online activation failure and tried to activate it with an agent for an hour to no avail. I already purchased a plan and the NET10 customer service representative told(lied to) me that they will refund for my plan if I try it one more time after a few hours. I triple-checked with the agent that she will leave the detailed comments regarding this so I can get a refund quickly.I took it to my workplace, home and mall in this area but gues what? None of the places seem to have any coverages at all to activate this phone. So I called the customer service again and I was told they do not have any conversation record (Duh!) and I could not get a refund as they can try to send a new SIM card and activate it! Horrible waste of time and money. I am in process of refunding for this phone from Amazon but I am also disappointed with NET10 service. If they don't have coverage here (not a small city) and their phone does not work, why not refund? Also, if incorrect SIM card problem is present so frequently, what was NET10 doing?I honestly think NET10 should close the business and hope Amazon does not have any phones available in the market list so there are no more victims. Besides, some of their customer service agents are very rude and difficult. All of their service agents are from overseas call center so I did not expect much quality but they were some of the worst I experieced. I wish there is a website that lists the companies that do not use overseas call center. If I knew the service agents were this bad, I would have simplely given up getting my money back.Last word, Motorola, please insert a correct SIM! I purchased another feature phone from other brand with other service company after this and it is much better experience, including the feel, display and of course a CORRECT SIM card.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT CELL PHONE, BAD SIM CARD", "Author": "Jon   Farmington,  MO", "ReviewID": "R1VPVHNR8V80UY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "THE PHONE ARRIVED IN THREE WORKING DAYS, WELL PACKAGE.

Inconvenient but not impossible.The phone itself works moderately well.  The lock function is rather annoying because it's unlocked with two keypresses which can still happen in your pocket.  Also, the browser button is on the front page so if you don't lock it pray you don't use all your minutes up bouncing in and out of \"Browser.\"  Other than that, functionality-wise it's ok.

They're easy to find but this could be an inconvenience if you were hoping to share chargers.The issues above are only mere inconveniences.

Some of my favorite features are: mp3 player, 1.3 megapixel camera, up to 2GB of storage microSD card (not included but you can buy one cheap enough), fm radio(you have to have a wired headset plugged into the headphone jack to use the radio--doubles as an antenna), bluetoot, & an decent speaker on this phone. A few complaints on this phone is the battery life, the reception are only average compared to other Net10 phones I've owned (4). Also, i've lost at least a half dozen minutes connecting to the internet by accidentally hittin the browser button,**** I just learned how to disable this feature***** select menu, select settings, select security, select lock application, enter 1234, select OK, scroll down until use see 2 browser checkboxes and check both of those (I believe this is a security feature that is there to prevent someone from using your web browser). One last minor con is when you are trying to listen to music you cannot use the bluetooth for this, you must use a wired headset.
