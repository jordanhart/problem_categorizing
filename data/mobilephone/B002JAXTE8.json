{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BLACKBERRY- OEM FOR CHEAT STORE", "Author": "drjaba", "ReviewID": "RG8WL4P8YCWFJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought from the OEM for Cheap Store in Amazon a Blackberry 8310 GSM-unlocked cell phone. Before buying it the store confirmed me in written (email) that the phone was new (not refurbished) and unlocked and would come with all the items showed in the picture. The headsets never arrived with the unit although it arrived on time as promised to my residence in the US. This phone was to be used by my wife overseas.When she went to the local phone company we discovered that the phone was not new but used and probably refurbished and that the phone was assigned to a person in a service provider named Centennial (US) with an user name they provided and an unknown password and therefore no email service was possible with this phone.After several email correspondences, at last I got an answer apologizing indicating that their technical personnel would fix the problem in a couple of days and they could do it from the US without returning the phone. After that, it was not possible to make further contacts with them by email, always an automatic response and once a response indicating to call to a telephone that was never answered (two trials in different days). The problem was never solved.No doubt that this was a scam done through Amazon. I never had a previous problem with Amazon and always got what was promised but now I am suspicious of the type of merchants they are currently dealing with.Otherwise, until now this \"new\" product is operating OK as a cell phone but you don't need a Blackberry for this. I recommend people to keep far away from this OEM for Cheat Store.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "I LOST MY MONEY....", "Author": "Angel", "ReviewID": "R2PH7LS232UWRT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for use in Venezuela and only after 15 days of use it stopped to work.

Unfortunately I only ended up wasting my money!! The phone is poor quality! The keyboard is extremely HARD!! you cant send a text easily because typing it would take centuries since the buttons are so hard! Also when I saved phone numbers on the address book and dialed them, they had an 86 country code automatically assigned to them which shows that the phone is a phony chinese make! The charger is of very cheap quality, mine broke down within a month without any reason while it was stuck to the power supply! Please donot waste your money on this and get some thing better for some more money!!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Curve 8310", "Author": "Terry L. Bruce", "ReviewID": "R1UG0XE6EL8TKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an all round good Blackberry. It is going off the market, but if you can find it the price is right. It has all the normal funcions including the Blackberry messenger.It does have the ball for moving around which does need replacing after a year or two. The cellular itself will hold up for two o three years and then you will need to replace it with an upgraded one as in that time I am sure it won't be available anymore. I have found the 8900 to be very good, but of course more expensive. I also have a Torch which has more features than I will ever use.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 8310 All u want in 1 phone", "Author": "Trona", "ReviewID": "R2G8APO3A6AW81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its a very nice phone specially for its bb messaging system.
