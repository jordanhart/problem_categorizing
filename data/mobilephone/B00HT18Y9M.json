Just a great product.The only two not-so-great things worth commenting are: 1) there is no front camera (but I don't care about this, so nothing important here) and 2) due to all the functionalities in there, the battery lifetime (I mean from charge to charge) is very short: sometimes I have to charge it every other day and sometimes everyday or even more frequently. [Compared to my previous Java-based touch phone, where I was recharging the battery every 10 days at least, the Lumia's battery is a disappointment.] Anyway, now I learnt to leave everything closed (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc...) so the battery in standby mode can last for 4 days or more if I don't heavily use it.A by-the-way third point 3) there is only ONE slot for SIM. My previous phone had 2 Sims and that was great.Once again, otherwise, I do NOT hesitate to recommend this product. I so much love my Lumia 525; and I enjoy every moment I interact with it (whether talking, gaming, texting, GPS while driving, PowerPoint remote while teaching, and even just while exploring the zillion new free applications in the Apps store. I love it.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HT18Y9M"}}
