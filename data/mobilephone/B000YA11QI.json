{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great flip phone", "Author": "Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...", "ReviewID": "R1VR6UWKMDDXQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for over two years. I'm finally upgrading to a Windows Smart Phone (HTC Touch Pro 2) but have felt some sadness moving away from this beautiful and functional phone and decided to write a review about how much I've liked the phone.First, this is a slick, high quality phone both aesthetically and in build quality. Everything just feels solid and well made, including the responsive touch pad which makes texting as easy as possible considering it doesn't come with a QWERTY pad. The hing is one of the best I've seen on a flip phone, and even after two years of constant use it is still solid and not wobbly at all.The LCD screen is very nice, even by today's (end of 2009) standards. It's crystal clear, and make texting, operating the phone, playing games, etc., fun and not eye straining at all. The front screen, while lower resolution, is useful for taking self portraits (in camera mode when the phone is shut, it displays what the 2.0 mega pixel camera is pointed at!) and displaying your own custom images.The phone has a built in mp3 player (compatible with mp3s and WMA files) that is better than average for a phone based player. The phone can also play music over the phone's speaker, which sounds surprisingly good!The touch screen buttons on the front of the phone are well placed and easy to use for changing tacks or pausing.Voice commands works fairly well, but certainly not perfectly. I find it recognizes what I'm saying about 75% of the time.Phone call clarity is the best of any phone I've ever used, and better than friend's phones I've tried that are new.A few complaints:1) To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3.5mm adapter.2) The phone occasionally freezes up and needs to be reset by removing the battery.3) web browsing is pretty poor on this phone, but I never used that functionality much so it didn't bother me.4) The Micro SD only supports up to a 2GB card. It will NOT support SDHC cards!Overall I've LOVED this phone and it's held up remarkably well over the last 2+ years. This is a high quality piece of hardware that's stood the test of time.4.5/5 Stars.
