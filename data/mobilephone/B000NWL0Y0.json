I like the look of the phone and the size is sweet and I like the ringtones and clearity of phone, but I was so disappointed with the batttery life and reception. My old nokia's battery would last for three days and could find a signal anywhere. Maybe its just because I'm not used to Motorola's but overall I'm underwhelmed.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not for 850 MHz", "Author": "Kbeemxs \"RR\"", "ReviewID": "R1P4EO4EGX46KJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I intended to purchase a true 4-band cel which I could use in any place, and I trusted Amazon description which states \"Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz\".But when I inserted the SIM of a 850 MHz network the cell did not work, after some searching in the cel menus I found out that Amazon description is wrong, since it is intended only for 900, 1800 and 1900 MH.So be careful if you need to use it overseas..........", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Purchased for a trip to Jamaica", "Author": "Ronda", "ReviewID": "R17OBLUWRQC6PK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just needed a simple phone for a trip from the US to Jamaica.

All I pretty much needed was the blue tooth and it has it so that serves the purpose.  Only thing I am dissapointed with is the fact that the phone service does not transfer over to AT&T.;  It only stays on for cingular so I often get dropped calls and no signal.  That can be a problem if I am in an area where the phone picks up no signal and I have an emergency.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "very nice phone", "Author": "Brenton Rogers \"Brenton\"", "ReviewID": "R23PF3L8L7AXUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easily", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "MADE MY DAUGHTER VERY HAPPY", "Author": "Richard Cannon \"BEETHOVEN ROCKS\"", "ReviewID": "R174NCMAIQPQHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS.
