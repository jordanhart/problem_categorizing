Griffith \"book reader\"", "ReviewID": "R3PNJNUIGLLUX0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Blackberry Storm 2 9550 \"listed as new\" as a gift for my niece, and after only 2 months of start using it, the phone keeps shouting down for no reason. We try a new battery, but it shouts down and it does not turn on. I paid $229.93 for this phone and I really feel so embarrassed with my niece and her parents. This was a real rip off.  Amazon should screen people and sellers using this site to sell their products, and should not allow sellers to list items as new when they are not new.I DO NOT recommend this seller. I am very disappointed.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "Winston", "ReviewID": "R3EZNCWB9FIVIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a product everyone should have and enjoy. the blackberry storm 2 is an excellent device and is working perfectly since i acquired it at amazon.com and since then haven't regretted the decision .", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Claim for my product and attention", "Author": "Dulce Andrade", "ReviewID": "R2R9R6VQKJMKUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is in good condition and my claim is not related to it. My annoyance is related to the attention I received from the seller. The product came only with the table charger and the corresponding cable. The user manual was related to other model. Additionally I did not receive the installation cd nor the earphones. I made a claim to the seller and received an email from a lady that informed that was going to contact me by phone the next day to solve this situation. No call. At this moment I do not want a phone call for explanation. I would like to receive the complements offered. I regret this situation because I have been using Amazon for about ten years with complete satisfaction and now I felt unsecured with my next purchases through this web.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product plus very nice customer service", "Author": "Catherine", "ReviewID": "RIEKQMWTESG7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't be more satisfied with the customer service. The item has been sent back and forth several times due to slight problems that I was not comfortable with. The customer service staff responded promptly and kindly with out any hassle, always being nice to my questions. The product itself is very good, except for some unknown data and voice usage, which may be caused by the unlocked process that I totally understand. However, the product works pretty well so far. I would say the quality of their customer service is a very big bonus, which helps me finally get what I need. Considering all factors during my phurcase, I am happy to give a five star review to the seller.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "no deal", "Author": "jamesianglenn", "ReviewID": "R1KGW2FLU9TL8K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered phone, I  had some idea they would be refurbished.  Phone had not been cleared and still had original owners number, the phone self-dialed the original number. The first owner had donated it to a charity, and wondered how I got it.  The phone also had alot of touch pad problems, would later only call numbers in he contacts list, and would self-dial the last number dialed.  Cell lounge did give a refund less shipping cost, but took about a month. But I'm glad I got a refund. The Cell Lounge staff were very polite.  I bought a new blackberry from ATT, at full price, but no problems.  If you have an old unused cell phone, destroy it either buy fire or a hammer. Don't donate or trade it in because you never know what will happen with it, and your personal information.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's not new, it is REMANUFACTURED!!!", "Author": "JCAG", "ReviewID": "R3D0Z8TNJ4SFUL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's not New, it is REMANUFACTURED! . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect gift", "Author": "\"D\" Rock", "ReviewID": "R3KRTTGLB50KEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item as an anniversary present for my husband and he is so in love with it.
