{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed", "Author": "Critical Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2RLF7FD4MF16M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently.First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why.Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later.Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping.Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition.Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet.Now the actual review:Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in.There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational.Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry.I absolutely love this feature and it is very important.Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps.The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones.Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage.UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy.Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart.People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities.(I will update more here)The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well.The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way.NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing.I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications.Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere.Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering.More to come.UPDATE 12.13.13I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now.Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away.I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that.ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it.Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side).  So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges.Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality.Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing Cell Phone Ever...", "Author": "Brad", "ReviewID": "R34U0C0GEAC16D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always thought the Note was an interesting concept since the first version.  I love my iPhone but with each release I became more and more disappointed that they never increase the screen size.  I was worried about moving from my Apple iPhones, but it was time I had to try.I have been absolutely amazed by this phone.  The size of the screen is terrific.  The first few days it felt huge and took some getting used to, but by day 3, it was normal and no big deal.  I look at my iPhone and think \"Wow, I settled for that tiny screen?\".  I figured with this big screen I would have to run from outlet to outlet with a charger, but it lasts all day where my iPhone couldn't.The speed, the image quality, and the functionality of this phone is just amazing.  The S-Pen features and Samsung's spin on the Android platform are perfect.  The S-Pen allows for such accuracy on the screen that you can do very detailed work on a relatively small screen.  It's integration with Evernote is great and the Sketchbook allows the average artist an excellent canvas in his or her pocket with Adobe illustrator like features.  The keyboard has a top row of numbers making input of passwords and data so much faster.  They not only improved the speed of a Smartphone, they improved the speed that a user and work with it, making my iPad and iPhone obsolete.I was able to transfer my music with little effort thanks to the Google Play music app including the things I purchased.  I used the Note app to sync notes on my Apple devices.  The integration between the Note 3 and Evernote offer a solution to this.The only negative I can say about the phone is S-Voice is no Siri.  I used the location based reminders on the iPhone often for things such as \"Remind me when I get home to take out the trash\".. I have yet to get S-Voice to do this, but I understand it's supposed to be able to.I'm almost speechless at how perfect this phone is.  If you are interested in a bigger screen are worried about leaving the iPhone, dont be.  Give this phone a few days to get used to and you wont look back..", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best cell phone on the planet!", "Author": "FALCON", "ReviewID": "R3FVDW8LO1CCUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Forget those silly complaints about region lock.  They do not affect 99.99% of users and no USA carriers.  The N9000 is the European phone, and gets setup for the carrier used in the European country where you activate the phone.  Period.  US users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number.  It's that simple. Amazon makes both available.  I teach overseas yearly.  I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.]First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster  just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today.  As for those phones that only show an app screen.  I call them cave phones.1.  The beautiful  5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\"  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.  This phone is a joy to use.2.  The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  No lag on this baby.  Just try to do things to outpace it.  It moves data faster than you can see.  Partially because of #3.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  Graphics are amazing.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!  It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great.6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware CPU and GPU  improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.16.  I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider,  wearing suit pants to jeans.  Both phones  fit fine in your pocket.  Don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans.17.  The TouchWiz UI is fine, and superfast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store.  Over a million users.  So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer. There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user.  However, there should be two of them or a better one.  It is Ok, just not great like the rest of the phone.  This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES. All that said, I'm very happy, with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good screen protector.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm loving it", "Author": "manbearpig \"Half man, half bear and half pig.\"", "ReviewID": "R2J1FLOQGAKM8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Samsung phone (after galaxy nexus) and I can already say that I won't be moving away from Samsung phones in the near future. As an FYI - my smartphone usage history comprises of HTC Kaiser/AT&T; Tilt, Blackberry 8700, iPhone 3G, HTC EVO 4G, HTC EVO 3D, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, LG Optimus G and now this Samsung Galaxy Note 3. You can probably find more than one million reviews for this phone online. Hence I'll not include any of that readily-available info in this review. Following is my feedback of the black galaxy note 3 (Verizon version).- NOT CDMA: Before getting this phone, I was under the impression that ALL Verizon phones are sim-less (CDMA) but I was wrong. All Verizon feature phones are CDMA. All Verizon smart phones use a sim card. Also, if you buy this phone online, chances are that the sim card will already be installed inside this device. So do not spend too much time looking inside the box, vacuuming your living room, yelling at your spouse, and then searching the parking lot. Look inside the device first!- GOOGLE VOICE DOES NOT WORK: This is not related to this phone as much as to Verizon. Verizon does not allow Google Voice. And hence if you are a current Google Voice user (to make international calls), make other plans. You will not be able to continue using Google Voice to make international calls once you get this phone.- SCREEN RESISTS FINGERPRINTS: While I could not find anything online that mentions that the screen is oleophobic, I very much suspect so. This screen resists fingerprints to a large extent. May be it was a requirement for the s-pen (stylus). May be not. Either way, I'm not complaining.- CALL QUALITY ROCKS: Both local as well as international calls are crystal clear.- SCREEN AUTO BRIGHTNESS WORKS: I have used smartphones before which had their auto-brightness feature set to either too aggressive or not aggressive enough. This phone gets it just right. I never have to worry about not being able to read it in sunlight or get blinded by the screen at 3AM.- HOME BUTTON IS NOT CLICKY ENOUGH: I mean it works but does not feel as clicky as the iPhone- ONE HANDED MODE: Features like these differentiate this phone from other phablets. I'm surprised at how much I use the one handed mode while driving or hauling groceries or sex and stuff.- TOUCHWIZ: Everyone knows that touchwiz is not the prettiest UI layer on android, but it does add features that do not exist natively in android. Rather than providing 16 weather widgets and 24 clock widgets, Samsung has focused more on including features like raising your phone to your ear to answer a call, one touch status bar, swipe right to call, swipe left to text, incoming call notification window (when screen is on), smart stay, hand gestures and stuff.- MY MAGAZINE: This feature does offer the promise of a good native RSS reader but the lack of customization (in adding your own feeds) makes this less useful as of now. I hope they make it more customizable in future updates.- BATTERY LASTS MORE THAN ENOUGH: With moderate usage, I have not had to charge my phone before bedtime so far. In fact, the lowest I managed to drive down the battery was ~25% on a day that involved shooting videos using 4K, smooth motion, slow motions and stuff.- HANDWRITING RECOGNITION WORKS: Every time you have the s-pen out, you get the option of writing instead of typing the text in most text fields. I would say that this works about 90% of the time. And it even identifies cursive!- DISABLE APPS: If you do not like pre-installed apps (from Verizon or Samsung) that you can not uninstall, this phone offers you the next best thing. You can simply disable any app in the settings and then you don't have to worry about those disabled apps running in the background or using your location data and stuff.- GOOD BUILD QUALITY: As a side note, I'd also like to mention that my almost-2-year-old galaxy nexus is still rocking even after getting abused at the hands of my 3 year old multiple times while my less-than-one-year-old LG Optimus G did not survive. I'm confident that this phone will be equally strong and durable. Also, in spite of being such a large device, it is surprisingly easy to hold. While my LG Optimus G was very slippery, this is more grippy.- PHOTOS AUTO-MOVE TO SD CARD: If you insert a micro SD card, the phone starts saving all the photos/videos to it automatically (and you can change this in settings if you like). This is a convenient and well-thought feature.I'm loving my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black (Verizon Wireless), hope this helps.UPDATE NOV 6, 2013: Google voice started to work on this phone. Not sure what changed, may be google updated their app in some way but Yay... Another strike in the pros column.UPDATE JAN 2, 2014: So I have had some more time with this phone and I explored its built-in RF transmitter (remote functionality) and it works fine. I'm probably in the minority here when I say that all my TV, cable box and sound bar are manufactured by Samsung but my Note 3 has no trouble controlling any one of them. Plus the Samsung \"WatchOn\" app is cool for browsing whats on TV currently across various channels and if you like something, just tap the \"Watch on TV\" button and voila! Also - I'm able to control my Samsung TV and cable box thru my Sony tablet. So I would assume that this phone should not have much trouble controlling non-Samsung branded devices.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "ryannkc", "ReviewID": "R1UID6HW95IEC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "well when I wanted a bigger phone because I use it 24-7 I waited for the galaxy note 3 to arrive.

I'd really debated on the gear, but went with it, and overall I'm happy with both items.I bought the note 2 in December 2012, and it was an awesome phone. I'd spent about 10 years with BlackBerry, and then went with the Razr Maxx and its stupendous battery life. The note 2's battery life isn't even close to the droid. Other than that, I loved it, and really loved the S pen. I'm retired, so I used the pen for grocery lists, notes, quick phone #s and the like.But after an update a few months ago, my keyboard began to lag. Even Samsung didn't know what to do, and I was frustrated. When I heard about the 3 I began researching and reading reviews. Yesterday I went to verizon and traded up my note 2 to a 3. I set everything up last night and have explored some new features I didn't think I'd even use, but I saw I will love them. Magazine is one new feature. I've become a news junkie and this brings up some things I'd not find anywhere else. I am going to love the scrapbooking function - I can easily copy and save quotes, as I'm prone to do. The battery life seems very good. I took the phone of the charger about 9am. It's almost 6 and I still have 69% remaining. I've played some angry birds, and I've had the Bluetooth on all day (I'm not a person who uses Bluetooth much, but it's been on because of the galaxy gear, which at this time has 77% remaining). The note 2 would be well below 50% by this time - without the Bluetooth.The galaxy gear is simple to use. It's pretty intuitive. My only dissatisfaction is the sort distance between the note 3 and the gear needed to keep connected. I'd hoped to be able to go upstairs without my phone, but the Bluetooth disconnects. Same for a short trip to the kitchen. I keep the volume and notifications on vibrate. My wrist easily feels the vibration. Since I can't be far from the phone, I'd hear it ringing anyway!What I can't understand is the carriers not having cases for the phone. I've ordered a case from Amazon until otterboxes are in.Finally, I know some people don't like \"phablets\". I do more texting than phone. The phablet is convenient. I do a lot of Facebook from it and other web browsing. I do all of my gaming from it. I use it to read ebooks in bed. If I had to give up all of my devices but one, the one to keep would be the note. I have had virtually every tablet as well as most of the Nook and kindle ereaders, so this is saying something.Well done, Samsung!", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned.", "Author": "Jimmy Goheen", "ReviewID": "R2FMOYA2NIFV3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great phone with tons of functions.

The resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone. Additionally the touch interface is very responsive, more so than the previous Note 2. Moreover, it is also quicker than the Note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps. But, there are a few things that the Note 3 lacks in that the Note 2 had. One is that although the camera for the Note 3 is 13 megapixels and the Note 2, 8 mega pixels, the Note 2 seems to take better quality pictures. Further, the Note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well. And, the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the Note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that I wouldn't have to do with the Note 2. Secondly, the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the Note 2 had. In the Note 2, one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well. But, in the Note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating. I don't know why Samsung took a step back on the camera on the Note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own. Which, it does not do very well might I add. But with that being said, the camera is not horrible, its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras. Another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the Note 2's. That was something that I really enjoyed on the Note 2. Overall though, the phone is probably the best phone I've ever had and I've had the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 along with the Note 2. The visual aspect of the display is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential. And, I appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed. In the end I'll rate the phone a 9/10 the only complaint being the camera functioning.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice features, but poor low RF signal reception", "Author": "C.

I paid full price to keep my unlimited data alive. I am finding that the RF reception is abysmal. In buildings where I used to get -89 dbm with my Motorola Droid Bionic, I get -118 dbm with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Even outdoors, with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I don't get that great of a 4G LTE signal. The phone will usually then switch to 1 to 2 bars of 3G and stay there until I am back in a really strong 4G area. I'm thinking either the antenna is of poor quality or the radio is not very sensitive - or both. I may have to return this phone and try the LG G2. This GN3 cannot even begin to compete with my old Motorola Droid Bionic when it comes to holding on to a less than perfect signal.  In strong signal areas there is no problem, but when the signal isn't the best, the GN3 does a poor job of holding the 4G LTE signal.  My Motorola Droid Bionic used to do an outstanding job in the same exact places this GN3 fails.  The screen is brilliant, and you couldn't ask for a more feature packed phone.  The sound quality is good and volume level is great, but above all the GN3 has to be able to connect to a signal to be a great phone.  In the near future, Verizon is going to Voice over LTE (VoLTE).  This means that our phone conversations will now be carried on the 4G LTE band.  That really scares me with my GN3, since it can't maintain a 4G LTE signal unless I'm really in a strong signal area.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phablet = Phone+Tablet Combo BUT", "Author": "S.

The Note 3 is an amazing phone/tablet (or \"phablet\"). I purchased it a couple of days ago to replace my Motorola Razr Maxx which I loved until it recently started to freeze and lag. I had been eying the Note 2 for some time and wanted to wait for the price to drop. I'm glad I did not rush to buy it, because now the Note 3 is out and I found it half price and brand new at BB. I have the original Galaxy Note 10.1, which I love and use consistently for work. Of course, I would love to upgrade to the 2014 edition, but first the phone, and then.... So far, I find the phone to be easy to use, blazingly fast, crystal clear display, and the S-Note app is wonderful, which tempts me to no end to lunge for the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, lol. Upon purchase, I transferred the SD card from the Razr Maxx to the Note, which brought up all my saved pictures that I had downloaded, so no need to start over. I also immediately bought the Otter Box Defender to protect this phone, as it is a worthwhile investment. The phone is quite big, but this is what I like and my hands are large enough to hold the phone comfortably. Smaller hands may find it to be a problem. The phone sounds crystal clear, the audio (using headphones) is beautiful, and I will now begin to download some of my favorite apps to expand on the enjoyment of this phone. System updates were available immediately upon turning the phone on, and the updates downloaded with no problem at all. I find the plastic screen protector with Otter Box to be quite smooth, and does not interfere with the hand or S-Pen at all. And I feel good knowing the screen (and the whole phone) is well protected. I would advise a good strong case such as Otter Box, as this phone could easily slip out of your hands, mainly because of its size, but also because it is a bit slippery. Overall I have no complaints at all, but will update this review if anything else catches my attention. Should you decide to get this phone, you will not be disappointed.

Search Samsung's site for an app called Samsung Smart Switch. It's free and easy. If you find issues with that app for any reason you can move all of your text messages from your old phone to this one by loading a free app called SMS Backup & Restore and following the directions I outlined in my November 30, 2013 review of that product. Another free app you may want to consider is Software Data Cable, which allows you to back up your old Android phone to a laptop or PC, then move it to your new phone from that backup. You will need to load that app on your old phone and the Note 3, but it's simple and very handy.While the size difference between this and the Note 2 is only a matter of inches, the screen on this one is brighter, has more vivid colors and can be easily viewed in direct sunlight. The 32GB of internal storage is a big plus because the 16GB on my Note 2 was beginning to get full. When I added in my 64GB external SD card I swapped from the Note 2, total storage comes to 16GB more storage than my 80GB laptop. It's easy to forecast that the next version of this phone could finally wean me off computers. As it is I am spending a lot more time on my phone doing stuff I use to do on my computer.This is also a much faster phone. I do not use it to anywhere near its capacity, but it zips along from one screen or app to the next with no lag. I was more than pleased with my older Note 2, but this one is even better.I take a lot of pictures and video, so I appreciate the greatly improved camera resolution and the easier and more intuitive interface. But what I truly love is there are no major differences in the user interface even though this one runs under Android 4.3 versus 4.1.2 on my Note 2. In that respect there was zero learning curve. After tweaking a few settings that did not come over when I restored my old ones, I was up and running as before in practically no time.This ships with a cable that supports USB 3.0 and has what looks like a connector that is incompatible with existing micro USB chargers, that is not the case. You can still use existing chargers, battery packs and the such because their micro USB connectors will plug into one side of the charging port. If you have a computer capable of USB 3.0 your transfer rates will be lightning fast.The battery is about the same as the Note 2 for use time between charges. Since the Note 3's 4.3 Android operating system does include Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support you may notice a slightly improved use time if you use bluetooth a lot. As it stands there is a very slight difference between the Note 2's 3100mAh battery capacity and the 3200mAh one in this phone.I am still exploring the nuances of my new phone, so as I discover noteworthy features that I have missed or emergent problems that I should warn about I will update this review to reflect them.

I put on the 0.4mm tempered glass screen protector and was ready to give it a run through a myriad of tests before I decide to swap my current Galaxy S4 (GS4) for the Galaxy Note 3 (GN3).- Size: After coming from the GS4, the increased size of the GN3 is not that drastic. Perhaps 1mm thicker, 1/2\" longer, 1/4\" wider, but somehow this yields a 5.7\" screen over the GS4's 5\" screen. It just means you won't have to squint as hard to watch the boobies!- Weight: I am impressed by how light the GN3 is when compared to the GS4 and the GN2. There is a very slight difference of weight between the GN3 and GS4, but it's so minimal, that it certainly launches the GN3 to a new level.- Pen: The pen function on the GN3 is freaking phenomenal! However, I believe this is solely an OS issue, and not related to hardware. I found that the Papyrus app to be more to my liking than the included apps.- Speed: Oh my freaking chupacabra this sucker is fast, noticeably so over the GS4. Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor clocked at 2.27 GHz, holy moly, this puts the GS4's specs (quad-core processor clocked at 1.9 GHz) to shame.- Memory: 3 GB of memory vs the 2 GB in the GS4.- Storage: Glad to see Samsung boosted the stock storage from 16 GB as found in the GN2 and GS4, to a whopping 32 GB. I won't actually need an extra SD card now.- Battery: 25 hours of talk time unmodded/unrooted, are you serious? Wowzers, this 3200 mAh battery is the bomb, boasting a 22-day standby time. GS4 has a 2600 mAh battery, and gets around 20%-40% less talk/standby time. 84 hours of music playback anyone? Yes please. After 4 days and 2 hours, my battery is finally at 49% with wifi on.- Camera: Same as what's on the GS4, which is awesome!- Video: 4K video, wait what?! Are you kidding me? And up to 120 fps slow-motion capture??? Oh, this is going to be fun! 3840x2160 (4K) @30 fps, 1920x1080 (1080p HD) @60 fps, 1280x720 (720p HD) @120 fps. For reference, the GS4 only does 1080p HD at 30 fps. No wonder it took the #2 spot for top camera function on a phone! The only reason it didn't is somehow, that s***ty Windows Nokia phone scored half a point higher in camera function. In addition to the image stabilizer featured in the GS4, the GN3 also includes continuous auto focus. This is a HUGE improvement over the GS4's video capabilities. I took several videos with the GS4, and it was constantly loosing focus. Not anymore with the GN3!- Google Wallet: It's back! I think it's great that Google Wallet once again works on the GN3. I used to use it all the time on my developer version of the Galaxy Nexus. Google discontinued official support for this app on the GS4 for whatever reason, though a modded version could be applied.- Knox: An eFuse, that defaults to 0x0.  Any attempts (currently) to modify the bootloader results in tripping Knox, or setting the eFuse to 0x1. Does this have any effect on the phone itself? No. It only means that once tripped, your warranty is void (as with rooting or adding a custom bootloader as it always has been) only now, Samsung has a way to track this.- Rooting: Full root and 0x0 Knox bypass has been established for the GN3. I believe the XDA community is currently working on a way to add a custom bootloader without tripping Knox.This is definitely a great device to consider if you are looking to go with a phablet!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My perfect phone", "Author": "Ashton P.

Amazon has always had the lowest price, verizon couldn't even come close to matching it.The process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information. When trying to go through the process VZW customer service verified who I was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information I needed.  Luckily the Amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what I needed.  While I was on the phone with VZW, at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from Amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories (which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing).After finally receiving my phone two days later, I tried activating my device.  I spent over 4 hours on the phone with different VZW reps to help activate the device. No one could help me.  I guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day, but they ported my number from sprint already.  I was without service for almost 1 whole day.  The following day was Thanksgiving when I needed to activate it, but VZW's support number was closed due to the holiday.  Luckily i was able to connect with someone at Amazon who had a direct contact number, who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running.  If it wasnt for Amazon I would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone.After buying the device at $199.99 on Nov 26, I found the device price was lowered.  I called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the $50 difference.  Which increased the monetary value for Amazon wireless even further!The only down side (besides hours on the phone trying to activate) was the fact that although I ordered the protection plan through VZW when ordering with Amazon, Verizon had no record of that.  As long as it is within the first 30 days you can call VZW to add it.  I had read a previous review that said that, which made me double check a week later after activation.All in All, i had a lot of hiccups with the process, but the Amazon wireless customer service made right by everything I went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business.

The camera is amazing and does surround shot (puts panorama to shame). The phone doubles as a remote for TVs and cable boxes too. What more could you want? A nuclear phone?People complain about touchwiz but Samsungs interface is fine to me. It doesn't have much bloatware. I'm coming from a Motorola Droid 3 and that is the camera that took the pictures in this review. Touchwiz is fine by me and the RAM pushes it fine. This phone is a BOSS", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "John B.", "ReviewID": "R2806Q9NIW0W1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Note 3 after a good deal of consideration and research.  First off I should relate that I'm into computers.  I took my first computer course in 1972 (Fortran) and have kept up  with developments ever sence.  I built my own gaming/general purpose rig and repair, modify and troubleshoot computers.  I enjoy it.  I have been watching the development of cellphones with the same interest.  My first cellphone was a Motorola bag phone (remember those?) and have upgraded only when I saw a definite improvement in functionallity but never did so as a matter of fashion.  Late last year I decided that it was time to replace my six year old LG \"dumb\" phone.  I also had become interested in buying a high end tablet after seeing some of my young in-laws using theirs during the Holidays.  I had the thought that it would be great if you could buy a nice tablet that also made phone calls!  Of course nothing like that exists.  I then began taking a harder look at the high end phones after seeing a HSN show on the iPhone and decided it was time to finally make the jump to a \"smart\" phone.  I concluded that the technology had matured to finally deliver the the functionallity that it promised and still be user friendly.After much research I settled on the Samsung.  I looked briefly at the S4 but felt it was to small to replicate the tablet experience that I wanted.  I'm a Verizon customer (no particular loyality, they just happen to have the best service for my area) so I went to the Verizon store to check out the phone with a salesperson and maybe get a deal.  Because they are so new there are no deals on the Note 3.  If you feel you can wait a year the phone will certainly be cheaper and in two years it will probably be free with a renewal/upgrade.  Verizon wanted $350 for the phone plus $30 to connect it.  They also charge a monthly fee for data use.  Not the plan use that you contract for but just a fee to use data.  SCAM! but what you gonna do?  I then went to my old faithful, AMAZON!  They listed the Verizon ready phone for $229 with no extra charges.  I went back to the Verizon store and told them that if they couldn't match the price there was no way I could ignore a $160 difference.  They couldn't so I went home and ordered the phone.  I'm an Amazon Prime member ( as an aside:  if you order more than three things a year from Amazon, seriously, join Prime.  I ordered a forty inch TV for a Christmas gift and it arrived in two days.  Free.  Wow) and I got a notice that because of high demand my delivery would take a few extra days.  I thought; no big deal.  I wasn't even really supprised when two days after my order the package showed up on my doorstep.  I opened the package and went through the basic setup.  I did have to call Verizon support but they were very gracious about connecting and initializing the phone.Now, about the phone.  This thing is amazing.  The closest approximation I can think of is a laptop the makes phone calls and takes (really good!) pictures.  I am new to the whole \"smart\" phone experience as I indicated and have been constantly amazed by the functionallity, capability, and potential of the device.  I mean; dual core processor, 3 gigs of RAM, 96 gigs of storage with the expansion slot.  By way of comparison my first store bought desktop computer had an industry leading 45 gigs!.  The Android OS is Linux based so it has some subtle differences but not to the point of being a problem for PC users.  There is definitely a steep learning curve if, like me, you are new to the whole tablet/smartphone experience.  It came with almost no user instruction other than initial setup.  I went online and found the Samsung users manual and downloaded it.  256 pages if you skip all the lawyer stuff in the front.  I also got a book on my Kindle account (free) that also helps but I am convinced that, like most electronic gizmos that are continuously developing, by the time I figure out how to really use it I'll be ready for the \"next\" thing.  YouTube is also a great resource for instruction on the phone and the various apps.  As to the apps;  if you order the phone from Amazon it comes pre-loaded with all the Amazon apps and they cannot be uninstalled but why would you want to?  And because Google owns the Android OS you are joined at the hip to Google and all its apps and anoying behavior and no, you cannot get rid of it.  I have used Google since it first came out in beta but I find them rather spooky.  I'm sure the same problem (or worse) exists with the iPhone.  One of the first things I noticed about the phone was the very poor battery life.  I was used to my old phone keeping a charge for days and I noticed I was only getting 5-6 hours of time on the Note.  I researched the situation and found that you should perform a certain ammount of cleanup on the new phone.  Built in utillities can accomplish this but the best solution is to download an app called All-In-One Toolbox.  Get it from the Amazon AppStore for free.  It is a highly regarded app and makes the list of top ten downloads consistently.  Using the app's function of disabiling background resource hogs you can up your battery life to maybe a day and a half.  Bottom line, the Note 3 is a battery hog so you can just count on keeping it on a charger when not using it.  The up side is that it charges fairly quickly.Physicaly, the phone is large.  Even for my 6'2\" oversized hands.  I find myself constantly fumbling around when using it, trying to find a comfortable position.  Another problem is when shifting the grip on the phone I inadvertently press one of the soft keys and thereby change the screen.  Annoying but something that I'm sure would be a problem with any phone and particularly with smaller phones, i.e. S4.I just looked up and realized its 3 A.M. I thought this review would be about two paragraphs.  I'll try to add more impressions later.Bottom line; this device is, in its small way, a life changer.  Like I stated earlier, a laptop that makes phone calls.  It's just a little too large and heavy, with a protective case (which I recommend), to fit in a shirt pocket but I have no trouble finding a way to carry it.  And all those times in the past when I was away from home and I wanted to do something that required a computer and internet access and was frustrated are now history.

I was formerly an iPhone 5 user, loved apple Eco system. Bah bah bah... First impression, wow it's big I wanted a big phone since I'm use to having small phone because of Apple. Maybe sometimes too big, sometimes I fell like its a perfect size. So first let's start with android, I had android phone in the past, I keep it for a week hate it promise myself to never buy another one.. It was different with this phone I got to say to running android 4.3 it was a different experience, android has changed a lot it's up to par with iOS, same issues same headaches. Like with any OS it has it kinks you just have to figure it out. Android is good now. There is a lot of apps out there that allows you to still share calendar with iOS and vice and versa. Love that. Hardware, specs are to blow you of water. I love the camera amazing photo quality very much what I was use to on iPhone 5. I love the display, it's just amazing. Bottoms too me a bit to get use to them, now I don't see anything wrong with them. Plastic is okay I wish that it was more durable I have a case since day one and I got a dent already. Battery, I can get a whole day without charging and heavy usage, two days if I use it modern and turn off all of the gps and sync. Battery is mainly use to power the beautiful display. Did I mention how beautiful it is. Samsung, not too happy I didn't buy this phone for brand I bought It for its size and specs. Samsung takes a lot from android, you can't use a headphones with remote without being a samsung compatible, you can have certain settings without downloading apps. It kinds blows. It's one of the reasons for my overall rating, I can't get too specific. Verizon, great... I have lots of unwanted apps to disable, junkware alert. No headphones included what a disappointment.  I can clearly say I enjoy this phone more than I though I would. I really thought that I would return it.. But wanted to try something different.

To those I say, the market is dictating that cell phone makers go big, or go home. I have big hands, and I can tell you that it feels good to have something in my hand(s) that won't feel like it'll break. Cell phone quality is excellent, the build is more sturdier than the Note 2 (there were people crying about a loose home button, but that wasn't in mine. I buy that defects could happen, but those are exceptions, not rules in regard to the Note 3.)

Battery Life!!! I have had this thing for a week and so far, the battery last a good day and half to 2 days before I even see a low percent. I have not used the MicroUSB 3.0 cable that came with the Note 3, because honestly, the million and one USB chargers with 2.0 cable do a great job charging my phone. All I would have done was open up yet one more USB cable, so I have left that in the box.Bottom line, buy this phone!!

With the 3GB RAM and Quad core processor you will NEVER run out of resources.  LTE is blazing fast, seems to turn on faster thanHuge screen with gorilla glass 3 (you wouldn't believe the difference even from galaxy nexus with it's \"scratch resistant\" glass). 1080p resolution (enough said).Very long lasting battery.  With that 5.7inch screen you better believe it will suck down power.  The battery delivers.You can root it, it's a pain but it's doable.Camera is really nice.  Custom built in camera and gallery apps are not as good as stock but still pretty good.USB 3.0 - They barely brag about this!  The USB 3.0 chord and charger that comes with the phone is amazing.  The phone will charge from 0-100 in like 40 minutes with the USB 3 cable.  Transferring files is extremely fast with the USB 3 cable (must have a USB 3 port which most new laptops and motherboards have).  USB 2 cables and chargers still work with it, the charge is just a little slower.  Don't freak out when you see the new male portion of the USB cable, it's not proprietary, it's USB 3 and it is still backwards compatible (the right side of the USB 3 cable is the same as just USB 2).Cons:The bootloader is locked so I can't load custom ROMs.  The bloatware is annoying but it's to be expected.NFC doesn't work with Google Wallet even rooted- Annoying, but I think then are working on it.  From what I understand it's a hardware thing where the new NFC format isn't compatible.S Pen is useless for me.  Waste of space in the handset.  I'm sure it's useful for some.

It has a super-HD screen and also comes with a stylus inside a slot on the phone itself.  The screen area is very large and the speakers are adequate but headphones are suggested if watching video.  It has multi-screen so that users can have two of certain applications open at the same time and in split screen, such as Gallery and Chrome or Maps and Gmail.  It has 3 GBs of RAM and is FAST!  A CASE is needed but not a screen protector as the screen is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and scratch-resistant but not scratch-proof.  If one does not put his or her vehicle keys in the same pocket as the device, the screen shouldn't get any scratches.  I bought a screen protector the same day as when I purchased the phone but have now gone two weeks (out of three months' ownership) without a single scratch.  I do highly recommend downloading a home screen launcher, such as the one I use called Buzz Launcher, because the programmed home screen is just ugly and cluttered.  After some experimenting, one will discover which applications you can (and should) turn off to free up RAM.  Overall, this is a highly rated phone by professional websites and, if not mistaken, the best-selling phone in the world right now for a reason.  This phone is much better than the Galaxy S5 and Google Nexus 5.  Another reason I bought this \"phablet\" is so I wouldn't also have to spend money on a separate tablet such as the Google Nexus 7 since this is only 1.3 inches smaller and also has a much better as well as HD screen.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are much much improved.Lets make this review simple and straight to the point, with a few comparisons to other phones:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. And WOW, what a screen it is!There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from the Note 2's 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a lot brighter. This screen has been technically measured to be the brightest screen of any phone, and just now bested by the Samsung Galaxy S5. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(as tested by DisplayMate).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). I can finally use it in the bright sunlight now!* Touch input response is lightning quick. This means when you touch something, it responses nearly instantaneously. It even beats the iPhone 5S, the previous champion, and is only just bested by the HTC One M8.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content! This phone is AWESOME for gaming.3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all - there are literally over 30 features! One of my favorites is the Smart-Stay feature, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle your hand and risk dropping the phone to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app. Also, there are tilt and hand-gesture features for when you want to scroll web pages, emails, zoom in on photos, switch to the next or previous photo or music track, answer a phone call, etc. etc. etc!5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud mono speaker is more useful than having two expansive speakers that space the sound out wider and making it harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use. Although the new HTC One M8 has much improved and louder speakers than the older M7.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly, usually from 20% to full charge in about 2.5 hours. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place. from about 10am to 2am, with heavy usage, I usually end the night at about 30%, which is actually quite amazing since I am on it constantly - phone calls, checking emails, web surfing, checking sports stats and news, and spending hours using my Pulse News app.CONS:*There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. The plastic back nice a nice leathery LOOK, but it is still cheap plastic and feels just like it. Thank goodness most of us cover our phones with cases, so in that aspect it's not a big deal, just that for a $700 phone it should have been made with much better materials and craftsmanship. With rumors of a new Galaxy luxury line, this may be changed very soon though.*The Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. There is a minute, but noticeable lag when you open certain apps or switch between apps with the multi-tasker. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will not satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it in one hang, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative, period. Samsung dominates the phablet market, and that's because this is a nearly flawless multimedia machine with an excellent, crisp, brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and AWESOME battery life.

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III.

It performs very well at each purpose that I bought it for.  I have had it for about 3 months now and have never regretted it.  The large screen is very clear and very vivid.

The pictures are very clear and detailed.  And it is very easy to use.  I think it serves a very good purpose for replacing a tablet and smartphone with one device.  The quality is great.  If you are one of the Kool-Aid drinking Apple fans this can be the salvation to your addiction.  iPhones are puny junk when compared to this thing.  The removable storage is one of the many features that Apple refuses to allow in the iPhones and which I absolutely require in all of my devices.The only drawback is the lack of accessories.

First of all Samsung's manipulation of the android OS is cumbersome and a bit annoying all of the extra garbage and bloatware is a constant nuisance always asking for multiple log ins and sign ups. The recently added security is a major pain and kills apps that don't need to be.My biggest gripe with the Galaxy line is how cheap they feel, the Note 3 of course being the least of the bunch but still too much plastic.Another issue I have with all Samsung devices is the audio processor, this is easily fixed by adding an EQ like Power Amp but even with this add on fails to come close to an HTC one w/beats proc or an iPhone.Samsung has accomplished a major feat going against its main rival Apple but needs to keep a close eye on HTC with aluminum body design and LG making major strides with devices likeke the Flex and G2.I have already seen what the S5 is going to bring and I am by no means impressed so hopefully they make the 4 a much better design both internally and aestheticly.But as for the Note 3, I like the camera ( too much bloatware though)  The screen size and clarity, the pen is useless, but the software is the one thing that will keep me from buying another Samsung.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "SGN3 is the best!", "Author": "benapo", "ReviewID": "R3QNPS3141L1UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great!

The screen is absolutely fantastic.  The device, though large, feels great in hand.  The stylus, with the quick actions that launch automatically and also when you push the button (and air gestures) works very well.  The phone's battery life is unreal.  I got easily 2 days worth fo use without charging, and a solid day of HEAVY usage.  And the SD Card slot is so underrated these days, as well as the removable battery.  The \"leather\" back didn't look or feel cheap to me.  And the phone turns a lot of heads, fid that's your thing.  It's definitely a step up from the Note 2.  Okay, so why didn't I give this phone a 5, or even a 4?According to the rating guideline, a 5 is \"I love it,\" a 4 is \"I like it.\"  Well I liked it at first, but never loved it.  But over the course of a week I ended up not really liking it.  I tried to give myself time to get used to the interface and it never happened.  I changed the launcher, tried to tweak the settings, even tried some themes.  Ultimately it came down to the user interface is just awful.  The colors are not consistent between the different apps and settings.  The Samsung touchwiz software and verizon stuff get in your way more than they help.  Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, the UI was just jarring to me.  I didn't care for the hard buttons either, although that's just a preference.  The way the Samsung framework is set up, there's no easy way to enable on screen keys either.  Overall I was just not happy with the UI and the UX.  Also, the screen ppi settings are wrong for a screen of this size.  everything is \"too big.\"  Samsung could have tweaked it down a bit to make use of the 1920x1080 screen.  As it is, you don;t really get any more usable room in apps than you would in a Galaxy Note 2.  The only places you'll really see the screen shine with pictures, games, web and video.  For me anyway, all other apps seemed to be overblown because the PPI settings are wrong.So I gave it a 3, because overall I think \"it's okay.\"  I ended up getting an LG G2.  I like that phone a lot better.  The LG user interface is more customizable and doesn't remind you of old Android, but more in line with the new Android 4.x user interface.  Plus, the G2 is capable of being flashed with Cyanogenmod, if that's your thing.  Unlike the Note 3, you don;t have to give up the stylus to do that.

I never had a problem with any iPhone.  To this day I think that they are great phones.  I did try several different android phones before but I always went back to the iPhone because I felt that android still needed to mature into a more stable and unified platform.  Well I think that android is definitely at that point now and it is a rock solid and great operating system for phones and tablets.  On the other hand I had mixed reviews about the hardware used on prior android phones.  The specs always seemed impressive on paper but in real life usage I was not happy with the performance of android phones when compared to my iPhone experience.  Something about them just didn't seem right.  That is until I got my hands on a Galaxy Note 3.  This phone is simply amazing.  It has a rock solid operating system plus hardware that is blazing fast at everything!  Plus the screen is awesome and the battery life is great.  The S-Pen has a lot of neat functionality and is not just some gimmicky gadget it is actually useful and nice to have.  I can finally say that I don't see anything that the iPhone has that this phone does not and on the contrary I feel that I couldn't go back to an iPhone because this phone offers things that the iPhone cannot such as the beautiful large screen and the S-pen.

A class of its own.", "Author": "Kiyo M.", "ReviewID": "RJLL23GONBJ8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a new phone and size is not an issue (and you're not biased towards Apple products), don't think: This is the best phone out there to get.There's a reason why the current king of basketball, Lebron James, is endorsing this phone.It is simply the BEST phone..tablet... phablet... mini computer,  entertainment, gadget and reason why Samsung has taken over Apple.The only reason I can see people not wanting this is the size. (or prefer iOS over Android software) I used to be one of those people who thought it looked silly having a phone this size when the first Note came out; however, with tablets becoming more prevalent, and being extremely useful to have daily, having a screen size this big is fantastic. The size really doesn't make it an inconvenience at all as it is slim and easily fits in a pocket. I can wear skinny jeans and the phone can still comfortably fit. I use my phone a lot more now than my tablets. This phone is loaded with features, that even if size becomes a problem to you, there is a One Handed Operation setting where you can adjust the screen smaller! (See TIPS below) It's very useful!I tried out the Note 3 at an actual store and I was instantly envious and sold. I could not wait for my upgrade contract to come..----- Upgraded from HTC Rezound (my old phone) -----My old previous phone was an HTC Rezound. I could not stand that phone! It would get HOT just talking on the phone (It was so uncomfortable putting my ear next to the phone), the battery life was horrible (I bought like 4 spare batteries for it!), and it would lag so much trying to make one simple phone call, it gave me so much headache I had to upgrade right away.  I can't believe how sluggish my old phone really was, as the Note 3 runs smooth like butter. The screen is gorgeous. I can last an entire day with the battery and using it heavily.The Note 3 is a major breath of fresh air! The Note 3 really makes my old phone or any other phone look like a kid's toy phone.Despite the larger screen size, it is still much lighter and slimmer.The Galaxy Note 3 is a luxury first class experience. With the powerful processor and 3GB Ram, it is smooth!-----Pros:- Beautiful 5.7\" Super AMOLED capacitive LARGE touchscreen. Great size and colors. (1920x1080)- Runs so smooth! Fast processor and plenty of memory - 3GB!- Dual Window screen (you can watch YouTube while browsing the web and whatnot; processor/memory is powerful enough to give you a nice experience) - it's like a mini computer!- Does NOT get hot at all while talking! (This device doesn't break a sweat!)- Slim and light- S-Pen is a great amazing feature exclusive to Samsung (You can draw notes and it can automatically convert it text); you can do so much with this pen.- Excellent battery life- Fast charging via USB 3.0 cable (you can still charge using a micro-USB cable, but it also takes commonly available USB 3.0 cables for much faster charging!)Cons:- When you double press the home screen, it pops up \"My Magazine\" app by default. They should allow the user the freedom to assign that to something they want.----- TIPS: ------- Best way to take screen shots is using the S-Pen; hold the side button on the S-Pen and then press down/hold on the screen - it will take a screen shot AND allow you to edit the screenshot on the fly (This is great for pointing out something on the screen or whatnot for sending quickly)- You can also take screenshots by putting your palm on the screen and swipe across like your hand is a scannerTo do this, you have to go  to Settings > Motions and gestures > Palm motion to ON- You can also hold on to the side button of the S-Pen and double tap the screen to open the ACTION MEMO right away.- To make the screen smaller, go to Settings > One-handed operation > Use for all screens to ON; when you swipe quickly from exactly at the side edge of the screen (so you would actually be feeling the silver sides) across and then back out to the edge of the screen, then it would shrink the screen (if that explanation is confusing, then just make a V-motion swipe on the edge)----- CONCLUSION: -----When it comes to screen size, battery life, features, there's just really no comparison to the Note 3. It is a league of its own. The Note 3 is future proof; although it came out in September of last year (2013), newer phones that have come out after is still no comparison to the \"King\" Note 3.The \"smaller verison\" Samsung S5 was released recently this year, but it has less memory (2GB) and smaller battery life.I also have a Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, but it is a pleasure using the Note 3 and I use it more than the tablets now.This phone is easily worth 5 stars and the price. The Galaxy Watch also seems like a nice accessory to get, especially if the price becomes more reasonable. I'm aware the Note 4 will eventually come out, but I'm extremely happy to have this phone in my hands now instead of waiting months and using my old sluggish phone. I'm certainly happy with the Note 3 and I'm sure I'll definitely have a great experience with it until a Note 5 comes out...Highly recommended powerful device in your hands, worthy of the praise it gets from hundreds of people.

Battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. Connection on Verizon is fast, for both Data and Calls. I haven't experience any call quality issues. Camera qualities are second to none. The S-pen is a nice feature to have. Phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands).  Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can.Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that.Design:The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body.  The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too.Hardware:This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues.UI and software:If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities.Camera:So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram  this phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR!Size:The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3.  I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience.Battery Life:It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone...My only complaint:I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me \"Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging\". I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent.On the other side, its worth noting you CAN indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro USB cords, however it will be slow.Overall, JUST GET THIS PHONE. I can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. I fought back and forth whether to get this or the LG G2 for cheaper, but I decided I wanted the best phone I could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung Note3 is the best in its class!", "Author": "Art Beasley", "ReviewID": "R91J043T1F3CN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply put.

For over a year I read reviews of other phones and held off buying because I felt all phones sacrifice in some areas including key things like camera, battery life, removable memory, processor speed, quality, etc.  When I saw the specs and read the many positive reviews I was glad to see this phone made no sacrifices; however, I wasn't sold until I handled it in a retail store and was amazed by the screen image quality, speed and more importantly the very thin and light feel of the phone not only for a screen this size, but for screen of any size.  Some reviews complain about quality; however, I have to disagree; I have been using this phone for 3 months without a case and it looks and feels great even after several drops.  I don't baby this phone and it is holding up great without a scratch.The camera takes amazing photos and videos indoors, many times without using flash.  I have received numerous complements from others, especially when I project onto my 64 inch plasma TV where most phone camera flaws are exposed.The video quality is so good, I find myself watching sports and movies on this phone and letting family have the 64 inch plasma, but I really don't feel like I'm making a sacrifice watching this beautiful screen in my hands vs the 64 inch Samsung plasma on my wall - its that good!!I am not a heavy stylus user; however, it comes in handy in areas I wouldn't have guessed.  I like using it to capture screen images and send to friends with hand scribed notes.  Also in those moments I find myself needing pen and paper to write quick notes, I prefer to use stylus over typing notes. S Educate is an amazing learning tool that has creative use of stylus for fun learning at all ages.The speed is also amazing!  I rarely see the waiting spinning symbol, all apps are there almost instantly.The battery life typically lasts two days with about 30-60 minutes of internet music a day along with 45 minutes of navigation, 30-60 minutes of videos and more each day.I have never been more enthused for a product and anxious to share my experience.

You can actually write down something on the notepad and let you link it to something else. For example, you can write down someone's phone and click on it to initiate the dial keypad.  Or write a website or physical address and click on that to bring up a browser or a Google map to navigate. Basically there is no other phone that competes with galaxy note 3 in this regard. With the auto correction feature when typing something, it is difficult to have typos in what you are writing. The thing that follows your eye when reading to help you scroll works but not sure how to make it do that on purpose. It just does it every now and then. When reading small prints, you can hover over the content with a finger and it magnifies the content. A lot of cool features I have yet to figure out.The battery life is great.

The plug is totally different, and supposedly the included charger will charge it faster, but the older plugs actually fit and charge the phone!

I have owned it for 3 months now and can't seem to put it down. It is big enough where I do not have to squint to read emails such as on the iphone and small enough where I can text and type one-handed (I have bigger hands). The features that come packed with this phone are all very useful and great. There are honestly more features than anyone would need to use, but more is always better. It is very fast and doesn't seem to skip a beat with all my programs running in the background, as well as astounding battery life that lets me go without a charge for a minimum of 2 days. I have not had the mentioned reception issues so it may just be a bad batch of phones or the service in my area is very good.  * Now, I bet you're wondering why I am only giving this product 2 stars when I have just talked so highly of this product. The poor rating is for amazon customer service and their bloatware. I had initially purchased the phone and chosen an address for it to be shipped to. An hour after purchasing I recognized a different address was designated for shipping. I contacted amazon an hour after the purchase (3 days before it shipped) and told them the correct address for shipping. I was told the problem was addressed but behold, my product was shipped to the other address and I did not receive my product in time or at the correct location, not to mention the product came a day late.  * Once I received my phone I was willing to let the shipping mistake slide until I started looking through the programs and realized I could not delete any of the apps that amazon preloaded onto the device. Granted, they are not very high in memory usage but when I spend 200$ of my hard earned money on a good product I would like to have the option of choosing which apps I need and don't need. To put it in perspective it is like buying a car and not having the option of choosing which features you want and don't want. The only thing you can do is disable the apps so they dont run in the background, but they still take up memory that should be free. The phone does come with other preloaded apps (samsung & google) that cannot be removed but they are at least desirable and used every day. I actually considered returning this phone due to the unnecessary bloatware and inability of removal, but decided that the product is too good to let a couple apps ruin its integrity. A company should not jam their products down a customer's throat and expect positive feedback. Quite actually, it deters me from using your apps on any of my devices.SUMMARY:  Phone is a great product, much better than the Iphone 4s I switched from. Amazon shipping disappointed me and sent phone to wrong address. Amazon pre-loads their permanent bloatware apps onto the phone (cannot be removed). My recommendation is to purchase this phone from your cellular carrier as it will come preloaded with less bloatware apps.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone", "Author": "Duncan K.", "ReviewID": "RWW04G5ZGYBZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i went from a s4 to the note 3 and all i can say is WOW!!!! the difference is amazing i cant even use the s4 anymore cause the screen is so small!! this phone is nice its big, but im used to it by now.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lady's Phone", "Author": "Dipankar Das", "ReviewID": "R1UWFJGFLT12BE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Too big for me to cary on my pocket.

I upgraded from the Galaxy Nexus to the Note 3 in hopes of having a more productive phone. The only reason to buy the Note 3 is the stylus and ability to write notes (otherwise it's no different than any phone except much bitter). While the device does a good job with transcribing my chicken scratch, I find it hard to write small enough to fit an email address or other notes.The biggest annoyance I have is that some of the features that made this phone device to desirable just aren't that good. Mainly the split screen apps. The system locks out most of the apps and only allows a small handful of apps to be use. You have no control over the apps. So if you want to watch Slingbox or HBO GO while texting or sending emails you cannot do it. Additionally, the buttons are a bit different than what I am use to. My favorite button was the window selector that allows you to switch apps. Doesn't exist on the Note 3. You have to hold the home button for a couple seconds. I find this very annoying.This device has a lot of promise but Samsung did a horrible job of allowing people to actually use the device. I wish I could have got the S4 or something else.

It has worked superbly for me.  I came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time.  There are two things I'd like to talk about with this phone:  Size, and Samsung's Customer Service.Size:I can never go back to a smaller screen.  I really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that I almost drop it sometimes when I don't have a good grip on it.  I love having so much screen real estate!  I love it and I will never go back.  In general though, I don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature.  I'm 6'2\" so I'm somewhat taller than average, so it may be that I'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit.Samsung's Customer Service:Terrible.  I don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done.  I don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way.  That's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone.  Get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better!  Anyway, it started with my phone arriving.  I opened the box and got right into everything, then noticed that there wasn't an included headset.  I just thought, \"Wow, are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset(that probably costs them $1 to make) with their most expensive phone?\"  So I contacted customer service to see if there was any way I could get one.  I had sold my pair of Beats headphones since I don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking I'd use the stock headset that I thought would come with it.  I basically got a flat \"no.\"  My next aggravation came when I saw a news article that said \"Free $50 Google Play credit for Note 3 Customers.\"  I quickly made my way to the link provided, only to be met with a screen that said \"Due to the high demand, we have run out of our supply of credits.  Thank you for your interest!\"  The promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks.  Really Samsung?  I contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits.  Again, a flat \"no.\"  These are somewhat little things, but it's the little things that make good customer service, and I feel like Samsung fails miserably in that department.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchase Insurance", "Author": "Roger G.

I did a lot of research and waited quite a few months before upgrading from my Galaxy S3. Initially I was satisfied with the device.  10 days after purchasing the device; however, I am stuck paying more money to replace it. Normally I do not purchase insurance on devices and luckily the phone company put it on without asking me. I did not drop or put any excessive pressure on the phone to damage it. I set the device on the counter and when I picked it up a few minutes later the screen was malfunctioning. Having 14 days to take it back to the provider I tried that first. I was informed that there was a pressure crack in the LCD and that apparently I had caused it. Knowing that I had not done anything to cause it I became very upset. I was told that I could send it to the provider but if they determined that the phone was damaged I would have to pay full retail for the replacement refurbished device they replaced mine with. The other option was paying the $100 deductible for my insurance and not knowing exactly what was wrong with the device. I turned to Samsung to solve this delima. They looked at the phone and determined the LCD was cracked, said that I caused the damage to the device and it would cost over $200 to repair. Now I have a device that I did not damage and must pay an insurance deductible on to replace. I asked how to file a complaint with Samsung about this and they said I cannot. After further researching this specific issue I have found that this is actually a common issue with this device. It can actually occur due to temperature changes in the device that are considered normal operating temperatures. I have to note that I loved my Galaxy S3. It was why I stayed with a Samsung device. I was even considering buying a Samsung television because I love my old phone so much. The S3 was durable as hell. I musthave dropped it 100 times before the front glass cracked, the LCD still works flawlessly. Apparently the quality of their products are not uniform across the company and they don't stand behind their products even when they should be under warranty.

I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue...
