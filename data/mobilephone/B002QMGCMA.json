However, for some crazy reason, about 3 weeks ago it started redialing phone numbers over and over, staying stuck in phone records, and just being nuts!  So, I ordered a phone from OEM Shop thinking they were the same dealer I got the phone accessories from.  ***DO NOT US THIS SELLER***They sent me a phone with the charger flap split in two and the white square in the upper right corner on the inside of the battery compartment was gray or missing, meaning water or related damage.  When I let them know, they said they'd send me another one and for me pay for return shipping, so I filed a claim with Amazon.  I had to pay for return shipping (not reimbursed) for their defective phone.  So, since this phone can no longer be bought with cell phone companies, be very careful who you buy it from.  It's a good phone when it doesn't act crazy...which mine apparently fixed itself the next day, and now it's good...for now anyway....; )", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didnt want another contract extension", "Author": "fromMNstateinturmoil", "ReviewID": "R15FGRGANAWBP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is exactly as stated. it's a no frills phone.

Federico", "ReviewID": "R127DJHMJ09YEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a replacement for my wife. She does not like the newer smart phones that are big and clumpy and only uses it for calls and text. This was a perfect fit because she had the same one with T-Mobile and all I had to do was charge it, replace the sim card and that's it. The price was right and in todays market with most plans going to no contract and supplying your own phone, you will see more people buys phones for under $30 bucks rather than pay $600 for something that wont last a year!", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Chantele Belamour", "ReviewID": "ROJ5DOMNF3K6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone worked great while i had it, ended up upgradimg so i sold it to a friend and thry have had it ever since.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "E.
