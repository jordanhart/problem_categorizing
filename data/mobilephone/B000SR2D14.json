The first one broke with everyday use.  I then purchased another because of the appearance.  The second phone was a 'dud'.  It worked for a few days and then stopped.  It would not charge, make or receive calls.  At that time, I had both of the telephones in my possession and returned them both.  The two cell phones were placed in their individual boxes and both shipped back in a larger box (to avoid paying two shipping charges) and returned.  I received confirmation that the 'phone' had been received and immediately send a clarification that there were actually two phones.  I heard nothing.  I followed up to inquire as to what was going on and that is when the unbelievable happened.  A representative named Chris informed me that they only had one phone.  I explained that if the received one phone then they had to have received two because they were both returned at the same time (in the same box).  The response...we can't find it and we are not going to return any more of your money.  That is the short version, this actually went one for several weeks.  They refunded only one of the phones.  When asked to speak with someone else who could resolve this issue I was essentially told by Chris that he/she was the last line of appeal and that this matter was considered closed.  I will never do business with this company again and would not recommend it to anyone. They were unresponsive and ripped me off.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal on Krazr K1", "Author": "RikkyJ", "ReviewID": "R25O5IKC9F7ZUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new unit replaced my wife's Krazr (same model) purchased in 2007. The phone has performed flawlessly but it was dropped and damaged. We saw this selling for less than 1/3 of the original purchases price , so we ordered it. Phone arrived quickly. Charged the battery, after which I transferred the data from the damaged phone into the new unit via \"Motorola Phone Tools\" software (provided with the phone). Works great!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok phone", "Author": "Desi Dude", "ReviewID": "R219UAKX3GLWX9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is snazzy (if that's a word!)- looks good and functional.. but nothing great about it.

Had a silver one of the same model for six years before something broke in it, so was accustomed to the ease of use and loved it.  Keep in mind though, that if you're into texting, it's not the greatest for seniors instead of those with younger fingers and thumbs. It can be done if you have the patience for the small key pad, has a great camera too. I think the web capabilities with the phone are somewhat outdated, but I've been offered a software update for that. I passed on it because the remote area I live in only offers about 2G instead of 4G capabilities anyway.I talk more than anything else, tried a more up-to-date phone for a while which didn't suit me, so am really glad to have found this phone available, and the speaker works great on it too. The vendor gave me great and timely service, staying in communication with me from the first email I sent through the delivery of it.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola krzr k1 cell pone", "Author": "Kris T", "ReviewID": "R2QWQ73TLZUOZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband love it.
