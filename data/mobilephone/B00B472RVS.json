It took some time to set it up the way I wanted, but it has performed flawlessly since.  This phone is a nice step up from my Samsung Exhibit II which took a bath (no, not in the toliet, why does everybody ask me that?  lol).The only downside is that if you want to get rid of the extra AT&T; apps, you'll need to root the phone.  I decided against it since those apps aren't seemingly causing any problems with the E-Mail and other applications I've set up on the phone.  And with an additional 32 meg memory card, I don't need the space they take up.I highly recommend this cellphone.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Khan T.", "ReviewID": "R2IOAUP6IUJPSC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is not 100% unlocked,still At&t;,but it works with T-Mobile.Delivery is fast .The Cosmetic is excellent.Thank you.I would reccommend to my friend", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product.

Retail box packed in bubble wrap and packed inside another box to insure it survived USPS. 13 GB of internal memory minus 1 Gb of ATT bloatware leaves lots of space for apps.

The plunging happens while the phone is sleeping and not even in use. I have two other S3's that have none of these issues, this one may be a lemon. This is the first used phone I have purchased and it may have been a mistake.
