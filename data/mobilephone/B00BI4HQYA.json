{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally,  a prepaid phone that rivals contract phones", "Author": "B. Hall \"bistro223\"", "ReviewID": "RFP4NKLOC2NBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For years people like me have been faced with terrible choices when it comes to prepaid phones.  You always have to pick from the \"Blackberry look-a-likes\", a flip phone,  or a really terrible touch screen phone.  Not anymore.  This phone is as good as higher priced contract models.  Sure it only comes with 2GB of internal memory instead of the 32GB iPhone or Galaxy,  but im not loading 1200 songs on my phone.  I dont need 200 apps on my phone. But even If you were to want to use this phone that way,  you can always load up the micro SD card which is 4GB from the factory,  but will accept a 32GB card. (sold seperately) I just want a phone that will get on the internet when I want it to,  load a YouTube video when I tell it to without buffering for 10 minutes,  and open apps like Angry Birds and Pandora quickly.  This phone does that beautifully.  I cannot say enough about the smoothness and quickness of the phone.  It runs on the famous Ice Cream Sandwich OS from Android,  which most any app is compatible with unlike a lot of the ones on Gingerbread.  anyway,  let me get to the pros and cons of the phone.Pros.1. Slick looking phone,  very flat, and sleek.  It sports a large screen, only 1/2 an inch smaller than the Galaxy S3.  The menu and back \"buttons\" at the bottom are not buttons at all, but rather are lights you just touch...just like the Galaxy S3. It has a home button in the middle at the bottom like an iPhone.  You aren't going to have to feel embarrassed busting out your prepaid phone with this model. It has a sophisticated, respectable look.2. Its fast.  When you move your finger to a command,  it does it.  Just like that,  no thinking,  no waiting.  Just pure seamless operation.  Thanks to its 1 GHz processor it can process commands with impressive speed.  Of course internet pages will load slightly slower than dealing with programs on your phone,  but its still very fast on the internet...even when not on WI-FI.  When on WI-FI it is almost as fast as the cable internet on my home computer.  On simple 3G it opens web pages as fast as a good DSL connection.3. Price.  At only 199.00 you are not going to find another phone that will perform like this one.  This phone performs like a model that costs twice as much.4. No contract.  You get all of the advantages of having a contract phone without the contract!  Sure Walmart now has the iPhone for sale on their Straight Talk plan,  but who wants to spend 700.00 on a phone? Not me,  if I could afford that,  I probably wouldn't be buying a prepaid phone in the first place.Cons1. Battery life.  the lifespan of this battery is pretty terrible actually.  Today,  I took it off the charger at 99% this morning (6:30a).  For some reason it will never say 100%.  Anyway,  by 10:00 am,  it was already down to 63%.  so I downloaded the Juice Defender app,  turned off wireless, and Bluetooth.  It seems to be conserving the battery a very noticeable amount more.  It went from sucking about 10% per hour,  (which is unacceptable to me) to about 4% per hour,  which isn't great, but I can deal with that. It would still be wise to invest in a backup battery somewhere along the way.2. Location of charge/usb plug.  The fact that the location of the charge/USB is on the bottom of the phone may be a plus to people that use a docking station.  I for one,  do not.  when I am in my car I may need to plug in my charger as well as my  3.5 mm AUX cable so I can hear Pandora in my car.  Well,  the 3.5 mm cable input is on the top,  while the charging input is on the bottom.  this causes the phone to sit sideways in its place on the seat,  which is a minor inconvenience for me.That's really all I have to say bad about the phone.  Don't spend 99.00 on a ZTE Merit, spend just 100 dollars more and be so much happier for the same monthly payment.  Just remember,  you only buy the phone once.  Monthly payments are the same with the 99.00 crap phone or the 700 dollar iPhone.  Dont pay 50 dollars a month for a phone that doesnt do what you expect/want/need it to do.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Having your cake and eating it too!", "Author": "H.W.", "ReviewID": "R3CD6NWAAKZ8EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me put it as simply as I can.

For 200$, it's the best deal I've seen on the market. A close friend of mine got a new I-phone 5 for Christmas, and I've yet to see something the $700 phone could do that I couldn't manage on mine. The processor is very fast and I've never had service issues though I live a fairly rural area. Lots of storage space for apps and pictures. The camera isn't out of this world, but it isn't bad either- its about what I expected, and the flash is nice. Same for battery life- neither fantastic or horrible, just turn off extraneous services, (WiFi, Bluetooth, etc) when they're not in use. Overall a fantastic buy!

Even though we couldn't get a signal at our house it was good for emergencies or calling when we were away from home. We don't live for our phone, so it sereved us pretty well. The criteria for going Hi-tech (Smartphone) was, 1- a signal from our home. (Even though we will keep our landline, like I said I am old school and I want it incase I need emergency response) Verizon was the only network that gave us that. 2- No contract. 3- Did I say no contract. So I did my reasearch and found that Net 10 had the best plan. $45.00 a month (on auto charge) and Verizon network. This ph. is great for some newbies like me and my wife. Even at work for me ( I work for the Forest Service and am remote, I get a signal) She can Skype with her family in Europe and text and everything a smartphone does. I'm even getting into the text thing. pretty cool to be able to touch bases without calling. I love some of the free apps apps I've found too. The Flashlight, the Googel Sky map that shows the stars (Freakin Cool)  and others. I know it can do a lot more, but I don't wnat to be obnoxious with it. We're not gamers and don't Fsacebook or twitter, but can see how any thing in the way of communicationg can be Done with this thing. For the $200+ we paid I know my wife can stay in touch with her family, she even takes her mom shopping with her useing Skype and showes her the beach etc.....I know there are more expensive phones out there that stand up and salutye when you turn it on, but this is perfect for us and lest us participate in the communication revolution. Highly recommend. Photos are great. speakers are a huge improvement over what we had and i'll end it here, cause I am so stupid when it comes to what these things do, that I don't know enough to know that I don't know anything.  Get it you'll love it. Also check out this web site. Educate youself.  It was a huge help in understanding how  contract phones and networks and how to get teh right ph. for your situation.

I haven't had a smart phone before, just a prepaid flip phone and that finally broke down. I always had the iPod touch and the iPad for the apps and I hated my old phone but I couldn't afford a \"nice phone\". At 45$ a month, this phone is a great cheap alternative to higher price smart phones. At first sight of this phone, it's very lightweight, but almost was slightly disappointing looking at it. It doesn't look very sturdy or durable especially comparing to my iPod touch, but I treat my electronics with care and I plan to get a cover for it. Turning it on however was a much better experience. Pretty screen. It's very fast, rivaling/surpassing my iPod touch for sure.  The thing I hate about apple is it upgrades and leaves their customers behind. I literally purchased my iPod touch 4 last fall, and the apps don't even work on it anymore since the upgraded to their new iOS, not even Facebook and everything is slow and crappy--- there goes 200$.  Hopefully android doesn't treat their customers the same way.  It has many apps to choose from in the google play store.... All of the ones offered from iTunes it seems... At least the popular ones. It has 4.0 ice cream sandwich which was why I selected it out of the price range phones that had 2.0 (yuck) or somewhere around there.The battery life is what concerns me the most. I got about 8 hours on it yesterday of continuous use. Because it has so many features it can be a battery sucker. I suppose the best way to counter this would maybe get a backup battery.Overall, pretty pleased with the phone. It works on verizon networks. For anyone griping about app crashes, there isn't a device that exists that doesn't crash once and a while.  My iPad does it, my iPod does it, my high price computer does it. It happens.Week 1:A lot of apps to choose from.  The phone runs them quickly and efficiently.  The wifi and 3G are quite fast.  Mind that the 3G is actually 2.5gb of data per month so I have tried to use the wifi as much as possible.  Videos load quickly, just as fast as any tablet.Camera (back facing one) is pretty decent at 5m.  Front facing one is pretty bad/lame but is usable for skype or other video messaging... for selfies, this is not the best camera.  It looks like an old webcam quality.To save battery from drainage, you can hold down the home screen button (the one in the middle) and swipe off the applications to close them down.Extendable storage with a micro SD card so you can load more multimedia stuff.  I'm not huge on that.  I use a few apps like snapchat, words with friends, pandora, bank app etc.  I would not use this phone to spend long hours on apps unless I am at home with the charger nearby.Conclusion:This phone works just as well as any expensive high priced phone.  The camera is decent and the phone is very responsive.  Screen is very nice and the device is very light weight.  Extendable storage, versatile with customization... you are able to move apps, add apps, there is a GPS, wifi works very well.  Nice sound quality (doesn't sound like surround sound but it's a phone, come on, let's be realistic.)  The weakest aspect of this phone is the battery life, just be mindful to charge and close down apps when not in use, also turn the push setting on the mail to off to retain some battery life.  Everything else seems great about it. Cheap but powerful.  I'd recommend this phone.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "LAWRENCE THOMPSON", "ReviewID": "R34FHME2WC02OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome phone compared to the other smart phones!

I recharge it every night.From what other reviewers have said, it appears you have to buy the Tracfone/Straight Talk version if you want to use one of those services.

After a couple weeks it finally stopped doing that.However, immediately afterwards the phone would start randomly leaving me nasty messages telling me that removing the SD card without unmounting it first would cause data problems. I never removed it, but I did manage to lose priceless irreplaceable pictures of my first grandchild. Losing ALL media files became commonplace with this phone if I couldn't get to a computer to transfer files soon enough.The last event with this phone came just days ago when it was connected to a charger. The phone shut down and attempts to start the phone caused it to get so hot I had to remove the battery out of a literal concern over a fire starting.While the phone is still under warranty, I am debating what to do... do I hope it can be fixed?

The screen is good size not too big not too small, and has crisp graphics. The speaker is amazing, the over feel of this phone is nice but I do highly recommend a case and screen protector. Battery life is way better than my previous phones (Samsung Galaxy S2, & HTC One). I've had this phone for four months now and only have one complaint, at times it is a bit slow but nothing too horrible. I clean my phone out often to keep it running its best deleting messages calls and unneeded pictures. There is an amazing app called Clean Master it works great to get rid of junk that slows your phone down. This phone is great I recommend it and you can't go wrong with the Verizon towers it uses super fast at times the 3g blows my wifi out of the water! You can't go wrong with this phone, I would however go with the Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon tower model) if you have the extra cash. I ordered this online and it came unavailable due to high demand. I drove 140 miles to get this phone from a Walmart store I paid $200.00 brand new and got the protection plan as well. I have cracked a small portion of the screen down by the touch buttons but I don't notice it, I happened to take my case off that day just to feel the phone in it's natural state lol than I dropped it. Get a case!!! Can't go wrong with this phone Straight talk has a bunch of junk phones running on ancient android versions.

The screen is super sharp, very nice display. Very quick 3G and the service is through Verizon, so you are basically getting a Verizon Smartphone for $45 a month. Android 4.0 is wonderful, everything moves super fast even without using a wireless network. Plenty of memory to install everything you need. The phone itself is thin and sleek.
