I had the tilt device for two years, it was a good phone. I enjoyed being on the 3G network. I also used it to tether as a modem for my laptop, no issues there, great for visiting clients at Starbucks and not having to pay for internet. Really nice not having to fumble around with setup on that tethering. I used to watch youtube via player application, before youtube finally made their own plugin. I would check out Fifth Gear, top gear, etc episodes during my lunch hour, it was good fun, espcially with the tilt screen while I was eating. After two years the battery needed replacing, I never did, but it sure needed a new one. The charge was only lasting a couple hours. I dropped it twice, and had the screen replaced once for $100. The time the screen needed replacing it was thrown from the second story of my apartment, the phone is pretty durable. Most phones would have smashed to pieces.What can it do that an iPhone can't you ask?* Tether as a modem* Internet Access with AT&T; via 3G for $20/month NOT $30 like on the iphone* Full keyboard* SMS messaging, (add pictures to text msgs)* Run office applications (word, powerpoint, etc)* Screen tilt* Create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking (sweet)* No I-Tunes or Qucktime malwareWhat does an iPhone do better?* Larger screen* Better battery life* Backlight auto adjusts brightness, saves battery* Shuts off faster, no buttons on front that accidentally turn it on* Looks better (impress your friends, the tilt looked like a brick)* Better support if/wehn it breaks, at least implied* More applications* Larger storage up to 32gb with 3GS* Ipod / music work much better, easier to use etc* Voicemail stores on the device* GPS device with compass can tell you which way to turn not just your location* Thinner, lighterAll in all I am planning on keeping the iPhone after having the tilt for 2 years. I still love the tilt though... nothing wrong with that phone at all.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good workhorse Smartphone - fully featured", "Author": "K. Coker", "ReviewID": "R2K8CT64KA56E7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As the title suggests, I consider this Smartphone to be a good work horse.A previous poster listed a few features on this device, I've expanded some of the detail on that and added some other info.* Tether as a modem - very helpful and less expensive than buying a standalone aircard.* Full keyboard - there is a soft keyboard you can type on without having to slide out the keyboard everytime you need to type something.* Can open, edit, save Microsoft office files (word, powerpoint, etc) (on an iPhone you can only view not edit).* Screen tilts - helpful to reduce glare* Create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking - without additional costHelpful tips for Windows MobilePeriodically Windows Mobile devices experience registry corruption.  The best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device.  By doing these periodic resets (in my experience 2 times a year is necessary), the device remains responsive and less buggy.There is a lot of functionality built into the Tilt that is handy.  It is one of the better Windows devices for navigation.  Using a bluetooth GPS bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Device", "Author": "Bookworm", "ReviewID": "R2DR5T9Z3CPDLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really good device. I have had many cellphones and PDA's and this is one of the best ones I have ever had. It is durable, has good battery life and an easy to use qwerty keyboard. The tilting action makes it easy to see what you are typing with no glare. The video resolution is good and SD card makes it as expandable as you want. You can switch out cards if you start running out of room or want to keep some files private. I highly recommend this device. I have used it in a busy medical practice loaded with references and resources; and with the Google mobile apps bar, I am on the internet in a flash and can access the web or my Google apps.

Got it back in 2007, and it's still holding up. After 4 years of much use and traveling, I've never had a problem. There isn't even a single scratch on the screen, and I never even bought a screen protector for it. The only things I've had to replace were the stylus a couple times, and the back once. The stylus is sturdy and works well, but eventually the tip broke off it. As for the back of the phone, the latches on the original one broke so it wouldn't clip back on.It's keyboard and ability to flip upwards makes texting very comfortable. It is also nice and bright, bright enough to light up a small room.Only real thing is the technology it has, compared to the technology we now have made in the past 4 years. Some problems are inability to play youtube videos, and it can lag sometimes. Nothing else besides that, really.The camera on the phone is pretty good. It takes decent videos, but it takes awesome pictures. Crystal clear.So overall, it is an awesome phone. After having it for 4 years, I'm still not tired of it. I plan to keep it until it finally breaks (which may be a while!). But hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

It was THE flavor of choice and had a number of things I wanted.  I had it for three weeks.  Of the time, all the windows features worked fine, didn't have difficulty with freezes or other things that people reported.  I set up my email and it failed numerous times - would not automatically send/receive without going thru hoops.  Anything sent was visible for < 1 hr and anything received was also visible for ~ 1 hr.  There was no auto-delete function invoked.I was on the phone with AT&T; for > 6 hrs over the course of the last two weeks.  They agreed there was a problem.  I took it into an AT&T; store where their store management reproduced the problems (down to the last one) and said he agreed too.  Lacking the email function, this smart phone isn't such a smart phone and not worth the box it came in.I replaced it (paying the difference in $) with a Blackberry Torch.  I've now had it 3 weeks (The Torch) and have had ZERO problems and have not had a need to call tech support, not even once.One other thing that should be changed - the keys and the backlighting make for difficult use of the keys unless the room is dim.
