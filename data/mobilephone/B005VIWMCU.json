It doesn't freeze frequently but it does freeze up enough to be a nuisance. The camera doesn't have a flash but that really wasn't important to me. Battery life is OK.

Don't forget to reboot your phone once a week to keep it working smoothly with no stutters or freezes and make sure you use a 32 g sd card. There are so many ways to customize this phone with phone features and apps that you will want to have the whole capacity of memory available. Its not likely you will use the entire 32 gigs but its so cool to see the face of iPhone users when they ask u how much memory your Galaxy S has!", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice screen but everything else is sub par.  too bad it looks good but does not perform", "Author": "fanpro \"fanpro\"", "ReviewID": "R3BKA8I4BBIPS7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Samsung did a very poor job with this phone.  slow, bloated os.  crashes.  reboots for no reason. drops calls.  looks cool but fails way to often.

I bought this for two features: the ability to record in 720P and that it accepts microSD cards (of which I am using a 32GB one). The video quality during the daytime is good enough so that license plates are clearly legible, although I cannot say the same for night time quality (a problem inherent to most cameras).To speed up the GPS signal acquisition, I'd highly recommend putting a SIM card into the phone as it is very difficult for the phone to determine it's location upon power up without one (even in a clear area).", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, inexpensive smartphone", "Author": "Tara", "ReviewID": "R1E5NS9U7VNJYV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the same phone and we ordered this one for my husband. He wanted a smartphone, though he hardly uses most of the features, so we didn't feel the need to buy a more updated model for $500. This one is great. The touchscreen is accurate and responsive. The camera is more than decent. We both use ours frequently for sending photos to friends/family, taking pictures of PowerPoint slides in class, etc. The phone is user-friendly and I'd definitely recommend it.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome and Simple to use", "Author": "Louise Binion \"Louise\"", "ReviewID": "RLF7BS9VPESS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung Galaxy 2 has WIFI and is super easy to use...

Comparing this phone to mine I could tell that it was a bootleg version. The packaging was a generic Samsung box,  the cords were completely different from the ones I have, and it doesn't come preloaded with the movie Inception like it's supposed to. The phone was obviously used and did not have the original back piece even though the description says it's new. Within a week the phone had problems with the apps working properly.
