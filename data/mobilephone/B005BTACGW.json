{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good middle of the road phone", "Author": "Tee Ball \"Frank Lee Speaking\"", "ReviewID": "R476SSOAPB3MF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let's face it. If you are considering this cell phone, you are not expecting to pay for, nor will you get a cutting edge smart phone. I bought this phone and activated it on PagePlus so that I could enjoy some of the features of phones you might get on a plan costing $80 to $100 per month. Also, I wanted to move on from the awful experience of owning a Tracfone/Net10 prepaid feature phone. In that context, this phone has quite a bit to offer, with some caveats. First I should tell you that it will help if you're somewhat techie to get the full use of the HTC Ozone running Windows 6.5. I will assume you wouldn't activate it on VZW, as there have to be better choices on their plans by now than a several generations old Windows phone. If you have a plan on which data is limited, you should get the NoData utility to shut the door on data transfer \"in the background.\" Next you may want to get the Opera browser which makes web surfing way more intuitive than Internet Exploder, and much faster. Both of these additions proved to be a bit fiddly for me, trying to navigate to, and install the software. Google is your friend here. There's help out there, but you have to dig a little. Remember that web pages will render very small on the 2.4\" screen, and you will have to zoom in and out frequently. The Opera interface makes this much easier to do than IE, and it seems to know where to align the viewing window on the page automatically so you don't have to scroll with the 5-way button all over the page. Web surfing in general is far better than it was on my old Net10 Phone, a Samsung R451C, however, if you  want YouTube, you need to watch it in IE. The Ozone's home page is nice looking, and gives you the basic info you need at a glance. Other than the obligatory time and date, you can see whether you have missed calls or have appointments or messages of any kind. There you will also find the familiar Windows \"Start\" soft key on the lower left, and the contacts key, lower right. Initiating a message or call is much faster with less hoop-jumping than the old Samsung. Beyond that it gets a little sticky. For instance, if you want to see your actual battery status, you must do a lot of menu drilling. Press Start, navigate to the settings icon which, after selecting, you see a seven item menu with \"More...\" at the bottom. Select More and you get yet another seven item menu with \"More...\" at the bottom. Select number 2, \"Power\" and you get another menu with \"Power Management\" and \"Power Information.\" Select the first option, and finally you see the battery status bar, along with backlight brightness and a few other switches for power management. I had to do this many times to finally remember the location of the information I wanted. This is typical of the O.S. Touch screen devices have left phones like this in the dust for navigation and simplicity, but remember, we're saving a bunch of money and getting some great functionality that can't be had with other prepaid plans. Before I had activated this phone, I was comparing it to the old Sammy, and I was concerned that in most places, the Net10 Samsung showed a better signal than the HTC Ozone. It didn't matter in the end because the Ozone can text and call just fine even when it displays one bar, and sometimes no bars. The earpiece sound is different though... more bass, or possibly just less high frequency sound. Callers sound as though they have deeper voices. I'm not a heavy talker, but no issues really with the business part of this phone. The WiFi on the Ozone is a nice feature that will save you some data usage. It works just fine with my DSL and plenty fast. The communications functions of this phone are quickly accessible through the comm manager by pressing the function key then the spacebar. That lets you switch Bluetooth, WiFi, data, airplane mode and the phone radio on or off. This phone is CDMA (Verizon), or GSM (AT&T;), and comes with several outlet adapters to work about anywhere in the world. Battery life is pretty decent for my usage, which is mostly standby, some texting and daily internet usage.  One charge will last for days for me. As for typing, I make too many mistakes on a touch screen keyboard, and the HTC is only a little better. I wish they made this style phone with a larger screen and keyboard. I've had to adjust by being more deliberate and making myself go a little slower to reduce mistakes. I'm getting better, but given all the new phones with huge screens, this phone, screen and keyboard are small by comparison. Why not make a phone in a Blackberry form factor with a three inch screen and a bigger keyboard? Another small gripe is the 5-way scroll/enter button. The center button is just a thin bar which I often don't hit squarely and end up jumping a line instead of getting the desired function. You rely on it heavily. It should be easier to use. Let's face it. Cameras on cheap phones suck. They can't handle contrast or moderately low light, and the pictures are muddy. I'm spoiled by my DSLR, and I find the Ozone's camera barely useful. I rarely use the video feature, but it can't really be any better than the still camera. This capability is only useful if you have no other choice.In summary, the HTC Ozone is working fairly well for me. It's much more useful than my old Net10 phone due to better web access and threaded messaging, and it's only five or six dollars more per month than the plan I had before. The Opera browser makes it easy to page down long web pages, not a line at a time, but a page at a time. It allows a cheapskate like me, born before the subscription era, to have what I need for under $30 per month. I work for a very large company where the employees are strolling around with iPhones and Galaxies galore, mostly just to hang around on FB, or play video games at a cost of four to seven hours of their labor per month. I'm getting much of what they're getting for a lot less, albeit much less of a status statement.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty cool phone", "Author": "petesura", "ReviewID": "RIRNZA57QQRP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "solid phone. does everything advertised and more. the keyboard feels really awesome and natural. i got this phone after trying a touch screen phone.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cell", "Author": "adp \"amber\"", "ReviewID": "R3J535AMZFDIM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is cute and works well great screen and some really good options to personalize the phone I didn't keep the phone because it didn't work with my plan.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice phone, good network, good os, service plan a bit expensive", "Author": "W.
