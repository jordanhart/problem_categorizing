I broke my htc thunderbolt and didn't want to upgrade since verizon new plans suck. Phone seems quick because of the smaller screen. Auto resize takes away any webpage size problems.  I put the extended battery in from the get go so i have no problem making it 12 hrs. Keyboard felt small till your fingers get used to it. Make sure you have a larger sd card because ir only comes with 2 gigs.

And my Motorola Droid Pro, has outlived a iPhone 3gs, and other petty things... Out of all honesty, the camera on the Pro was better than my iPhone's!!! Love it to death!

I got it used and was warned about a small missing piece of plastic in the corner of the keyboard. That was literally the only defect on the phone and that wasn't the kind of problem that causes any problems in using the phone. It worked great. As far as Droid Pros themselves, I liked mine for the most part while I had it. But I went through three of them, and each of them had charging port issues. My friend has also had two Droid Pros that the charging port became loose in and stopped working. I have an iPhone now, but as far as Droids go, I really liked this one.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great replacement for my Blackberry", "Author": "tsr_thanatos", "ReviewID": "R1O75DAZXDD1UI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I'm still getting used to the Android phone, it does SO much more than my Blackberry can, and MUCH faster too.
