Detailed review follows...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R17KZVQ8QF71W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is my replacement for my original and much loved S2 I9100 Unlocked phone that I carried for 3 years since it was new and came with Gingerbread 2.3 OS. This one with Jelly Bean OS I find so improved over the original one. The 4.3 screen is just the right size to read emails, surf the web, watch videos. I no longer like any screen to be larger than 4.3 to 4.7 as they seem to be bulky and heavy. So I bought this phone as I wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably.***The new one I own is the I9505P, which is the best one to buy. These come in I9105, I9105L and I9105P. The letter at the end stands for the features and where produced etc. The one with the P at the end is the ONLY version of this phone that has BOTH NFC (Near Field Communication) and OTG (On the Go) where you can buy an adapter and plug a flash drive or other USB devices into this phone and it will read it (at least from my experience with it and online research). If you buy the regular I9105 or the I9105L, then there is neither of these. Be sure and ask the seller before you order.Also, mine started auto updating from Jelly Bean to Kit Kat the newest OS because it is a I9105P (the elite one). The P is most like the original I9100 S2 with the same specs except in internal storage is 8MB vs 16MB in the older I9100 original S2 International Unlocked one.PROS:+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Since the 4.3 inch screen and smaller phone is sleeker and also lighter, it fits anywhere--no more heavy and bulky phone to drag around. And I installed a lightweight TPU cover on it and screen protector). Both you can purchase at a very low cost online.*Note that the S2 I9100 (original) and the S2 I9105 (Plus) have the same outside chassis (design), size etc and can use the same covers, screen protectors etc.+ STANDARD SIM CARD SLOT is on this just as the original S2 I9100 had. However, it will accept a Micro One as well if you insert it properly with great caution as I followed a video on youtube on how to do this. So I installed each a Standard Sim, and it worked, then I also installed a Micro Sim into it by its self with no adapter (carefully) and it worked. This is tricky but can be done. If you have a Micro Sim, you can also call your provider and get them to send you a Standard Sim and transfer it onto your new Standard Sim from your Micro Sim card. Or go into a phone store and let them do this for you. Or you can ask me in the comments and I will tell you how...+ Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser). Be sure that on the WiFi settings, Advanced that you keep the WiFi on always and to not have the WiFi turn off when the phone is sleeping (or the screen turns off)--this way the WiFi will stay on until you turn it off. Be sure to remember to turn off WiFi when you finish to save battery!+ Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has decent battery life, it is not the best, but the battery is not that large in the phone. I still get all day from the battery IF I turn off the WiFi when not in use and close up apps I do not use. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness.*To save memory and battery life, I wrote an article on how to turn off apps not needed. Let me know if you need this and ask in the comments.**Apps - I keep my Apps from the Playstore down to 12 MUST HAVE FREE APPS FROM THE PLAYSTORE, and all are pretty small and do not take up much room on this phone nor use much battery. Let me know if you want that list.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE - This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.55 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.+ CAMERA - The 8MP camera takes superb picture inside and outside with or without flash. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Sid by side I found the picture quality wonderful in the phone and in my camera (both have excellent colors, detailing etc).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would as even the OS is now up to date and it is like a NEW S2 all over again but BETTER! Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the bigger phones such as S4 and S5 etc, want a 4.3 screen that is a more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.
