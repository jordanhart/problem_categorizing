Screen is a bit small but usable and much better than a flip phone. Has almost all the features of an expensive smart phone in a compact size. Certainly not for watching movies as small and 2G. Has a quirk that it goes to lock when you make or receive a call and have to double tap it to turn on speaker or to use keyboard to enter pin numbers or info. Speaker needs to be on to disable the lock feature.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone itself is great, but no tech support available from Samsung", "Author": "PrepGal14526", "ReviewID": "R1240DVYGJ5LKY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone shipped much faster than expect and I really loved the look and feel of it.  However I have to give it two stars because when I ran into problems converting it from German to English the tech support people at Samsung were not able to help me at all! The phone came with instructions on how to switch from German to English, which did not work for me since the options were not even available when I turned on the device. When I contacted Samsung they were most kind, but said that they did not have the training or experience with this kind of phone. I did not understand what Global phone meant, but assumed it would work in the USA.  Apparently it was my mistake, but I'm disappointed Samsung couldn't help at all.  I had to return it :(", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "galaxy star is a good product", "Author": "Hyacinth", "ReviewID": "RYCBZ8N3KWFD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is working great so far no problems as yet delivery was on time and I would recommend itto anyone who needs a small and efficient phone", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "bonito y practico !!!", "Author": "Calos D.", "ReviewID": "R1W1BCGGO0PRE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the phone is very nice comfortable and practical, is a gift for my wife and she loved it! here in Caracas Vzla works best! time delivery! are fast! check not only bad thing well when asked from amazon and bring not flash!", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "i Love it", "Author": "Sonia Salas", "ReviewID": "R22UX0MMLQUQLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved the size, I'm in love, it seems very easy operation, the screen resolution is very good, is light.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "cool", "Author": "Diany", "ReviewID": "R1AU6HDHFFMGY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its ordered this for my sister she says it a great phone learning to use it, it came new as stated and it to this day working absolutely great", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung Galaxy Star S5280 2MP, 4GB, Jelly Bean, WIFI Factory Unlocked World Mbile Phone - White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41acyofiGLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D3LI8OI"}}
