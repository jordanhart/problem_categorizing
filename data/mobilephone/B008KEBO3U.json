{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sexy phone", "Author": "Harry Seward", "ReviewID": "R386LTXZVSGY03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've played around with Samsung's SIII and HTC's One X but none of them compare to how sexy and well built as the LG Optimus 4X HD.When you hold the LG Optimus, you know that you're holding something unique. The back cover has some texture to it and doesn't feel flimsy when you take it off. Its widths, or the side of the phone, has these two silver perpendicular lines which makes your fingers sink into the middle. Think of it as a trench that stretches from top to bottom. The quality of the plastic and physical build is strong and secure. Overall, the phone doesn't feel cheap.Button wise, this phone has only three used for power and volume. The power button can be found on the top right of the phone. Shaped like the phone, the rectangle power button sticks out enough so you can locate it by feel alone and has a nice spring to it when pressed. The volume rocker, however, doesn't share the same qualities as the power button. Located on the left side of the phone, the volume rocker doesn't stick out enough, due to the silver perpendicular lines, and isn't springing. Not a problem for me but others may not like it.The battery life isn't the greatest but you shouldn't expect much from a quad-core smartphone. Depending on how I use the phone, the battery will last me 3 hours if I'm gaming (Final Fantasy 3) and 6 hours on typical use (web browsing, 30-60 minutes gaming, email, and music). I'm planning to test how long the battery will last when its only playing music soon...Update 9/19/12After manually, yes manually, updating the software from v10c to v10f and installing a fix for the nvidia CPU, battery life is much better than first reviewed. First, the software update reduced the amount of heat generated by the CPU to more reasonable levels. Instead of being hot after hours of playing, the phone becomes mildly warm. As for the nvidia fix, apparently it makes the CPU work the way it was intended to. What I mean is by that is the CPU actually has five cores, not four. The fifth core is only active under minimal phone activity. An example of this is listening to music with the screen turned off. I've listened to Pandora radio on wifi for nine hours straight and my battery is only at 60%.As for storage, this phone comes with 16GB internal storage and a SD card slot up to 64GB. Unfortunately, the LG Optimus does not come with a SD card so look to invest another $5 to $30 if you need additional space.Update 9/18/12I just noticed the low speaker volume and heat issue when gaming for long periods. The speaker volume doesn't matter too much but the heat issue gets me worried. The processor is located where the LG logo is on the back cover. After about 2 hours of gaming it gets warm. Not unbearable but it does make me worry about the longevity of the hardware.Pros:Unbelievable battery life (Update 9/19/12)Looks sexyUnique feelDoesn't feel cheapCons:No SD cardVolume rocker isn't greatestSpeakers aren't the loudest (Update 9/18/12)Does get hot after 2 straight hours of gaming, only on software version v10c (Update 9/19/12)", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product Review", "Author": "Graciela", "ReviewID": "R1MZM5ZPM2QPCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, works perfectly with any operator in Venezuela, beautiful design, very good speed when surfing the internet, good reception in calls and excellent operating system, good camera and good size storage, I love this phone.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best price / quality / performance.", "Author": "Pedro Gil A", "ReviewID": "R33N0YLP58I953", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best option you can find when choosing a cell phone, LG is a great brand that has never left me bad (I have TV, bluray, refrigerator, washer and dryer.

I bought this phone after Hurricane Sandy Delayed my Order for a Galaxy S3 and my friend was leaving the states to come to Belize and i needed a phone and wanted to upgrade to a quad core having sold my HTC Sensation 4G.Circumstance 2. I prefer LCD screens to AMOLEDCircumstance 3. Low cash flow - Somehow as i was looking for quad core phones this one flew under the radar. I need a phone with a removable battery, and expandable memory, therefore HTCs ONE X would not work for me. SO i went ahead and purchased the S3 and as the shipment of the phone was being delayed somehow i stumbled upon this phone, read and watched a bunch of reviews and i wondered to myself \"why am i going to spend over $200 more for a S3 with accessories(case, screen protector & belt holder) when i can get this LG 4X HD with the same accessories for so much less, and use that $200 for something else. The difference in price just did not seem justifiable, that was the deal breaker. Therefore i quickly cancelled the order for the S3 and ordered this.Yes in benchmarks the S3 comes out on top in most categories,Yes the S3 has more appeal, cache, Hype and probably higher resale valueyes the S3 has some cool tricks like automatic dialing, and multiple screens thingy etc.BUTThis bad boy is no slouch and looks really nice, feels solid and has a goregeous screen. Works well in direct sunlight and in general is overall a solid phone, Runs high end games(like ShadowGun) flawlessly,(Asphalt 7, runs good, but not as silky smooth as on my old HTC sensation, Spider-man i have no idea why it runs so jerky, not sure if its the phone or Android), other games run great.PROS- Great Price, i mean this is literally unbeatable- Excellent for those(like me) who are on a budget- The phone all in all is a very good phone read the reviews, from GSM Arena, Cnet, TechRadar etcCons- Doesn't run some high end games smoothly- LG's UI doesn't seem as fine tuned as HTC's Sense. Like copying and pasting isn't as nice, the LG keyboard has  \"$\" and \"&\" on page 2 when you select the number option which takes up alot of time, both of these UI quirks are very annoying to me. I think i will download another keyboard.I would Highly Recommend this phone", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best phone ever made !", "Author": "M.C.", "ReviewID": "RBXINBFTDTEOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've played with almost all other top smart phones like Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4S but none of them comes close to the Optimus 4X HD ...

Before I purchased it, I read all the negative reviews I could find as those tell the story of what's wrong with a phone, esp when you get consistent problems. Everything I read negative, and there were few, were various problems. The most frequent was not being able to hook up to a specific GSM network.  I'm no wizard, but thru some sources, I found that I could get this phone to work well with any GSM network I was using by having the proper APN settings and you need to have almost all of them for the phone to do all its potentials. Without these, things like messaging, attaching files, etc just doesn't work. Basic settings for calls are pretty much default with your SIM card.I'm pleased with the 8 Meg camera. The flash is a little inconsistent in that if it's on 'auto', it doesn't necessarily go off when you need it. I just set it to 'on' if I think I need it.  There may be some settings that determine when the flash will go off that I haven't discovered yet.  The 'panorama' setting is cool but you need to know how to control your speed of movement for a good shot....I'm not good yet.One flaw... no user's guide.  Had to find one on the internet and that worked out ok. Took awhile to find it and it is for the Optimus 880P.The battery is a bit of a letdown, but you can control a lot of the functions to extend the life. If I sleep the screen, turn off the WiFi, all running programs and the 3G, with the phone charged at 100% at night, it will drop overnight to maybe 97%. Heavy use during the day requires a daily recharge. I'm not a heavy user and most of my experience has been learning to use the different features which use up the battery. On days I do normal stuff, my battery shows 75%+ battery left at the end of the day. One thing that really helps the battery life is to reduce the brightness of the screen, whenever possible and easy to do.One of my favorites of this phone is the screen is just large enough to make this phone a decent eReader. I have downloaded a very cool eReader program for epub format books called Aldiko and it is a great reader program. Once you 'authorize' your phone, you can put most any epub in the library.  I use lots of library books, so I need to read them before they vaporize.Since I'm only 3 weeks into this phone, I haven't experienced a couple of the complaints that the phone just stops working. Comes with a 1 year warranty which I hope I'll never need. The screen protectors I purchased were worthless to me, probably because I couldn't install them correctly, but the screen is 'Gorilla Glass' and pretty durable. I do recommend a basic phone body protector. The screen shows lots of fingerprints and smudge marks, but I use a microfiber towel to clean it regularly. A bit of a pain but it does the job.Hope this helps. Great screen, fast processor, 16 gig internal memory plus micro card if needed lots of features. I suppose in 2 years it'll be obsolete but not for me. I also recommend backing up the phone from time to time in case you need to do a 'hard reset'.Good luck and hunting. PS. I bought mine online from a dealer I could actually talk to on the phone.

This Quad core chip definitely make this phone blazing fast. Nvidia Tegra has optimized some games with awesome graphics to this phone example :Dead Trigger.

Front camera is an 1.3 mp one which is fair decent for making ocassional video calls.Speaker:The speaker is just fair it is not the loudest even though this also depends of the quality of the media.OS:This phone is operating with android ICS 4.0.

I am absolutely stunned how this phone has gotten so many positive reviews claiming it to be blistering fast, when my phone can't go between 2 simple applications without glitching. Everything on this phone works poorly. And sometimes it simply doesn't work at all. Even when I try to delete emails from my Yahoo app, it'll take literally 20, 30, 40 seconds and sometimes more. If you get an incoming message, the phone simply stops processing whatever it is you have open. It just stops working completely. If you're watching a video, it'll stop playing, pause, and restart. Just swiping between screens can cause the phone to buffer and glitch. I complained to the seller and he told me that there was nothing they could do because it did not have a warranty. Why then, did every other phone specifically state that it did not have a warranty? And Amazon refuses to do anything. What a piece of trash.The phone I received is a lemon. The phone is terribly sluggish and the overall performance is absolutely horrendous. When swiping between pages, the pages will freeze and when typing a message, the letters won't come up sometimes for several seconds and then rapidly fill the page. Even when on my home wifi with speeds at 20Mbps, pages take a long time to load. I have upgraded the OS, killed apps and cleaned the cache, and still terrible performance.

It is slightly longer but have significantly larger screen due to removal of the thick bezels on the top and the bottom of the phone. It is way-way faster than LG Optimus 2X and feels lighter. For some reason it feels more responsive than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (T-Mobile USA) - that may be because of the bloated GUI Samsung installs on the phone.When I got the phone it could not find T-Mobile at all. there were two different AT&T; options so I assumed the phone is not completely broken. The Wifi connection worked great as well. I started to sweat a little because $400+ USA would be a lot of money for a non-working device but then I remembered that some people have complained about slow data speeds which got fixed with a firmware upgrade so I decided to give it a try.I checked the firmware version and it was V10a so I upgraded it to version 10F (using a phone app and my WiFi internet connection). The T-mobile support come up. This problem may be due to the limited spectrum that T-Mobile is using here in Los Angeles USA and probably has nothing to do with the phone.I switched to T-mobile and I was able to make a call.Unfortunately the data speed is limited to Edge only.I have noticed that my Samsung Galaxy S3 has a better reception that this LG (Optimus X4 HD) phone so I decided to go to the T-mobile store.

So it set up fast and ran fast. Also, I loved the very clear and high resolution large screen and so many superb features of this phone. Well, I was truly in love with this phone however, I could never get the WiFi on this phone to be very strong. Comparing it to my Samsung tablets and Samsung S3 Mini, the WiFi on this phone was so very weak. (I tested these out with WiFi Analyzer free from the Playstore for comparison). It connected very quickly to my home router and stayed on, but even close to my router the signal was very weak. So I tried several things to no avail. Since I rely on WiFi to get onto the internet, very, very sadly, I had not choice but to return this phone. It is very possible that I just received one with a weak WiFi radio, just sadly one of those things. For you the reader, you may not have any problems at all. For me, if this phone had a stronger WiFi signal, I would have kept the phone and be happily using it now!

Also the headphone jack would not detect the headphones properly if you recently used the FM radio so I returned it.So I paid up for this phone ($297 versus $218 for the Sony). The screen was very good like the HTC One V and the interface presentation is very sleek, better than the Sony Xperia J.The interface of the FM Radio and Music Apps are wonderful. The phone read the SD card without issue and the headphones jack worked properly going from FM Radio to playing music. The dolby digital sound mode makes music sound really great as well.The quad core processor definitely performs, I get 3.5G network on T-Mobile, and sound quality is really clear.The phone is big, so one handed use maybe difficult if you have smaller hands, but the larger screen makes viewing web pages and typing text messages a pleasure compared to smaller screen phones.The camera is decent and can do features like panorama pictures, you can even say \"Kimchi!\" or \"Cheese\" to automatically take a picture. I assume the video is ok to but haven't tried it yet.I only give the phone 4 stars because the software that connects the phone to the computer is Windows only and the update process to recent Android was not fluid. I was able to connect the MAC to transfer content to the SD card though.A few word of advice when updating the phone using the software update on the PC is to remove your SD card, and turn off Aut-Play in Windows so it doesn't try to connect as an MP3 player during the update process. The update was smooth sailing after making these adjustments.I'm really happy with this unlocked phone.

The screen is at least as good as the nexus 4's.Some people don't like the LG overlay on android 4.0, but I think the lock screen is pretty cool, and the rest is so customisable you can make it look like you want.Sure there are a few things in jelly bean that this phone does not have, but it does everything else fantastically.I get 2 days easy out of the battery if I just use the phone as a phone with occasional emailing and web surfing. But can run the battery down pretty quick if I want.Just make sure that you update the software. You may need to do it several times, 'cos it increments one update at a time. My phone came with v10d out of the box, but latest version is v10h. Updating is simple as running the software app that is included.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the hardware but the software interface is behind the competition", "Author": "ambrose akpotaire", "ReviewID": "R14M99YNJ8SLUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the hardware but the software interface is behind the competition.

I wanted originally the Nexus 4 but because of the insane demand waiting two to 3 months for it did not work for me. Maybe in the future when Nexus 5 comes out so in the meanwhile I ordered this also because my Sony Xperia was long in tooth and not cutting it no more.First impressions.Wow gorgeous minimalist design. I can see why this was originally launched in the German market. The screen was vibrant but not overly saturated like the S3 Galaxy (awesome phone) I gripped it with confidence, no flexing or creaking. Images and text very crisp. Screen response was snappy and instantaneous. Apps burst open with no lag. Call quality was good from both ends. A good first impression.Detected a lil heat bloom which I suppose is to be expected with 4 cores. I'll keep an eye on that. Detected my sim card and network (tmobile) promptly. was able to dial right away despite it being an international phone. Prob stuck with edge speeds data wise until tmobile builds out that 1900mhrtz 4g network. But Wifi everywhere helps immensely!
