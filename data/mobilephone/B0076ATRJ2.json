The price is so low. YES it's real, BUT the price rises with each purchase. I paid $330.00, it's now $375.00, as I write this review. Build Quality? Third times a charm? YES! It finally looks good! The back is NOT made from plastic regardless to what some \"know-it-all\" tells you. Sorry I do not remember the name of the material they used but I remember it has the famous Saffiano Leather look by Prada. Camera? Well for me that's a bad question but I shall try my best. I'm a photographer, so I have no problems with the camera , it's great! I used in a room with no lights, a shaded window and only light from the tv and what could shine thru the blinds. It was Ok, BUT then there's this photo editing app that comes with the phone! It's not Lightroom or anything but... It's ok, it's very decent,AND WILL BE USED. Flash? Sorry never used, I'm not a flash photographer. Sorry. The UI is in black/white, now that might not be for everyone but either you can change the UI or not get the phone. (Unless you NEED it because its Prada) It is in color. Speed? That depend on the user. I shut down every background app, and anything I'm not using, also I set everything to manual so nothing's refreshing on it own. I averaged we'll over 600mb of RAM, very very smooth interface. Oh yeah and the video is... Well in sunlight outside no complaints, any other lighting situation, maybe. Battery life? All I can say is, batteries are getting there. Now what you've been waiting for SOUND QUALITY!? Ok the speaker on the phone sucks. But of course it does! The only thing you want know is, Does it support lossless?...............well YES,YES IT DOES!", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Prada", "Author": "R.

Also, I get a lot of dropped calls, struggles to pick up reception, not sure if I got a lemon?  I also get a lot of crackling noise over the phone.  I am using t-mobile as this seems to be the network that supports it, no-one will help me because it's an unlocked international phone.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Ace \"Andres Ventura.\"", "ReviewID": "R2WNKTDWN9G6UM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really satisfied with this Android phone, it works great, touchscreen is very responsive without lag, battery life is OK, it lasts all day but not more than 30 hours without needing a charge while on all the time, don't bother buying a screen protector, it already comes with one, both cameras work great and take great pictures (for a cell phone) as for video quality it's really HD quality.The phone itself has a great look and looks much better than most phones out there, specially the over-hyped iPhone, I've gotten lots of compliments on it, the monochrome look adds to the phone's minimalistic looks which I really like.Overall it's one great phone, I'm not one of those persons who stays on Facebook/Twitter while on the phone as I do it all at home, so I pretty much needed a new change from my old Blackberry in both the looks department as well as functionality, the Android OS does the trick and the phone is nothing to be embarrassed about (unlike my old BB).", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "After one year experience", "Author": "Daniel Ngo", "ReviewID": "R2HFHVX0RH2NP2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I rate 3 stars for its designs. The phone is sleek and beautiful. The chrome buttons make it more fancy. Prada has its own theme on the phone which is very unique. Overall, this phone is beautifulLiterally, Im getting rid of it tomorrow for various reasons. First, they say you can update the system to 4.0. Sorry, you wont be able to do that if you live in the US. It runs Android version 2.3. Due to the version, when 2 or more apps running at once, the phone starts to slow down, glitching or even froze itself.Second, after using it for a while i realize whenever i use the phone when it's charging, the phone is extremely hot. Not even kidding, there is some spots get burning hot that i feel like something burning inside.Third, the rear facing camera is good with 8MP. The quality of pictures wasn't bad. The front facing camera with only 1MP and I don't complaint of picture quality either. But the color of pictures is not right. Whenever i try the front facing camera, the picture came out with too much green. For the rear facing camera, when i use flash it came out with bunch of bright effect. The photos were pale and not right.Finally, so many apps are not compatible with the system. Due to the old system, some apps like Instagram or Sanpchat keep corrupting when using.Overall, this is not a bad phone. If we could update the system, it would be a good phone to use. Otherwise, i rarely recommend it.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG P940 PRADA", "Author": "Danijela", "ReviewID": "R3BEG9JLEBEI58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Uses battery to much.

If you have AT&T;, you may have to configure the API (you will know this if you cant receive MMS or get on the internet), but its not hard to do.  Email me if you run into that problem and I will assist you.  Its not as fast as other phones I've had (however, its close and decent) but chances are if you were looking for speed, you wouldn't be looking at this phone anyway.
