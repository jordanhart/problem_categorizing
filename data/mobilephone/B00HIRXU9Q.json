However, I think this will last me longer than I thought. Although the camera is mediocre and the touch is not as responsive as I would like it to be, this  phone cannot be beat for the price! Also, it comes with a screen protector and a case! This phone has a solid construction and is probably one of the best deals for an android phone out there.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Alfredo", "ReviewID": "R3TGSC308BK2T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "is a phone with good finishes, with quality that characterizes BLU products, price / exceptional quality, is a fast phone with updates on a website, I recommend it 100%.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good...", "Author": "RYAN001", "ReviewID": "R3HOB6UTFAZ1HB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "***UPDATE 26 May 2014***  So after a few more weeks of use I am updating this review.  My wife uses this phone and she seems to be \"okay\" with it.  As a preface, she went from an iPhone to this phone.  We would have stayed with the iPhone but it was a Verizon CDMA phone so you're screwed if you want to make it a pay as you go phone.  Anyway, two comments from her - 1) scrolling on certain apps like Pinterest seems to be difficult and frustrating as the touch screen wants to activate links as you're scrolling; and 2) the camera is okay but nothing to get too excited about.  Other than those two comments the only other recommendation is use a Google browser when surfing the internet from the network.  For some reason the Android browser doesn't work.  Also, as mentioned below we went with StraightTalk (owned and operated by Tracfone) and their customer service was pretty good in trying to help resolve the internet issue, however we found the solution on our own.  Tracfone just sent us a new sim...good luck out there and still contend this is a great phone for the price point.***********We divorced ourselves of Verizon and contracts about six months ago.  Looking for a reasonably priced phone that we could register with a \"pay as you go\" service.  Also I have family members who are rough on phones so I wanted a phone that if it broke it wouldn't be $500 or more to replace it.  With all that said I opted to go this route after lots of research and what was best for our situation.Positives --1.  Phone came earlier than expected which is always nice.2.  Overall first impressions are what I expected at the price point.3.  The phone registered onto StraightTalk with no issue.  I opted for the T-Mobile compatible sim which worked flawlessly.Neutrals --1. Functionality of the phone...so far no complaints as it operates like most Android systems.2. Resolution of screen is crisp.  I am sure some people could tell the difference between other systems but this one seems compatible with the Samsung I had a few years ago.  I will update later as the phone vets more use.Negatives --1.  Note: I don't use a ton of apps but the of board memoir is small!  Yes, it has a SD slot to expand memory but this only helps for music, pictures, and videos and won't help if you're a big gamer. So consider your memory needs before purchasing.  (If you use apps like FB, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and so on then there will be plenty of memory for you.)2.  Back panel is thin plastic.  If you think Samsung series of phones are thin this one is about on par maybe a little lighter!  I highly recommend the purchase of a phone cover.  Can only find them on Ebay and they're not like an Otterbox Defender so just know you will be running some risk with survivability if someone drops this phone on concrete or asphalt.Will update in a few weeks once it gets more usage.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "notboca", "ReviewID": "R2T19BG4U615BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the phone one week ago.

I read that Blu makes these slick phones for cheaper because they don't have the huge overhead costs of major retailers like Samsung and Apple- seems true.It does everything you expect a smartphone to do and it's stylish/sleek/and quick.It's cool they give you a free case/screen covers with it too.However I just couldn't live with the 5mp camera, I was used to 8mp's and I definitely noticed the difference in quality. Note you need to setup the APN to get your MMS (picture messages on text) to work. It took me awhile to realize that. If you don't care too much about the camera, say you just wanna take profile pics (close range) and what not than this is fine.I exchanged it for another Blu phone, for $60 more the camera and everything is way better (if you dont mind the usb on top)-BLU Life Play Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Quad-Core 1.2GHz Processor, Android 4.2 JB, 4.7-inch IPS HD Display, 4G HSPA+ up to 42Mbps and 8MP Camera (", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "B.

The guy at T-Mobile asked where I got the phone and for what - he could not believe that I had a phone that looked liked the Samsung S5 for 1/6 the price. The camera quality is OK - if you want better, buy one of those fancy cameras called a DSLR. The screen resolution is not super HD - but it is really good, and any regular person would not be able to tell the difference. I'm a professional photographer and I am happy with the resolution.I was so happy with my cellphone that within 2 weeks I purchased 3 more - same one for my kids and the Studio 5 II for my wife. They love them.
