My son's die hard apple only friend traded in his iPhone for the 8x after seeing my son's phone(a shock to us all). The customization makes the iPhone boring. The music is outstanding and the feel of this phone must be experienced to appreciate.  Simply the best phone on the market and Windows Phone is a terrific and efficient operating system. Who need all those time wasting apps when everything you need is built into the operating system.  Connect your calendar with other family members and create rooms to share photos and notes. Windows phone app for the Mac works great to sync with your existing iTunes library. Not one complaint here. Your life is on one screen, no more app mining for information.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "k.wiedenkeller27", "ReviewID": "R2MH3K6V7M16GW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of wanting this phone, I searched on Amazon and found it. I LOVE this phone so much. I have tons of friends with the iPhone or an Android phone that are jealous of my phone (not only because of the awesome color). The only real downside to this phone is the app selection. I don't have Snapchat or Instagram on this phone, but I do love the way it functions and the set-up. I would definitely recommend it!", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nicely designed phone", "Author": "Li \"Amazon-Aholic\"", "ReviewID": "R3632RERNDG3VN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "From a hardware stand point, this phone rocks, beautiful display, slim, sexy and vibrant design.  Long battery life.From OS design stand point, WP8 features beautiful interface, logical design, awesome touch keyboard.The only thing that this beautiful device lacks is App support.  There is not much naively supported apps from major players, a few examples: facebook/yelp/instagram to name a few.  Functions in these apps are extremely limited compared to android or iOS powered devices.I bought it to use globally when I travel outside of the states, and it should serve the purpose well.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my H.T.C phone!", "Author": "Martha", "ReviewID": "RNQFCO6WSNJZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank-you, Amazon.com ! I looked everywhere for this phone, even A.T.&T.; stores, and A.T.&T; customer service when I upgraded. I could get the phone, but only in California Blue. It was a pretty color, but, what can i say, i wanted the lime light color! No one had it,I could not find it.  My customer rep told us we may find screen protectors and covers @ Amazon.com. while looking for those items, my dream phone popped up! It was .99 cents. I ordered it, of course. My first purchase on Amazon. I am 100% satisfied! I would recommend it to everyone. My phone is awesome..no issues @ all, and Amazon.com is also awesome, no issues @ all. I will use them again.

Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, upto 16 GB internal flash (this model has 8 GB), 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far I love this phone", "Author": "DSJ12", "ReviewID": "R1KP8HXVIAN3AY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I switched from an Iphone to the 8X because I loved the way the tiles looked. I've had the phone now for 2 months and I still love it. It's so easy to customize and looks WAY nicer than my Iphone did. The screen is larger- but not so much that it feels more like a tablet than a phone. It's easy to access all my emails accounts (except gmail- I still have not worked around that)and I have no trouble accessing Facebook (as other reviewers have mentioned). It was super easy to convert my Itunes file over to windows player to transfer all my music to my phone. The camera pics look great too. Yes, there is the downside of less available apps, but most of mine did carry over.
