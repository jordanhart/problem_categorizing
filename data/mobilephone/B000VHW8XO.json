{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great Pay as you go phone", "Author": "Bob Whitley \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R30QJWRITT5FZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used quite a few Pre-Paid phones before and i have to say that the i855 is the best for the price.This phone doesn't play Mp3's and it can't record or playback videos but it does take pictures.The i855 isn't jam packed with all the entertainment features of the more expensive phones but what it does,it does very well.The i855 has nation wide Boost Walkie Talkie which allows you to talk to any Boost Mobile or Nextel customers for only $1.00 a day.There is a web browser that loads pages pretty quickly and lets you view most mobile web content without any problems.This phones web browser is a bit better than earlier Boost Mobile phones.It also has Multimedia messaging which means you can send & receive Picture,Text and voice messages.This phone is Java enabled which lets you play the latest 3D games and use applications like Gps navigation.The call quality is very good and the external speaker is clear and loud so you can hear it even in a noisy area.The screen is a bit larger than older Boost Mobile phones and it's very bright,clear and colorful which makes it great for playing games.It has a clamshell desighn and also has an external blue LED display that lets you see who is calling before you answer it.There is a \"Smart button\" on the top of the phone that lets you connect to the last person you talked to quickly which works very well with the Walkie Talkie function.You don't even need to open the phone to use the Walkie Talkie,just press the \"Smart Button\" and you will see the persons name on the external display,then press the PTT button and you are instantly connected.Just talk into the external mic while holding the PTT button and you don't even need to open the phone!Very nice feature.I like the i855 very much but i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason.When i first got the phone i noticed that all the Java apps didn't work at all.Even the Java download apps didn't work which meant i couldn't even download games or other applications over the air.I had to buy a USB cable,hook the phone up to my PC and re-install the Java download app.You can find this iDEN Download Apps Utility on the Motorola Website.I must say that if you are using Windows Vista you will need to run this app in Windows XP Service Pack 2 mode to get it to recognise your i855.Otherwise you will get an error message.After fixing the Java issue i couldn't be happier with this phone.If you are looking for a well made pay as you go cell phone that doesn't cost a ton of cash,get the Boost Mobile i855.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "good phone for the buyer who is not picky", "Author": "Joseph R.

Since the phone and service are both necessary to make this product functional I believe it is appropriate if I write a blanket review for every Nextel phone listed on Amazon.  After all, these reviews are meant to help the consumer make an informed purchase and this review will serve in that role.I had problems with my Nextel service almost from the beginning of my 2 year contract.  I would experience repeated dropped calls in my apartment.  Since I had no landline the use of my cell in my apartment was very essential to me.  Repeated calls to Sprint/Nextel failed to resolve the problem.  They would either tell me they would look into the problem or that there was sufficient coverage in my area.I pointed out that if there was sufficient coverage for my area that I would not be experiencing dropped calls so frequently.  Apparently my logic was lost on them.  They then told me that concrete building would interfere in the signal.  I informed them that my apartment was a wood structure and actually had quite good clearance from the sky.  I also asked why the Sprint/Nextel signal was experiencing so much trouble but my work cell (Verizon) seemed to work fine.  I have since switched carriers and as of yet have not experienced one dropped call.I eventually felt compelled to buy out my contract at $200 after one year.  I sent complaints to my State Attorney General as well as the Better Business Bureau.  Sprint/Nextel responded to both of these complaints with the standard line they had given me about adequate coverage for the area.My intent on filing these complaints was to compel Sprint/Nextel to make good on their failure to live up with their end of the agreement i.e. providing coverage to my cell.  They have decided that $200 is worth more than a reputation of standing behind their service.It is my opinion that Sprint/Nextel is the worst company I have had the misfortune of doing business with in at least the past 5 years.  In fact, never has a business in my experience done so little to try to make things right with a customer.I would encourage anyone considering doing business with Sprint/Nextel to talk with people they know in their area that has used the service.  Had I done so when I was initially looking into cell phones I would have steered far away from Sprint/Nextel.  Perhaps other people have had better experiences in other areas.Sprint/Nextel you had a chance to make right.  I am guessing that if just one or two people are persuaded by my reviews then it will cost you well in excess of $200.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "A fantastic pay-as-you-go phone!", "Author": "Richard George \"texas lone star\"", "ReviewID": "R1O4VPZGEJ667S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding features available with Boost Mobile Service and the Motorola i855e include:Nationwide Boost walkie-talkieMulti-media messaging and text messagingWireless webColor screenDigital zoom cameraJava enabled games and appllicationsHands-free speakerphone with voice-activated dialingGPS enabledReal music ringtones600 entry phonebookYou can get immediate access to Boost or Nextel subscribers at the push of a button with unlimited nationwide Boost Walkie-Talkie, for a low pay-as-you-go daily fee.An all-around versatile and in-demand phone!", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "blocked phone", "Author": "E.
