To my surprise, when I received the BlackBerry it was as the seller stated. It was a New cell phone and packaged just like out of the factory line! I was worried though since I had read that it does not have Spanish language capability. Fortunately, it gave an option on what language I wanted it in on start-up and Spanish was one of the options (Since this phone is a gift for someone in the Dominican Republic). It's working just as it was built to do and works brilliantly in the Dominican Republic.
