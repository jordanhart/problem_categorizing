After ordering it on Amazon from Victor International, it arrived in a few days (which was an extremely pleasant suprise)I put in my prepaid T-Mobile SIM card and the phone worked instantly (which was another pleasant suprise).It does everything I had hoped for, which is:  Make calls, while not having to carry a phone in my pocket or belt.A little background on why I bought this phone:I love technology, but never got into the whole carrying a phone thing, especially now-a-days with phones like the iPhone (with are pretty big if you think about it).  If I wanted to surf the web, I could do it at home on my Ipad or Laptop.  I had never felt the desire to pay $50+ a month for a internet plan or $50+ for a cell phone plan (which could add up to over $1000 a year).  For the last few years, I have been using a T-mobile prepaid plan, and last year only paid $5 for my prepaid plan (so I could keep my minutes).  But...because I hate carrying a phone, my wife would get upset with me because she could never reach me, and there were times I had wished I had a phone handy to make a quick call.  So, I decided to surf the web (from my laptop) to see if there was a wrist cell phone.  I looked all over, and felt this was the phone that best suited me.  One of the major reasons I bought this one instead of other wrist phones was that it had buttons for dialing (not just touchscreen).  I didn't want to pull out a stylus everytime I wanted to make a call.  To be honest, I also love the movie Avatar, and figured James Cameron wouldn't lend his movie's name to just any watch.Calling is easy, but it took a day or so to figure out how to navigate quickly, upload my ringtone MP3's (from a micro SD card) and enter my phone numbers.  The touchscreen works, but I prefer using buttons to navigate.  I still haven't tried out the MP3 player, and I plan on testing out the Bluetooth when I have time.In closing, I finally feel I have a phone that is cool and practical.  I feel like I'm on Star Trek, when I make calls now.  You should see the reactions I get from people (from high schoolers to grandparents).  They are amazed that it works so well.  They also comment on how much more sense it is to have a phone readily available, rather than digging into their pocket to answer a call.Gotta go, my wife is calling :)", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cool Gadget", "Author": "Alysia Hillyard", "ReviewID": "R75B9L1KYF1YH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you like gadgets its super cool.If you are looking for an actual cellphone with smartphone quality this is not for you.The sound quality on this cellphone watch is better than some others like the ultraslim gsm gd910.It is more user friendly than some others as well.If you have larger fingers this is one of the better cellphone watchs out there as the buttons are larger.Battery life surprised me on this one, I've been using the same battery for the last 2 days and have not had to charge it yet.Really need to save your contacts to your sim card before switching over to this watch as saving contacts can be tedious.Wrist band is soft/flexible which is nice in comparison to other watches of this type. I have a very small wrist and this band had notches that fit to size and the face was not too large for me.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic gadget and conversation starter", "Author": "David Hogan \"gadget superfreak\"", "ReviewID": "R3JQXP2UY8Q93C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a MUST HAVE for all gadget and/or cell phone fanatics. I bought a more expensive model with virtually identical operating system a couple of years ago and paid almost double for just a slightly different keyboard layout.  This one is simpler looking but has all the desirable features.  Call quality is excellent, storage capacity via micro SD card exceeds specifications.  I have a 16 GB MSDHC installed with almost 1000 mp3 files and have taken several acceptable quality photos I could not have captured fast enough if I had to fish my camera phone out of a backpack or even back pocket!The cell watch attracts attention everywhere I go.  I am constantly using the phrase \"Yes, it's really a cellphone, and it keeps pretty good time, too!\"When I'm out running around in shorts and a t-shirt and i don't want to carry a phone or risk losing one, this is the ideal combination of wristwatch, mp3 player, and cell phone that I can wear to go biking, run into the grocery store, or anywhere else.  The sound quality is just what you expect from a small package, but the volume is sufficent to make calls and listen to music without a headset if you need to.I have called friends and family out of state and had them report no difference in sound quality even when using the speakerphone, though I more commonly use a Bluetooth when I plan on making calls in advance.  Pairing is simple and there are multiple profiles to store preferences for indoor, outdoor, meeting room, and Bluetooth profiles so you can customize the volume and ringtone specifications in advance for quick changes.  When I walk into a meeting, a couple of key presses makes sure I will get vibrate only and no key tones, outdoors I get loudest possible ring and simultaneous vibration.  Great features I don't have on my $300 smartphone.At about $80, this is cheaper than some standard candybar or flip style phones with more and better features, and it fits comfortably on your wrist.  I usually charge mine every day, but I have left it on for three days at a time on more than one occasion and I've never run the battery all the way down. It comes with a spare battery that I keep charged and in the car, but I've never needed it.Virtually no way to improve on this with current technology available in the states, but I expect these will continue to get a little smaller, as they have been for a few years now.  Terrific product!!Only way to make me any happier would be for Amazon to offer replacement chargers and earbuds, but reasonable people expect the \"starter kit\" packaging with import goods.  As more people switch over to cell pone wristwatches, the marketplace will demand that sellers make more accessories available.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok product", "Author": "Susan Anne Wulff", "ReviewID": "R1K3B05NHNTYVU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty cool thing. If you show it to your friends, they will imidiatley be impressed and want one. If you really like techy things, this is definitely not the product for you. I used att service, and this watch only worked outside with no trees around. And, unless you  live in china, you cant use it's Internet services. And there's no wifi integration, so you can't use the watch that way. The watch was pretty cool, until the band of it started breaking. It is a very rubbery and soft band, so it rips easily. There's also only one game. Don't get this unless you like really simple things from china that only work for a couple months.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "a nice smart watch", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3TZ6HLRYX9OLZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There seems to be a lot of functions on the watch. But the manual is vague at best.If your going to put in only name and # for the phone, I recommend you put it to the sim card. Twice now, we lost data that was saved to the watch, not sure why. It is supposed to have voice command capability, but could not get it to recognize any command.if you turn on voice for phone numbers to be audible, it only speaks in Chinese, no matter what language is selected.The plus side, calls a crisp and clear on the receiving end, and the speaker option to the watch is hard to hear. The MP 3 player is good with the included ear buds(only way mp3's can be played). The stylus is neatly tucked in the band, and does not slip out.The watch will accept a 16GB micro SD card. it keeps time well and can choose time as a screen saver, and then just tap the screen for it to display. I actually bought this for my Wife, so she could have an easily accessible Phone that was easy to use and out of the way. and can be used quickly in an emergency. The battery life is good, and it comes with a spare battery. It is a good price when you consider you get blue tooth ear phone and charging cable, ear buds, two batteries, charging unit for phone and blue tooth( can only charge one at a time.)", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Nice Toy, But Battery Life Is Bad", "Author": "Patrick Taylor", "ReviewID": "R30WD04TKPOQ9Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone, which is also known as the Avatar ET-1, is probably the most popular watch-phone I've seen. The price is attractive, but sometimes, you get what you pay for. I've been using mine for about a week, so far, and what I've found is, even after a week's worth of complete charge cycles, the battery life is still very short. A full charge will get me about 20 hours of standby before the phone shuts down. (with very little warning)If you decide to have a voice conversation for say, half an hour or so, the you had better consider charging it again, or else risk shut down within 2 hours or so. Makes me wonder, does this thing run on vacuum tubes or something? Nah, then the sound would be nicer.The interface is a bit primitive. Looks like what the Soviet lander in the movie \"Red Planet\" was displaying on its screen during the hilarious repair scene in that film. Sadly, from what I've seen on the net, all the other watch-phones currently available seem to have the same interface. This makes me suspect that they are all coming out of the same factory. This kind of makes the prospect of an upgrade to a better watch somewhat bleak.The touch-screen part of it is very tough to activate, but that is actually a good thing. I was worried about accidentally dialing while it rubbed against the inner sleeve of my leather jacket, but no problems at all. It takes a firm press with your fingernail, or the included stylus, to activate it.The keypad works well enough, but it is really, really tiny, so I wouldn't want to try to use it in say, -30C weather or anything like that. I sometimes find the touch screen easier to use than the keypad. (and I hate touch screens)Mine didn't come with a camera or compass or anything like that. Some of the Avatar ET series do. I haven't used the mp3 player or video player or FM radio, but I'm sure they work fine. (while, probably doing a rapid-drain on the battery)I hate carrying bulky smartphones and things like that, plus I would often find myself forgetting my cellphone. I thought, \"Hey! A wristwatch-cellphone. Great idea!\" Sadly, this phone hasn't worked out to behave as a proper full-time cellphone should be expected to. I even switched carriers so that I could use this thing. (my previous carrier was an AWS network. This thing is GSM only) Too bad. I was really looking forward to the convenience of a wristwatch-phone. So, for now, I will continue to use this thing, as I'm kind of committed to my new carrier now. (spent too much $$ lately) If anybody out there knows of a watch-phone with better battery life, I would love to hear about it. It would also be nice to find a watch-phone that actually works on AWS networks.---------------------------------------------------An update after 2 weeks use: I've found that you can extend talk time by using the USB plug-in headset that comes with the phone. Even though it looks and feels awkward, this actually seems to use less power than using the phone's built-in speaker and mic. Using the headset the other day, I was able to have an hour-long conversation while grocery shopping, and still had plenty of power left until being able to get home to recharge. I'd consider using bluetooth with it, if not for the already poor battery life.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Same product, two different phones... wouldn't recognize microSD card.", "Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "R2O3ZH0XG3DKML", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have ordered this phone twice, and am in the process of making the second return.

Every time you want to write a text message you must scroll thru like 10-15 input modes to get to English ABC, it won't keep your setting. For me, input with keypad is easiest. Handwriting mode is frustating, because you must write each letter so it understands it correctly, and for me it's rare that it does. You must enter the number text is going to, manually , unless you are replying to an incoming message. There is no recent or other menu, so if you do not know the number by heart, write it down before you start to text. Making and taking calls is easy. Bluetooth is best, due to speaker volume and position on watch. It's akin to trying to put your elbow in your ear. It does have voice dialing. It gets the person I'm trying to dial correct maybe 10% of the time. Again, it may just be me it is having trouble understanding. I have no accent, born and raised in SF Bay area. I must install sim card every time I use it, as I only have 1. each time i do, it has the correct date, but never the right time. Setting the time is a pain too. I just make a mental note of how far off it is and calculate approx time. It works fine for what I got it to do... place/receive calls/texts without holding a phone, while I shop!!

It's a fascinating watch that is a great \"showpiece\" in public venues...I've sent the amazon link to many inquiring minds that want a wristwatch! Callers can hear me pretty well, though I sometimes strain to hear their responses in public venues.Not so good news: The phone won't connect to my bluetooth earpiece which would improve my ability to hear folks on the phone without holding my wrist to my ear. Occasionally I get feedback (reverb?) in the background.  I also have issues connecting to the internet (uses WAP). Less than a month after purchase, my earbud isn't connecting properly; so, I can no longer utilize the FM radio (ear piece must be connected) and replacement parts aren't available on Amazon.

I get more positive feedback than negative, but the negative ones are from unfriendly,unliked people(;. It's going to become a trend, no doubt, you'll see. Since my old phone died of old age, this is what I use. I also pair it up with a Bluetooth in case people start looking at me weird and start creeping me out.Outwear/Looks [exactly like picture shown]:It's a little big, so I just turn it facing my body.It's rubber and even though and not scratch-proof.Comes with a stylus.The watch arrived Aug. 1st and so far, it has not teared. (read update for damage)Has a port for charging and mini-SD cardThe sim card slot started causing problems after a month in, so I took some receipts/paper and folded it between my battery and the cover, snug tight, and all is well.Touchscreen/SoftwareTouchscreen is not scratch resistant, so that's too bad. You can use about anything to touch, but be careful. I got pen marks all over mine.It's a little hard to press with your fingers unless you have nails like a girl or use a stylus (or pencil)It's like most touchscreens, not oilproofYou can change the brightness (to save battery or whatnot, which btw, will make it hard to see in the sunlight)I would give it 4 stars since it's a new thing/idea/innovative (3 if it wasn't innovative), but it's also dirt cheap compared to the upcoming ones (don't ask me how I know), so I gave it 5 instead.FYI, I likey.*******Update 11/28/13Damage: The band broke a month or 2 ago because the connection with the watch is weak. I superglue'd it back, but it's not something I should have to deal with.USAGE: It has a calculator, FM radio (plug in the headset that it comes with), HORRIBLE camera, bluetooth capability, and anything else you would want in a phone (besides the apps and stuff like that).The box includes:charger usbusb to outlet converter (the best I have ever seen in my life).
