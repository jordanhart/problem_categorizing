Easy to use, and it has phenomenal battery life. I can typically go about 2 or 3 days without having to charge it. I previously had this phone in blue, but I like the berry color so much better. Not only that, it arrived from this seller before even the earliest estimated date. When this phone eventually dies (which I doubt will be anytime soon), I'll definitely get it again, specifically from this seller.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005KL6QPW"}}
