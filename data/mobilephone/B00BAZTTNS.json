After a month of suffering, I threw in the towel and bought the LG Spirit; and so far love it. I believe that it is worth the extra money over the cost of the lesser offerings from Metro. Everything works as you would expect that it should.  The one thing that it lacks that the Avid had is a little light that flashes to notify you that you missed a call or other event.  A small app from the Google Play Store called NoLED adds a little light to the screen that solved the problem.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have Spirit", "Author": "Kris Lynn", "ReviewID": "R3R90ILHDMNEVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went from an LG Motion to an LG Spirit a couple of days ago, and I have to say.\"I love it \". I absolutely fell in love with the Motion but thought the screen needed to be a little bigger for all it does for the media. Upon use, I literally couldn't put it down. I just wanted a phone to play games and watch movies on, with maybe a few calls every now and then. Now I can watch Netflix and play Angry Birds all I want. So naturally, when I found out The new LG Spirit was almost exactly like the Motion with the bigger screen I wanted, I knew that I would have to have it. It does so much more than the LG Motion though. Not only is it a bigger phone, but it also has a video editor. The Lg Spirit has exceeded my expectations, and has become the last cell phone I'll ever own. Thanks to LG for making such, Metro PCS for providing the service, and amazon.com for lower prices. AMAZING!!!", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrading from the LG Motion to the LG Spirit", "Author": "P. Peters", "ReviewID": "RRM2GM1CMEL55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As mentioned, they are basically the same devices but the Spirit has a larger screen with better screen res and I believe the USB port is on the bottom of the phone instead of on the side, plus a few other enhancements.While the specs list this the CPU @ 1.2GHz, Quadrant Benchmark testing shows it to be 1.5GHz.The LG Motion is a great phone and I'm sure I will love the LG Spirit even more with the bigger, better screen.My only wish is that LG would have used an 8MP camera instead of the 5 MP camera, but it takes great HD vids, especially outdoors. Same with pics.Pictures tend to look a bit off in color when viewed on the phone, but once transferred to your PC, the color balance looks better.I like the Motion better than my old iPhone 4S and I'm no longer handcuffed to an expensive 2-year contract, plus I can sell the phone anytime I want since I own it and not the carrier.I will use the $70.00 rebate and will also sell my lightly used LG Motion which will almost pay for the upgrade from the Motion to the Spirit.I'm also saving $40.00 a month by dropping my contract carrier and going with Metro PCS and I'm also getting better service and faster 4G, about 7.5 MBPS D/L, depending on my location.Since I have WiFi at home and at work, I don't use much Data so I can go with the least expensive 4G plan from Metro and if you go over your monthly data allotment, they don't charge you extra - they just throttle your data speed down until the 1st of the month.Either way, I'm saving about $500.00 a year, not to mention the cost of the phone, which I can always sell if I want to upgrade.Win/win.Props to LG and Metro PCSUpdate: After using this phone for the last several months, I love it even more!I've also added a 32 Micro SD card for more music storage and for more video storage capabilities. I also received the $70.00 rebate that was being offered at the time, so my cost for this phone was a little under $200.00 after shipping and Kalifornia taxes. This phone rivals the Sammy S-3 in functionality and in Benchmark testing as well at half the price.This is the best \"bang for the buck\" smartphone on the market. I blows away my old iPhone 4S which I have since sold, along with my LG Motion which I bought before the Spirit came on the market.I haven't had a single problem with this phone and like the fact that the battery is easy and inexpensive to replace if needed and storage can be upgraded via a Micro SD card. One other thing: \"Rooting\" the phone is easy and gives the user much more control over the O/S. It also allows you to disable/uninstall much of the LG/Metro \"Bloatware\" which makes the phone even faster and smoother.I absolutely love this phone - the screen is just the right size as a bigger screen/phone would not fit well in my front pocket.It is also lighter than the LG Motion.Everyone that sees it wants one and several of my friends and co-workers have purchased one after they were \"released\" from their existing contracts with other carriers.Some products overpromise and underdeliver. Not this one. It lives up to the praise and then some, all at a moderate price and performance wise, rivals phones costing 2x as much.I was going to buy a S-3 when the S-4 came out in anticipation of the cost of the phone being more reasonable, but bought the Spirit while the $70.00 rebate was offered and I'm glad I did as I like the Spirit better than the S-3The only real negative is the camera - it does great outdoors in natural light, but can be a bit grainy indoors.For the $200.00 savings, I can live with a 5MP camera vs. and 8MP camera, and if I want to take good pics, I have a 16MP Nikon Coolpix camera that cost me $100.00 for a refurbished model and it takes fantastic pics.Either way, you can't go wrong with this phone and I can't recommend it highly enough.Good luck and enjoy.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Impressed!!!!  LG Spirit Rocks!!!!!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3F6Y77R26TCQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased a pair of these phones a week ago and I cannot stop smiling.  I was the owner of the LG Connect (Metro PCS).  When I saw that the LG Spirit was out and offered a newer version of the Android OS along with a bigger and better battery, and oh yeah, the bigger screen as well..............I knew I had to have it.  The battery life on the LG Connect was horrible, so bad that one could not leave home without a charger of some sort in their pocket.  Yeah, that bad.  This phone is really an upgrade, in every way, top to bottom.  I have thrown everything I can at it thusfar and it keeps asking for more.  I love the ability to truly customize many of the features with \"Ice Cream\", or Android 4.0.  Battery life is amazing, screen is very bright and vibrant, phone is extremely light given it's larger size, and from what I can tell so far this puppy is a \"Winner\".  The one thing I will mention that did set me back at first was that this phone/OS did not come with a Flash Player integrated like my older LG Connect.  A quick search of the net and this can be fixed with very little effort.  Flash is running and I'm anxious to see what more this thing can do!  Amazon was also extremely fast in getting the phone(s) to us.  Purchased two total and recieved in roughly 2 days.  Way to go Amazon!!!!!  Don't wait, don't overthink getting this phone.  I'm sure that you'll be just as impressed as I am.........  LG came through on this one..........", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No 4G out of the box but fixed quickly by Metropcs...", "Author": "Pilot68", "ReviewID": "R14PR8YPZ1WHK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased from another online site that specializes in mobile phones for $229 with free shipping and a $70 mail-in rebate from MetroPCS.  (AFAIK any new LG Spirit should be eligible for the rebate)I had an Esteem which I sold for $175 on CL.  So after rebate, I actually netted $16 in my pocket by upgrading to this phone!  Imagine that - making money by upgrading your phone!When the Spirit arrived, I tried to activate it with *228 but it would not so I called the 888 number. They did get the phone activated, but after a few minutes I noticed it was showing 1X and EV, but never 4G as my Esteem did in the same locations.  I went into a Metro store the next day and was told the Spirit was \"too new\" for them to be able to help me, but they gave me a # to call \"Specialized Support\" or something along those lines.  When I called, to my amazement, I was speaking to a real-live person within about 60 seconds!  The very knowledgeable CS rep said that the phone's MEID had not registered as a 4g phone, so something within the system on his side would need to be done.  Five minutes later, I had 4G working on the Spirit. Hats off to excellent customer service from Metropcs.The phone itself is so buttery-smooth and lag free! Its just a joy to use and really puts the Esteem to shame. I'm getting almost a day and a half of battery life - very impressive.The only knock on the Spirit is no HDMI-out.  I tried the DLNA Smart Share program that comes with the phone, but the lag and buffering while viewing phone videos on the big screen tv were unacceptable. Oddly, I could stream video from my PC to the phone with no problems whatsoever.If there was an option for 4.5 stars, that's what I would give, mainly due to the lack of HDMI-out and a very pedestrian camera.

It's screen size isn't so large (like the Galaxy S III or 4) that you feel like you're carrying around an iPad mini. It's fast, has dual processors, and supports 4G LTE. It has a lot of other features, including adding an internal mini SD Card up to 32 GB.The phone does come with a sim card. Once you get it from Amazon and activate it, you HAVE to bring it to a MetroPCS store to get the 4G sim chip put in. If you don't do that, you'll never get 4G LTE speeds. They basically swap out the sim chip it comes with and put in their own one and activate it with your number. And yes, you can port your landline number to this phone or another cell phone number.People ask me how I got a landline number for my cell phone and I tell them I simply ported it. Because of FCC regulations, they are required by law to port your number whether landline or cell based.Read the specs and compare it to other phones. It won't replace your digital camera, but it won't break the bank either. The online MetroPCS store no longer has them for sale so I'm assuming they are out of stock on them. It's a very sturdy camera with that new gorilla glass for a screen. You can sync it to Windows or Mac (with the proper software), use it as an MP3 player with headphones, watch movies, and more.For about $200 this phone is worth every penny. I see people thumb typing on their iPhones and tsk tsk that they can't swipe 'n' type as Apple locks out all third-party technology that affects \"core\" technology, e.g., the keyboard. I was able to replace the LG onscreen keyboard with a Swype keyboard and now I can type (swipe) as fast as I type on a regular keyboard.And that is why I prefer an Android phone over an iPhone: It lets me customize it to my tastes, and not the other way around. FYI: I saw the preview of IOS 7 and for a change Apple \"borrowed\" a lot of ideas from the 'droid phone.

I decided to go for a cheaper (almost just as good) model the LG Spirit :)This phone is a beast, a savage I have a '06 Toshiba Satellite laptop and this phone would easily kick it's ass in any hardware aspect.Love the OS, the games look just AMAZING - though bear in mind my last cellphone gaming session was on a BB Curve 8530 so it's a big switch for me.The 4.5\" IPS display is gorgeous and the camera is recording in 1080p (the face camera does 720p), 4G LTE connectivity is wonderful the download speed is fire and with 802.11g/n WIFI this thing downloads with almost the same speed my Asus G75VX with 802.11ac antenna does - unbelievable !!!Some games literally have PS3/XBOX360 quality graphics !!!The phone is capable of taking voice commands and does it with precision, I'm yet to have it misunderstand what I dictated - all you do is press a speaker icon on the display.I seem to be going round and round with this review, I know;Let me get straight to the good and the bad if any :DPros:1.2GHz dual-core CPU;1GB RAM DDR2 (monster);4.5\" 960x540 screen - flips 180*;720p face camera + 5MP 1080p rear camera with 1080p recording;Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich;4.3GB of internal storage space;speed;ease of use;intuitive OS/UI;battery life (so far so good);there's more I'm just tired today and gotta wrap-up;Cons:the process of adding files to SD card;Google keyboard glitches;I think it's one of the best phones MetroPCS has to offer right now, especially when you take in account the price it goes for, gross bill was only $308+change and what this baby is capable of doing and the speed it DOES it with.

It TRULY is comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S3 at least concerning its performance( simply the camera is lower grade at 5mp but is nonetheless a worthy camera, LOVE the feature of saying cheese, whiskey, kimchee,LG, etc. to take pictures, a unique feature of LG). It is FAST and actually clocks in at 1.5ghz, making the 1.2ghz label irrelevant. It is NOT about the processor speed, so much as it is the QUALITY of the processor, and the Spirit is packing a nice dual core SNAP DRAGON. Dungeon Hunter 4 runs BEAUTIFULLY(takes nearly a gig of memory too!). Many people are under the impression that this particular phone will not store apps to the sd, it is not the phone, but the ICS 4.0 and beyond android software that does this, particularly to improve the performance of many applications that suffer from bugging and crashing, much of this is prevented with on board memory, and this phone, unlike many other value priced phones, it has 4.3 gb of internal storage, the sd holds up to 32gb of pictures video and music(make sure to get a class ten or above sd card). The display is clear and has much depth to it. The price was amazing, the store sells this phone for $269 + tax, which roughly comes out to $286, plus a case, puts you at over $300, by purchasing it through amazon (prime) I was able to spend $235, and that included a nicely reviewed, kickstand armored case. This is a FANTASTIC phone. I have loved and trusted Lg for quite some time now ( I own a 10,000btu a/c and 40in 1080 by LG) and am yet ::knock on wood:: to be dissatisfied. Thanks Amazon! Thanks LG!***update*** I have had the phone about three months now,it has suffered only a minor nick at the bottom of the screen, but so far so good. No 4.1 yet, but not necessary at this point.

Their current Lg phones have half the memory of this one, and are not nearly as sleek or smooth in performance. They come with 4.1, but will run out of memory quickly which is NECESSARY to have multiple apps, as most can no longer be saved to sd. I would get this phone before it is no longer available. For an extra $60/year, insurance is a good thing to have for it, even two years of ins., puts you at half the cost of the phone. With a steady hand and practice, the camera works quite well. The Spirit has been good to me...", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone", "Author": "MOVENSHAKE", "ReviewID": "R3MVJZ9JIF8UC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very satisfied- here's why-Battery Life- Good-FAST PROCESSING Power-Good call quality- this is my only phone.-Smooth games/app-Camera is fast and smooth.

However, since the phone connects to my home Wifi network I can browse the Internet even faster on this phone than with 4G, use Skype for calls (I use Skype for over 90% of my calls at home) or use the Metro PCS Joyn service for calls and texts through my home Wifi. Since Metro PCS offers Joyn, which eliminates the reception problem in my block home, I feel fine giving this phone 5 stars.

I'd have to restart my phone and it would eat my battery life when it did that. If I had 90% of battery all of a sudden after that I would have 50% of battery. And it could have only been stuck like that for 2-5 minutes.Just a couple weeks ago I have started to experience over heating for the phone where it gets really hot and I experience the same freezing problem. Now that it's hot out I'm experiencing over heating.I don't get these problems everyday, these problems seem to come when I hang out with one of my friends.
