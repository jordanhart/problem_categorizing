{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia Miro", "Author": "damien-tt", "ReviewID": "R3K57YOFXJYS56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Intro: Having passed through a few reasonably priced, decently powered Xperia handsets (my last was a Xperia Mini) I am now on to my latest, the Sony Xperia Miro ST23a. This purchase was influenced by a couple of factors such as the availability of handsets at the time, the features (I missed the front camera in my old Xperia Mini Pro) and a simple design. I tend to stick to mid-range Android handsets because technology changes everyday and it makes no sense buying expensive, high end devices when the next best thing is right around the corner. However, this is subject to debate because we'll agree that everyone has different needs and tastes where mobile handsets are concerned.Features: I'll just highlight a few of the main features below since the full specifications can be found by searching for the Sony Xperia Miro at cc[...]:- Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich Operating System (latest handset build is 11.0.A.5.5 which seems to speed up functionality and add the SMS counter)- Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support as well as dual-band UMTS support- 3.5\" 320 x 480 pixel touch-screen with HVGA resolution- 800MHz Cortex-A5 Processor- 5MP rear camera with auto-focus and LED flash- VGA front camera for Googletalk, Oovoo and Skype calls- MicroSD card slot (internal) with support for up to a 32GB card- 4GB internal memory and 512MB RAM- Wi-Fi b/g/n, Wi-Fi hot-spot support- Stereo FM radio and much moreOpinion: The Sony Xperia Miro satisfies my needs for a smartphone at the moment, however I haven't fully explored its capabilities or features as yet. The camera quality is crisp and clear when taking pictures and the interface is far smoother than the update I performed on my previous Xperia Mini Pro and Xperia Mini handsets. It is a reasonably priced handset (I got mines at the time for US$202.26) which provides the standard features you'll come to expect from a Sony Xperia handset. I did not receive a headset with my purchase but I was able to source one via Amazon. For others who may need to purchase a headset, please be advised that you cannot use previous Sony Ericsson headsets with the newer Sony Xperia handsets. According to a post by another user (see the customer review here[...] ) older Sony Ericsson Xperia headsets use the OMTP standard which is not compatible with newer Sony Xperia handsets.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Affordable and Dependable", "Author": "music-freak", "ReviewID": "R2FP3675KAFPDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My original T-Mobile phone was supposed to be everything that this phone was, only it wasn't. For the same price I got an Android 2.3 Gingerbread with an Amoled touch screen, though it was pretty to look at the phone could not update and it caused me major grief when the SD card slot died and the phone slowed down after only a couple months of owning it.  Instead of buying out of contract and adding more pain to my wallet I looked to Amazon, I had heard that Sony was starting to make amazing smartphones and found that an Android 4.0 ICS was available - I read many reviews against this and other Xperia types; there are more expensive ones out there that only run 2.3 - I wondered how and why this was, as this phone is a good deal $200.00 less than those.  After thinking really hard, I bought it - two days later I was able to play with it, though the screen is not an Amoled and doesn't look the greatest - I got used to it in a matter of hours, this phone is seriously fast when you want an app open it doesn't fumble the screen around flickering trying to operate - it just opens quickly and smoothly.  It has built in Walkman technology only the best of what you would imagine from Sony with level adjustments and equalizers built in with no added app or cost to get it, unlike my old phone where I had to buy a $2.00 app to get the same basic functionality.  The downside is Sony's Timescape which has not had an update in months so getting the live Social Media Updates right from the homescreen gives an error, from the looks of it, even the new Sony Xperia series still have this problem and Sony may never fix it, but I took it off the homescreen and that took care of that.  It has a changing color theme light which is very cool and changes from blue for facebook or text message updates or red if you get google updates and it looks extremely sleek and futuristic which is everything I have wanted in a phone.  It's the greatest purchase I have have ever made for myself on such a small device.The camera is a true 5.0mp camera and takes very clean photos and it takes them quickly, the video is a bit different - the quality is brought down quite a bit. The microphone on this is the clearest I've heard on a mid level phone as well as the speaker on the back - Sony knows sound and they do it really well.The phone is very lightweight, to the point that I thought that there was nothing inside of it at first.After using it for a couple weeks it's showing me there is something in there and it's doing a fantastic job.Sony used to leave a very bitter taste in my mouth - from TV's catching on fire, to sparking Vaio batteries...  I used to be an Apple only kind of person, but my family introduced me to Android and Google - which I thought was best with Samsung, I no longer feel that way.  I feel Sony has started to become an electronics giant again and I am excited to see what they will bring in the future.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Android... So far so good. Now the screen will not turn on", "Author": "R. Henry", "ReviewID": "R3R8N6CZWSRZWY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, as a long time die hard Nokia fan (Currently own a Nokia N8)I was looking for a pone that would me to experience Android but did not want an expensive (flagship) pone but neither wanted a Low end one. This pone fits that description. I have used a Galaxy Ace and found it lacking some stuff I really wanted (Front facing camera, decent rear camera and onboard storage)and I realized then that I don't like TouchWiz UI so Samsung is out of the question.This pone feels very good in the hand, has the right size as most pones nowadays are over 4 inches in size, and to me that's just too big (even though I have big hands)The downside for me is that the accessories are way too expensive for this pone and it does not came with a screen protector or a headset.I am still stumbling on some of it's features and on Android as a whole, as I am just learning the howto's of Android.I am still looking for a substitute to my two years old N8, but untill I can find a pone with the same or better battery life (3 days with wifi on 24 hours) and a better camera, and a matching signal coverage and call quality, the N8 is staying with me.Overall I am lovind thei pone so far, it just scared me a bit one time when, after playing with the settings, the screen would not turn on when the charger was unplugged, I could hear the pone unlocking click but could not see nothing on the screen. After re-connecting the charger, the screen came back on, so I increased the screen brightness a bit and the issue went away (same thing happenned to me once with an Asus netbook).Nice Little pone, really recommended for anyone who does not want a high end android but a good mid range one. Ohh, and it comes with ICS out of the box (unlike the Galaxy Ace, and I do't think it will ever be updated to ICS)***UPDATE Jan 16 2013***Minus 2 starts as the phone is now going to a repair shop.It has developped a really annoying \"feature\" where if the phone is charged using the supplied charger, it would get hot and after the screen turns off it will not come back on after the charge is completed. The phone will continue to work, as I will hear it unlock, receive calls and notifications also but I can't see a thing as the screen is completely black.It would normally \"wake up\" randomly after a couple minutes or hours and continue to work fine untill the next charge.I then avoided charging it with the supplied charger and used the computer instead as when I did so, it would not get hot and all will work fine after the charge is completed.Well, 3 days ago I charged the phone with the computer and the screen turned off, as it normally does, after the charge was completed it worked fine so I went outside. When I tried to use the phone the screen would not come back on. I can hear the phone doing the \"click\" when I unlock it, I can receive calls, but the screen is completely black.3 days now and the screen is still pitch black so the phone is going to a repair shop so they can determine what is the problem with it.As I am no longer in the US I cannot return it as the fee is very high to ship a package to the US and back, so it's going to have to go to a local repair shop.I was so happy with the phone untill this.I must have got a lemmon.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great so far", "Author": "R. Kovach \"catch9\"", "ReviewID": "RQI8Z3L0QSNI3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: T-Mobile sucks!Returning this phone. T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the \"low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home. Also, it has a removable battery - for me this is a HUGE advantage as I can buy a spare for traveling or really long days and just swap out the battery.I have used SPB Shell on the Galaxy but it slowed it down too much. Loaded on this and ran great. But the Sony interface is so nice, I switched back to that.The only two quibbles so far are the size (keyboard) and the loudness of the speaker phone (too quiet) but I use Bluetooth most of the time so not an issue.Worked out of the box - threw in SIM card and memory card and off it went.So far, so good.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wish I could keep this phone!", "Author": "A. Rabiee \"Rabi\"", "ReviewID": "R4O0FZH8XOVSC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great design Android 4.0.1 based cell phone. Compare it with a Samsung Android based phone this phone looks much better from design point of view and is much less expensive than a similar Samsung or HTC cell phone. The phone is light and the screen size is perfect if you are not looking for a large screen like Samsung Note or Galaxy S3. The feel is pretty much like iPhone 4S, except that this is much lighter. The camera picture quality is also fair. The only problem that I had with this phone is that I had wi-fi problem from time to time. The phone had difficulty to reconnect to the wi-fi connections. Searching on the web and talking to a Sony customer service, I found out that this is a common problem with a few Sony cell phones recently and no one knows how to resolve it. So in spite of the fact that I was deeply in love with this phone I had to return it back!", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "bought as a gift for my daughter.", "Author": "Berta", "ReviewID": "R3920V9YYLUUER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "She absolutely loves the phone.
