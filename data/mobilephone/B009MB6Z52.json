{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good deal for a phone that is actually a phone", "Author": "AJB", "ReviewID": "R1N0DHR4XZVTT6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had Blackberry, Droid and Apple phones, and with the rising costs of data plans and prorated fees, I decided to downgrade. I just want talk. I want my phone to be a phone. I can use my laptop or iPad if I want web ability. The phone combo device seems silly to me at this point. I start computing and at some point I hit the wall with the phone's limitations. So I opted for this simple, elegant LG phone. It has a nice weight to it. Not too heavy, not to light. It doesn't feel cheap. The touch screen ability is a total fail, but that's okay. The sliding keyboard allows full control of the lite Droid OS and allows dialing and even talking on portrait slider mode. The speaker is amazing. It's the best speaker I've ever heard. I talked to people on it and I could hear every word.There's no wifi, but it allows you to use multiple email accounts, including Exchange/Enterprise. I loaded an Opera account and a Gmail. It set them up automatically without me entering SMTPs or anything silly. Not even my iPhone4S could accomplish that for Opera!Initially, the online setup gave me a Mexico area code (weird). The website didn't allow users to change numbers, so I HAD to call. I waited for about 2 minutes and a Texan (not a call center out of the country!) answered and set me up with a local area code of my choice. The phone rebooted while we still were talking and my number was set! WOW. I tried Metro PCS for a while and they charged $10 to change the number and couldn't do it over the phone. I had to bring my over priced Droid junk phone into a special repair store that felt more like a welfare office. But I digress!1. Solid phone. Not cheap.2. Basic phone. VERY basic.3. Good call quality, above average speaker.4. Medium usability due to small keyboard and hit and miss touch screen. You will end up using a combination of the touch screen and keyboard.5. Rugged. You'd have to throw it against a wall to damage it and I'm sure it would keep working anyway.6. EXCELLENT option if you are looking to downgrade yourself to an UNLIMITED talk/text phone for $35.7. Superb \"Droid what? Apple who?\" factor as the price leaves change in your pocket for things you need like food and water.Final Word: Go for one of these Verizon phones. Excellent customer service from American call centers 24-7. Area code changes at no cost. No software glitches here. Phone does what it's supposed to do: Talk/Text. Leave your web surfing for the laptop/tablet.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fraudulent product \\Buyer beware", "Author": "Jules74", "ReviewID": "RDMKOWLEJNDYC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered two of these phones to replace my kids older phones. I ordered them from this seller(JoyCells) because the item description said new and the sellers rating was the highest compared to another seller who offered the same product.These were a little cheaper too. I received them in three days which was as expected. The phones were packaged in boxes that to me seemed generic labeled \"LG Mobile Device\" and labeled with a sticker that said \"NEW\". The phone looked new and contained instruction manuals wrapped in plastic. After wasting an hour of my precious time with a screaming toddler fighting for my attention Verizon was unable to activate because these phones had been active on another account previously. I called Amazon and reported my experience. The Amazon Rep that I spoke with was great and most apologetic. Obviously they are going back because they apparently are stolen and usless paperweights.

I thought I was getting a phone that I could immediately activate against my daughter's existing contract with Verizon (to replace the identical phone that had broken).  Instead, what was shipped was a VN271PP (pre-paid) phone (as indicated for the model no. inside the battery compartment).  I tried activating it with Verizon and learned that in order to use it, I was going to need to activate it as a pre-paid phone (with it's own phone number) for $35/month (unlimited voice/text), and after 6 months, I would be allowed to transfer the phone and use it on her existing line.  Since this isn't what I had expected when I ordered the phone, I called Amazon to indicate that what was shipped is not what is advertized on the web description.  Nowhere does the web description indicate that this is a pre-paid phone.  Amazon did a great job and shipped me a return label immediately for a \"no-cost\" return).  The phone is being shipped back today....I'm going to still see if I can get the \"non\" pre-paid phone (in case what was shipped by Joycells was done accidentally).01-Nov: Update...After my first rating of 1-star (since the phone shipped didn't match the advertisement), I contacted Amazon and got a return label to ship back the VN271PP phone at no cost, and they annotated my file that if I reordered to get the correct product, they'd expedite the shipping at no additional cost.  Based on my 1-star review, Joycells contacted me to see what could be done to resolve the matter to my satisfaction.  I explained the issue to their representative, Michelle, and she confirmed that she would have the proper phone sent out when I reordered.  I reordered on 31-Oct and then talked with a new Amazon rep. about expediting the product.  They confirmed that instead of receiving the phone in 5-8 days with free shipping, it would be over-nighted for \"FREE\"!  It arrived today! I got it up and running with my Verizon representative in 5 minutes and (as promised by Joycells) the phone did not require a new 2-year contract with activation.  All's well that ends well!

I have had 7 of these phones though they are only for 4 lines.  3 have been replaced and 2 of those three were replaced again under warranty and they are horrible.Only one of them has survived beyond the 1 year mark without issue (though it did have some battery drain problems).Phone 1, had ear speaker issue, replaced under warranty within 6 months, replacement phone 1A has a charging issue, new battery doesn't even charge well.Phone 2 had screen issues, backlight would come on but screen would be blank. Phone was out of warranty so they didn't replace it, finally I took the battery out and gently pinched the flat screen surface to the back side of the screen case with the slide out open, this reseated the tiny internal connector without opening the device.  This phone still has coverage issues and resets itself often, also it has a battery issue.Phone 3 stopped charging within 9 months, it was replaced in warranty but Verizon failed and sent the prepaid version 3A, this phone was returned and it was replaced with the correct model 3B, and this warranty replacement phone turns itself off sometimes when the slide out is opened and closed. It also fails to text often indicating a radio issue.Phone 4 is the anomaly, it works just fine but has had battery drain issues when in poor signal areas.With the lack of Amazon reviews and the amount of people that also have told us they have issues with their Extravert, I felt it necessary to write an honest review of my experience.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery Life Short", "Author": "Hsiu Tseng", "ReviewID": "R2W8MXTHNBXXUZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received them in five days and the phones were packaged in boxes, no manual, and the Battery life seems short, needed to be charge every two day.

It certainly works, don't get me wrong, but its not like a super sensitive screen.  Maybe once a month or so I recalibrate the screen and that usually helps.  A lot of times for my job I need to have my phone on vibrate so its nice when I can actually find a phone that vibrates a lot.  It doesn't matter if I'm changing the oil, welding, grinding, or plowing, I can usually feel my cell go off.
