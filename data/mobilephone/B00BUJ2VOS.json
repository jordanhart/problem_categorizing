{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Katherine E. Parker \"Stan \"The Man\" C...", "ReviewID": "RXPKYFX9BA3HI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've really been enjoying this phone.  It works great, it's fast and I was able to switch in my Mobile SIM card and get phone service up and running very quickly (middle slot - right slot may be for International plans).  The screen's resolution and large size has meant a little less eye strain compared to my Star N8000 phone (also a Chinese brand) I had been using before.  This is a much better phone.  Jellybea has some great new app management features - such as being able to close and uninstall apps without delving into on as Settings.  Compared to the Star N8000 5\",  the camera on this phone is much better, although not as good as other more high-end phones such as Samsung.  The camera settings I have several times been able to manipulate to get more or less acceptable color and lighting.  The phone speaker is loud enough for me and I have some hear loss and that was a very welcome feature as my last phone was rather wanting in that.  The battery having which as had some criticism for being underpowered - I have not had ANY issues with the battery draining too quickly,  but I also adjust the screen brightness dimming for low light/indoor light conditions with a desktop widget and keep the screen timeout brief when I not actively/continuously using it. Only issue I have had, is that the keyboard input gets a little screwy when trying to operate the phone while it is plugged in - which a couple of instances,  I have had to wait hen few seconds or click the home button after unplugging the phone. But then you are apparently really not supposed to use a cellphone while plugged in.The phone was delivered in two weeks, much sooner than expected.  It came with a nice flip case with phone back cover attached.  Both that and the phone cover that comes on the phone are composed of sturdy plastic and attach to the phone back secure.  Phone came with a few extras,  a single battery,  other stuff as featured in the description.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android 4.1 3G smartphone\nMT6589  4-Core cortex A7   1.2GHz\nBack:8.0MP;Front:2.0MP", "Name": "Zopo Zp950+ Phablet 5.7inch Mtk Mt6589 Quad Core Android 4.1 3g Phone Gray", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Iv3O2UVXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BUJ2VOS"}}
