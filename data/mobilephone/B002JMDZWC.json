It's good for calling and texting which is all I do. My Motorola Karma died on me the other day with no warning so I had to purchase a phone out of pocket.  This was the cheapest phone I could find that had a QWERTY keypad AND had pretty good reviews on all the websites I checked on. The negative reviews I read were mostly about things I don't use (web browser, etc.)  I prefer my old phone but the Slate is still a really good phone. It's very lightweight without feeling cheap, the keypad is easy to use and phone calls are clear.  All in all a good purchase.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid Basic Phone", "Author": "Kenzy", "ReviewID": "R34NOEZWF79EK9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a replacement; it is a great basic phone with full qwerty keypad. The menu is straightforward and easy to understand, the reception I would rate fairly high, since I also have a blackberry 8900 and this phone had reception (could make and receive calls) in places where I had none on the blackberry. Don't expect tons of features because it doesn't have them but perfect for a pre-teen/teenager or someone that wants a full keypad but doesn't want the confusing menus of a smartphone.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "replacement", "Author": "mon", "ReviewID": "R2L0CV6YTI4LJG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was hoping to get a replacement phone, but mysister was not able to use because she was notable to text.

Unfortunately, now it likes to shut itself off whenever it wants. Sometimes it turns itself off when the battery scale goes from 3 bars to 2. I've been lucky that it hasn't gone off too often during a phone conversation. Other than that, it's a pretty decent phone. Just be prepared!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Simple Phone!", "Author": "G.E. Wright", "ReviewID": "R1UQW4ZDW1WUYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an owner of the Pantech Link cellular phone for over a year. The Pantech Link is a small and sleek cell phone, which in my opinion, is a great option for  someone who heavily texts and is looking for a simple phone. The phone has many positive attributes which contribute to the desirableness of the phone, but there are also a few negative aspects that the phone includes.In my opinion, the Pantech Link model has many factors that contribute to the appeal of the phone. Some positive aspects that the phone includes is the battery life, inexpensive price tag, raised keyboard, the overall simplicity, camera, the longevity of use, and how small/light the phone feels in your hand or pocket.  These positive aspects of the phone make it perfect for a perspective buyer looking for a phone that is simple to use and whom are tired of  the heavier smart phones that tend to break within a year.  I would recommend that if you primarily text, this is a great choice for you, as the full QWERTY keyboard is raised up and has a bit more space in-between the keys compared to the regular full keyboard phones.  Also, the battery life of the phone can last up to three days with minimal use which is perfect incase you occasionally forget to charge your phone. The price of the phone is very low compared to most phones.  Directly from the AT&T; cite, I found that the current price is as low as $9.99!  All these aspects have contributed to my approval of this phone and  make it a great phone overall!'Although this model has many positive aspects, the phone also has a couple flaws in its design.  The only two negative factors of the phone that I have found is the memory storage and its occasional glitches.  I often find myself deleting the text messaging conversations and pictures to make room for new data in the phone. If you need a phone with a good amount storage space, this is not the phone for you. Also, as the phone has becomes older, some glitches occur.  Although it has not been a problem for me, the phone often decides to turn off randomly.  This usually happens when the phone is sitting still or if I am in a humid environment.  In my case, the phone is the perfect fit for my lifestyle and expectations of a cell phone.  I recommend this model to anyone that wants a simple, full keyboard phone that gets the simple tasks done!'", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A GREAT PHONE, A BIG PROBLEM", "Author": "Director \"World Artist Yeah\"", "ReviewID": "RURNG94VHTMKS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FAVORITE PHONE BUT IT HAS A HUGE ISSUE.THE UNLOCKED PHONES, I FOUND OUT BY GOING THROUGH 8 CALLS WITH AT&T; AND PANTECH (WHO HAS AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE BY THE WAY AND OUTSOURCED) DO NOT ALLOW FOR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE MULTI-MEDIA PROFILE, UNLESS IT'S THE EXCLUSIVE AT&T; MODEL (W/LOGO ON THE DEVICE).
