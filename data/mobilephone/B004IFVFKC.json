Smaller than many other smart phones but does the job. Its an Android phone but apps come with it and new ones add easily. Plus it's self learning and will make a email and text window automaticaly.

The biggest problem I've hand with this phone though is that it's response time is slow. Apps will crash constantly, audio files will takes as long as 10 seconds after you hit the pause button to stop playing. This was an extremely annoying part of my phone before I realized what was going on (now it's just annoying) I would hit the pause button over and over thinking maybe I missed it or it didn't register, finally it would turn off and I'd think I was good slipping it into my pocket. I'd walk a ways (as long as 30 seconds later) and all of the sudden the audio would go off again.ProsPhone size is perfectWidgets are usefulCustomization is very user friendly once understoodConsPhones processor is to slow for the phoneCan't run all apps from the market, you'll want to research specific apps if you are considering purchasing themAlarm snooze seems to be every single button on the phone", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Mary L.", "ReviewID": "R16XPPYR2Y20OX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the phone on time.
