{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Do not buy this phone", "Author": "gio", "ReviewID": "RU4IS99NQCV3A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I strongly do not recommend buying this phone and here are list of reasons:1. I checked and it is not shockproof. I bought some 4 weeks ago and received 2 weeks ago this phone, so I have 2 week experience working with it. First day it was working. In the evening I gave it to my children for playing and next day in the morning I called and it hang up itself, but I was able to send SMS. After I just moved sim card to another slot, it started working. It worked for 2 days and stopped working right after I dropped it from about 1 meter on the floor. I again moved sim card to another slot and it started working. After that every time I was dropping it, it was stopping working, but moving sim card to another slot was always helping. But yesterday after dropping it from about 50 cm phone turned off and I was not able to turn on phone, until I didn't remove battery, And most exciting is a fact that my friend also dropped his HTC (that is 5 times slimmer than mine) from same heights and nothing happened to it. So why you are buying shockproof phone that cannot withstand dropping even from 1 meter heights.2. Sensors. They suck. GPS receiver: I checked side by side with HTC, I was holding both phones in my hand, after 3 minutes HTC got location with 10 miter error. Guess when my phone received location? After 15 minutes, and with 100 meter error. Ok if GPS doesn't works let's use usual compass, I installed one application for compass it didn't worked. Ok maybe incompatible application, so I installed another one and another and another and finally compass arrow moved, but little bit different direction than north is :D. So with this phone you are lost. Maybe that's why they are selling it with mountaineering clasp with compass :D.Ok next sensor is orientation that I checked with androsensor and it doesn't give any values. by the way magnet sensor also doesn't give any value so you cannot use such app as metal detector.Add to this: flashlight very week for the phone that is kind of extreme; 150MB of internal memory that I can see and half of this is used by applications that you cannot move to SD card and you only have maximum 70 MB of internal memory, and the fact that applications though they are installed on SD card, still are using internal memory makes it even worse. What about RAM it is even worse only 100 MB I can see and 50MB is used with system apps and only 50MB is free. So you should install and run 1 application at a time  :D (In reality no more than 5 applications can work same time).So after reading this if you still want to buy this phone, please buy mine. I can give it to you for half price (excluding shipping or all other costs of course). I could sell it even cheaper but I realize that I can use it as a nutcracker. (Saw YouTube video about phone's extreme test)By the way there should be 0 evaluation for this kind of products.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY good phone", "Author": "rich", "ReviewID": "R1RFN2N1G3KYP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this phone about 6 months ago and have NEVER had a problem with it.i have dropped it a few times...on concreat..wood floors...always works. have even gotten soaked from rain ..i would recomend this for anyone who is outdoors alot,or who is prone to dropping stuff", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Bright, built-in LED flashlight\nMountaineering clasp with magnetic compass\nGPS navigation\nUnlocked Smartphone with Dual SIM slots\nWaterproof cell phone that is shockproof and dustproof", "Name": "FortisX Waterproof Rugged Unlocked Smartphone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Xj5352bLL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008EDILHY"}}
