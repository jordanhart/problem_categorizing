He is 70 and this is his first and probably last cell phone unless he loses is.  Perfect for his minimal use.  I set up his contacts and he just has to hit a # to reach whoever he needs to reach.  Of course, I have had Net 10 myself for years and paying $15 a month for our usage is perfect.  He is now accumulating minutes like I do.  :)", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "lemuel cook", "ReviewID": "RNUVDRWIYAW2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my phone, it's basic, but gets the job done.

Paying $500 not to talk to people (lots of people avoid answering) is DUMB. Checking up on the intellectual wasteland that is Facebook is DUMB. Paying $5.99 for a flip phone PLUS 300 minutes of airtime?BRILLIANT. One star off for the echo I usually hear when talking to my partner (I ordered two of these bad boys) but that's about it for downsides. Holds a charge for a couple of days, unlike my last Net10.All in all, this camper is happy! :)", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple phone at a great price", "Author": "janjill \"janjill\"", "ReviewID": "R34KAD5POXON8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is simple phone for a great price.
