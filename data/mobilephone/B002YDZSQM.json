{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can't go wrong with the Bold 2....", "Author": "Quentin Gerlach \"IT Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3VV6GMWZ8WRXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright, let me just say off the bat that as a former Bold 9000 user, I've been looking forward to the new Bold 2 for months since pictures were leaked on the internet. Since I get my phones through my company, I've had the phone since Nov. 18, when it was released on AT&T;'s network for Premier people.  Unfortunately, my friend decided that after playing around with my phone, they wanted one, so I bought them an unlocked one.The new Bold 9700 is a sleek phone - no doubt about it. RIM apparently has decided, though, to somewhat standardize their phones' look, a direction that bothers me to a great extent. One of the things I loved about the Bold was that it was different - you saw any other phone, and then you saw the Bold - and you thought \"Wow, that phone IS bold!!\" Size I couldn't care less about - as long as it looked good, and worked awesomely, what else matters? And the Bold 9000 fit those well. So when I got the new 9700, and I compared it to my coworker's Tour (for Verizon), I was quite surprised at how similar they were. It's actually somewhat hard to tell them apart (the 9700 is a bit smaller, and also has the trackpad). Just an observation....Alright - to the review:Pros:Trackpad - this is definitely a most welcome upgrade. RIM outdid themselves on this part - I thought the trackball was good, this trackpad is great! The older Bold's trackball was great, as long as you kept dirt and dust out of it. Which turned out to be somewhat difficult, since there was a depression surrounding the trackball, and so if too much dust or dirt got in, the ball needed to be replaced. Also, if you used it too much, the ball would lose its grip, and become less responsive, also - once again - needing to be replaced. Both those problems are now gone with this new trackpad. For former trackball users, it may take a little use to get to know it, but once you do, trust me - you'll never go back.Speaker - the speakers on the Bold are nothing less than stunning. My friend has an IPhone, and my speakers for playing music and speakerphone blow his out of this century. Not only can they get very loud, but they also are quite clear and crisp, for the volume you can put them to. And, if that wasn't good enough, RIM includes AudioBoost - for when you hook your Bold up to your car or stereo system, which bumps the output sound even higher. Excellent....OS - the new BlackBerry 5 OS, which comes preloaded on the phone, is a major improvement over the 4.6 version in most other phones. It's snappier, and quite more responsive.Camera - RIM upgraded the camera from a 2 MP in the older Bold to a 3.2 MP in the Bold 9700. The pictures that the phone takes are quite good, even in poor light conditions. Of course, if you try to take pictures in the club with it - prepare to be somewhat disappointed. Ha. But for regular, everyday camera uses, that \"quick shot\", the Bold 9700 actually takes decent pictures. Nice for when you forget to bring that digital camera with you.There's a couple other pros I can think of, but they're more along the lines of business users, or based on networks (you could get 3G speeds on AT&T;'s network since the first Bold - T-Mobile just got their first 3G BlackBerry with this phone). If you're interested in them, drop me a comment, and I'll get back to you.Now, for the cons:Battery - battery life is still somewhat bad, although it definitely is an improvement over the older Bold. I normally use Pandora - an App that plays Internet Radio, trust me, this should be one of the first apps you download, it's free - the other is Google Maps, also free - anyway, back to the review, so I normally use Pandora, and I can get about 6 hours out of the battery, with small breaks in-between receiving phone calls. So, in normal use, you could probably get about a day out of the battery, which isn't terrible, but also is somewhat worse than comparable phones out there.Hardware - this is probably my biggest negative I had. Normally, when they say upgrade, you would think they would put better hardware in the thing, right?? Well, think again. With the exception of the upgraded camera and trackpad, there is NO difference in hardware between this and the older Bold.Zero.Nada.I would've liked some upgraded hardware in the phone. But again - this is just my thing. You may not care.My last negative is more hit and miss - some people have been reporting that BlackBerry Maps - the app that RIM ships with the phone for navigation, doesn't work on the 9700. Myself included. This appears to be at random, but it just irks me.  It may be dependent on the network you're on. Fortunately, there's a workaround - get Google Maps.So - overall, the phone is a nice update. It works, takes nice pictures, looks sleek, and can be used as your new boombox when you want to blast \"What is Love?\" by Haddaway. (Kidding on the last one) I would completely recommend this phone, even with some of its faults, since they don't really take away from the experience with the phone.I'll update this review from time to time, as I continue to use this, so if there's any questions, please feel free to ask.UPDATE:  As of today - 8/3/2010 - RIM has announced that their new BlackBerry OS - 6 - WILL be compatible with the 9700.  So if you are looking at this phone, but aren't necessarily a fan of OS 5, or weren't sure if updates would be released for it - fear no more.UPDATE 2:  Today, 1/26/2011 - RIM has still not released the OS 6 for this phone yet, which is just BS.  I included a link for those of you who are feeling dangerous and don't mind using beta software, so here you go - [...]  Remember - it is a beta, so some things might be different, but I didn't notice any less functionality.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Misleading and false advertisment", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R2R7QAQ1VSAW2M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently bought this phone from Worldwide Distributors. In the Technical details of the product  it clearly states \"Quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US/International 3G compatibility via 800/850/1900/2100/ 1700/2100 MHz, UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities\" The phone I received is not compatible with all 3G bands as stated. I got a T-Mobile phone which works with 3G bands 1, 4, 8; that is equal to 2100, 1700, and 900 and does not work with 1900 my operator 3G band, also does not work with 800 and 850 as stated in the Tech details. So I bought a 3G phone that does not work in 3G which is equal to a 450USD paper weight. Needless to say I am surprised that Amazon been a company of such high reputation allows sellers to publish such false and misleading advertisement. If that wasn't enough Worldwide Distributors return policy clearly states \"Cell phones may only be returned for refund within 3 days if they have been unopened and all original seals are intact.\" You will need to open the box and turn the phone on in order to see frequency with which it works, so this means, screw you, we will not accept the return of the phone. Last but not least, should you happen to know which operator works with which frequency, they have this little pearl in the return policy \"Buyers are responsible for network, GSM band, and Carrier compatibility, including internet browsing, picture and text messaging functionality which are not guaranteed.\" Double screw you, you just paid 450USD for a paper weight and you are stuck with it. Worldwide Distributors you SUCK and I will make sure that everyone I know knows about this, and AMAZON ignorance is not an excuse.....", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Few good improvements but...", "Author": "AAlt", "ReviewID": "R3JZ5J0NRZHA3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about a week now. And while this device beats previous bold 9000 in many aspects there is still much to be improved. So let me first say things that I do like about the phone. Of course the greatest improvement was the addition of the trackpad, at first it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but I got accustomed to it very quickly. Second thing is the screen resolution, it was improved from the old bold by 480x360 vs 480x320 pixels. The screen is really crisp and bright and sunlight legibility is very decent. The camera also experienced an improvement and while I was taking pictures outside on a bright day and later comparing them to the previous bold, there is a very noticeable change, pictures look somewhat close to my wife's 10 megapixel canon camera. I was also surprised by the improved quality of the videos this device shoots. Much better and less pixelated  than the original bold! Now for the things that I don't like or wished to be improved. Despite of the fact that everyone raves about \"amazing\" battery life on this device, I must say I am disappointed. At best, the battery lasts me a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say. Perhaps I do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging. I usually like to read various blogs and news on opera mini 5 browser and I noticed that this application along with IM+ drains battery like crazy! Of course at least now I don't have to carry a spare battery with me like it was with the previous bold since I am sure this one will last me for the full day.  But most often I still have to charge it every night. Which is kind of a disappointment and not what I expected after reading various reviews. Now about the browser: It sucks.... It simply sucks so much that any other smartphone's browser will put it to shame. But another annoying problem now that I noticed is that I can't get to mobile version of citibank online at all! No matter how I would reconfigure the browser... So it means no banking online for me as I used to do on my previous bold. Very annoying... The browser is still slow as hell  and only the fact that I have opera on this phone doesn't make it a deal breaker. I must say though that I am running a latest .405 version of the software and perhaps the issue with banking online maybe be fixed in later versions. Which I again, doubt very much. Now another disappointment is the absence of many supported languages. For example there is no Russian support whatsoever. But than again, it may be released in the later versions. I hope so. And now last but not least is the speaker quality. In the first day of use I noticed that the speaker has been  downgraded. Instead of the three speakers which previous bold had, this device has only one and when you bring the volume all the way up you can hear a rattling noise. Not a very nice experience... Overall I like the device especially it's size, I was skeptical about it as I liked the bold 9000 big screen. But this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing. Also I like the battery cover design, you can not accidentally open it and whole device seems sturdy and has a look of a professional tool. Hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages. But as of now I am giving it only 3 stars.UPDATE:Couple of weeks ago I noticed that phone would randomly delete data, but today was the worst: In the morning I discovered that all my contacts were completely wiped out!!! by itself! And when I tried to restore them from the backup file it would not do that saying that the file is read only. I tried this file in my old curve 8310 and it worked flawlessly. So I suspect that there are serious bugs in the OS 5.0 and AT&T; is not coming up with any updates as of yet. In a mean time I am lowering score for this phone because I am very disappointed by the poor implementationUPDATE 2:As five months passed since I got this phone, I must admit I like it much more than I did before. True, I still have some issues with it, but these issues are just too minor comparing to lots of useful features that this device delivers. Previously I wrote that it deleted all my contacts from the phone book, and last week it just happened again but I noticed that it happened after I added an another gmail account to the phone. So after I gooogled a bit I found out that gmail actually will sync your contacts with your gmail account but for some unknown reason remove them from the phone book. So basically all you have to do is to download google sync on your phone and transfer contacts back to the phone book. So I tend to believe that this issue has more to do with google gmail setup rather than the phone itself. Also the issue with the Citibank mobile site have resolved mysteriously, and now I am able to do banking through the native browser (which still sucks by the way in many aspects) I am also looking forward to the release of OS 6.0 which should include webkit browser with flash support and other new and exciting features. So I must say that ever since I got this phone it never crashed or restarted on me, not even a single time. So I must increase the rating of the phone to 4 stars as it's been a really great tool which I certainly can rely on in terms of usability and trust.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quite an amazing phone!", "Author": "Stockstradr \"Stockstradr\"", "ReviewID": "R1499MFLSNSGGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not your typical reviewer when it comes to phones. I'm a principle staff mechanical engineer who has spent 15 years designing phones, first for Moto and then for Nok. As part of my job, I get paid to buy competitor phones, try them, tear them down, take notes on design, performance, and then write 100-page internal reports on each product. It is a fun job. I've done this on roughly three or four HUNDRED different phones during my career. I do not work for RIM.I did a complete tear-down on this product, and I also have been using the phone for three months.This is one of the most incredible phones I've ever used. Seriously.The build quality and design are best-in-class. The user interface is excellent. It is also has an elegant, very expensive look about it, helping earn its current undeniable position as an \"iconic\" phone that's become a must-have for everyone from investment bankers to Hollywood's power elite to rock stars. I do not overstate that. I have friends who are investment bankers, people who make over a half-million a year.  They can afford any phone but they don't carry an iPhone, or a Nokia Virtue ($20,000). They ALL have this exact phone. They won't be seen without it.Take your iTunes, move your music-of-choice into a \"Blackberry\" playlist folder, then sync to this phone using Media Sync in the Blackberry Desktop Manager. Even your album artwork zips into and shows up as you browse on the Blackberry! Plug your Bose QC3 headphones directly into this phone and listen to music.  The audio chip on this 9700 produces awesome sound.You can put a 32 GIGABYTE memory card into this baby. Yes, I'm serious. That's a lot of music, and movies! My Apple iTouch and iPod are now on a shelf collecting dust.Take your home videos or entire DVD movies and convert them to Blackberry 9700 resolution using the free Roxio Media Manager, and you'll be amazed how good they look on this phone's amazing 480x360 LCD.The camera is amazing. The thing auto-focuses on your subject in a fraction of a second; a phone that actually takes FOCUSED photos!The phone syncs to all your Outlook data super fast. Contacts, tasks, calendar, etc.Did I mention the optical navi mouse? You have to try this. You will love it. Swipe your finger over it, and that is sensed optically, and the cursor on the LCD moves with same fast response as a PC mouse. Even has the mouse click. Now you run Opera Mini web browser, and you have a better web interface than an iPhone - because with the Blackberry you can zoom in / out, and at same time use the navi mouse to scroll web pages and mouse-click hyperlinks, just like web surfacing on a PC. Sorry Apple, but this Blackberry has a more efficient interface than an iPhone for web surfing.Google maps! This phone's GPS is so fast, it updates your position in Google maps while you drive. Also, you really must see Google maps \"street view\" run on this phone. So cool.The processor is damn fast. You can stream your custom radio station off Pandora, while Google Maps is auto-routing directions, and then switch to browse photos, then back to Google Maps.  Can you multitask that on an iPhone? Nope.But it is the wonderful little things that Blackberry has done with the UI that really make a difference. Exchange an SMS with your friend, and the Blackberry is smart enough to immediately switch that into an SMS chat thread where you're seeing the entire conversation thread out, as if you were using Yahoo Messenger (which you can use as well on this phone). I've never seen SMS message real-time chat threading like that, except on the Blackberry products. So cool.And the available apps, both free and paid. So many amazing apps you can add to this phone.You will love this phone.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "OMG I love this phone!", "Author": "Arion", "ReviewID": "RJUQ7SQJ1BXNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome!

It was/is the best phone I have ever had, and it was super bulletproof (besides a $3 trackball replacement every now and then).So when my free upgrade became available, the Bold 9700 seemed like the best choice.  I was initially seriously excited about the new size and sleek operating system, but when sending a text 6 days after getting the phone, it locked up, shut down, and would not reboot.I exchanged this Bold 9700 for another new phone at the wireless shop, and this phone performed the same failure 14 days later.I exchanged that failed Bold for a third Bold.  This time I insisted on getting a fresh SIM card, memory card, and charger, as I thought maybe there was a hardware interaction that wasn't the phone's fault.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R3PF5X68PDH428", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Any current Blackberry user should be happy and possibly happier with the 9700 if upgrading from a previous model. When it comes to new users, it's a crowded marketplace out there. Those who prefer great physical keyboards may want to look into the current Blackberries. I got this company-issued Bold a couple of months ago through my employer to replace my old 8830. As a Blackberry user for more than 10 years now, I am quite happy with what I got and I see many improvements over what used to be a standard-issue Blackberry some 2-3 years ago.First, the good things about the 9700 Bold:- IT'S STILL A BLACKBERRY - This is important to the many BB users who want their Blackberry to change only slightly from one generation to another, at least as far as the physical form and the user interface is concerned. While Blackberries evolved from the little 'wheel' to the track ball to the current touch-sensitive square that's replacing it, they are still recognizable and I bet that if a time traveler from, let's say, 2002, popped up in 2010, he/she should be able to use the 9700 in no time. All buttons are at the familiar locations and, at least when comparing it with the previous generation, the 9700 responds very much in the same way.- IT'S SMALLER, LIGHTER - While the screen appears to be (very slightly) larger on the 9700, it's bulk is significantly reduced. The 9700 is thinner and it weighs a lot less than its predecessor. Not everyone may appreciate this in the beginning and I was one of those but I got used with the lighter device quickly and I would consider it an improvement now.- IMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY - While not the best screen in business, the picture on the 9700 is significantly better as far as resolution when compared to previous models. I would not use the Bold to watch movies or read books with the Kindle application but... this is a Blackberry and it's good at doing what Blackberries are expected to do: email, voice, enterprise integration. Everything else I see as 'extras'.- EXTRAS - Of course, you get a camera which I'm not likely to use but it's good to know it's there, you can get video for free or subscribe to some pay service, have the ability to store various media and so on. It's good to have them but I'm not likely to spend much time with the 'extras' except maybe for the Web browser.- IMPROVED WEB BROWSER - This is good news. The built-in browser is not quite as good as, let's say, Opera but it's coming pretty close and it's a major improvement over what Blackberry used to offer. And you can always install Opera or some other browser.- 3G - Of course. EDGE is still available as the fall back service but, whenever 3G is detected, the 9700 will take advantage of it.- BLUETOOTH, WI-FI - they work great and pairing with a Bluetooth device can be done literally in seconds.In addition to the above, on the 'the same' or not necessarily 'improvements' category, I noticed no significant change as far as battery life is concerned. The 9700 needs (and comes with a) MICRO USB power adapter so the old MINI USBs won't work on this model. You also get the official Blackberry black leather case with a belt clip.On the not-so-good or 'really annoying' side, I really hated the abundance of bloatware - I call it 'crapware' - that seems to have invaded the Blackberry world. There is an abundance of little pre-installed apps and services that, shortly after you click on and go to the trouble of activating them, it turns out that they are 'pay' things, ranging from Pac-Man to TV services, and it's either impossible or very difficult to remove - I didn't have the time to waste so I was able to quickly hide them but... there SO MANY of them. If Research in Motion is listening, they should know that I do NOT love Blackberry more for turning the BB desktop into some apps and services peddling space.Still on the 'not-so-good' but this could be only an isolated instance, my first 9700 was dead on arrival but I was able to get a replacement quickly and this one works well.When it comes to rating the Bold 9700, within the context of Blackberries, it's probably one of the best. It's lighter, brighter, sharper, faster and provides more functionality than previous models so it's a five-star.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dont buy it without a warranty", "Author": "Mona", "ReviewID": "RYLZ2W4IZJI1M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought mine 4 months ago ...yesterday  it went off and didn work after that..I dont know what was the reason, I didnt download any thing and I didnt update it :S", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed by the MEDIOCRITY of the BOLD 9700", "Author": "BrickByBrick", "ReviewID": "R2C2UI5H603J80", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "WAIT for the BOLD 3 or better yet... try DROID.Pros:Good Size.BB Desktop Manager Plays very well with Outlook.Great Screen.Some applications are available for download.Fast processor.Email Integration.Messaging App.Cons:Build Quality: Trackpad is VERY soft and gets very scratched up very easily (when the rest of the materials around it do not) and visible (and annoying) signs of wear and tear after 2 months (seriously... I bought this the day it came out on AT&T;). The plastic used to build the battery door is too soft. After one month of use the fit in the door has become compromised. It doesn't fall off or anything, but there is a noticeable lag in the fit of the battery door. After it snaps into place it still \"wiggles\" a good bit back and forth. Yes, it doesn't impair the functionality of the phone, but I am annoyed that I paid so much for inferior quality materials.Personally, I think this keyboard is TERRIBLE. The keys are too cramped. I hate how num lock and caps lock requires two buttons to activate. I prefer the simple \"keep this button pressed longer to activate caps lock\" approach.Documentation: BB SUCKS at documentation. The learning curve for getting the most out of your BB is difficult indeed and they have no logical order or meaningful narrative for you to use to get your head around this thing. This thing could be almost as useful as the iPhone if only I had 240 hours to spare to get used to all of the poor interfaces.Poor Organization: Some apps go to apps folder. Some apps go to apps folder. WTF??? What is the difference? Why put this level of abstraction in front of the user?Can't delete third party apps: why can't I delete facebook? Who the h*ll are they? This is my phone??!!Lack Of User Customization : The keyboard has backlighting that you cannot control as much as you would like. For example: BB measures the ambient light and decides if the backlight should be turned off or on. You cannot control the threshold at which this takes place (without a third party app that you have to pay for). If you are sitting in a conference wathcing a pitch and the lights are turned down you will experience my frustration. Again... WTF??? Why can't I just turn this switch off???Lack Of A Simple (and effective) Keyboard Lock Protocol.It bothers me. I turn this off and it's difficult to keep it turned off. Any slight pressure on the end/power key turns it right back on. WTF!!! This is the only phone that has a problem staying turned off!This phone is the reason I'm going to give windows mobile one more chance... or maybe even the iPhone.Summary: There are some good ideas in here but inferior materials and a disjointed GUI will leave you feeling \"taken advantage of.\" Once it's free (with subsidy) it would be worth a shot... maybe.

While one of the reviews stated that it is a matter of getting used to, after one month - I am still not used to it and the keybaord leads to many typos which never happened when I used the 8300 - some so bad that the dictionary can not provide alternatives because the mistake was too bad.  Perhaps the feel of the 8300 keyboard was a bit crude, but it was solid - you knew which key you were pressing.  The 9700 is a different story, so I would recommend anyone planning to purchase this BB to go to your nearest retailer and try out the keyboard, try typing several long sentences.  Since I upgraded through my company, no hit to my wallet, but upon further review, I might have been better off with the 9000 (I decided not to upgrade from the 8300 when the 9000 came out).  This is a fantastic product, but the keyboard is very sub par.---- added ----Btw, the unit died on me after 3 days (continuous reboot loop) and tmobile is sending me a replacement.  Come on....---- update ----Ok, received the replacement unit.  It works fine.  That said, after several months of using it, i still HATE THE KEYBOARD and have not gotten used to it.

Most have been solid and dependable.  I especially liked the Curve 8900 and the 8800.  They had excellent voice quality.  The UMA wifi calling on the Curve was convenient and dependable.I purchased the 9700 for alleged 3G speeds and to use the phone in Japan.  I was successful using the phone in Japan, but the speeds do not really qualify as 3g and I have had a number of problems with the phone.In summary:What I like--1.  The batter life is decent.  Not as good as past Blackberries.2.  The keyboard is fine.3.  The screen is good resolution but very small.4.  Email works fine; this is a given.What I didn't like:1.  The 3G is a joke.  I've downloaded firmware upgrades twice and the device never really achieves decent speeds--for example, it rarely exceeds 200 kbs.  I've tested a Nexus One (not noted for its 3G prowess) next the Blackberry and achieved 2-3 mps.2.  There have been a long history of dropped calls and fluctuating receptions levels.  The call quality is the worst I have had while with T-Mobile.  I like T-Mobile, but they keep suggesting things like a sim swap or firmware upgrade to fix the problems.  These approaches have not worked.3.  The UMA does not work well.  The call transfer from Wifi to Cellular worked well on the 8900 but does not work on the 9700.  It causes the phone to freeze or restart.4.  The 3 mp camera is no better than the relatively good camera for the Curve 8900, which was probably almost threes year ago.  The camera on the Nexus One is much better.5.  The browser and internet browsing experience is terrible.  Many sites will not load.  The screen is too small.  Javascript takes forever, and page loading is generally very slow.  I've tried Bolt and Opera, which are somewhat better.  Also the bookmark system for the standard browser is bad, forcing priority to T-Mobile sites and lacking flexibility.6.  I'm a big Audible user to listen to books.  The Blackberry application is terrible--it is painfully slow, crashes frequently and is slow to download books, even over Wifi.  The music player is also crude and poor.7.  The application store is poor compared to Android and nothing at all like the Iphone application store.  Apps are the name of the game, and on this issue, Blackberries are severely handicapped.I'm now pushing our company to consider non-Blackberry options.  I think many people, having tried the Iphone and Android devices, are sick of Blackberries.

I'm used to getting 4-6 days of use from a Blackberry without recharging.  This model needs recharging every 1-2 days depending on usage.  My colleagues at work, who have the same device, have similar battery life.2)  The Blackberry frequently \"blacks out\"/stalls while the processor tries to catch up with the simple tasks requested of the device.  Never had this problem with prior generations of Blackberries.  The device clearly has underpowered processors.  My colleagues at work have the same problem.3)  The \"lock\" feature.  If you accidentally press A/* key, the keyboard locks and I've been unable, by reading the meagre instructions that accompany the device, to figure out how to unlock it.  You think it'd be simple, but no.  The solution to such a simple problem should be more evident.

This will probably date me, but I hail from the days when my parents used the bricks you comically see displayed in youtube parody as cell phones.I've been moderate to low end when it comes to bells and whistles, mainly because I already have so many gadgets now ( zune, ipod and creative zen, 2 laptops a 8MP Canon camera and gaming console) that already serve their various purposes.  I have been with T-Mobile for about 6 out of the 10 years I've actively used my own cell phone.  I was out of contract, and needed a phone with 3 G (2100 band) to go to Japan.  Lo and behold, the holy light shines upon blackberry as I resume search. My sister, a seasoned blackberry user was jealous when I mentioned I had taken the plunge and bought this product.I am used to flip phone with bells and whistles or no frill phones.Holy cow, I do not want to ever give up this phone!I am used to bigger phones with awkward texting layouts and missed the QWERTY style keypad badly.  The keys are a bit tiny and if you as we say, 'fat finger' your computer keyboard I would advise to look for a phone with bigger buttons to keep you from throttling your blackberry when you can't type, \"BrB\".  But, that aside, This phone will be a major step up from anyone who uses their phone for the usual text message or phone call and maybe the occasional application.  If you are a world traveler in need of a phone that can roam international, I was steered towards the blackberry service as well by trusted business colleagues.I didn't have to set up POP3 Clients for my emails so that was quite a relief and the layout was a lot to maneuver, allows me the most pertinent applications first.I let my sister play with my phone after I bought it, and she was so amazed I wound up (no joke) buying her one with my provider that same night after explaining the terms and conditions and having the representative walk her through the process as well.  She actually tapped my hand when I tried to take my blackberry back from her!  She was completely amazed by the speed of the browsing and I was amazed with the clarity of picture on youtube in particular.I have my own wifi when I am at home, so I wasn't too thrilled that T-Mobile makes me purchase a $30 web package to qualify for a 2 year agreement with the product.  If I didn't already have internet and in my personal situation didn't split the bill and keep my plan for my sister's, it would actually be a useful plan, but I find it fairly excessive and advise if you are not in contract, just buy the phone outright from T-Mobile- you pay less in the long run and don't risk breach of contract if you try to drop the plan.Once more in summary, if you want a web surfing blackberry that has a spacious luxurious keyboard and are all about web access, you probably should keep it moving.  But, if you can compromise being able to look at a few pictures and the keyboard a little bit but want a solid phone that will last you and has a lot to offer, I would stop here!  I've gone through quite a few phones (at least 8 phones... I think) in my cell phone lifetime.  This Blackberry Bold 9700 by T-Mobile by far is the best that I have ever witnessed.  When I'd usually feel like \"here goes nothing...\" I finally get that feeling of \"Yeah, I think I did it! I made a good decision this time\" now that I have the Blackberry, my first time.

The Blackberry's are not based on a soft key design (where the keys are based on software on a touch screen), so there's no chance of having a system lockup during an emergency call.

I give it a 0 out of 100.  Drops calls routinely.  Awful awful as a phone.- GPS antenna doesn't pick up a signal if it is cloudy.  Forget it if there are a few buildings around.  Works about 50% of the time.- Constant crashes, the Sprint store says ALL Blackberries crash ALL the time so it's \"normal.\"  Get used to it, no replacement.  Sprint says you have to reboot most BBs at least once a day after taking the battery out for 1 minute.- Slows down to a crawl with moderate use.  I get a lot of email, this thing simply can't handle it.  It was reasonably fast for the first week of use.- Less than 8 solid business hours of battery life.- Vibration is too mild to feel, you can't use a gel case.- Hides voicemails for some random number of days, then pops up without explanation.- Keyboard is absolutely HORRENDOUS, every key is a different shape and it gives you zero feel for which key your finger is touching.  I can't imagine a worse keyboard if the sole objective was to play a joke on the customer.- The speakerphone is difficult to understand, less volume available that the previously garbled Curve.  Seems the fix was to make the Bold's max volume lower, like we couldn't do that ourselves.- The touchpad is too easy to press and is constantly selecting things unwantedly.  As bad as the old trackball was, when the trackball worked (rarely due to quality defects) it was better.- Web browser is awful, nearly useless for anything but basic google.- Profiles are unreliable.- Still no period (.) key.

Here's what I encountered, some of the web pages weren't being opened and others did.  The ones that weren't being opened just gave me a blank page and stalled then I tried going to Yahoo site and it opened to that page without any problems??!!  You might think it was just a fluke or that page I tried opening was a non-active site but I can assure you that I tried with many other sites and it also gave me that same problems.  And then there were other sites that would open but only uses half of the screen so that it made it difficult to read due to the smallness of the images. This problem didn't exist with the other older model wide screen Blackberry with track ball.  Another critical flaw is that the email accounts doesn't work and it wouldn't allow you to create any email accounts.  I believe this is due to the fact that since Blackberry has their own server for the emails and if you have no data plan the Blackberry somehow doesn't allow you to connect to their site.  So the only way you can check your email is by using wifi to access your email account website such as Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail and etc.  But then again you would encounter the site either it's going to open up or not as I mentioned from above, so it becomes hit or a miss every time you are trying to access some website.  I have an older iPhone and so I wanted to get a newer smart phone and wanted to try out Blackberry since I heard so much about how great their emails and such but if you can't access it then it becomes no better than a dumb phone.  So to pay all that money to get this phone was a waste.  My only suggestion is that if you want to get this phone then make sure you have a data plan otherwise you'll be having all problems I mentioned.  But then again, there are sites I mentioned that it would only uses half of the screen so it would be difficult in trying to read the words or viewing the images.
