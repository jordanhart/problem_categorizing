Then they sent me a 2nd phone saying that it was human error at their end, well the 2nd phone still was NOT brand new, I was on the phone with Sprint for 2 hours trying to get the web browser to work and they said the phone was tampered with and could not get a browser! VERY frustrating when I should/could have just gone to the sprint website and order a clearly stated refurbished phone and know I have all the features the phone should include.  Be wary of this sham.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfection!", "Author": "CLG33", "ReviewID": "R1CFS6HDZWJHPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this same exact phone for almost 2 years and the phone started to act funny, and lose a charge very quickly. I thought it was the battery so I bought a new one, it was not the battery, the phone was simply worn out. I went to Sprint to try and upgrade but my contract still had 4 more months so if I wanted to get the same phone it would cost me $154 PLUS an additional 2 years on my contract! Outragous! I found this phone here and was afraid that it was too good to be true. When I received the phone I was very surprised that it was in fact brand new, it even came in a Sprint box. I am so pleased with my purchase, I will never purchase another cell from Sprint again. No more contracts for me!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS PHONE", "Author": "D Hager \"Mick Hager\"", "ReviewID": "RP6S5CHWRWAYG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone was USED and was sold as NEW!
