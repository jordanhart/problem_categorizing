{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful Phone. Android for a blackberry addict.", "Author": "Dimitri", "ReviewID": "R1XHCLV6867XS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before this phone I went through then NokiaE71, then moved to blackberries. I absolutely love the form factor and I really wanted a keyboard. I also wanted to try android because I didn't want to pay for BIS anymore.Buying this phone I wanted it to do two things: Check email and live long on battery. It excels at both, and does much much more.Start with the cons:* Camera is abysmal, but pretty much on par with my old blackberry.* Very low system space. This can be fixed a little, even without root, through using ADB to allow you to move bloatware to the SD card.* A little slow with large games: I can play world of goo and temple run but some of the larger games will lag.* The phone is not designed to be used in portrait mode much, but several apps only work in portrait, which means you have to hold your phone sideways.* Tiny market for this phone so rooting it is not as easy as some other phones, and there are no custom roms out for it.* Stock android phone app could be better, and no dialing from home screen.* No central place for all incoming messages to go, sms and chat and email are all separate. This is a con of android v blackberry and not a fault of this phone.* Alarms do not show up in agenda view. Again this is a fault of android, not the phone.The Pros:* Keyboard is great. Seemed odd at first, but broke in and became perfect.* Touchscreen is small, but good! I have had no complaints about latency and what not.* Looks and feels exactly like my blackberry did, people thought I never switched phones.* Revives email very well, great for composing emails.* Have taken phone to the beach several times and had no issues.* Battery lasts forever -- several days -- and the screen is not always the main consumer of battery!* Taken this phone out of the country to Europe and it worked like a charm.* Ridiculously loud speakers, never missed an alarm with it.This may not seem like a 4 star review, given all the cons, but it's the overall experience that I am rating. This phone does exactly what I wanted it to do, it replaces my blackberry. It may not be a flagship android beast, but it works, and it works well and reliably. My next phone probably will not have a keyboard, but I am glad this phone does. I would buy this phone again if it broke.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This ones's pretty good", "Author": "H. C. Redondo \"Chirriche\"", "ReviewID": "RF8H8DYUVL84V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has all I need. Especially the qwerty keyboard.It's amazing to write on it. At first you feel it kind of slow, but after a week you get used to it, and becomes softer the more you use it.The screen size is something I don't care too much about, but I'm pleased that the GB 2.3 works perfectly well with all apps on Play. Like the most important ones I mean.The five stars is for the call buttons that makes the device, a CELLPHONE... not that big size screens with no buttons I don't really get used to.The waterproof is good, but is not going to surf with your phone on the pocket... besides why would you surf with your cellphone.. I mean is surf.. but it works for like going on a walk and get wet and then clean it and then... you know, adventure.The other good thing is the D-Pad that if you like to write like a professional, then it's a must because when you mistake, your thumbs are so big that it will press all the word instead of the letter you want to erase.One thing I don't like is that there are some preinstalled apps that updates whenever you got into Internet connection and this I hate, because the device's memory is kind of small, so those updates steal some memory that could be free. For example Facebook or Google+. Dude.... you can't uninstall neither of them. NEITHER!The last CON I have realized is the camera quality... I mean in dark places forget about it because it's pretty bad. In sunny days you can get good pictures and stuff but don't expect it to be like S4 or Iphone. Then I realized that with this app for the camera (Camera Zoom FX) you can get really good pictures and with a lot more settings like ISO and stuff.But overall, it's a pretty good phone for that people that can't quit the buttons-phones and love something little and kind of cheap.I wrote this on my XT560 (:**excuse my english, I'm from Latam* Other bad thing is this USSD code for prepaid lines of my country. I can't see how much is left in my account, I just have to call the service. But....

I bought this phone so that my fragile i717 could miss out on abuse this summer during summer camp.Additionally, the phone is marketed as being sturdy, however there is a dent in the upper left metallic covering around the bezel just from being in my pocket with keys for a short period of time.On two occasions in the last week, I have found that the battery door has unlocked itself and detached from the phone; not good for water resistance.The 3.5mm headphone jack's rubber cover takes a great deal of force to open for the head phone jack.The d pad feels flimsy.Based on the written description here and on the Motorola site, the phone, in my opinion, deserves 3/5 stars.Camera:The camera produces dark and grainy pictures in a low light or indoors setting.I give it 3/5 stars.Features:The phone has a ton of features that are cool.It is water resistant which is a plus, however I do not want to test this feature.The built in compass seems like it could be helpful while exploring an unknown area.The vanilla Wifi hotspot feature is like a dream come true.  Most unlocked phones are still bound by At&t;'s tethering rules, however this phone is stripped of that and is able to create a wifi hotsopt out of the box.The FM radio is always a good thing to have for emergencies or if there is no songs on the phone.It has a built in flash flight application that utilizes the built in flash from the camera.It gets 5/5 stars in this department.Signal:I use Pure GSM which uses At&t; cell towers and the phone was able to maintain 4g/3g when my friend's iPhone 4 only got 2g or lost the signal.  It has not gone below 3G or 3 bars in the same places that my i717 loses signals all of the time.It gets 5/5Battery:This phone really shines in power management.  It can last two full days on a single charge with my usage pattern.  As a disclaimer, I work 7 hours of which I do not use the phone that much unless it is being used as a hotspot momentarily to load media onto another device.  I also play music to and from work.  If your usage pattern is similar, I would expect great battery.  However, on my i717 my battery only lasts 12 hours before it needs to be charged and that is with normal use.It gets 5/5 stars in this category.Performance:The phone is snappy on most tasks, however sluggish on some.  If you are not going to play dead space or tap tap 4, I think that it would be good for your needs.It gets 4/5 stars here.OS:The phone is running Motorola blur interface I think; it may not be so check up on that.  I cannot really tell that it is there if it is.  There is a useful Motorola widget that tracks the apps that one uses the most and keeps them in a central location for easy access.  It is not as terrible as the Motorola Charm that I use to have.There is hardly any trace that this is a phone from Rogers, the Canadian Carrier.It gets 5/5 stars here.I will update as needed.I give it 4.5 Stars out of 5 at the moment.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Amy Rose", "ReviewID": "RLOULIED6L02Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone for those of us who still prefer having actual keys instead of just touchscreens. This phone doesn't have the speed of the new \"superphones\" out there, but it is a very reliable phone. The phone is very comfortable to hold, the keys soft and easy to use. The battery in this phone is amazing - after using so many large touchscreen phones, I forgot how long a battery could last.

No more soft keyboard for me.

I felt instantly in loved with this phone once I received this in the mail and activated it. Although unfortunately a week and a half later that I have this phone I  accidentally dropped it straight face onto the pavement which crack the screen; however, it was still functioning like normal. I believed it would have survived being cracked if it had fell on the rugged rims of the phone. I had the phone replaced by the same seller, because even though it was slightly a little bit more expensive it came very fast considering I needed another phone as quickly as possible, When it came in a few days I became happier again :D.

But when I read the \"instruction manual\" it was utterly useless, nothing much in it.  So I got online to look up the instruction manual and realized that I may not have the genuine product as there were things in the manual that my phone didn't have.  I decided to give it a few days to see how it worked.  Unfortunately I was not able to use it much as I couldn't get reception on it most of the time.  I never had a problem with my old, much cheaper, phone but I was never able to get more than one weak bar on this phone the whole week I had it.  So this obviously wouldn't work for me.

I thought IP67 guarantees that it could be cleaned at the meantime of washing hands, but absolutely I was wrong. It happened several times that the touch screen stopped work when there was water on it, and I didn't care and thought \"oh, that is interesting\", until the last week I finally understood it was because the water leaked into the screen!!! Water appeared inside the screen, sometimes made no response to touching, and sometimes got softwares go crazy. The only thing I could do was to leave the screen locked, and waited for 5 days. It is extremely bad experience, and I would rate lower than 0/5 to its water proof.I am not the only one suffered from water leaking in the screen, and I believe the only solution is that Motorola re-designs their water sealing for the screen.
