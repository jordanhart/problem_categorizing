{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well engineered, amazing if just for the camera & the screen!", "Author": "JoHn", "ReviewID": "R3LXDJ0HZGUFCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": ">>BUYERS BE WARE, there are many versions of this phone, the US at&t; version is a 16 GB version, people unlock it via an unlock code and sell it as an unlocked international version, the international one has 32 GB & comes without the at&t; logo on the front. The one on this page is the 16 GB one, the 32 GB will cost a bit more and you need to write in search \"32 GB One X\", remember this phone has no slot for an external SD card, so more internal storage may be crucial for some!<<----Original review----I used so many brands and models of phones and smartphones than I can remember, and this one here, except for the memory card thing, covers every hole that was in every other phone I used. It also covers any thing u may have thought of having in a phone, and it is doing that in style! I tried the Samsung Galaxy S3 at at&t; before choosing the One x, and it really isn't better. I mean it is just about personal preferences, I always feel Samsung phones ( not all Samsung products, I love their TVs for example)have a cheap felling. Besides I liked how the One X looked more than the S3.Pros:-Amazing screen, and I am coming from a Motorola Droid Razr which has a very good screen itself. The screen here is sharper,  colors are better, no shadows(Razr had a green shadow on all colors. Watching Youtube or any vids on this phone is a thing I long for throughout the day!-Battery life is good enough for a full day with moderate use. Of course excessive movie watching, game playing or hours long web surfing require a twice chraging.-The 8 MP Camera deserves all the fuzz it received when first introduced, its pictures are steady, colors are vivid and quality is really high!-Speed: The phone handles multitasking very well, games and videos are a breath nothing you should worry about here.Cons:The only thing I didn't like about this phone, which is why I would say it is more like 4.5 stars not 5, is the lack of a memory card slot. I mean, seriously? it has a 2 year free subscription for extra storage online and everything, but whyyy?? How hard was it to add an extra slot for a memory card? An engineer's mistake without any doubt.Bottom line, if you want an Android phone go for the One X or the S3, can't make up your mind, try them both and just pick any of them you will end up with a winner either way!-----UPDATE------So I was tempted to get the S3 since I have a month to exchange the phone with at&t; and I wanted to know how better was the S3. I got the blue S3 and I certainly loved it, it doesn't feel cheap in hand as I expected, but it feels rather classy and here are my thoughts in comparison, I hope this experience may help other people decide:- The S3 overall look is really slick, it is ofcourse all about personal preferences as I said before, but sometime I wished that the One X looked more like the blue S3! the metal edges gave it some superiority no doubt about that, the blue finish was really good, but the white looks really cheap, don't think about it!- The Samsung motions( swipe to take a screen shot, raise the phone up to your ears with an open message to automatically dial the sender without pressing any keys & others) are really cool and are certainly a point above the OneX.- Sd card slot, as basic as it is , it is better than not having one!But that is it, these are the only things where the S3 bests the OneX- The Svoice(Smamsung reply to iPhone's Siri) Is totally useless, and certainly needs more development, a good idea that may get better in newer models, but not a plus for the S3, not to mention it consumes more battery when turned on.- The screen is different than the one X, I can't totally explain it, not the pixels density but mainly the colors. As I read online it looks like Samsung forgot to calibrate its screens, so as good as they are colors don't look natural. And you can't really feel it unless u spent some time with the OneX's gorgeous screen, colors aren't as vibrant or bright, a picture of a clear sea looks darker, less vivid and less colorful on the S3 than the One X and though really good, the One X is considerably better.- The camera is good, but again the One X's camera is definitely better both outdoor & indoor, may be not by much but the difference is definitely there.- Eye tracking: It was supposed to prevent the screen from sleeping when you are reading or surfing, well it doesn't do the job very well. In low light situations it is pretty much useless, since it depends on the front camera for eye tracking. In regular light it was ok, but again u had to hold to hold the phone in a certain way to make sure it \"sees\" your eye! I didn't find it that impressive..or useful!- Speed:same for both- Samsung's touchWiz vs htc Sense is an even battle I liked them both.- Battery: both are almost the same battery wise, though moderate to heavy use will definitely require a twice per day charging with both of them, you may be able to get enough juice till you get back home. Actually light use easily gets you through the day.Of course you can buy an extra battery with the S3 and swipe batteries cos the one X has a built in battery which the user can't replace on his own, but again you can buy a charging case for the oneX!Both have NFC which I didn't use in the ~ Two weeks period with each phone.-------Conclusion-------If you want a better screen and camera definitely go with the oneX, you will regret you didn't go with it when you see one in comparison with the S3!If you are a media fanatic who needs a lot of space, the the OneX isn't for u, the S3 is as good as a phone, even with a lower screen but with extra micro SD card slot. Also if you like to impress your friends, the little Samsung motions are certainly impressive and fun to use and the overall look may be a bit better.WHAT DID I DO?I missed how great the OneX screen was, I certainly missed how awesome HD vids looked on the screen, also I missed the slightly better camera, so I gladly paid the $35 restocking fee for at&t; and again returned back to the OneX, black this time since the white one caught stains fairly easily and had to be cleaned from time to time! I sold the at&t; over eBay and bought the unlocked international version with 32 GB built in memory, which was a bit more expensive but was definitely worth it!", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware, Seller is not being totally honest about this phone", "Author": "Patricia", "ReviewID": "RSSM6PB3QK2IX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my husband so we didn't have to extend our AT&T; contract. I paid a premium price for this phone, the same as a new one from AT&T; and I expected to get a new phone. What we received was a previously sold and returned refurbished phone at a new phone price.I gave the phone to my husband on Christmas morning unknown that it was a refurb. My husband suspected it wasn't new due to cosmetic marks on it and when he went to the AT&T; store to activate it they confirmed it had been previously sold and was returned under warranty due to a defect.Fast forward 3 weeks. My husband has had the phone and it has worked for the most part. It did have some glitches with freezing up at times and taking a long time to finally ring when he tried to make a call. Wireless also would lock on to a network and wouldn't let go even after leaving that network area so he would have to manually turn wifi off to get it to connect to the mobile network....  Very aggravating for a $500 phone.My husband put his phone on charge last night and turned it off as he normally does... This morning he takes it off charge and tried to power it up...Nothing!  He spent the next hour trying to get it to boot up.....Nothing!He then takes it up to AT&T; and they try several different things to get it to boot up....NOTHING! the phone is completely dead after only 3 weeks of ownership.My husband is livid I spent $500+ on this phone and the fact he now has NO PHONE.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome super phone", "Author": "juan ferrer", "ReviewID": "R17RQ2Y8LMFPTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the HTC one x is truly an awesome super phone, It's really smooth and very speedy with no lags. the built quality is excellent, the camera is superb. the screen is really great has true colors and excellent viewing angles. and the tegra zone optimized games for tegra 3 are really awesome, excellent graphics the best for android when optimized with tegra 3.

I decided to go with a nice android after having an iPhone and a Nokia Lumia. I wasn't looking to spend more than $200, but I found this phone and decided I'd give it a shot.So, I ordered it. And to be honest I was a little upset with my \"3 to 5 day shipping\" when it took a week to get to me. But oh well, haha. I can wait. So, I get this phone and I'm pumped to get it, so I take it out, look at it and I'm frustrated. The screen is all scratched up, and I was just like \"Did they really sell me a phone in this condition?\" But I took a second look and realized it was a screen cover. Screen was pristine and the rest of the phone looked good too.Pros:This phone is fast and useableIt's a very attractive phone. The screen is vivid, and the way it's designed just feels and looks good.The main camera takes good photos and videos. The slow motion video is definitely a plus. Doesn't serve much purpose, but it's fun to mess around with haha.It's just a good, well rounded phone.Oh, and the Beats Audio definitely improves sound quality. Even if it's just a fancy equalizer.And with moderate use on a 2G network the battery lasts me all day. (Some games, some music, lots of texting and snapchat, and maybe an hour of phone call each day.) I take it off of charge at 6:30 AM and put it on to charge with probably 30-40% battery at about 10 or 11 when I usually go to bed. No charging between. And keep in mind this phone IS used.Cons:I don't have a lot. Sometimes the keyboard glitches out.I'm kinda upset that this is the American AT&T; version and not the international one. But I couldn't find the international on Amazon for less than $350 used.Conclusion:This is a really solid phone. It works well, it's attractive, it's fast, and there aren't many things wrong with it. There just aren't. So, if you're looking for a relatively cheap but good android phone this one would be the way to go.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love My Phone", "Author": "R.

I have had the phone for over a month, and have not had a single hitch. I will say the battery life varies depending on how you use the phone. If you are talking, surfing, or the like it lasts a while. But, when you play games that are HD, it really sucks the juice up. It takes a little while to fully charge too, a couple hours or more.

I got it almost free with a new contract. I wish I had paid the extra $100 to get a 4S again.1. In the first week, when I still had both phones, the HTC screen got scratched by my keys, while the 4S remained flawless.2. The phone developed a problem where it would not realize that the SIM card was inside and I would have to restart my phone. If you search on the web, this is a very common problem and people have exchanged their phones just to get a new phone with the same problem. It is easily fixable by attaching a sticker or several layers of tape to the back of the sim card, but it's silly for the phone to have this problem in the first place.3. I miss Siri, although you can install Assistant apps that work similarly, I miss holding down the home button (safer for texting while driving)4. I have noticed, through Task Manager, that a lot of apps will turn on by themselves in the background (especially Facebook and Groupon), though I'm not sure if this is an Android problem or an app problem.5. Bluetooth when on does not automatically connect to my car system - I have to go into the menu and tell it to connect.Besides the above points, the phone works fine. Battery life is great (lasts all day with multiple email and facebook refreshes and a game or two), screen is fine, camera is fine, and the phone has never crashed on me.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "There is a scratch on the shell of it.

Wang", "ReviewID": "R9SV5JK99OWRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone because I was going to be going overseas for several months, and wanted to have a phone that I could use anywhere in the world. The International version of the HTC One X, while offering better hardware configurations, fit very well. I use T-Mobile while in the US, and with the new tower integration, I am able to receive 3G speeds within the Seattle area.Additionally, I have been able to use microSIM cards from SMART in the Philippines, as well as other providers in Taiwan and Singapore.The phone is powerful. It's slim, and while it's a plastic phone, the plastic is high quality and very sleek. (Warning- don't drop it!) The screen is incredibly bright, and while it has Gorilla Glass, people seem to say that the quality in this department is iffy, some are indestructible, others get scratched by merely looking at the screen with an ugly thought. So I've been using a Skinomi screen protector, which has done the job relatively decently (but with the usual characteristics, fraying at the edges, yellowing tint, etc).My main gripe about the phone is that the camera lens sticks out the back, and the glass cover is prone to scratches. The glass is not gorilla glass but merely a high impact glass, which is easily scratched. I have a rather ugly slash that if it were a tiny bit more to the side, would have interfered with the sensor while taking photos. This is a huge issue for such a great phone.Secondly, the battery life is abysmal. With my mobile data on, my phone after 10 hours of use has dropped into a dangerously low 25-30% charge. Using wifi, my phone also results with the same charge. If you do not have them activated, the phone of course will behave like any other phone, hardly taking up any juice. But I've had to purchase an external battery charger in the case I'm out for the day. It's a bit annoying, though I know all smartphones currently have this issue.All in all, the phone is great. I paid a huge price for mine since I bought it early, but now the prices have fallen to the point where it's worth taking a look at these phones. Even if they're 'old news', they're still extremely powerful and can handle pretty much anything still out currently.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Fuentes Flores Carmen Luisa \"Carmen\"", "ReviewID": "R3E604SB0L09KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

But because I didn't pay much attention on the description, and the misleading photos of the phone, I accidentally bought this one.Which is the AT&T; version. Because I'm a T-Mobile customer, I weren't able to connect to the LTE services that T-Mobile provided. (This phone is unlocked, it can be used for any SIM card carriers) With the lost in speed for the quad core, and the lost in LTE services, I was disappointed, But this WILL NOT effect how I'll rate this phone.This is absolutely a gorgeous phone, I had the chance of choosing the GS3 or the One X. But I prefer the warmth of the color on this phone. Screen resolutions as expected will be clear and crisp, GREAT for watching videos.The camera takes high quality photos, it brings out a more realistic color and the burst mode is useful, although, I don't see myself playing around with that feature much.And one of the most important features that this phone provides is the Beats Audio. A lot of viewers you see on Youtube are comparing the volumes of the speak, and totally forgot the fact that, the Beats Audio feature only enhances the quality of the music when you're listening to audios through headphones.Overall, this phone is great for peoples that likes to watch videos, take pictures, and listen to music. which is much for entertainment other then processing speed such as the GS3.I'll prefer this phone to anyone that likes entertainment other then processing speed.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful but no battery life", "Author": "Jacqueline Rodriguez \"Jacqueline Rodriguez\"", "ReviewID": "R2DL8VZ5ONWTIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a gorgeous phone with a stunning display, but the battery life is awful.

I thought not having a micro SD card slot wouldn't be an issue, but it is. I don't even watch videos on my phone, but I was hoping to use it for downloading music to double as an mp3 player. It is useless for this, because it does not have enough memory unless you dump optional apps and also because the sound doesn't go loud enough to hear the songs well (and I don't even like my music loud).The thing I dislike most about this phone is I cannot keep a bluetooth paired to this phone. I have to pair it repeatedly, and sometimes it still doesn't work. It was mentioned as being an issue all over the web (of course I didn't see that until after I bought it).Another problem I have is I can't clear my Swype cache. I took it back to the AT&T; store, and no one seems to know how to do it either. So I'm stuck having the Swype spell \"picnic\" for me when I want to Swype \"ladder\" unless I format the phone completely. Ugh.Yet another thing I don't like about it (although minor) is using my personal pictures for wallpaper background. The phone forces you to crop the pic so much hardly any picture looks decent.

I've had my One X for about 2 months now and in the beginning there were some minor issues but all of them got sorted out through updates/upgrades, upgrades are very important in the phone, tablet or computer business and HTC seem to be right on top of fixing issues that people seem to have. HTC seems to do a good job so you won't have to wait a year to get your phone working right, like some other companies that I won't mention. HTC just released ICS on 13 of its older phones so you know that you will be getting upgraded to the newest Android releases in the future if you have this phone. At least with this phone it's the top of the line Model from HTC so I could see it getting at least the next 2 major Android releases, Jelly Bean and whatever comes next. It is nice to know that your phone will be future-proof for 2-3 years. It's a good phone, first it looks really nice the design of this phone is second to none, just look at the thing its stunning! It looks nice the screens Gorilla Glass is strong and don't get scratches, if you want to see how good the Gorilla Glass is made on the phone go to YouTube and search \"One X screen\" You will see a review of someone hammering in a nail, yes a nail with the screen of this phone and the screen hammers in the nail with no issues to the screens glass, another one with the phone spinning in a drying machine! There are and more where people take keys to the glass and body and does not damage the phone, so yeah it's a sturdy strong phone. Then under that screen is the most beautiful display I have ever seen on a phone the icons look like they are just floating on the surface, the SLCD2 screen is amazing, picture quality is really good, burst mode is really nice you can take six pictures every second continuously so you don't miss that shot you want. The phone is fast I mean really fast! Sense UI don't slow this phone down at all its very snappy, it has done everything I have thrown at it, the phone is faster than some computers, it's got 5 cores 4 of them run up to 1.5GHZ and the 5th core that runs at a low spec for standby so your phone will not use hardly any power when asleep or running a light task, which saves a lot of battery. My phone can sleep all day and only lose about 5% power sleeping all day. I can get through 2-3 days before charge if I don't use it that much due to its companion core from the NVidia Tegra3 processor that displays really nice graphics and has some games that are specific for Tegra3 from NVidia and its developers. These specific games are really above and beyond what the competition has to offer. You can do a YouTube search on Tegra3 games to get what I'm talking about, but for example Riptide GP used on a normal phone or tablet without Tegra3 it will play but not as well as it would on a Tegra3 optimized setup, when on Tegra3 phone it will show water effects where the water splashes up on your screen and runs down he screen. Its best to check out these games for yourself on YouTube, then you will see a big difference.

Sense is more lightweight but more targeted, meaning it does not crete any lag (maybe the quad processor helps with that) and at the same time it is there wherever you need it to have a meaningful shortcut in the android, so you don't need to go through 3-4 screen taps more.However, I spent this week with HTC troubleshooting and now they confirmed I need to contact their technicians to fix the problem, which obviously I am not going to do. I will just return the phone and try my luck from another batch, I am sure that not all One X's have this problem. I will leave the 2 stars (although the phone is worth 4-5 stars) so people are aware that they might get a faulty GPS.--I received this phone only today.It is great! My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S II and I really liked it, but I wanted something newer and better, so I went for the HTC One X.The One X is fast, has a beautiful screen, HTC sense has improved a lot (I used to have HTCs in the past, and Sense was bloating the device - now it gives a much better integration with ICS but is much more lightweight) and it is nice to have 25GB in drop box with it.However, there is a problem that is HUGE for me, and hence the two stars: The GPS is buggy! As long as I keep moving in the car my location seems pretty fixed, when I stop in a red light, it goes mad, I jump all over the place, Google Maps (and HTC Locations) show me one second here, and next second two blocks down the road. The software keep re-calculating and honestly it is really unusable! I used several tools such as \"GPS Status\" and \"GPS Essentials\" and all show the same problem.Here are some links about other people reporting the same issue:[...][...][...]Please note that XDA developers suggest a fix, however this did not work for me, and also it did not work for other people in other forums.I really hope this is a software issue and soon there will be an update.
