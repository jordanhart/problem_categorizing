When the item arrived, it was immediately evident that I did not have in front of me the box in the photos. It's technically carrier packaging, but it's a generic box from AT&T;, with no printed information on the outside pertaining to this specific phone. The phone inside was in near-perfect condition, save for two very small blemishes that I can't seem to remove from the screen. It may be worth noting that these imperfections were covered loosely by a misaligned factory screen protector with the usual \"don't text and drive\" slogan AT&T; is known for. Also, while the charger and battery door (and the phone, itself) seem to be genuine Samsung products, the battery is not. This creates problems when one is trying to get the phone to charge consistently, or to maintain a full charge if you ever do get it to that point. I've since ordered a genuine Samsung dock and spare battery, which comes with a handy one-piece wall charger, instead of the AC adapter/woefully short USB cable combination that comes in the phone's box. This new battery and charger seem to have cured all of my problems with charging, which is definitely a relief for me.  The phone itself has proper specifications, as far as I know, to prove it's the exact model that's advertised here. The screen is absolutely beautiful, I must say. HD YouTube videos look flawless, though I may be easy to impress in this respect. I've previously owned a Nokia N900 (lovely phone, broken USB port) and a Motorola Atrix 2. The S3 seems to have so much more potential than these other models.  I'm using this phone with Straight Talk and without any trouble. I can't really speak as to whether it's truly unlocked or not, since I've yet to have trouble using AT&T-locked; phones on this service which also uses the very same network and towers. I CAN say that it's probably wise to find out which network your prepaid SIM-based service operates on in order to give you the best chance of having the same signal quality available to you.  It's also good to know that these phones are capable of wireless charging, with a few accessories you can purchase here on Amazon. This is something that interests me, as I'm a bit paranoid about microUSB ports nowadays.All in all, this seems to be a great phone with enough tech packed inside to keep it feeling current for some time.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not an Authentic Samsung S3 From AT&T; Carrier", "Author": "Mr. Love", "ReviewID": "R3I2C63NV1KIJZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This will be my third Unlocked Samsung Galaxy SIII. Upon receiving this phone I immediately notice it was packaged in an opened generic style box with sliding cover instead of the sealed lid covered box all original Samsung Galaxy SIII's come in. This was a immediate flag due to my previous phones came in unopened larger and fully detailed packaging. Upon opening the box the phone was not package like the company models; there was a generic sticker on the screen that said \"Don't Text & Drive.\" Clearly not from the AT&T; company. The phone and other items were also wrapped in resealable plastic covers. Though the phone looks to be authentic, I am left to believe this item is some after market copy, or back door promotion item. Even some of the pieces in side of the phone are different than the original modes, i.e. SD Card and SIM Card slots are designed differently. And the serial sticker looked as it was printed wrong and slightly cut off (Definitely not present on my previous S3's).I have only turned the phone on at this point and all seems to work fine. But at this point I am lead to believe that this item was sold to me as some cheap copy with the authentic price tag. I am going to open the phone and if it does not have the Snap Dragon processing hardware, than this will definitely be a rip off!

There's not much inside the box, just the charger usb cord, small touchpen, micro sd chip/adapter combo and battery.  (In the original order it had a docking charger and hip carrying pouch)  Also should note that there was a generic replacement battery instead of the SAMSUNG one.Battery in, Excitement on - Or so I thought, I quickly learned that I have to keep the charger nearby.  Either from this being a faulty battery or just the low quality of the generic replacement.  It never seems to fully charge to 100, and if it does it drops back down to 90-94 within a matter of 10 mins of use.  Even with all the apps cut completely off, no data or voice being used it cut off from 20% down to 0 during the period of 1 hour.  Really disappointing.  I would recommend purchasing an extended battery (but you do have to get the extended case as well which makes the phone bulky)As for the actual usage.  I'm  switching over from the iphone so I'm enjoying the new swipe type texting/keyboard.  Unfortunately with these I find that I'm fat fingering it more the iphone.  The feel of the keyboard touch is so smooth that you don't really sense the actual keys (I guess it's something I'll have to get used to).  Also the autocorrect, doesn't seem to be correcting as it should.I've also noticed some lag (during screen transitions, swyping while using whatsapp, and the back out process when you're in a app)Music/Media - Changing/adding music was a breeze, adding pics to the external sd card was simple and it picked up everything and loaded it to the media gallery already in folders (if you have personal pics you DEFINITELY want to reorganize it - also download safe gallery free to password protect some folders/pics)VPN/Tethering/Hotspot - now by default this DID NOT WORK.  I was highly upset at first and did a bunch of reading to see how to enable (yes I know the basic steps but it kept saying \"not a valid sim\")  So I finally downloaded hotspot toggle widget and it activated it for me.  I'm guessing it was either a software malfunction or security issue which was stopping me from turning it on/off through the regular interface.Pictures - look amazing and so does video... Absolutely no complaints thereCellular network - I went with T-mobile since they have the best package here and 4G... Well let's just say T-mobile sucks in a lot of areas but it's great to be able to leverage that hotspot when you're in a 4G area.  Also, I had no trouble switching over (since it's a ATT unlocked device).  The SIM was popped in, and it registered on their network in about 2 hours.Screen - I constantly worry when I'm going to crack it when it's in my pocket, but it seems pretty sturdy.  I've dropped it a few times (it's slippery due to its nice finish).  Background light is great indoors but once you get outside, it's all over.  This is a downside of most phones but not all!Volume/Ringer - Felt the need to add that it's really not that loud, nor does it vibrate that hard (even after maximizing all settings)  Will probably create and amplify my own ringtones for a decent noticeable ringer.I would have liked to see a hdmi output on this one and possibly a slot for the touchpen, louder volume, outdoor contrast and less bloatware (that'll drain the crap out of your battery as well - I disabled 7 apps that came with the phone and haven't needed or noticed them since)", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arrived right on time!

The USB cable seems and feels cheap although it says to be Samsung, The Battery's tag says to be a replacement battery for the Galaxy S3 I9300 and does NOT have the NFC chip (For S Beam and NFC wireless comunications). HUGE DEAL BREAKER IT DOES NOT COME WITH WARRANTY, but it works well its new no damage at all and it is in fact unlocked. Also no documentation of any kind, no user manual, no papers from At&t.; Paying an extra 50 dollars and buying it from At&t; directly or with Amazon's Wireless shop would be a good idea, that way you'd be getting your product completely sealed on the box.P.D. it comes with Android 4.1.1 not ICS  **UPDATE**Day 2, since day two i noticed the wall adapter and USB cable didn't work properly. As soon as i connect the wall adapter to the electricity the phone starts ringing and notifying me that it needs to be charged. I had to use my old LG phone's USB cable and adapter. Although software and hardware work properly the Accessories and box are a total deal breaker. seriously i can only recommend this product if you do not care  about these inconveniences. And if you prefer the authentic accessories and to take it right out the Samsung Box buy it from Amazon Wireless or other sellers who actually mention the imperfections.  ** Final Upadate**Dont buy this Article buy it from Amazon or  trusted sellers", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S3 SGH-I747 White AT&T; 4G", "Author": "encyclopedia", "ReviewID": "R28RDRM2727JWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The cellphone is like new.

But this version of the Galaxy S III is a terrible phone. My wife uses the US Verizon version and it works fine. But the i747 unlocked version is a dud. First and foremost there are no back or menu keys, either on the bezel or on the screen. There is just a single home button in the middle of the bottom bezel like on the iPad. The bottom bezel is metal. But Android isn't designed to just use a Home key as is the iPad. With Jelly Bean many of the Android applications have been updated to not rely on the back and menu keys. But even many of the updated apps haven't extended that functionality into the depths of their settings menus. It's easy to get stuck on a screen with this phone and have to kill the app in Settings, or with a Task Manager app to get back to a main app screen. Some app features are just not available since you can't get to their settings menus because there is no Menu key.The phone itself has some software problems. The screen periodically locks up. It's particularly annoying when trying to take a quick shot with the camera. To unlock the screen you have to turn the screen off and then back on. Occasionally you have to restart the phone.The camera is quite poor. The photos are totally washed out if there is any indirect sunlight on the subject. Midday with the sun overhead is fine. But if there is any sunlight coming in a window or door opening the photo is over exposed and useless. Of course low light photos are out of the question.I was ready to throw this phone against the wall and certainly replace it when I got home from travel. But it was stolen at the end of the trip. So good riddance. I've replaced it with a wonderful LG Optimus G for less than half the cost of the SIII. Samsung really fell down when they released this model of the SIII. It should never have gone out.

I suggest if you are interested in an Unlocked GSM Service Provider to look at this phone as your phone of choice. I also looked over the companies items and they carry over 500 items in stock and if the SGH-I747 is not your choice check out their many other phones.  I can not tell you anything about them since I only bought this I747, but I can assure you the business's Customer Support is excellent and if you have any problems they go above and beyond to make me happy, and I am sure they are great looking over all their reviews compared to purchases they have an outstanding raking.

It's 3.7 volts (original is 3.8v), doesn't have NFC (near field communication) which enables some key features, i.e. touching two phones (with NFC) together to transfer data, Google wallet, etc. Also, with phone off and charging to full then turning phone on, the battery always reads at 85%. The battery itself doesn't show Samsung. I thought it was odd that this this new galaxy s3 was getting worse battery life than my old galaxy s2, since it reportedly has better battery life and the battery is almost 1/3 larger than the s2.

Their representative even quoted that Samsung manufacturing is so perfect that there can be no manufacturing defect in any of their products. I am confused, why then give warranty on the phones or any of their products for that matter if their products are so defect free??They are demanding $170 again for the repair.

My mother (we got ours at the same time) is still using hers. I have since moved on to an S5.I have dropped it, carried it without a case, and rooted it in the time I have owned this device. I have been very lucky when dropping it and have only come away with minor chips to the chrome ring around the outside edge of the phone. With all that, it has not once given me an issue concerning any of the hardware pieces. I carry my phone in the same pocket as my keys. I had a case on it when I first purchase but later moved to not using one at all due to the poor design of the case. Since then (6-8 months), the screen has only acquired a few micro scratches that are only noticeable with the screen off and titled at the right angle.As far as the software goes, if you have the know how, root this device! I personally put the latest verson of cyanogenmod on mine and it works fantastically! All of my apps appear to open just as fast as current generation devices and I also have the latest version of Android.The only issue I have had from this phone is the headphone jack. I use mine on a daily basis and had worn mine out. The replacement part is fairly cheap on ebay ($5) and it only takes a screwdriver and ten minutes to swap out the damaged piece.I would highly recommend this device as a starter phone for younger people or even as an upgrade if you are not able to move to a current gen device.
