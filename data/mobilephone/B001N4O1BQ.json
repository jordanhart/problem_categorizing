{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for 2 years!", "Author": "A. L. Wallinger \"petite chica\"", "ReviewID": "RQIFWH9V0YNJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Samsung SGH-t629 for 2 years now (on the T-Mobile network, with myFaves) and I love it. I am ready to trade up, though, to the Samasung Behold and, as my third Samsung, I am sure it will be as well-made as my previous two. I love the sturdy slider design, the best part is it's durable but sleek. The big screen looks pretty and has great colors (plus it works as a mirror when turned off ;]). The camera could be better, of course, but it's sufficient for what I use it for. Only had a few glitches occasionally, that work themselves out. I've even dropped it in parking lots before and the screen hasn't cracked or anything. Just a few scratches on the back, that's it. I constantly slide it open and closed and it stands up to my nervous habit. I love the keypad too; it's not bulky at all so I like that. Good volume for the alarm and ringer (though I usually keep it on vibrate). The ringtones are a little cheesy, but that's to be expected. I don't even mind the default wallpapers so much (more variety than my previous Samsung, a Stripe). I like the music player too, for my t-zones ringtones, and I love the microSD memory card. I have like a 2GB memory card and I have so much memory available. Battery life is good, as long as you don't surf the web all day or play too many games. Menu is easy to understand, which is great. I like almost everything about this great little phone, I just want an upgrade!", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung T629 Phone", "Author": "A. Williams \"#1 grandmother\"", "ReviewID": "R37B2ZP5ZXOKS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over three years now.  I have never had any mechnical problems, ringing problems, camera problems.  I have even dropped it on several ocassions and it still workds.  The battery life could be a little longer.  It's not one of your touch tone phones but for someone who just wants a phone with not a lot of fancy frills it works just fine.  especially for senior citizens who cannot work all the new mechanical items.  Good phone", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horrendous Repair Turnaround", "Author": "Apopman", "ReviewID": "R2QYYB866B6JUP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My T629 broke after only a month of use.  The phone failed to ring on all incoming calls (electronic problem). I had to return the phone to samsung for repair.  It took 5 working days for the phone to arrive plus 15 working days to look/fix/replace the phone (basically stared at the phone so it can magically fix itself).  Then it took another 5 working days to have it shipped back. Essentially, I didn't have the phone for 1 month.  Word of advice, don't buy the phone or avoid samsung product unless you have extended warranty from the vendor for returns.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Software problem", "Author": "Prabin K. Rai", "ReviewID": "R365WUT6F2T3X7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used this phone for 2 years from Tmobile. Basically it is a very very simple type of phone without any sophisticated functions. Its good points are that it is very strong, reception is nice, and display is clear. But, its bad point is that it has a software problem. Alarm, schedules, reminders etc. do not work punctually. They work whenever they like. Sometimes not even single in a month, though the phone is set for daily alarm. I have been many times deceived by this phone regarding time matters. It has a serious software dysfunction. Even the games do not produce any sound, only vibration works. This phone is not good for texting, if you are a texting geek. I do not recommend anybody to buy this phone unless you don't have enough money.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001N4O1BQ"}}
