{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Intended to be a temporary replacement. Now it's permanent. Best phone I've ever had!", "Author": "kali dinh", "ReviewID": "R3W4NKA2Q4XR34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Got this phone to replace my broken iPhone. I intended it to be a temporary replacement but I'm keeping it! I love the sleek look of my old phone but definitely prefer android. There are way more apps and just freedoms in general. I play games, listen to music, social networking, etc.  My friends always ask where I got it. Also works with any SIM card as long as its GSM. Great battery life too.Cons: Ordering from over seas takes forever. If you can find an American dealer, order from them.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely the best unbranded phone on Amazon!", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RC3OMXNKOEJZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone for the price.  Durable, fast, and runs tons of apps.
