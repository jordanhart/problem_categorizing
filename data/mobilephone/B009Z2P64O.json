So I ordered this one for myself. Problem was, it came with problems. Blue tooth didn;t work. Phone would alwyas switch over to speaker when answering it. And the person who sold it, left all thier contacts, pictures, and videos on it.. So what I bought, was another persons phone who had problems. No wonder why they sold it. I will never but another person phone over the internet.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shipping takes to long", "Author": "Reaper", "ReviewID": "RNRH705K1AYD8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i ordered my parcel on Saturday the 14th and i selected the 1-3 day shipping and its understandable that its the weekend and USPS doesn't deliver on weekends, but 1-3 days would mean id get it Wednesday or Thursday and yet its still in NY. I ordered another item with standard shipping and will be receiving it tomorrow. So if your not in a rush to get your phones then i suggest the standard free shipping.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.49", "Features": "Works as New", "Name": "Huawei Pinnacle 2 QWERTY CDMA Cell Phone Black Metro PCS", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lLNAtuQ5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009Z2P64O"}}
