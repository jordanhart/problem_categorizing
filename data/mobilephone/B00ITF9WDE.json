(which take at least 2 more days compare those who live in mainland USA)2) Fast response my question via email (within 16 hours) and nice customer service. My question was the battery looks died and the customer representative say sorry they could not mail the battery due to local laws. Instead, they offer other solution to me, which make me feel so good. Later, I found out that the battery actually working (after I pulled the sticker on the battery, it still has small piece on the copper connector)Con:This model was released Fall 2012 and the plastic cover made me little hard to hold. Battery might not run more than 20 hours.Conclusion: the seller is responsible and the phone is affordable. Even though it did not lower much compared to its original price, I still recommend this phone from this seller.I will update this comment if anything occur.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery doesn't work.", "Author": "Luis A.

Also with 8gb of storage, a nice 5gb was still available after all the installed stuff which is still plenty of room (I'm coming off a phone with 512mb so 5gb for me is luxurious!). It was as advertised, but it came with android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean rather than ICS. This concerned me as there's been no mention of an official JB rom for the phone and all the information I dug up suggested there were a lot of problems with various JB versions from people rooting and installing alternate rom versions; issues ranged from camera issues to apps not working and many others, but as of this point everything seems to work and it does have the Google Play store so that's fine. The only thing I don't like so far is there are a lot of Chinese apps I simply cant use and can't be easily removed: such as assistant app similar to Siri that only speaks Chinese, there's an extra news app with no English setting, a search that at first I thought was the standard Google search widget but it goes to Baidu, this was rectified by removing the widget from the home screen and downloading the actual Google search from the Play store. In the end I still have a lot of room and coming from Android 2.3 a lot of features I had to download apps for are pre-installed: things like battery information, a note pad app, and a few other things that I couldnt fit on my old phone. Downside is some apps can't be moved to SD storage which seems ridiculous to hobble this feature, the button to move them does seem to exist so it's possible it might just be a compatibility issue with some apps.Setting up:I'm on T-mobile so it took a while to get all set up because I had to enter the APN information, there were some other hiccups like the internet didn't work at first but after clearing some cashe settings it seems to be running fine although there was one point where it wouldn't dial or receive calls despite claiming to have a 3-4 bar signal. I have gotten calls so I'm hoping it was just a one time issue and not indicative of my future with it. It doesnt have an app drawer which means ever app you download goes on the phones desk top but you can organist them into folders to minimize clutter. The phone also comes with a bunch of different themes for customizing it's look.Build:It's a quad-core phone supposedly running at 1.4ghz though I have not tested it that seems accurate from the smoothness of the interface. The audio coming out of the speakers was stunningly impressive when I first tested some ring tones... which brings me to an issue I had in that it seems to use my ring tone for EVERY alert, every time I got a voice mail it used the ring tone I set for phone calls I may need to download a ring tone app to specify it's context settings, this could be an issue related to the unofficial Jelly bean OS it's running or it could just be an awkward setting I haven't accurately changed yet... I dunno. The phone is lighter than my old one and is a pleasure to hold the front and rear facing cameras 1.3mp and 8mp respectively are pretty high quality (okay again my last phones cameras were .3 and 5mp, sooo...). Battery life with modern phones you're lucky if you can get a full day out of them without having to recharge halfway through the day. With the screen set to midway brightness and with moderate use it will last a whole day, but it initially starts loosing percentage points so fast that you'll always be worried you wont make it of the day. You will, but it might be by the skin of your teeth if you're a heavy user of smart phone features. (constant internet surfing, texting, and media) which is a shame because the 720p screen looks great.For the time being those are my first impressions of the phone. I'll wait a week to see if anything changes my opinion and I'll edit accordingly with new info should it be warranted.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I paid for", "Author": "Brian R.", "ReviewID": "RH3TQV89WE5JN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone arrived inabout 12 days, nice display and easy to setup.
