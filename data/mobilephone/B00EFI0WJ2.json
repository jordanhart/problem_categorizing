This is my first smartphone, (My friends got tired of me messing with theirs!) and I couldn't have made a better choice.  The only drawback I have is the small inbuilt memory, which frankly, is no hardship.  The sharpness of the screen colors and graphics blew my mind.  Now my friend want to play around with MY phone.  The sound is clear and perfect.  Apps perform smoothly and with no issues.I would definitely recommend this product.

It has an unremoveable \"playApp\" store, which Windows Defender has identified as malware/spyware. Constant buzzing noise when making calls, as reported by a few other reviewers. Completely unusable and possibly spying on user.  I have NEVER had this many issues with a phone. Sent it back after 2 days. I feel this HEAVILY modded version of Android (not to mention the device itself, which came with parts of the word \"android\" scratched out) was created by a desperate hermitted programmer in his mother's basement.
