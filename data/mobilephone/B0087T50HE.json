There is an LG issued firmware update to Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, this does not void your warranty. I updated in 5 minutes using SmartFlash. This makes the interface faster and more intuitive, too many improvements to list. It really breathes new life into the device and leapfrogs many in the market.Battery life is suitable for my usage.Another major consideration was the network bands. In Trinidad and Tobago carriers use 850/1900 bands for voice and data respectively. It's important to note that the black version of this phone does not meet those requirements. Only the white will work.In total it worked out to 1500 TTD including skybox costs.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "satisfecho", "Author": "Wilber Bernay", "ReviewID": "R3E0N95GBHR2SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelene el producto mejor calidad buena se\u00f1al bueno manejo de internet responsables equipo llego en buen estado y llego lo pedido gracias", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "My son likes so much", "Author": "Nahren Moran", "ReviewID": "R3C5IPHXEKYKO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for my son, he said is wonderful, it is easy to use it, and is so many apps like samsung, nokia or another like this", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can be annoying", "Author": "D.

LG support was a pain to deal with regarding this (would not support international phones, etc.). I kept trying to work it out because the phone looked so good for the price, but really after a month it was clear that it was a malfunctioning piece of junk. Luckily the amazon folks were very cool and took it back.OLD & Inaccurate review:Of course, it isn't the most cutting edge, but it has a great looking screen and, for the price, it certainly does enough.Cautions:1. It does not come with a very current version of Android, but this link gives directions on how to update it: [...]2. No SD memory card provided, you will need to order your own, but these are very cheap so its not a deal-breaker.3. I received an international charger (I am in the US).  Its not a big deal because the phone allows for USB charging too, so maybe its a bonus for when I travel?I haven't had the phone for long, so I'll share more when  I can.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice product", "Author": "Fabiana Martinez", "ReviewID": "R3FURK21BN2LXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great phone!
