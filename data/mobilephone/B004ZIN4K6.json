Metro PCS has very few quality phones. However, this is definitely one of the best. The phone comes with an touch screen and fold out keyboard. Perfect for you cell phone needs. For those of us who aren't ready to go to the droid or iphone. The LG Banter is a wonder compromise that maintains cool features while still being very easy to use.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Used and abused banter", "Author": "ozzy101", "ReviewID": "RS3DA9ZZYMWOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "LG banter was poorly packaged and obviously used. It also arrived without a manual. The phone now serves as an ugly paper weight as the touch screen no longer works. 90 dollars for two weeks worth of phone use; never again!", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can buy this item from metro pcs website for $59", "Author": "amanda", "ReviewID": "RH3RPFY7IUHH3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Can buy this item from metro pcs website for $59.
