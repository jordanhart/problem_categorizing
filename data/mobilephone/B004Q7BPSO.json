E. Delage \"Rock Coinsure\"", "ReviewID": "R1UD6DJCGDBE48", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought 2 blackberry storms. They were the quad-band international phones. You can use them as a basic phone in foriegn countries that have phone services. however, since Verizon is the chief supplier of these, they are all no good for e-mailing, texting from country to country. You cannot get internet nor any mail services with these. You would have to go back to the USA, go to a verizon dealer, sell your soul with a 2-3 year contract with very limited servies and it MIGHT work out of the USA. Do not buy these if you are  to be in Asia, or Europe. These phones are nice and full of good stuff, but, unless you use them in a large city in the USA, you might as well have a Walmart pay as you go phone.  My first one would not hold a charge and it would actually ruin the battery in the phone once you put it in a charger. The second phone was used as my alarm clock in the cradle and when i was awoke at 3am with my phone making weird noises and the alrm and ringing tones randomly going off. I restarted it and it just said it had a program failure and kep ton shutting on and off.  So, as much as I used to like Blackberry products, I will not do it again. They are worthless in heat, cold and dusty. They have good reception when you can find it. If you are in the military or are a contractor and you work in a war zone, these phones are a waste. just get s set of cheap walkie talkies and talk to folks.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Deffective not new", "Author": "AP", "ReviewID": "R19I2DQ20QHA51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

For the price it worths, no big complaints. If you want something better please buy a Galaxy or an Iphone and spend $300-$500 and stop crying.Pros:1- Panel touchscreen. It means that you must click the screen when select your button. Less posibilities of dial or touch something by mistake.2-Big screen 3.25\" with touch slide menu3-Metal back battery cover4-3.2 Megapixel camera with a hi bright flash makes good pics.5-Can easily install almost the most popular bb apps even with low memory capacity for apps6-1GB extra memory for files. and also has a mini sd slot able to expand to 16GB on external mem.7-3G network enhaced.Cons:1- And worst. NO WiFi . The next version (9550 Storm 2) has it2- Bad video streaming capacity. There is almost no apps to watch online videos.3- Small app memory capacity4- Awful autocomplete feature that makes you write things that you don't want.5-RIM servers dependant. If they go down or out , your online capabilities goes down.Conclusion. It is a good BB phone and it worths for the price. If you want something like an Iphone, buy an Iphone, if you want something like a BB Torch buy a BB Torch, if you want something like a  Samsung Galaxy, please buy a Samsung Galaxy.
