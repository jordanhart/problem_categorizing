{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My First Sony Ericsson, A review from a Nokia Fanboy", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R3MNFUQWJ7HJR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the \"my computer\" icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved \"Disc2phone\" and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes \"Stereo Widening\" impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "The iPhone Alternative", "Author": "Prasanna Karmarkar \"Peeker Marker\"", "ReviewID": "R1KYBV12KJZ11Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Going from an old Nokia 6200 (which had great call quality and was ahead of its times)  to a Moto Razr I suffered the torments of usability hell. No memory, no headphone jacks, terrible address book, substandard camera, terrible alarm clock, etc etc.The day I got my digits on the W810i (i for international, unlocked quad band) was a happy day for me. Now, one year into using it I can expertly outline the pros and cons, and authoritatively issue bouquets and brickbats.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hot -* Great battery life. I don't measure this in terms of hours and minutes but the reality of how often I had to charge. I use the phone quite a lot for listening to music especially and have never run out of charge when on the road. On days of low usage I have gone 3 days without a recharge, but topping up for 1 hour everyday is all you need. With the Razr I was constantly being stranded with a dead phone.* Superior voice quality - as distinct from CALL quality, which thanks to Cingular sucks like a vaccuum cleaner!* Walkman quality music - I use iPod earbuds for a good reason, sometimes a Sony MDR 7506- More later.* An expandable Sony ProDuo memory slot of upto 2GB.I bought the phone with 512 MB and have not needed to upgrade yet.* A feature rich 2 MP camera with flash, white balance controls, macro mode, night mode, zoom, resolution settings, and effects settings.  This is quite adequate for point and click oppotunities - but also great for video, I bring out my Rebel XT 8MP only for more \"artistic\" photography.* A great FM radio. Works really well, although it does require the customary earphone-jack extension that also works as an antenna. I say \"customary\" because I don't think there is any phone that can play the radio without having to attach the headset cord.* The proprietary audio jack (Sony Ericsson only) actually ends in a generic RCA type stero headphone plug! This saved the phone and allowed me to jettison their earbud in favour of the iBud, or my Hi-Fi studio monitor when I feel like it. You can easily switch from whatever you're listening to -- the radio, the MP3 player or the video player and take a phone call by clicking a button. The song is paused, and will continue where you left off after ending the phone call. The iPhone is trumpeting this feature, but its been a part of the W810i for over a year.* Has an MIDP 2.0 mobile java O/S, which means you can download any and every java app. I use the Opera Mobile browser instead of the packaged Sony browser and google maps which are are also a free j2ME download - *no more paper printouts for me*. I also use a mobile app from cricinfo.tv for streaming cricket scores, and the pre-loaded Music Mate which playes basic guitar chords and also has a pitch pipe for tuning musical instruments.I am a non-starter in video games so i won't comment, except to say i tried the \"JC does Texas\" preloaded game - it was fun, but did not convert me into a gamer ;-)* The Address book is really excellent. It has a full featured contact list system like a vCard that includes full address and multiple phone numbers for the same contact. In theory the calendar and address books can be synched with Outlook if you download the Sony Ericsson PC Suite and connect use Outlook to synch calendar and contacts. I have no reason to believe this won't work, except my work place will not allow personal devices to be installed or synched up on the work machine. At home I don't use Outlook, so I'm missing out on all the calendar and reminder functionality* A nice alarm clock that lets you select days of the week you find\" alarming\".So my alarm does not go off on weekends, then comes back on every day of the week.This is a big improvement over the old way where you had to manually set the alarm for each day.You snooze, you lose.* I found this out very recently - but the phone plays videos appreciably. There is a minor geek factor to this, but well worth it. You can take pretty much any video file you have - from P2P, DVDs, flash, etc and convert it to the 3gp format. I use a free universal encoder that's quite a wonder. Its called SUPER and you will find it at e-rightsoft - For example I watched the final episode of Heroes on my phone in a flight. Downloaded from bittorrent, encoded to 3gp to a 176*144 format that took all of 90MB.  You can watch full length movies doing this, but the movie player functions like bookmarking are sorely missing for long files. If you don't watch the full movie at a stretch, you'll spend minutes simply forwarding to the correct spot the next time.THIS IS HUGE -- you can take any YouTube video with you on this phone. Yeah, yeah its a two step process but which one of you is busy saving the world anyway. Get a firefox plugin for downloading YouTube videos as .flv files (flash videos), then use SUPER to encode into 3gp. Voila! -- I have Rihanna's Umbrella and Fergie's Bumps accompany me on all my rides.* The phone is recognized a USB plug-and-play drive. Need I say more?This is very useful, because its easy to move files and also charge it anywhere I have a computer with USB! Forget DRM, everyone is going away from that anyway. Also, Apple's way of requiring iTunes and having to register a device by deviceID before using it, that is way too restrictive.My kingdom for USB P'nP freedom!* W810 has Bluetooth and Infra Red ports. Use them for file transfers, synching or for headsets.* An email client that is configurable for POP3 so I get my gmail, no problems. This is not a business phone so there is none, and never will be support for corporate email. Its easy enough getting to your personal email though, even without POP. Use the browser, doh!* pretty standard but worth mentioning - has voice dialing, that can save you in some situations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not -* No WiFi !* No GPS receiver. This means that when you use google maps you have to manually figure out where you are, then also check if you are sticking to the route. I have had no problems with this myself, but could be incovenient for some.* The T9 texting system is disappointing. The Razr did it much better. There is no multi-select word completion, and there is not auto-add to dictionary any time you type out a word that was not in the dictionary. The process of adding your own short forms, cute names and whatnot is very manual and laborious.  Also, the auto completion with the Razr showed multiple word possiblities in a multi-select as you typed (like the AJAX javascript lookups in gmail adress) so that meant you could really fly through the message.* An open chat interface called MyFriends (under the Messages menu) using which you can log on to all your chat clients at once - AIM, yahoo, msn and IRC - possibly google chat but i've not cracked that nut yet.The setup is strictly for nerds/geeks/professionals - an average user could never set this up. After spends hours on many forums I was able to set it up. You need the use of a free third party registration system:  Yamigo to create a chat profile to which you can add your chat accounts.  When you create your MyFriends profile in the W810, you need to provide the URL as the server and select the Allow Connection tab to \"Any Network\" or else this won't work.MyFriends is a very ambitious concept and works in essence but fails in usability.It keeps the internet connection open always because it relies on an HTTP service. When you lose connection it logs you out of all your chat systems, requiring you to re-login. PAINFUL. It also drains the battery a lot. Sony would have done better to do what the Razr did, have an AIM chat client onboard that connects directly to the AIM server, so you did not have to use a third party http service.The best option is to set up the AIM and yahoo accounts to forward to cell phone when not signed in. Works like a charm.* The phone is capable of playing streams really - but bleeds to death on Cingular's cutting \"EDGE\".Hear me ye all - Cingular is the one thing that can kill Apple's iPhone. The situation can only be rescued if Jobs takes it over and refurbishes their network from the ground up.I have NOT found a realplayer for java mobile yet, so it is really a player problem.I'm sure there's an open source java project out there that can play all the streams.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shot -* The earbuds from Sony are pure product suicide. They are so bad that I could barely hear the music and calls. If I had not tried the iBuds I may have hated this phone, only because of Sony's lazily and badly produced earbuds. That would have been a real shame because this is really quite an instrument.* browsing pictures on the phone is painfully slow.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What you got -  The W810i is already more and does more than the iPhone will ever be, or do. Hi-Fi music, first class camera, great voice quality (when the signal exists!), calendar, addressbook, reminders, notes, alarms, email, SMS, MMS, bluetooth, video recording and playback. The iPhone will conquer the world anyway, because  it has sex appeal and ease of use like never before. Contextual buttons that come and go, basically an expanded interactive menu system. Brilliant breakthrough in usability. For those who don't want to spend the big bucks, you can get all that and more in less than half the price here.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony claws back the portable media market", "Author": "Mr. Cj Jothi", "ReviewID": "R16KYNBJXM28K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't lie, I'm a Sony fan. Have been for years. When I was at school, I would take the Sony catalogue with me and look at each of the hundreds of products and admire the constantly evolving designs and technologies this company offers. Sad, I know.There are two things that made Sony what it is today; televisions and Walkmans. Their TVs were and still are today the standard by which all TVs are measured by. And Walkmans, well, they revolutionised the way people listened to music. And of course they are now good, if not the best, at many other things, from video gaming to professional video cameras used by James Cameron and Michael Mann!The company however has always annoyed a number of people by unnecessarily introducing proprietary formats. Some good, some bad, but ONE company alone will always find it hard to win public support with a format if it is not supported by other manufacturers. This was highlighted by the company's biggest EVER mistake, encapsulated in one word: ATRAC.Sony were slow to the MP3 market. In the beginning they shunned it, developing the MD and Discman lines whilst Napster was taking on the world. It took computer companies like Creative and Apple to introduce MP3 players whilst the likes of Panasonic, Sony and Philips failed to embrace such a simple concept. Sony were so complacent that they built their own audio compression format, ATRAC, which could only be made by Sony's own Sonic Stage software, and played by Sony's hardware. The software was absolutely appalling, and did not really improve on MP3's already strong compression rate. It was cumbersome to use, and next to the hip image of an emerging iTunes, and the ever improving iPod, Apple  did not just overtake Sony, they pretty much obliterated them out of a market they dominated. Heck, they invented the portable audio market.Come 2005 and Sony execs are looking at themselves wondering what happened to their once-guranteed hundreds of millions a year. They quietly admitted to themselves that they blew it. But their other markets were thriving. Look at the PSPs, the PS2 and upcoming PS3. Look at their Bravia HD displays. Look at their groundbreaking HDV cameras. Sony are kicking butt, but Discmans and MD players are no longer a top 5 option for ANYONE. It is either an iPod video, an iPod shuffle, an iPod nano (get my point) or maybe, for those somewhat bored, a Creative whatchamacallit!But they have found a way to use the Walkman brand, by using cutting edge technology and simple, ingenious design, and incorporating a music player in their line of phones.The W810i is one of the more recent additions to an ever-expanding line of sublime phones and I've got to say \"it is amazing!\"This phone, unusually so from Sony, allows a great deal of flexbility in terms of how the user can import and export data. The phone boasts a memory stick port, which is such a massive feature, because this means you can replace the standard 512MB stick with a 2GB stick (4GB is now available, but let prices fall before you buy one). 2GB!!! We may no longer be impressed by such a figure, but may I remind you that with an average 4 minute, 4 MB MP3 we are talking a ridiculous 500 song/45 albums capacity. That's an iPod nano my friend! Hook up your phone via USB and two drives pop up on your computer, the memory stick and the phone's internal drive, and just like your own HDs, you simply drag and drop data from folder to folder. It's brilliant, and obviously lends itself well as a USB stick for students. This means you can use it with PC and Macs, unlike an iPod, and it is not restricted to working with ONE program, unlike an iPod, although iTunes does rock!So just how good is the Walkman feature? Well, it is very similar to the iPod interface, and whilst it may not boast the brilliant iPod navigation wheel it still has some effectively positioned buttons that allow volume change, starting and pausing music and skipping back and forth tracks. They are in the perfect place, and I commend the designers, because this is where the phone truly excels; ergonimics. With such a vast array of features, it must take a pretty smart bunch of people to make it anything but a hassle to use. The devoted Walkman button transports you to Artists/Albums/Playlists etc etc. You can change the equalizer, you can send your tracks via Bluetooth/Infrared to other people, you can basically have fun.Sound wise? It sounds damn good. Is it hi-fidelity? No, not by a long shot (but then, neither are iPods!). It comes with good earphones, but I like good sound, so will use my best phones, and encode at a slightly lower compression to cull the best performance from this hardware. It does not sound as good as an iPod, but this is a very personal opinion. The differences are marginal, but this, unlike an iPod, does so much MORE!A test of whether this is a direct competitor with an iPod is whether, if you took away all the other features and were left with just the Walkman feature, would it be good enough, and the answer is yes. It can improve. It would be great if Apple would allow iTunes to work with other players, because integrating the W810i with iTunes would be phenomenal. The W810i could improve by showing the music artwork, having MORE control over how your music is played, and I would argue to somehow make the menu less cluttered, although it is already well designed. The small details Apple lend their products are great, so if Sony could change the font or anything, to make it a LITTLE bit more streamlined I think it would be more or less perfect!. A great extension to this would be allowing Walkman phones to be dockable in cars like the iPod is, so drivers can control the songs through their stereo. Basically it is a great product, and Sony needs to think big like Apple so it can really stop people buying iPods! They have the quality, but they now need to work hard with PR and accessories to convince people who are set on buying an iPod to reconsider.Next up is the 2 MP phone, which, for a phone, is remarkable (and is now no longer the biggest, with Nokia's N80 offering 3MP). Compared to the first batch of dedicated 2 MP cameras, this wipes the floor with most of 'em. It does not come close to any dedicated digi cameras on the market today, but I took some pictures this past weekend that were full of colour and detail. It is impressive stuff, and serves perfectly well for a number of applications. Yes it is grainy, no there is no optical zoom, but it has a macro feature, which is amazing. Noise is naturally evident, and I won't be taking my holiday photos with it, but considering where we were two years ago with camera phones it has to be said it no longer is a gimmick. In a year or two cameras on phones will be able to take pictures comparable to point and shoot digicams, and that my friends is a fact. Please look here at a picture I took with the w810i! ([...] Looks good, doesn't it! The phone comes with flash, white balance, macro, panorama, nightshot, and a number of other features. The video camera is subpar, so I guess another year or two will mean DV quality cell phones coming our way (maybe not, lets not get excited!).Another massive plus is the RDS radio. Reception seems to vary, but once it hooks onto a strong signal it sounds very good, and if you have RDS services it will show you the name of the station. That's another one over the iPod!As for the phone. Well you got simple navigation towards your address book. Text messaging and calling is straightforward. The person on the other end of the line sounds good. You have a lot of detail on your Call History. It is so easy to make calling on mobile phones to be frustrating, much like Sony's earlier phones. Thankfully they have not taken anything for granted and made this an effortless task for users.Sony's unsurpassed battery life lasts for hours upon hours. How they do it I will never know!The screen is bright, and the phone saves battery power by reducing the strength of the LCD light based on the ambient light.The phone is very modern, has a good weight, and unlike the Motorola RAZR, is not uncomfortable to hold in you hand (sure, it looks good, but I do want to HOLD a phone sometimes!). The phone numbers are small, but I really cannot expect anything different when you consider just what these designers are having to pull off.I wish I could comment on the internet capabilities of this camera but my service provider still charges too much for surfing the web via my phone, and I find the whole experience a bit boring and slow. Mobile internet still has some way to go before it can really be an attractive proposition for me HOWEVER, the RSS reader function will certainly serve me well if I want a quick headline from the BBC website.You see, when you have a camera, a phone, a Walkman, internet, text messaging, radio, games etc all in one package, that because of consumer demand needs to be small, be light, pack in a colour screen, long lasting battery and removable media, then you have to wonder how it will all work together. Sony have done brilliantly here, and as technology becomes more and more advanced (smaller, lighter, quicker, brighter etc) phones will continue to evolve. They are clearly the best place to find the latest technology, and the W810i may not be the absolute cutting edge, but it is certainly the king for the moment. Apple better watch out. Sony want their crown back. Thankfully there will be only one true winner, and that's us, the consumers!", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "I have owned many phones, this is the best...", "Author": "M. Miles \"briefcandle\"", "ReviewID": "R2F0OQUKV862CB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and it should be for this price.This is my first review; I just had to add my two cents after reading the previous review.I have used my phone with Cingular all over NYC, Long Island and Colorado.  All I can say is that the reception is better than it was for my two previous phones, a Nextel Blackberry 7510 and most recently, a Verizon Blackberry 7130e.I bought this phone after using a friend's cheapo pay-as-you-go Sony phone. I am a harsh critic of poorly implemented technology, but very quickly recognized that Sony Ericsson makes great phones with lots of very thoughtful features and, most importantly, pairs those features with the most intuitive user interface I have ever seen.I am an early adopter of new technologies going back to the very first CD players, the Apple Newton and First Generation 5gig Ipod.  Believe me, Sony has a real winner here with the Walkman cell phone line.  It sounds great (as good as your source material) and the software for loading songs  was refreshingly simple to install and use.And, oh, the camera is pretty good.  If you are going to an important event, it is no replacement for a dedicated digital camera with a full fledged flash.  But for impromptu moments, it takes very good pictures in daylight.Love the phone, would recommend without hesitation.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "A great all in one phone, mp3/video player, and camera.", "Author": "Optimus Prime", "ReviewID": "R2VYR9J7X9MOGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "9/19/06 Update. Since my first review, I'm still enjoying this phone and have added some other fun things to do with it. Besides the obvious music and watching video, I hook up this phone to my big stereo's auxilliary RCA inputs via the 35mm earpone cable and voila!, the sound rocks and is very portable especialy at parties. Speaking of parties, I save some encoded karaoke video clips with scrolling song text and minus one music to my phone then plug to the stereo and BAM! instantly I have a portable karaoke machine in my hands. Friends view the song on the phone screen as it plays while they sing. Mic is separate though but boy the fun never stops. Just some ways to improvise to have fun and this phone lets me do that. Try it...I'd been shopping for many months now for a good phone and a portable mp3 player. After careful research among carrier phones, reading tech reviews, and among other brands out there including the ipods, W810i wins highly because I love listening to portable music plus the phone/camera/FM radio/expandable memory integration and yes the unique MegaBass all in one just fits my kind of need. Truly an audiophile's phone. Of course there are many similar capable phones or dedicated units out there but not quite like the W810i. Ipods and RAZR pale in comparison...in my opinion. W810i is just SUPERB. Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW. I have this phone for more than a month now and NOT a drop call occured. I have T-Mobile service with T-Zone for internet access which is fast in my experience since the EDGE GPRS is supported mostly in my area of travel. Downloading files and viewing websites was a fast treat. I enjoy this phone so much that I decided to upgrade the included removable 512mb memory stick duo to a Sandisc 4GB Ultra II Pro Duo just so I can store more than enough of my favorite mp3, video clips, and one full length movie too for my entertainment. Here are my own observations of this phone:PROS:1. Mega Bass. Adds more thunderous punch to the low frequencies of music and boy I love this feature. Tip: invest on a good quality heaphone/earphone for it makes a big difference folks in sound quality preferably those that have bass tube or bass enhancement designs.2. A built in 5 channel Equalizer and other audio settings to suit your music taste.3. A dedicated Walkman button for easy acces to music. Walkman menu and the overall phone menu is very easy to use and navigate around your music and other phone folders.4. 2 Megapixel Camera with autofocus is a big plus compared to none.5. Camera features includes:  - selectable white balance  - select between video mode(realtime action) and normal camera  - self-timer, effects(sepia, b&w;, negative, solarize)  - shoot Mode has normal, panorama, frames, macro, night  mode and burst  - self-portrait mirror on back6. Easy to use tactile keypad buttons, center navigation D-pad, and has T9 text assist for messaging.7. Speakerphone is loud, Quadband GSM, bluetooth, infrared, FM stereo with channel save presets for your favorite stations.8. Video clips/movies in 3gp/mp4 format can be viewed verticaly or widescreen. Some games can be played also in widescreen.9. A decent LED that acts like a penlight is helpful in finding lost keys in the dark. This light is helpful also to brigthen up your subject at night when taking pictures but it does not seem to function like a flash when you hit the shutter button.10. Phone call quality so far for me is great. Clear crisp  voice exchange reception from the other end with no static noise.11. Battery life overall is very good even in long minutes of music listening and watching a few video clips.12. EDGE GSM gives you fast internet access if supported by your carrier.13. Operating software is fast and makes navigation between menus or retrieving content very responsive.14. Expandable Memory slot. A BIG BIG plus folks especially if you want to add more memory. I have 4GB and it works.15. While playing music, it will stop during an incoming call then resumes once you hang up. Nice feature.16. Has music mode where phone functions are turned off. A plus when traveling in air or inside a hospital.17. Basic amenities like notepad, calculator, calendar, clock, alarm, SMS/MMS, text, email, voicedial, phonebook, contact....and the rest you can read on the specs.18. Some notables:  - Video DJ - create video sequences  - Melody Composer/Music DJ - create your own ringtones  - Has some imbedded games/ringtones/themes already  - Disc2phone software included for music transfer from PC  - During music transfer or while plugged via the USB cable  to the PC, phone is charging.  - Downloadable ringtones, games, themes, and wallpaper are  available from SonyEricsson.com of which some are free.  - A dedicated shortcut key directs you to a menu of your  commonly used features on the phone.  - Supports Opera Mini web browser which I think is much  better than the default Access NetFront Web Browser.  - gives you option where to save files between phone memory  or the memory stick.  - phone status setting gives you up front information on the  remaining memory capacity, battery life, and profiles.CONS:1. Ear speaker volume may be too low in crowded noisy place.2. Carrier dependent features like downloading ringtones or games may not be supported yet by this phone as expected but there is always a work around if you know how.3. Pixelation is more noticeable on my video clips if I switch to widescreen. Understandably expected but sad nonetheless.4. Automatic standby offscreen is a good feature to conserve power but can be very annoying at times when you're still viewing the screen. I'm still trying to figure out if it can be adjusted at all. Sony are you listening?5. No camera lens cover. No biggie for me since I have a Krusell Leather Case around the phone however its still a minus. I've seen people mod this phone and put a K750 back plate as lens cover.6. No dedicated earphone slot. Must use first the supplied cable adapter to hook up.Overall the phone is great and user friendly. It meets most of my expectations in ease of use, common useful features, and of good quality. Just know that if you are tech savy, you can do many things on this phone that may seem limiting to others on average. You may hear complaints from early users a month or two ago about drop calls but this had been fix already or can be fix by updating the software easily from the manufacturer's website. It is also rumored that Cingular might carry this phone later this year. If I may brag a little, some online reviews give W810i as one of the Editor's top choice for cellphone. It is also one of the popular cellphones in asia and still continues to grab attention worldwide. So far W810i can be found on online retailers and third party dealer stores. Getting it unlocked by itself with no carrier plan is very expensive. Dont' do that unless money is not an issue. Get it cheaper with a plan or wait for Cingular..if ever. I know the wait is such a drag. Better yet if you can't wait, grab this phone and avail of Cingular or T-Mobile services now...it still works.Finally, if you love music or listening to tunes on the go, or better yet be able to watch video clips, watch movie(I do), browse the internet, play 3D games, take pictures, and most importantly make and received phone calls, then you're going to love this phone. Its simply loaded with fun stuff at your disposal.

Just a heads up to everyone looking to upgrade their memory.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "My first Sony Ericsson, A Review from a Nokia Fanboy", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R3BK3YMJWGWFX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the \"my computer\" icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved \"Disc2phone\" and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes \"Stereo Widening\" impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nothing can touch a Sony Ericsson phone.", "Author": "Azurestrangelove \"Life in the So-Called Space...", "ReviewID": "R26KKL0QOZ8C3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an already dedicated Walkman phone user(w600i)and converted SE afficianado, the w810i was an easy choice for me when facing the dilemna of having to find a worthy replacement for my beloved w600i(Which is no longer being produced.)Walkman phones are not only chocked full of quality features, well made, loaded with the extremely quick and user friendly SE interface, but also extremely easy on the eyes. And besides, it's a WALKMAN phone, complete with Sony's own Mega Bass trademark. It simply doesn't get any cooler than this.Rumour has it that Cingular will be releasing this phone sometime soon, but I found myself too impatient to wait and went along and got the unlocked version to use on my Cingular service. For anyone who has considered buying an unlocked phone but is nervous(I was,) I can most honestly tell you that SE makes it painless to set your phone on your network. You simply go to the SE website and answer a few questions about the phone, and they send you everything you need in a text message which contains special software for your carrier which installs itself. It is also beneficial to buy unlocked phones because sometimes service providers cripple some of the features and capabilities when 'branding' the phones to them and adding their own software. Also, sometimes the carrier's software can cause problems with the phone, which was rumoured to be the case with the w600i, which would often crash unexpectedly.Onto the phone. I was astonished when I saw just how small and cute the w810 is. It's size and width is about comparable to an ipod mini, and certainly lives up to it's \"ipod killer\" nickname since it has dedicated music buttons and can store up to 2gb(4gb in the future) of music(the w810i comes with a 512mb memory stick pro duo, NOT micro, which is what a lot of other mp3 phones have.)The camera is absolutely pristine at 2mp's and has a lot of cool effects. The radio is also extremely well done and lets you select preset stations and has RDS, which not only displays the station's name, but also the artist information and tracklisting for the current song(when available, as it's up to the station to provide that info.)You can use mp3's as ringtones, message alerts, and even as your alarm clock sound. Another neat little feature is that the keypad has a light sensor that automaticly brightens or dims it's light, depending on the amount of light in the room. As expected, the internet connection is flawless and lightning quick, and the bluetooth capabilities are all present and work beautifully. Plus, when you connect the phone to your PC, the phone and memory card are recognized as mass storage drives that are listed as \"Phone\" and \"Memory Card,\" so you don't have to go out of your way to try to locate the devices on your PC. Special software is included but you don't even really need it, as I simply drag the files and drop them into the appropriate spot and it copies itself automaticly. I have no problems with midi, wav, or windows media files being put onto the phone, and as for itunes, you can also drag and drop them too, but I've noticed that some of the files are recognized and playable on the phone, and some are not; it's somewhat spotty with files in that format, but afterall, this isn't an itunes phone and what doesn't work in itunes format, I'll simply convert back to wma. Obviously, the 20mb of storage on the phone is mainly for use when adding themes, images or games, while larger files can be stored on the memory card. Of course, there are so many other little tricks and features that I haven't even discovered yet.Gripes? Not many! Afterall, this is a Sony Ericsson phone, which has every feature imaginable and cutting edge technology. My only disappointment from coming from the w600i is that the phone is a candybar, so it can't make cute little sounds when opened, and it doesn't have three speakers like the w600i(only one speaker,) so there is no stereo widening on this one(although I suspect this was a deliberate move in order to get us to buy the portable mini speakers{MPS-60} separately. Mine are on their way as we speak.) Of course, these are nitpicky little things...So, put down those Razrs and Chocolates and buy yourself a phone that really is a \"toy,\" because you'll be playing with this one endlessly.", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Have I told you lately...", "Author": "A.

It came with a 512 Memory Stick duo card and I have well over 100 songs which I put on it using the included software.  It has a 2MP camera which is better than most phones have (although, I think Nokia has a 3MP one).  The radio works well, although the earbuds are hard to use when you get sweaty at the gym (or at least for me...they keep falling out)The camera is a nice to have feature because I can't very well take my huge clunky, professional camera with me when I go to the Irish Pub down the street.  The 2MP camera is a quality camera and more than enough if you want to make 3x5 prints or upload the pictures on your blog.  The screen has good colors which are vivid and bright.  You do have some control over the quality of pictures that you take, too.  You can adjust the ISO, macro and the powerful lamp also doubles as a flash (ok, itz not great, but it works)  You can also switch to night mode as well.The phone itself is solid and comfortable to hold.  The buttons are easy to reach and very intuitive.  There is a feature that allows you to easily set up your phone.The MP3 player is just as good as an iPod (which I don't use anymore since I got this phone) and the external speakers are really great.  There is only a single button to push to turn on the player.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this phone and I'm glad that I purchased it.

Motorola phones like the SLVR and the RAZR are slick and feature-packed but they have a horrible interface, the non-US carrier supported versions are horrible to set up in the US and they lack a lot of features. Nokia is the opposite, nice user interface -possibly the best- but a downgrade in design and slickness. Enter the Sony Ericsson. This phone has everything: Feature packed, all the features work, easy to set up, friendly user interface and eye-catching looks. Before this phone I had an international version of the SLVR, which I use on the T-Mobile network and I was very frustrated with it (didn't recognize voicemails, only the sync feature worked with Bluetooth on my Mac, couldn't browse the Internet and some buttons were wasted on features not available in the US), no such problems with the W810i. It works with the network as good as any supported phone. The Walkman mobile interface works like a dream. I'm surprised by the quality of the pictures, which is similar to early Cyber-shot models. If I had to criticize anything about it would be the flash, which is not really a flash that goes off when you take a picture, but a light you turn on manually. I would have liked the lens to be covered for protection and hooking the headphones with a normal plug and not the Cell phone's proprietary jack. For the money, this is a phone that can almost replace your snapshot and your .mp3 player, so I consider it a bargain.

Motorola's asthetical appeal and occasionally superior features always dominated my phone purchases, moving from the v60 to v878 to a668 to v3 the last 4 or 5 years. Most recently, I became fed up with my v3's lack of capabilities.I changed to this SE W810 and I am thrilled to own it. First off, the 2MP camera blows away the old razr v3 vga cam.  Plus it is very intuitive to use since you hold the phone a way you would hold one of those disposable cameras.  The memory stick allows me to store as many pictures (and music) as I need. It plays music flawlessly, arguably better than my iRiver stand alone music player. The phone features everything and every convenience you might need.MOST IMPORTANTLY, I love this phone because of the detail in the design of the operating system. Hats off to Sony, seriously. It is incredibly easy to use. Understanding the functionality of the menus is so intuitive you can pick one up having never used an SE phone and have no problems doing what you want the very first time around despite needing to use the phone's long list of capabilities. Whenever an advanced function is needed, it is explained by a short succinct popup info message.The integration of the walkman features and the phone feature is amazing. The headset is one to be admired, serving as a radio antenna, microphone for handsfree use, and stereo sound for the walkman. While playing the walkman, you can receive calls by pushing a button on the headset, the phone knows to stop the music and take the call. Microphone has absolutely no distortion. You can also keep the music on while using the phone's functions like the calendar and the phone book. It will display the song in one line that appears on the top. Just incredible. The walkman allows you to build playlists using the phone. The easy access walkman buttons work flawlessly in line with phone functions, the play/pause button and the orange walkman button.This thing is just incredible, now I'm just worried about destroying the headset and scratching the camera when I bring it around, but that really shouldn't be SE's concern, it is really mine.Buy this, 10 out of 10 any day of the week. Don't be afraid of it's inferior exterior looks to phones like the SLVR L7 or SE K800 or Samsung D800's.

This allows you to power up JUST the music feature without actually turning on the phone thus allowing you to use it on a plane.  Also when in 'flight mode' the battery life is considerably extended.  On a 7.5 hr flight plus lay-overs and having kept the music feature on almost continously I still had 14% battery life remaining by the time I got to my destination!  Another neat little music feature is the built-in FM radio which uses the wire of the ear phones for an antenna!

At 2Mg resolution you wont be taking pictures worth enlarging to 8x10 but as a 'point n shoot' camera for general use it more then does the trick and the resulting images are pretty good in the 4x6 size range.The call quality I have experienced has been quite good, even in the speaker phone mode, with an average talk time of around 2.5 - 3 hours continuous call and I have gone up to 4 days without needing to charge the phone under very minimal usage conditions.Truely, the ONLY thing I have an issue with is that the plug-in port for the charger and the ear phones are one and the same meaning that you can't have the phone plugged in to charge and use the radio feature at the same time since it's the ear phone wire that serves as the radios antenna.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to just about anyone whether you're looking for a new phone, a new mp3 player or even a new point-n-shoot digital camera, especially if you're a traveler and need to lighten you accessory load.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I have ever had", "Author": "M.

I love the radio, and the themes are neat too.  It came with less ringtones than any other phone I've seen, but that doesn't bother me at all because once I load the music I will just use those.

It also synchronizes nicely with outlook, again with the convenience of Bluetooth. However, you will need to use the cable for importing your music.Now that were on the subject of music, the first thing I did, and you should too, is to put the included 512MB Memory Stick PRO Duo aside and buy a 2GB Stick. I imported 169 songs into the phone at 128kps and I still have over 1.2GB worth of space remaining on the Stick.

I received them in August or so, and now I am buying new phones already because these 2 are dead.It started off well, they look great, good reception, worked well on the T mobile network in the US. We were not looking for iphone equivalent, so we were happy. But within 2 weeks of receiving my phone, I started having connectivity issues. No matter what I did or where I went, the phone would say \"no network connection\". At first, this problem fixed itself if I left the battery out overnight. After a month, it would take longer for it to fix itself. After several months, it would fix itself for maybe a day and then go back to being disconnected for a week. Frustrating as heck.My husband's phone only sometimes had this error, and it never escalated like with my phone. However, one of the leads to connect the charger to peeled off, making it impossible to use his phone for charging. We were using my useless phone for charging the battery. Also frustrating.There are some other cons besides it breaking:1. Maybe it's convenient for some people, but the fact that pressing one button turns on the mp3 player is very... embarrassing. Without headphones in, the music will blast out. And this is with the phone on vibrate.2. For some reason our phones did not update their time with the network. So, because we kept having to take the battery out, or the battery kept dying, we'd have to reset the time. Just this morning my husband's phone alarm did not go off because of this.3. The alarm. There are no \"silent, just vibrate\" options for it. Everything has a strange sound. I got around it by recording silence, saving it as a song, and putting it on the phone as a \"ringtone\" lol.

The reason I bought this phone was because I travel a lot and I don't want to run the risk off breaking or loosing my iPhone. First off it is from a time when people wanted to make really really small phones. It was really unexpected but it's easy to get used to and happens to be very convenient because it can actually fit in your pocket. But now on to the reviewCall Quality: This is great phone for calling. I made an iPhone 4 sim card adapter out of an old credit card and some duct tape to test it out and at my computer desk where my iPhone gets around 2-3 bars this phone was full bars. I have called people with this W810i in places my iphone would never even dream of having bars. As far as phone quality the sony ericsson w810i is the winner. Which is good because when I'm traveling that's all I need. A phone that works as a phone. 5/5Text and messaging:Obviously not much can beat a qwerty keyboard. But at least the buttons on the w810i are comfortable and responsive. However I have noticed that sending picture messages is a hassle. 4/5MP3 player: This phones mp3 player is great. From the speaker it matches the iphones quality and you can connect any headphone set into the phones adapter. The earbuds that came with the device sucked though. They were cheap and broke almost immediately. Also I wish you didn't need an adapter to use headphones. For a \"walkman\" phone it seemed kinda silly. 4/5Camera: Decent camera. It obviously stands nowhere near the iphones but still for what the phone is its nice. It is has an autofocus lens and a lot of cute options like white balance meter and night mode. This is fine for me because I usually even with my iphone at hand, take pictures with my DSLR. So I rarely use the camera on phones. 3/5Overall I really like the phone and It is in some ways better than even an iPhone 4. It is a great device to get if you travel a lot and dont want to loose or break your more expensive smart phone.

It feels and looks well constructed, although I do not care much for the few orange color buttons and screen. The screen itself is a decent size and good quality. Sony Ericson phones are typically the best for talk and standby time, and this one is no different, with something like 8-9 hours talk time. I don't use my cell phone that often, and I frequently found that when I did pull out my old nextel phone to use, it was dead. This sony phone typically still has some juice left for me to make my calls.I got this phone for about $150 with a 2 year contract through AT&T.; I got the cheapest rollover minutes plan, which if you are like me, and you don't use your phone alot for calls, you will save up a redicously large amount of minutes, for up to 12 months. (you lose rollover minutes that are beyond 12 months).There were also 3 separate rebates that were supposed to take the phone down to $0, but as I'm sure they expect, it was so difficult, I simply forgot to send them in. You need the bar code on the box for each rebate and purchase receipts, and one had to be sent in within 30 days, and another in the fourth month, and another in the fifth month. Still $150 for this phone when it was new was pretty good, especially considering that it was otherwise selling for $400-500 when it was new.The phone sports a 2mp camera, and an mp3 player, two devices I really wanted in my phone. I bought a GB card for the phone and downloaded all my mp3's to the phone. The software for that comes for the downloading the files, is not very good, but it got the job done. The speaker for this phone for both calls and music is awful, especially considering this is a walkman phone. My 5 year old nextel phone had a far superior speaker. I don't like earbuds, so I didn't really test the ones that came with the phone. However hooked up with a pair of headphones, my mp3's sound pretty good. Strangely, the music volume always seems to return to a default level, and I have to keep raising the volume.The 2mp camera works well, and frankly I cannot tell the difference between pictures taken with it and my supposedly superior 8mp sony camera. Both devices take good pictures. This phone has about a 5 second delay between taking pictures though, which I found to be a bit much. It also takes video. With the 2GB card I purchased, even with all my downloaded music, I still have more then enough room for taking pictures and videos. Without purchasing a memory card though, there is very little internal memory, something like 30mb. You will need a memory card to take full advantage of the this phone's camera and music features.The phone is too small, and only comes about half way down my cheek. I miss my flip phone here, and am considering going back to one. The buttons are also a bit too small, however they are raised, providing good tactile feel.The biggest problem I had, is that in the first year my phone got a blank white screen. I contacted Sony Ericson and they said it was a software glitch. The phone was incapable of downloading the software updates and fixes, so I had to send it in. I got back in a reasonable amount of time, however, it was a refurbished phone, and not the one I sent in.

Obviously not the manufacturer's faunt but you may want to research that before ordering a high-end phone if the internet is important to you. My other issue is how small the keypad is. I am a texting machine and the small buttons make this difficult although I have gotten used to it.

What's worse Sony Ericsson appears to acknowledge in support requests that there is a problem, yet will not fix it because the hissing was introduced when they fixed (via a firmware update) a sonic distortion problem when volume is cranked up.So, everyone who listens at a normal volume level is out of luck while people who are piercing their ear drums at least do it in crystal-clear audio. Nice. This is a firmware issue that SE refuses to fix, at least for now.SE had a real chance hear to create a killer product. It does a lot of thing really well.

Pedersen", "ReviewID": "R1LE9U7CRH90HS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, let me just tell you that I own an older Sony Ericcson phone probably made at least three years ago (low resolution screen, no bluetooth) and it works just fine. Mind you I've had to take a wire brush to the AC adapter receptacle once or twice to clean it out and get it to charge. It has four bars right now. So, I decided to stay loyal to Sony Ericcson and purchase this phone, the W810i, and I recieved it in the mail two weeks ago. All was well the first week regarding music transfer, signal, and radio. I decided to go a step further and get a Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset and it worked okay with occasional beep telling me it \"lost\" the device. About an hour later I was hit with \"EMERG. CALLS ONLY\" across the screen with absolutely no signal. Okay. I then uninstalled my headset, waited a few minutes, and tried to make a call. Nothing. To roll this review up real good into a nice fatty boombatty this phone has gone completely haywire playing songs by itself when the keys are locked, incoming calls that I can't pick up, absolutely no calls going out, and just last night when I tried to call someone it made this loud high-pitched noise when it wasn't even on speaker until I had to turn it off. No more. Steer clear of all Sony Ericcson phones if you know what's good for you. Good functionality and signal are vital when it comes to buying a good phone. This one has neither. It is not a good phone.

Assistance from Sony was sorely lacking.

Cingular insisted unlocked phones would not work on their system - which was not quite the whole truth since I know others have working unlocked W810i phones on their system.What I like about the W810i:Small sizeEasy to navigate menusSound quality for both music and phoneEase of text inputCamera qualityWhat I dislike about the w810i:I could not get it work with my handsfreelink in my 2005 Acura MDX.  It would pair, but then transfer all of my calls made through the handsfreelink back to the phone.I had multiple dropped calls - almost every call!  I updated the software, changed the network to a manual selection, called Cingular, got a new SIM card and called Sony.  All to no avail.Bottom Line:I cannot recommend the W810i for someone who plans to use it as a phone!
