For starters, I expected a new phone since that is what I was told I was purchasing.  Instead I recieved a battered looking \"re-conditioned\" Vodaphone.  Secondly, though I have had it for over a month, I still don't know whether it even works, as the battery pack that came with it is useless/dead...and I certainly hope, that is the only problem and not the phone itself.It certainly wasn't worth the $159 paid.  I will never make another purchase from Tiger Mart...its also unfortunately that I had the phone shipped to Jamaica and thus am having a challenge making a return.  I hope I am still in the warranty period, as I will be in the US in a matter of weeks when I will be able to return and get back my hard earned cash.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Colors Silver\n2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\n3G Network UMTS 2100\nSIM : Mini-SIM\nDimensions 10 x 69.5 x 19.5 mm (4.33 x 2.74 x 0.77 in)", "Name": "Blackberry 8707V Unlocked GSM PDA Cell Phone - Quad-Band, 3G, Bluetooth, QWERTY Keyboard", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41apjupfUcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002CJHNP2"}}
