{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HTC Droid DNA - Large Screen - Lightweight - Great Sound - Excellent phone for my needs", "Author": "RatherLiveInKeyWest", "ReviewID": "R1N7FJA5TCNS3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Three months ago I let a salesman talk me into 'upgrading' from my tried and trusted HTC Incredible 2 (3G) to a LG Lucid (4G) at \"no cost\"... right. The cost of frustration quickly outweighed the 'free' purchase; in my humble opinion, the Lucid has a horrible user interface while its software is insufficient and not user friendly at all.  When I made that switch, was visiting a VZW store with a friend and just hanging out as she upgraded her phone... so that's what I get for not doing research before purchasing.After just a month of using that Lucid, I performed enough research to decide that the HTC Droid DNA was a proper replacement and have had two months or relative bliss so far. Am very happy to have made the switch to the DNA, and here are my observations after two months of DNA use:The DNA is extremely easy to use, it has an outstanding virtual keyboard and perfect touchscreen alignment, the Jelly Bean software provides access to the nitty-gritty level of function settings but it is easy to use and understand, the DNA has plenty of pages to store apps on, and (for me) this phone truly has excellent battery life. The on/off button is located on the top of the DNA and that is perfect for me - the Lucid was on the side, and I was always fumbling with it and hitting other switches (like volume)instead.Battery life of the DNA seems to be a point of weakness for other reviewers, but has not been an issue for me. Yes, initially the battery lasted about one day (I'd charge it about 10PM each night), but I'd used the Easy Battery Saver app before and installed it pronto -- now the battery lasts an average of 1.5 to 2 days (usage depending of course). That is more than acceptable to me given the large screen size and my usage tendencies.The resolution of the DNA's 5-inch diagonal screen is absolutely amazing, and the phone's body is incredibly thin and lightweight compared to others I have had (Motorola Droid, Droid X, HTC Eris, Incredible 2 and the Lucid). Texting is very simple, email setup was a breeze, and it works perfectly with Google Maps (Navigator).The DNA's sound is very good; its says that sound it driven by Dre \"beatsAudio\" components and I believe it as the audio is very good in standalone mode, or when hooked to portable speakers like the HDMX Jam (HMDX Audio HX-P230BL JAM Classic Bluetooth Wireless Speaker (Blueberry)) or the XBOOM Mini (XBOOM Mini Portable Capsule Speaker with Rechargeable Battery and Enhanced Bass+ Resonator - Black).There are two areas of concern that come up most often in reviews:(a) The DNA does not have a port for an expandable sim card... OK, but that has yet to be an issue for us as we use streaming apps and cloud services to host most big storage items like movies (Amazon and Netflix), music (Amazon and Pandora), pictures (Photobucket) and videos (YouTube).(b) The DNA does not have a removable battery... OK, maybe that could become and issue, we shall see. We have other phones whose batteries died after about two years use and we replaced those batteries with great success. Will be curious to see what happens in a couple years, but then we've been swapping out old phones for newer models in less time than that recently (so maybe that is the strategy here).How could it be better? Well, just like other Verizon offerings it does come preloaded with apps that you can't get rid of like Verizon Navigator, IMDb, Skype, Movie Editor, Slacker Radio, Books, Facebook, Reign of Amira, Amazon Kindle, NFL Mobile, Teeter, Zappos and other byte stealers that I really do not care about using on my phone... would be nice to be able to delete them altogether, but hiding them works OK too.If you are looking for a phone to replace the one you currently have, and are looking for a phone with great software, apps, visuals and sound... without breaking the bank... than I recommend this phone to you based on my experience with it.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love this phone", "Author": "matt dubois", "ReviewID": "R5SOX38FRRO1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the best deal i could find for the power the phone has and when i brought it in the Verizon  guy showed me his dna and said best phone we sell i have not had any issues and have run all the updates", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "best phone available for the price", "Author": "bob", "ReviewID": "R38O2HC6SWKM6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i spent hours reviewing and comparing phone stats online to get the best deal before buying this phone and now that i have it im very happy with it also i highly recommend the two part cases with the rubber and plastic as two separate pieces", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good for me and perfect for some.", "Author": "Gary Abner \"Gary\"", "ReviewID": "R2GO52AYV8CF2W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really liked this phone and I've tried almost all of them.  5\" really seemed like the perfect size, rubberized back  is great, and the 1080P screen is fantastic.
