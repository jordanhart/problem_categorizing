Best part is the sound quality and battery life. Samsung did a nice job to make sure sound quality  is on par with their high end phones. I don't have to charge this phone everyday. Can go few days without charging if I don't talk too long on it. I also like the prepaid service without a contract. There are no additional charges and Cricket network has excellent coverage. Cricket prepaid cards can be purchased at any major retailers and online stores. Buy this phone if you want an affordable good quality phone with a reliable service from Cricket.  I had this phone over few months and have nothing really bad to say.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone.

Fitzpatrick", "ReviewID": "R1RIPC4B3KG7X0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you use Cricket's Pay-Go service and need to replace a lost/broken phone, this is a very suitable option. I picked this one up hoping it would allow me to continue using my current service without needing to change my phone number, and, thanks to a friendly rep over the toll-free line, it did just that.I only dock a star for the phone's overall quirkiness and awkward design. The menus are easy to thumb through while sitting idle but, because of the extremely smooth and flat profile of the buttons, it can be frustrating trying to send a text or navigating menus while doing just about anything else. Also, you have to open the phone in order to see anything on the outside screen.I have no other gripes with this phone... it is built solid and feels very durable, has a sliding USB hatch rather than the ol' rubber flap, holds a charge for at least a few days at a time and above all, is a convenient, cost-effective way to keep in touch. A good buy.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "SJOz", "ReviewID": "R2RYX6BSRBS07D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone worked five the first day, but after that when I put it to charge the front screen went blank!!
