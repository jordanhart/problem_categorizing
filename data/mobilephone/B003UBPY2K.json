I wanted an unlocked phone because I didn't want to buy something from T-Mobile at a higher price or get locked into a longer contract.  She doesn't use her phone a ton so I was looking for a phone that cost effective, but still has good reception and a few bells and whistles.  So far, she seems to like this phone.  It has a typical phone pad that is easy to use.  The only complaint about it is that the numbers on the phone pad are a little tough to push because they are more like narrow rectangles.  I think that it is just a matter of getting used to it.  I use a BlackBerry and have no problem with even smaller buttons on the keypad.  The new phone slides out to a full QWERTY keyboard that is nice for texting.  If you want to surf the web, download apps, etc., this phone is not for you.  Get an iPhone or something similar.  If you want a basic phone that allows you to make phone calls, text, and do a few odds and ends without breaking the bank, this would be a great option for you.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Alyssa Pratt \"A.Pratt\"", "ReviewID": "R1TJLK7XZE6C6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had decided on this phone when I got a new prepaid Tmobile plan.

I looked around for awhile and settled on this phone. I like it a lot and haven't had any problems at all. The battery life is really good, I text  a lot but don't make many phone calls. The camera isn't great but it does the trick. The QWERTY keyboard makes texting much quicker. Obviously it's not a smart phone but it works well at what it does.

Gilston", "ReviewID": "R41DWTS8YX9Z4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I discovered this phone, I was looking for something cheap that had a full keyboard so I could text my friends.It's a prepaid phone, but I put in the Sim card from my old phone and it worked perfectly with the old service. I was able to keep my old cell phone number and all of my contacts. The phone has a few wallpapers and ringtones, but when I bought it, I couldn't find any more due to the fact that the phone was practically brand new to the market. That also meant I couldn't download free games or apps for it. Still, this phone is really great and reliable for being so cheap.After a while, I did notice that the phone's sliding mechanism was getting a bit wobbly, but I'm not worried about it. It's not really a big deal. The phone still has a pretty good battery life, even though I've had it, I believe, since August, and I frequently forget to charge it. The sound quality isn't great when you're listening to music, but I've never had any trouble when I was actually talking to someone. Most of the time, people's voices come in pretty clear. The games and apps that the phone came with were pretty fun, and I ended up buying one because it was so addicting. The screen is very clear and has great quality, but the phone only has two themes, black and white. The phone also has IM, supporting Yahoo!, AIM, and Windows Live.In short, there's not really a whole lot to complain about or talk about with this phone. It's pretty nice for the price, and it works great when it comes to the features I bought it for. I really recommend this phone.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "T-mobile T369", "Author": "John E.

That might get better as I get more used to the phone, I've only had it for 10 days or so.Call quality is real good, had no problems there.I think this phone is good for someone who wants to use it as a GoPhone (as it's intended), someone who is looking for a real simple phone and doesn't want internet (internet capable, but only EDGE), or someone who is looking for a phone to use until their contract runs out.I myself, plan to use this for a few months to buy some time until I can switch carriers.

In early 2011, I dropped one phone in a glass of soda, and within 3 months my second phone's LCD screen cracked under the screen. Neither were covered under our insurance plan. I needed a phone ASAP, so I went to the store and bought this phone the same day for $80.This phone has been dropped, kicked, stepped on, sat on, thrown, tossed, dropped in puddles, and somehow survived over 12 months now. The LCD isn't cracked, the screen isn't damaged and all the buttons are still there and functional. Today I dropped this phone off a second story balcony and watched it land on cement, sending pieces everywhere. The phone survived with only minor cosmetic damages to the case.The phone itself is a standard QWERTY keyboard. If you call and text all the time, and need a phone that is virtually indestructible (I should mention that I do not have a case for my phone) then this is the phone for you.

The battery life is good and sound quality is fine. I've dropped the phone many times and it still functions just fine, which is great. Basically it is a good basic phone for the price.There are a couple things that have come standard on other basic phones I've had that this one is lacking, and they are kind of annoying (but not a deal breaker at this price):- You can't customize any of the hot keys on the phone.- You can't customize the alarm volume to be a different volume than the ring tone. For me this is a pain in the butt because with previous phones I have turned the ring tone down very quiet over night, but keep the alarm at a normal volume so that I can actually hear it. However, if you want to be able to hear your alarm in the morning you had better be prepared to be woken up if a drunk friend or someone from another time zone texts you in the middle of the night. Bummer.I'm giving it 3 stars out of 5 because it meets expectations (a good cheap phone), but does not exceed them. There is nothing here to blow you out of the water, but there are no major downfalls as well.

I just want to talk and text, and this replaced a bare-bones phone.  The price couldn't be beat and I had it in 4 days.  The talk quality is fine. It's lightweight and pretty slim.  I love that it has a slide-out keyboard for texting, although I have to press pretty hard on the space bar for it to work.  It's also hard to do caps or any \"alt\" function - it seems to lag and not always work right.  I haven't gone on the web with it so I can't speak to that, and I rarely use the camera but that seems to be OK.  The only thing that drives me crazy is that I have to keep the touchpad locked because any movement in my purse was pushing random numbers/buttons on the phone.  Then every time I want to do anything I have to unlock it (which is only a couple of keystrokes, but still).  My old phone was a flip phone so I never had this problem.

Texting on the phone is very smooth and enjoyable, and call quality is fine as well.  My only gripe with this phone had to be with the phone's build quality; after a good half a year, the phone was not able to slide back into its original closed position and the back half of the phone protruded a bit.  Also, it's very easy for a small rock, pebble, piece of turf (I'd often bring my phone to my soccer games), or any other small object to fit between the two halves of the phones, especially when you slide it open.  This causes the phone's sliding function to become less smooth and more grinding the longer you use it.  And from time to time, I'm not sure why, the phone would not receive or even register an incoming call from someone, which can be very problematic at times.  All in all, however, for the amount that I paid for it, I'm pretty pleased with how the phone has served me so far.

I'm still getting used to it, especially how much pressure to apply to scroll through lists. On one of my first texts I accidently sent the message to 2 people because I didn't realize I touched more than one when scrolling through my contact list (luckily it was nothing I regretted sending to a person it was not intended for!!). Really like having a full keyboard for texting. The camera is nice, but I wish there was a zoom capability. Like others, I don't like the fact that the keyboard locks so fast. Most phones I have used before will allow touching any button to accept a call even if the keypad is locked. Unless I'm doing something wrong, you always have to unlock before you can even answer the phone. So if you're getting to your phone close to the last ring or so, you'll probably miss the call trying to unlock and answer. For the price it has some really great features.

Of the many cell phones I have come across, this one has proven itself. Don't get the \"old fashioned\" design fool you, this phone is dependable and has only a few minor flaws.The buttons are all physically there and raised so that you can find them tactfully. It even has a slide-out physical QWERTY keyboard with non-slip buttons. The \"cursor\" is a raised ring that you can easily feel and clicks in 4 directions, I've given it to men with big clumsy fingers and they had no problem with it.The UI is also simple and easy to navigate, use the cursor ring or push the corresponding number on the keypad to execute a function. It's one of the more simpler yet useful UI's I've come across.Photo and video are surprisingly decent, even at low resolution it takes very clear pictures with minimal color distortion, has good auto-white balance too. Video is not quite as a good in quality and the still camera requires that you hold the camera very still for at least 2 seconds. So no action shots.The camera shutter sound is also very loud and the shutter button is frequently accidentally hit and photophobes sometimes freek out and think you take a photo of them. You can \"lock\" the keypad and other buttons by holding down the star (*) key. It supports optional PIN/password locking as well.Voice and text work just fine, supports T-Mobile and AT&T; networks. There is a normal volume and speaker phone volume option you can enable during voice calls.E-mail and account balance no longer work, unfortunately.The memory card can be removed/unmounted while the phone is still on and remounted. Only problem is that you have to open the cover without detaching the battery and when you push in the memory card its easy to accidentally click the camera button.You can set custom ring tones, even for for each individual contact, from an mp3 on the memory card. But you can not change the default new text message sound.The construction and durability is one of the best, and a rarity these days. Mine has been dropped, stepped on, scratched, etc, and it still works like brand new.

You have to type alt before each number in a text because there are no dedicated number keys on the keyboard.5. We bought two of these. My phone won't let me make groups of contacts but the other one will. I have done a master reset on my phone and still no go. I presume it's a software corruption.6. You cannot download text tones whereas you can download ringtones.7. The icon which means you have voicemail is almost always on. I call voicemail and there are no messages and the icon turns off for a few minutes, then it turns on again.8. The sequence to unlock is to push two buttons that are next to each other. Consequently if you put it in your pocket it will frequently unlock itself and pocket dial.

This phone gave me all of the above, for $80 and no need to signed a new contract.Now, you need to be very patient with this phone, it is slow as melasa, it has all kinds of features but it doesn't excel at anything that it does. So it feels like a teaser, it can do many things but you have to work with it and accept its limitations.1. Size, this phone almost look like a bar phone, skin and slim, perfect shape, I hate those square huge smart phones that can not fit in any pocket.2. It has never frozen on me, one time it was getting to slow on a task, I just pressed the return buttom and held it and it quit what it was doing and woke right up so no issues there.3. Speed it is hurrible, if you click on the music player, it takes for ever to load the song list, or if you trying to view pictures, it will take for ever to load the pics thumbnails.4. Excellent texting phone, I love the virtual key board on the screen, no issues there, other then it has no smily faces, so forget about including smiley faces on your text messages.5. Battery life is okay if only used as a phone to take random calls, but if you text a lot during the day, the phone won't last a whole day, I have to have a charger every where I am, home, car and office.6. Data cable, the phone can be connected to a computer to upload/download info from the memory card or phone internal memory, but it is not reliable, 3/4 of the times my computer refuses to recognize the phone and I actually have to reboot my computer to stop the anoyance of the pop up windows about your USB device not working properly, so I have seen it work, just doesn't work all the time. The good thing is that you can still charge the phone when connected to the PC even if it can't communicate with the pc.7. You can only have one alarm, not multiple alarms as on my last phone.8. Ringing formats can not be as customisable as my last phone, you get 3 choices and that is what you get, ring and vibrate, vibrate or silence.9. Not as easy to put lock the phone for security with a password, my last phone I used to press the down arrow key and that would lock the phone, on this phone I have to go through all kinds of menu to do the same thing, not fun.10. The phone does lock the keys automatically when a call comes in, that is a pain even when listening to the voice mail and trying to erase a message, by the time you get the keypad back, it is too late to press 7 to delete the voice mail and you might delete the next message, what a mess.11. Music player, I like it, speaker phone does its job, but when connected to the car system or to a headphones, it has no base, it produces a tin foil sound and it does have some EQ presets that are useless, I change it from one to the other but it doesn't do anything to the sound.12. The touch screen, I like the resolution of the screen, I have loaded images from my regular camera and they look good but load very slowly, so viewing the screen is fine. The problem is this is a touch screen phone only, there are may things that can only be done via the touch screen which is not very accurate or sensitive. For example, pull up the music list, in order to scroll throught the houndreds of songs, if you don't press the screen enought it won't scroll down, but if you press it to hard, it will select the wrong song, so it is frustrating, they should had included a separate scroll bar.13. The camera images are okay, just not stellar but good enought to proof a point.14. The phone number directory, some of the interface is very weird, makes no sense, who ever designed the interface of this phone did not have a very intuitive mind so it is hard to follow along or understand how to do certain things.15. If somone send you a picture via text, it won't display it right away, first you have to switch from the conversational format to the standard text format so that you can get the option to down load the picture. Once the picture is down load, the phone beeps as if it has received a new text, when you open that new text it goes back to the conversational format so that you can see the picture and if you want to save the picture to memory, then you have to go back to the standard text mode to get the option to save the picture, very ackward and out of this world to just see a picture or any other file that might be attached to a text, too much trouble.16. And it has other anoyances like that, some of which I might be forgetting, but just be aware that you might be mad at this phone or frustrated with its interface and way of conduction business.So, if you don't mind the mandatory data plan and 2 years agreement, for $80 I would instead recommend the htc Aria or the old iPhone that ATT is now offering at a discount, those two would serve you much better then this wanne be little phone full of issues and weird behaviours...Enjoy it if you can, I will be switching to a better phone as soon as I can.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone, yet terrible call quality", "Author": "Jes", "ReviewID": "R2IL0E7U83I3AC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like the appearance and design of the phone.

Keep in mind that the activation will take at least 24 and up to 48 hours to get into the system. DO NOT purchase the refill cards on line, don't purchase the card with the phone. Get your cards from a T-Mobile store (not at Best Buy) because the online store might send you an invalid refill card and it's almost impossible to get the problem fixed (Best Buy will tell you to call the customer care line if they can't replace the card for you). Using the online refill is probably a better way to go, provided you have a credit card.Keep in mind also that the pre-pay customer care and regular T-Mobile service centers are two different places (you will be bounced from the regular customer care center to the prepay center, be prepared to spend 30 minutes to an hour with them to fix problems). Also, if you use your prepay phone to try to get problems fixed, it might eat your minutes if you get the wrong number.

Avoid getting this phone, as it is terrible!QUICK EDIT - Yes, it is VERY DURABLE, as I just got extremely angry at it and threw it against the wall...and it still works!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "love the phone !!", "Author": "Scott Kobel \"sprk\"", "ReviewID": "R12K115VZ8HNZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this probably a good 3 weeks ago or so.  My first touch screen phone and it's really nice.  Some people don't like how u always have to unlock it, yet i enjoy knowing that it's always secure and i can't push any buttons by mistake when it's in my pocket and it unlocks very easy !  It has tons of features, going to buy one for my wife in the near future.  It's nice to get a great phone and not have to worry about entering a contract.  I have a service plan w/ AT&T;, i don't use it as a go-phone, if u have a contract w/ AT&T;, simply put your SIM card from your old phone into this phone and it's that easy, just make sure u save your contacts and stuff to your sim card before u switch it over.

BUT... having major problems with texting. AT&T; says it's not a network issue. They are going to replace the SIM card- if that doesn't fix it, I will need to get a new phone. The problem is texting to other networks like Verizon, Sprint, Cricket- about half of the texts never go through or show up as multiple blank messages. Don't seem to have the problem with other AT&T; but not 100% sure. Did not have the problem with the old Motorola phone.
