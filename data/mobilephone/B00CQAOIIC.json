This phone is fantastic all around. I can't tell you how many android and apple users have stopped me to comment on my phone, picked it up to play with, and sighed with regrets that they just renewed their contracts picking up a new Galaxy or iPhone.A brief breakdown by area:Hardware: Nice size and weight, not bulky or heavy despite some biased reviews out there, and is certainly lighter than the iPhone once its been \"Otterboxed.\" Smooth and curved on the back for ease of holding, squared off on front. Easy to reach the whole screen with my thumb despite having small hands for a man. Wireless charging with the basic charging pad is quick and simple. Very satisfied to not have to struggle with micro-usbs anymore. Can't comment on durability because I haven't dropped it yet.Interace: Sleek, smooth, feels very high end and hi-tech, making the iPhone and Galaxy feel dated.Screen quality: Beautiful.  Slightly dimmer than the iPhone at top brightness. Good visibility outside in sun.Battery Life: Pretty good, with heavy use you will likely need to recharge at least once daily.Apps: This is the big gripe point with WindowsPhones in general. There are fewer of thost \"must-have\" Apps, most notably instagram, dropbox, and personally for me HBOGO, however, these are the only Apps I find myself missing. There are decent 3rd party apps that can do the same. Lomogram for instagram, SkyDrive for dropbox. No 3rd party HBOGO app, but Netflix and Hulu are available. Pandora and Nokia music should keep you happy on the music end. Built in email interface is far more robust and streamlined than the android version...as a Gmail user I was very surprised by how much better Microsoft was able to manage Gmail than google based android. Facebook App is more than adequate. The App situation should improve substantially, particularly in light of the 928 now available on Verizon, and T-mobile getting their own flagship 925.Camera: Best available in the market. I have not picked up my Nikon DSLR because the shots I get off my 928 are comparable if not superior, particularly in low light. I took a photo this AM with family in pitch-black closet, and the quality is phenomenal with the xenon flash. Low light shots without flash are quite good as well. Very cool photo apps like SmartShot(takes rapid burst of pics and you pick the best one), panorama, and an animated-GIF app.Video: 1080P, better than real life quality. Can't do much better than this.Sound: On full volume(30/30), the sound can fill the room, although can be tinny at highest volumes).I can confidently say that if you take a chance and pick up this phone you will not regret it.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the Price", "Author": "Geebox", "ReviewID": "RBBALT8D0KPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A User Review on the Nokia Lumia 928.Got my Nokia 928 a few days ago. First, overall the phone isGREAT and I would recommend it to anyone. IMO it is the Best Windows Phone to date. I will also say that in comparison to the other Operating System's; Android and iOS, Windows Phone 8 OS is better and faster in my opinion. Of course that is Subjective. Everyone has his or her preference as to the features, apps, size, style, color and specs of a phone that work for them and that's just fine. My sister likes the iphone 5 and it works just fine for here. My youngerbrother likes Android ICS and it works fine for him. The point is, I nor anyoneelse has to convince each person that they should buy a particular Phone. Having said that this is just a review for anyone not sure of Windows Phone 8.The Pros and the Cons.Pros:1. The Operating System: The Windows Phone 8 OS issmooth fast and responsive. It runs faster on a lower processor than a newer Android's faster quad processor. The point is, it doesn't have to have 4 or moreprocessors to run smoother and faster. Though I have not had it longer the 8days as of this review I nor the persons I know who have a WP8, have notexperienced the lags, bugs and many reboots I have had with Android Phones and Tablets. I didn't like the Windows Tiles when I first heard or seen them in pictures, but expect for the plain colors (you eventually get use to them) they work great. The Live Tiles update you on all the info you need on one screen without having to click on a bunch of different apps Mail, Facebook, Weather, Agenda, Calender, Messaging are all updated right on the front screen. You can customize the look, size, color of your Tiles and change them with ease.2. The Camera: This has to be one of the best cameras on a Phone. You will not be disappoint on the pictures it takes in daylight or low light. Nokia is hyping up this Camera and I have to agree. The Camera alone is a good reason to get this phone.3.  Call Quality is good: Both calling and receiving. The speaker on it is loud and clear.4. The Display is great with the AMOLED Display. It makes the screen sharp and clear and great even it sunlight. The Size at 4.5 inches is also a nice size, not too big and not too small.5. Xenon Flash: Brighter and better Flash as found on some standalone cameras.6. HD 1080p recording with great noise canceling mics. Also has front Facing 1.2MP camera.7. 32 GB internal storage8. 4G Network: I haven't had the chance to fully test it yet, but my pages load super-fast and my downloads are fast as well.9. Battery: Battery usage for a smartphone is Good. It also has wireless charging.10.  APPS: There is a lot of criticism with this OSand lack of apps. This area is where people have to put things in the rightprospective. Yes iOS and Android has more Apps than WP8. I have to laugh alittle when this argument is brought up. First who downloads that many apps?Second putting thing in the right prospective, iOS and Android is 5years old. Developers have had plenty of time to make apps. Windows Phone is going on 3years old with Window Phone 8 being only 6 months old with over 145,000 to date. Most of the top apps or equivalent is available right now on the WP store, with more being added as the months go buy. The point is, it took both Android and Apple years to get to the app count they have now. Besides most of the apps on those system or useless apps that don't say on a phone for long yet alone even make it to ones phone. Again my point is most of the main or equivalent apps that people use are either on the store or in development. If Windows Phone 8 sells great(and I think it will) more apps will come faster. Anyway Nokia has a set of apps that make this phone stand out itself, Nokia Music, Nokia City Lens: Nokia Maps, Nokia Drive. There are plenty of other apps that make this a great pick.Cons:1. No External Storage. I think Nokia made a mistake here. Even though it has an internal 32 gig storage( 23G usable) they should have made room for external storage. I like having my music, videos and some data on a storage card so I am not tied to a computer or downloading data on a cell or wifi. I almost didn't get the phone because if this.2. No removable battery. I am a heavy user, both personal and work. I like having a couple of charged batteries to throw in when I just can't charge.3. Lack of Apps? I put this here because in comparison to the other two OS's, WP8 does have less apps, however I think I make a good point above as to why this is not a good reason to not buy this Phone.4. No FM Radio: other Nokia Phones have the radio turned on. Though I heard that it can be turned on in a firmware update.5. No Etiquette: My own personal preference; a feature that mutes the phone when you face it down.6. Wish it had a stylus for notes: My own personal preference7. No Swype Keyboard: My own personal preference8. Unless I am wrong, No Video output to TV.Ok so for what it is worth, this is just an opinion for a user and not a article writer,and Yes I have had both Android and Iphone.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thinking about buying Lumia 928? Let's see if I can convince you", "Author": "Soner Bicici", "ReviewID": "R25GWFP60I0MA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you.First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps!As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S.My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S.Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review.Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier.Here are the pros:- Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808.- Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time.- Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can.- Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy!- Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free.- Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home.- Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers.- Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen.- Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most.- Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus.- Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too.Now time for the Cons:- As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness.- No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card slot so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage.- Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it.- Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no \"x\" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps.- Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not.Conclusion:I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try. If you have any questions, feel free to leave comments and I will try my best to answer your questions.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone.", "Author": "Adam B. Claar \"blubol\"", "ReviewID": "R1JIK2AAGKOPKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just the background...I got this phone as an upgrade on Verizon Wireless.  I was previously using an Android based Thunderbolt (first LTE android phone for VZW).  I had watched a buddy use her Lumia 920 so I had a decent idea of how Windows Phone 8 works.  I have never previously owned a Windows based phone.1.  Speed.  Initially I was worried that this phone would be slower than it's 4 core Android counter parts.  This phone only has 2.  I was honestly surprised.  It is as fast as any of my buddies Note 2s and even their new S4s.  Speed to use this phone is really fast.2.  Camera.  This is best thing about this phone.  I would suggest going to Youtube and watching some HD test videos (user videos...not Nokia commercials).  The camera is truly amazing.  The Xenon flash is great at night but just the day to day video and camera work is awesome.  I love that I can just touch the screen where I want the camera to focus.  Nokia has given you some really great applications like the panorama application which basically guides you through taking 3 photos that it stitches together to make a panorama shot.  Applying a filter like Instagram is quick and easy.  I also like that you can upload to SkyDrive automagically.  You don't have to but you can.  The 100GB storage is $50 or $6 a month if you need the maximum.  It is the least expensive of the large capacity cloud storage solutions.  *NOTE:  There is a dedicated camera button on the Lumia 928 that takes you directly into the camera.3.  Battery life.  I finally have a phone that I can go through the whole day on one charge.  I can charge it at night and that is all I need for the whole day...whether I am surfing the net or my daughter is watching Netflix. YES!!!!4.  Nokia Here/Navigation.  This took a little getting used to.  At first I was frustrated with the maps because they weren't up to date.  I then realized that you could download the maps directly to the phone in case there wasn't a data connection (nice to save on bandwidth).  After downloading the new map for the US everything worked beautifully.  *NOTE:  If you leave Here turned on Nokia is smart enough to know what the speed limit is and will \"ding\" at you if you are going over the speed limit.  This sounds trivial but I have to drive through several school zones on the way to work and occasionally find myself 2-3 miles an hour over the posted 25mph speed limit.  Instead of having to watch for kids and also my speedometer...I just get a handy \"ding\" from the phone that lets me know that I need to slow down a little.Limitations...1.  Apps.  If you are an app geek you will be disappointed in the selection of apps.  On the plus side you can load up your apps and still get the same speed out of the phone vs. an Android phone.  My daughter likes the way games look on the Lumia 928 better than on my old Android.  I would say that is just the hardware upgrade.  For a limited time if you buy a Lumia 928 you get $25 from Microsoft and Nokia to use towards apps in the Microsoft app store....overall...I am extremely happy with this phone.  It is the first phone I have owned and really liked in about 4 years.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"jtouchst\"", "ReviewID": "R2J5D68EZSPOMR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to try the W8 phones out because honestly, I just wanted to try something new. I was a little bored with my Android phone(though otherwise very happy) and not ready to jump to the Iphone since it was the same thing I had been doing with my ipod touch for years. I first tried the HTC 8x as I was a very satisfied HTC android user. The phone was beautiful but I didnt really like the feel of it in my hands, it dropped calls terribly, and some of the software that I was use to having for free on my Android device, such as the turn by turn voice navigation, just wasn't there, and the camera was just serviceable.  I had a few other qualms with it that were really making me consider jumping back to Android.I looked at the BBz10 (nice phone but a little complicated) and the Samsung S4 ( wasn't available yet on Verizon), and the HTC One ( would have gotten this but it is not a Verizon phone). I also though of waiting to see what the next Iphone would  look like but as it was like just to be a 5s, I couldn't imagine it being exciting enough to make me jump to that platform.  Then this phone came out to good reviews.  So I decided to try it out. I have to admit that I am surprisingly happy with this phone.  Everything that I didn't like in the HTC 8x is improved with this phone. Nokia just has more software, and that sofware makes the user experience. Also I think call quality is superior and I have only had 1 dropped call since I have had this phone.  The camera is very good as well.So far, the only thing I would change would be to round the edges slightly and to take the weight down a little more.  Other then that, I am a pretty happy Nokia W8 phone user.  Happy enough to want to see what the next operating system update will add to the phone.  Happy enough to stick with w8 platform until I can see what is the next great thing Android and Apple comes out with.  I don't know about os loyalty at this point but I'm more than satisfied with this phone.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Solid Phone", "Author": "F.

No issues like what i had with my 2010 AT&T; HTC Desire phone and I dont get bored with it, like I do with my wife's old Iphone 4 - wife has left Iphone for a Galaxy S4 because she was bored with IPhone also, almost got the Lumia 928, but didnt want to be the same as me, but she is still a little jealous that my phone take better pics than her new Galaxy, but I think they both do a great job.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This should be your next smartphone", "Author": "Rentme \"Rince, recycle & reuse\"", "ReviewID": "R1B0FD7JGU1X4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This really should be your next Smartphone!I have lived with Android and the defragmentation of the software releases with different versions on different phones.  I have experienced the high cost of the Apple products and have seen so many friends that encased their iphone with a big ugly case.  I have also experienced the \"great at first...than behind the times\" Blackberry Smartphones.  Now I am experiencing the Windows 8 Phone from Nokia and I can tell you I am not going back to any of the other options.  The excellent hardware quality of this phone and the additional Nokia Apps make this a super easy to use and that integrates with my desktop.  Other reasons to own this phone:- The offline GPS is fantastic as I never have to worry about having a data connection to get a route  (I found out that the Nokia mapping data base powers the majority of the car systems in the world and I can see why)- Nokia music is not something I would buy, but similar to mapping where you can download to your phone and then use without a data connection, this is fantastic to have a HIGH QUALITY sound mix on your phone that doesn't require a data connection to listen to.- Yup.....the camera can't be beat, especially with the Zenon flash and the Nokia Apps for the camera.- Battery charging is another goody that you have love.  First, it has a feature that charges the battery up to 40% faster.  Although most other new smartphones have this feature now, you really do notice it.  Second, you can find the Nokia wireless charging plates for $25 and once you use wireless charging you won't want to fiddle with the plug in cable again.  (I bought 2 plates and it is worth it)There are many other items I could list, but most reviewers have already listed them when reviewing Windows Phone 8.

Here's the stuff about Droid that drove me to Windows Phone 8...**Battery life - crazy bad to the point where I had to install the extended battery and cover (also true of my friend's Samsung phones).**Connection issues - 4G showing up in the display and the phone telling me during a navigation session \"Data Connection Lost\".  Really? I'm navigating somewhere... now what?**Random reboots - Oh yeah, never during a call but I'd be in the middle of web browsing session only to have the phone reboot itself.**Browser crashes - happened all the time.**4G to WiFi to 4G transition - a nightmare.  I'd have to turn off WiFi, wait a couple of seconds, and then turn it back on.**Bloatware and the inability to delete Verizon apps.  There were a LOT of unused apps, taking up space, that I would have loved to delete if I could.**Cost - $299 w/2-year contract renewal.Comparison to the Nokia 928**Battery life - you can't change the battery but you really don't have to.  It lasts all day with power to spare**Connection issues - there are none.**Random reboots - never happens.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had to manually reboot this phone for any reason whatsoever.**Browser crashes - none**4G to WiFi to 4G transitions - smooth as anything - there's no interruption in the data flow.**Bloatware - I actually LIKE the apps that came with this phone especially Nokia Drive, HERE Maps, HERE City Lens, and all the Nokia photo apps.  The one \"already installed\" app I wouldn't use, ESPN, was easily erased.**Cost - $99 w/2-year contract renewal.Notable features of the 928 & Windows Phone 8...Beautiful displayEasy OS - One screen for shortcuts (tiles) and one screen that lists ALL the programs.Great camera - pretty good low light photos, beautiful daytime photos, and a bunch of creative photo apps from Nokia that are fun and impressiveCall quality - very good; no complaintsProcessor speed - very smooth; no lagLive tiles - not the \"nightmare\" that I've heard of... some are kind of cool, some are functional.  All in all a nice feature to have.Navigation - works without an active data connection (map file is pre-installed).Apps - This seems to be a huge issue for some people.  Are there less apps available for WP8?, yes.  Do I care?, not really.  Why?, there really hasn't been an app that I wanted I couldn't find, or find an acceptable substitute.  I have Facebook, Skype, Open Table, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc.  More apps are being made available daily.  I found a decent tip calculator, a Drop-Box & You-Mail interface that's fully functional, and a bunch of games.  I know there's a zillion apps for Android and Apple IOS, but most of them are crappy or repetitive (how many flashlight apps do you need anyway?).  Oh by the way, all the apps I downloaded and installed were freebies.Thing I don't like about the phone...**Volume control... there's seems to be one control that affects everything (ringer, notifications, alarm, media, etc.)  A minor annoyance, but I would like to have more controls.**No FoxFi (I didn't use free WiFi tethering THAT often, but now I'll have to deal with its absence).Conclusion...I don't miss the Android OS at all.  There were too many issues with it for me to continue using it.  I was waiting for this phone to come out on Verizon and I'm glad I did.  It's not perfect, but it works really well.  Even though there are less apps than Android, they seem to be better written (more polished, more functionality, etc.) and there hasn't been anything I needed or wanted that I couldn't find.

From an android user", "Author": "paul riggs", "ReviewID": "RTZETS8G8WT9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background:I owned the Iphone 2g, which was a spectacular phone for its time.  I stuck with iphone until around 2011 when I started to think it was boring and I bought a Droid razr, which was also a good phone but not spectacular, I eventually broke it and upgraded to a galaxy nexus.  I became very accustomed to android and its ecosystem.  I used TONS of different apps, launchers and eventually ROMS for my Gnex.  I loved the phone and I loved androids customization.  However by 2013 the phone had lost its luster, I was sick of the poor battery life, instability and LAG.  So I thought about getting the Galaxy S4 or Note2 or even waiting (I'm on Verizon) for the HTC one.  The problem was I was worried about the battery life of all of those except the note 2.  I knew I didn't want to go back to Iphone because even though it is super stable, with tons of apps, its just so boring to me.  So I thought I might try the lumina 928, that was a week ago.Lumia Review:  -Build quality-The phone is really extremely well built.  Especially coming from a samsung phone it seems very durable and study.  -Setup--No Sweat.  The phone added all my verizon backup agent info and then nearly seemlessly merged it with my contacts from my google account.  -Call Quality--wow, no really wow.  Loud and clear.  You can tell the phone has 3 mic's and advanced background noise cancellation.  -Keyboard--Since this isn't android the keyboard better be good and luckily it is very good, and very accurate.  I was worried coming from swipe that this might be a deal breaker but it's so smooth and it autocorrects very well.  -Screen--The screen is beautiful, Just go look at one at the store, its great.  I read before I bought it that the white has a greenish tint if you look at it at a sharp angle and that is true.  However since I am the one using the phone I don't really have to worry about that.  -Windows 8--I am actually really impressed with the OS.  I always think of microsoft as old-school but the interface is very clean and minimalist.  The apps are lacking like you read in every other review but I don't have anything that I miss that much other than my bank app (USAA)  I can use pageonce  instead or just go to the mobile site but I really do miss that app.  Otherwise all the apps I really use are there and more are coming all the time.While windows 8 is not in the same realm of customization as android it is much more fun and customizable than IOS, while maintaining the same stability as IOS.  I like that live tiles of different sizes, they don't replace widgets from android but they do hold some information and flip from front to back or scroll through photos...etc.I also really like the Theme aspect of WP8.  I used to customize my nexus from top to bottom and make it a black and white theme or a super-hero theme or a family theme....etc.  WP8 can't do everything that android can but you can quickly change tile colors or from a black or white background.  This may not seem like much but its cool and it takes only seconds and everything remains stable, smooth and fast.  -Camera--The camera is very good, I am not a huge camera buff.  I use it to take pictures of vacations or kids or events and so on.  I have used it quite a bit and the Nokia photo suite is really useful and intuitive.  The Xenon flash works like a charm and works for flashlight apps too.  The talk about it being a great camera is true, however it does sometimes seem to change its white balance very quickly.  Like I said I am not a camera buff and that might be fixed in the settings but out of the box, its one of the things I noticed.  -Battery--This was and is one of the deciding factors for this phone, I hated charging my nexus all the time.  So far for me the battery life has been great.  I did get it down into the 30% range in like 6 hours on the first day but that was with near constant use.  With normal use it makes it though the day no problem.  That being said I was trying to get all the info I could on the battery before I made this purchase so I will tell you all I know.With the GPS on (Nokia Drive+ is great BTW) I think the phone will last a little over 3 hours with no charging.  That is much longer than my android phone but still a huge battery drain as most GPS's are.The phone is SUPER efficient in standby, I mean I think it uses .5-2% per hour if you just leave it.  My nexus would easily go down 7-10% per hour and this is much better than that.The lumia 928 comes with a \"battery saver\" in the settings.  You can set it to turn on manually, when low, or always (not recommended).  I am not sure why always is not recommended but I have it activating when the phone is \"low\" which I think is at < 40% (when the battery turns yellow).  The phone gets more efficient below 40% and seems to last as long if not longer than the last 60%.The battery has done really well so far and I liken it to an Iphone battery, doing more with less.  If you are coming from a razr maxx or Note2 you may be disappointed otherwise I think this will do surprisingly well for you.  -Recommended apps--If like me you are coming from one of the other platforms with 6X as many apps you may want to know which apps you should pick up.-The new Facebook and Twitter work well I think they have been updated since most of the reviews.-I like USAToday and WSJ news apps, I missed apps like stubleupon, pulse and flipboard so I started to use weave but I didn't really like it.-UC browser is better than IE.  IE is ok, it will work but you should try UC browser.-Customizable tiles(wifi, bluetooth, location) getting one of those apps is handy-Netflix works well-Audible is an app I use daily and It works well-ebay and amazon are good-Pageonce is a good app if your bank isn't in the windows store like me-I love the roku remote app (if you have a roku), I really like not losing that little remoteOverall I really recommend the phone.  I think its stability is great and its not boring at all, the camera is a standout and the usability of the phone is through the roof!", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thinking about a Galaxy S4 or Iphone 5?

Let's see if I can convince you", "Author": "Soner Bicici", "ReviewID": "RMJNC2219IJ9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you.First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps!As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S.My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S.Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review.Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier.Here are the pros:- Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808.- Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time.- Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can.- Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy!- Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free.- Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home.- Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers.- Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen.- Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most.- Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus.- Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too.Now time for the Cons:- As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness.- No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card lost so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage.- Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it.- Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no \"x\" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps.- Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not.Conclusion:I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try.

The metro interface carried from Windows Phone 8 is a fantastic touch interface, but having a regular desktop, micro sd slots,full usb ports made them the most versatile platform by far. Windows Phone 8 on the other had is a more limited, simplistic, and straightforward OS. Coming from Several Android, Iphone, Blackberry and even Windows Phone 5/6 devices I was pretty excited to see how things would work.Design: Honestly as first I thought it was a bit chunky, It has a lot of bezel, and is pretty thick. However after using it I really realized this actually helped usability a lot. It feels better in the hand and it's easier to operate than some of the phones trying to be as thin and bezel free as they can. Every time I hold it I just think that this is the best feeling phone I've ever had, I'm just really in love with the design now. Honestly I think they could have gone better with making it a 16gb with a micro sd slot, but windows phone isn't so great with SD cards I don't think (read software for more info) so i think it had something to do with that. One other thing I really miss is a notification LED on the front notifying me of missed texts/calls etc.Performance: Even though it's last gen hardware now, 1.5 ghz S4, 1gb ram, 720p screen it doesn't hold it back at all. The screen looks gorgeous (I can't tell the difference between a 720 and 1080p smartphone screen honestly) and it performs like a champ. It would have been nice to have 2gb of ram when going through the multitasking sometimes it had to resume the item which takes quite a bit.Software: Here's the big difference, The software, in a word is refreshing. The animations I thought would get annoying but keep the flow of movement really well, and when it gets done 9 times out of 10 the app is ready and loaded right away. Live tiles are really great, I had a couple of issues with some not updating right, but either way they make the main screen extremely lively. The \"app drawer\" I guess is what you would call it when you swipe to the right, It is functional but with only a single line of apps it makes kind of cumbersome sometimes.Windows phone 8 also doesn't allow access to the file system like android does. For instance I had a comic book reading application to read some .CBR files I had. I couldn't connect my phone to the computer and put the files on the phone to use though, I had to upload them to skydrive, then link my account with the app and download them. While I'm glad that atleast you can do this, it makes a 2 step process to like 5+ steps. The only thing I really found I could drop on and use from the internal memory was media files.One odd thing about the software is the search button, on windows 8 the search button will search throughout whichever app your in which is great. However the search button on windows phone is only a hotkey for Bing. It's kind of counter-intuitive, and should honestly just be a Bing button.Apps: This is a grey area, of course Nokia can only do so much on this front, it's up to the developers to make these apps, and Microsoft to attract them. Most every app from my previous android phone I was able to find. The community has been really great at making great alternatives to the missing apps like Flipboard, instagram, youtube and most everything else, finding the needed apps wasn't really a problem. A big HOWEVER though is that I found some apps missing functionality, they were like the red headed stepchild app of their android/iphone counterpart. For instance in both the official ebay app and an alternative one I was unable to add tracking information on my sales or manage my messages really. This is just one of a few I found that were just not up to par with the functionality i expected. Most of the time it isn't a deal breaker but it's something to think about.Things I miss are firstly a notification center. I pretty much manage everything with the live tiles but it would be great to have a spot to just check everything together though. Widgets I don't miss much, the tiles replace it almost mostly for me though one thing I would like would be interactive tiles where I can do things without actually going into the app.Camera: Lumias are known for their cameras and the pureview on this was no exception. It has a really bright f/2.0 lens, and whatever else the pureview technology does to help. The camera button works perfect, it will turn it to the camera from being off and it is a 2 step button meaning you can half press it to focus. Pics I took in low light looked like they were taken with like sunlight shining in, they turned out amazing. I tested it against my other canon point and shoot and the lumia blew the canon out of the water as far as low light performance. There are a ton of cool lenses that you can download to do different functions as well. The only thing that is missing however is the ability to take pictures while recording video which i really miss.Battery / Call quality: I'm not sure why people combine these 2 but they do, so why not try it. Call quality had no issues, I've heard complaints on other reviews but I experienced no signal difference or call quality from previous phones. Battery life was more than acceptable. After an 8 hour work day of between light and medium use I would have over 75% left usually. I had no issues lasting a day. From 6am waking up till 10pm going to bed I would almost never be below 50%. Also the wireless charger works without a hitch, thought the phone got decently warm during it which was odd.Conclusion: Well Microsoft has something really amazing on it's hands, Windows phone is just a joyful, unique experience. It makes heads turn, you can't go into work without having someone ask you about it. However can it replace your current smartphone is the question. I manage my life on my smartphone, and it needs to be able to keep up with me. My experience finds that Windows Phone will most definitely be able to keep pace.I do think that unlike an android device though I wouldn't be able to manage everything on my phone. If I were away from home or something I would probably need to access a computer at some point to manage thing. It just doesn't have that versatility yet. However Coming from the Iphone users will get an experience that is just as or more fluid, crisp and easy to use. Just don't expect the \"theres an app for that\" line to always work.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Aaron L. Smith", "ReviewID": "RPQDHRNE9IH1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon, and this is the first review I have been compelled to write here.  This phone is that good.I am coming from a Droid X2, which I wasn't really unhappy with except for the battery life.  I won't get into the battery life issue as I am not reviewing the Droid, but let's just say it was atrocious.  I was not unhappy with Android OS, but I didn't love it either, so when my contract was up I was willing to take a look around to see what else was out there for me.All of the phones I was considering (Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note II, Iphone 5, Droid Maxx) were $200 or more, so I was surprised to find this Nokia for $29.99 here at amazon (It can be had for $19.99 right now at wirefly.com, but I am a Prime member so the basically overnight shipping and support was worth the extra $10).  I read about the issues with app availability and synching to Google, then I went down to the local Verizon store and played with the phone.  I loved the interface and the look of the live tiles, but it still took me a couple of days to decide I was comfortable moving away from Android.  I am so glad I did.Pros:-price.  There just is not another deal like this out there.-Windows8 Phone OS.  It is so simple, visually attractive, fast, and stable.  My apps launch now, switching between apps or from apps to the home screen, the phone never hangs.  It just runs silky smooth everywhere, and everything is easy to find and work with.  Apps just work in WP8, and they work the same way every time.  I had a lot of on again/off again functionality with the Droid apps, they would work like they were supposed to most of the time, but sometimes they wouldn't.  The Droid OS did the same kind of stuff to me, sometimes it would sign on to the wireless at work or home automatically like it was supposed to, sometimes it wouldn't and I would need to do it manually.  I also love being able to uninstall any app, I hated the amount of pre-loaded crap that was on my Droid.  There is a ton more to love about WP8, like the way it consolidates all of your contact information from multiple sources into one contact (so facebook profile, LinkedIn profile gmail profile, etc... for the same person are all presented to you as a unified profile with all the data from the separate services, but the profiles all remain distinct in the background and can be edited individually), but I won't get into every bit of it, you should just try it yourself.-email client. This really belongs under the WP8 OS heading, but that was getting long and the email interface is so nice on this phone that it deserves it's own section.  It's the little things, but it really is the most pleasant email interface I have used.  Gmail works flawlessly here too.-Integration with other Microsoft services.  I love how smooth the MS Office apps work here, they are so useable it is just a pleasure to work with Excel, Word, Outlook, PP, etc...-MS SmartGlass integration.  I am a gamer and Xbox is my proffered platform for consoles (I have and like a PS3 as well but the 360 is what I use for multiplayer so I use it a lot more).  The SmartGlass app works so smoothly and is so cool, it is just a great feature.  I know it is available on Android/iOS as well, but it just functions flawlessly here on WP8.  Spartan Assault is also very cool, really good Halo game on a phone.-Nokia phone.  I have always loved Nokias and this is no exception.  Good solid build quality and well thought out overall.-Performance.  This phone blazes and switches between tasks so fast.  It is only a dual core, 1.5 GHz processor but it really works great.  From what I have read (and experienced), WP8 is not the processor hog that Android is.-Battery life.  I can go a whole day and part of the next without a recharge unless I am hammering it with games/video and tons of downloading.  This was my main complaint about my Droid and I am really pleased with the Nokia battery so far.  It also has built in wireless charging.  I didn't think I cared about this until I tried it, now I won't be going back to plugging in a phone to charge, ever.-Reception.  I get 4G reception with this phone in areas where my wife is only getting 3G, and I get signal in pretty remote areas where others are getting nothing.  I hike and ride my mountain bike pretty deep in the boonies, so this is really great.  I will add here that while the Nokia Here maps program doesn't have as much \"places\" detail as Google maps, it does give you the option to download the maps to the phone so you can view it offline.  Handy feature for those aforementioned trips to the boonies.  The maps themselves are good as well, and I like the directions feature better than Google maps.-Camera.  The camera is great, it is a champ in low light conditions and the xenon flash produces great looking (if not quite true to life) colors, I love it.  That's all I am going to say on he camera, but there are lost of detailed review of it out there.-Screen.  The screen is beautiful and the colors are so vibrant.  Pics and video look great as well, best phone screen I have owned.Cons:-App selection for app hounds.  I have found an app to replace most all that I used on Android, but there is not even close to the selection.  The big ones are here though for the most part and the app list is growing daily.-Google integration is not seamless as it is with Android.  I hesitate to put this under \"Cons\" because I have gotten Google to work pretty good here.  It is not automatic as it is with an Android device however.  The niggle is Google Calender, it doesn't integrate fabulously yet because Google hasn't supported WP8 with an app, but it does work via the email section with alerts etc..., you just have to use the Google mobile site to work with the calender itself.  Google maps must be used on the mobile site as well.-Can't expand internal storage. The 928 has 32GB of internal storage, so you have a lot on board, but you can't install any more.  This is mitigated by really easy and free access to MS SkyDrive.  You can set the phone up to automatically backup your pics, videos, docs, whatever to SkyDrive so you don't need to keep everything on the device.  I don't mind but other might, so I am including it on the \"Cons\" list.-Can't replace the battery manually.  I never carried an extra battery with me until I got my Droid, and I haven't carried one since I got rid of my Droid, so there's that.  I also have a roll up solar charging mat I carry in my backpack, so I don't need an extra battery when I go out in the boonies.  If my internal battery starts to significantly degrade before my 2 year contract is up, this will turn into a problem for me.These are the only negatives I can come up with yet, but I will edit my review if I come up with some more.  I was initially worried about committing to two years of WP8, but I couldn't be happier with my choice.

Been very happy with Amazon's service when I needed an exchange. There was an initial smudge on the screen and my order was promptly replaced with no questions asked. This second one is looking very good.Product:- Well designed and constructed. My HTC Thunderbolt had issues that I don't see here.- One of the best things I can say is that this phone is fast. Loading apps, switching, closing, playing is all snappy and fluid. I trust it will hold up with future OS updates.- It's a bit of a heavy phone if you're going to compare it to the iPhone, though much larger. I likely the matte finish of the black over the glossy finish of the white. It fits in a pocket well. The main issue I have with this is that when it's sitting flat on the back the Carl Zeiss shiny area rests a bit higher than the rest of the phone.- Wireless charging is a huge plus. I rather enjoy not having to plug this thing in when I get home.- The screen is fantastic. Nokia's PureBlack tech is good to have and it has some vibrant colors.- Camera is also great. This takes amazing low-light photos. I was recently out at a party after sunset and was able to take portraits with little flash needed (if any). Nokia has some good apps to help take advantage of this capability.- It's mostly rectangular with slightly curved edges but has a slightly curved back to help the stereo speaker, which sounds great.OSI do like Windows Phone and I think the platform has something going for it. It integrates well with my Surface and xBox. So you can clearly see I'm in the platform deep. Good SkyDrive compatibility and I can edit Word docs with no problem. Sure there are some apps to be desired but that's mostly items I check every now and then. Development is good from Nokia and independent developers (i.e., Using \"Instance\" as an Instagram app and 6sec as a Vine app). Some features Microsoft really needs to communicate better about. For instance, using the people hub to connect to multiple social networks is really great. The photos hub can filter out all these social interactions for just photo-related posts from my contacts. The gaming hub notifies me when my xBox friends come online and want to play a specific game.

There are a multitude of photo-editing apps available.Windows8: The operating system is the biggie here as it is the interface between you and the phone. I'm not a great fan of Microsoft forcing Windows8 on desktops or laptops but it's great for mobile devices. It's easy and quick to learn and easy to customize. One thing I love is the return button. If you click something by mistake, you can simply hit the return button and go back, with Apple products you have to go home and then click the app again. Another thing I like is the search button, no need to find the app to search; the bad thing is that the search engine is Bing!The browser is fast and I can load up image/content heavy websites fast. Actually the whole phone is fast.Battery: Hard to say so far. It's supposed to be good, but I've been using the phone almost non-stop playing games and it's lasting less than a whole day. I like the charge port is at the top, seems more convenient that way. Unfortunately, you cannot remove the permanent battery for a fresh one. This means I will have to keep a charging cord with me while out and playing marathon games. But at least it doesn't use some kind of proprietary cable.Phone: Call quality is fine. This phone will be a good choice for Verizon customers.Apps: Migrating over from Apple products, some of the apps I use like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. are missing but that's the price of Windows. It was a long process to download the initial app because you have to go through a tedious initial set up. Update: There are some complaints about the lack of apps but I'm starting to find a lot of apps now, including an app that gives you Google. And I really like Nokia's Map Here which is even available offline.Overall very satisfied with it. The important things are that it's very fast and the operating system easy to learn. I give it 9/10, the 1 pt deduction being the permanent battery and on Amazon's 5 star rating system, that is still 5 stars.Update 1: The phone has also survived it's first drop on the floor.Update 2: 5 mins ago, the phone was dropped again by the same culprit, this time on its corner. The top part of that corner actually popped off about 1mm along the edge but we just popped it in again.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "FESAL ALTOUKHY", "ReviewID": "R1I10O326BNHPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been the happy owner of iPhone for 3 years.

The addition of a AMOLED screen makes this phone a winner in terms of display over the other phones and the Windows Phone is snappy and intuitive.

Very fluid with swipes and works well outside. Just yesterday a friend was trying to show me a photo on his iPhone5 while we were outside on a sunny day we were trying to shade it with our hands so we could see something/anything. The Nokia 928 has no such problems.Photos are great, especially indoor photos which would normally not come out well on a camera phone. Nokia Smart Shoot takes 5 photos with just one push of the button. When doing family shots it's great. You take a photo, which is really five, then you flip through the five and pick your favorite. Panorama is pretty cool too but I don't use it as much.Nokia maps, city lens, and drive are great! The ability to use the drive with no data usage is key to keeping your data usage down. The ability to set if and when it sounds the speeding warning is great. You can set different levels for speeds posted over and under 30 mph. So for under 30 I have it set to 5, for over 30 it is set to 9. The only thing I wish the Nokia drive had was an option to show a line by line of the directions. My Garmin has that feature and I used it often.The OS is the best. I love the live tiles and the ability to change the size of the tiles. If you use a app or feature more often you can give it a larger tile to make it easier to see/tap. Pining and unpinning tiles to the start page is a breeze.People hub is amazing for those that use there phone as a social device.All the Microsoft products that are included are great for people that use it more as a business phone.Cons:If you are coming from Apple the lack of some apps will be troublesome to you. Windows now has about 5.6% of the smartphone market, up from 3.8 YOY according to Kantor Research. I think once it hit's about 10% which should be early next year the apps will really start coming in.Size: If you are coming from an iPhone the phone might seem too large. Trying to use it with a single hand if you are a woman or a man with small hands might be difficult. I wanted a bigger screen to make web browsing and typing easier so I was appreciative of the larger screen.Finishing thoughts: The Nokia deserves a look whether you are entering the smartphone market for the first time or thinking of switching from Apple or Android.

I really like the tile interface on the phone form factor.  I mostly text and read emails on my phone but the tiles make it easy to get updates on scores and news events.  The interface is very intuitive and most functions can be completed with just a thumb.Battery life has been outstanding so far.  I used to turn off 4G on my old phone to preserve battery but so far I have left it on with the Lumia 928 and easily get a full day of mixed usage.The one thing I thought I would miss from Android is the lack of LED alerting.  I like to keep my ringer off and get notification of new email, appointment,  text or phonecall based on the color LED.  This phone doesn't have that feature, however I am not missing it as much as I expected.  I generally leave the alerts on low volumne and they are sufficient to have me check my messages without being overly intrusive to those around me.The integration with Skydrive for the camera app is a nice feature that automatically backs up you photos to the cloud.  I was surprised that my favorites from IE on my desktop didn't sync like they would to my Surface tablet but I have missed this less than I thought because of the live tiles.

I didn't like the iOS7 update at all, and I was already ready for a change of scenery. I needed a smartphone so my choices came down to an Android phone or a Windows Phone (since I had seen the trouble Blackberry had been having).  Many of my friends have Android phones and they always complain about random things going wrong with it or just a laggy experience in general.  Maybe there's an Android phone out there for me, but after talking to my friends, I decided to look elsewhere.When I started reading about Windows Phone, it seemed like many of the tech review sites were mostly negative.  They'd say a few nice things about a Windows Phone, but then they'd go on to talk about how it doesn't stack up to iPhone and Android phones.  In my experience using my new Lumia 928, I've gotta say I only find it lacking in battery life (which may be because I've been playing with it constantly since I've gotten it.  I have a feeling I'll make it from sun up to sun down once the shine wears off a bit.Pros:Windows Phone interface is clean.  The live tiles are a refreshing change of pace from the boring icons that I was used to on iOS.The camera is great on this phone.  If you get this phone, make sure and use the Nokia Pro Camera app.  I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I can get from this phone, and I was already pretty happy with the job the iPhone 4s did.  This wins hands down.Fast.  I don't know how they did it, but they made this system run very smoothly and with great speed.  Apps load quickly on this phone and the transition animations don't feel like they are covering up lag like other phones I've used.Nokia Apps.  Nokia did a really good job of creating apps that make this experience a great one.  Nokia Pro Camera, Nokia Creative Studio, NOKIA MUSIC (HELLO!), Nokia Here Maps, Nokia Here City Lens, etc are really great, high quality apps that make this phone stand out over even other Windows phones.Cons:Learning Curve.  If you've never had a smartphone before, I don't think the learning curve will be too bad.  A lot of the interface is very intuitive.  However, coming from iOS, I had to give myself a good 2 days of getting familiar with the phone before my head stopped spinning completely.  :)  It's just a different way of doing things, and I'm glad that I stuck with it.Battery life.  I'm really hoping my battery will get me through to bed time once I start using it normally like I used my iPhone.  I plan to get a wireless charger for my desk at work though just in case I get in a pinch.Apps.  If you like Pinterest, you're not going to find it on this phone just yet (Sept. 2013).  All of the apps I used on my iPhone are on my Lumia so I'm good on that.  However, if you always want the newest app on the day it comes out, you'll need to stick with iOS or Android in some cases.  Don't count the Windows Phone app selection out though.  YOu really should look for yourself.Wrap Up:I'm sincerely delighted to have this phone in my possession.  I never enjoyed the iPhone for the 14-15 months that I had it.  Don't get me wrong.  The phone did just about everything I wanted it to do.  I just didn't enjoy it.  Using this phone is a pleasure, and it's going to take something really special from another company to pull me away from Windows Phone.UPDATE:My issues with battery life are no more!  I get through the whole day with the phone now with normal use.  There's some juice left over at the end of the day, but I charge it every night so it'll be full for the following day.  I stream music and videos a lot on my phone, and I use it constantly at work for email and calls, so I'm really pleased to see that I get through the day with it.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I expeccted and more", "Author": "C.

The people on the other line can still hear you talking, but you can hear them at all.  It fixes itself if you knock the back of the phone on your leg, but that is only a temporary solution that you have to repeat multiple times a call.

Not so good but I really liked the idea of easy sync with my computer.  Since then I have had about 6 phones...blackberry, I-Phone, and android with my most recent the Droid RAZR MAXX HD.  The Blackberry's were great but started falling behind.  The Androids are fun but a little buggy, and the I-Phone and I just are not compatible.Then along came the Nokia 928 to Verizon, I love it.  It is not as playful and gadget filled as others but it just plain works effectively and trouble free.  It is not as \"Powerful\" as some, but it does not need the same amount of processing power because the operating system is much more efficient than Android.  This 928 is every bit as fast as the MAXX HD, I-Phone, S3 and S4The battery specs also do not match some others, but I am just going to say the battery life is just as good as what I experienced on my Droid RAZR Maxx HD, my son's S4 and the I-Phone.  The sound quality on calls is every bit as good and the external speaker for music and speaker phone is definitely better.I read in one review that the NFC does not work with Android devices.  This is simply not true.  Maybe it does not work with all, but I know for a fact it works with my wife's S3 and my Son's S4.  We have traded pictures, videos and other data with NFC.I read in another review that the pictures are not very good or have a red tint. This has not been my experience.  The quality is definitely not as good as our fancy DSLR but it is as good as our small point and shoot digital.  Video is also very good for a phone.The call quality and reception seems to be the best of all the phones I have owned.  Even with a large multi-layer protective cover and skinomi skin.And now the \"lack of Apps.\"  I am not one who likes to use my phone as a level or as entertainment for my 5 year old.  I use my phone for communication, keeping my schedule, music, and tracking my rides and hikes.  Guess I also use it for maps and travel...I do use it for a lot of things and I have found all the apps I need...for free.  And I must admit my five year old has been playing games.So In summary, this phone is better than any android, blackberry, and i-phone I have ever used. In the month and half I have had this phone there has been no freezes and the touch screen is great. Its not ass powerful or feature rich as some, but t does not need to be...it is more efficient..and better in my opinion.

I guess since it's a phone I'll start with the voice quality. It is as clear as a land line, and that has not always been my experience with smart phones. I've had numerous other smartphones, the most recent an HTC Thunderbolt that had fairly poor call quality. The speaker phone has great quality too.The camera is incredible. Even the front facing camera produces high quality photos, and the phone has a number of built-in photo editing features. I've been trying to find a receipt scanning software program that will replace manually entering my business expenses, but the cameras on my other portable devices don't have good enough resolution for those great programs to work. Last night I tried scanning on my 928 and it came out crystal clear.That brings me to Windows Apps. That is the one weakness with this phone. I didn't realize how much I was going to miss the huge selection of Android apps. Windows has all the basics in productivity, games, entertainment, but just doesn't have as much to choose from. I'm sure that will improve with time.I bought the wireless charging pad and love it. No hooking the phone up to it. I just lay the phone on the charging pad (which does have to be plugged in to the wall or a computer). This phone charges faster than any smartphone I've had in the past. However, if you're using programs heavy on graphics like games, it goes through battery pretty quickly. I'm not getting nearly as much time per charge as I expected. The fact that it has a sealed battery means that I can't just pop in a spare battery when I run down, so it's essential to have a portable battery to plug into on the go or a phone charging cable.Customizing the home screen is easy, making it convenient to access the icons I need most often.The only button placement I don't like is the camera button. I take dozens of accidental pictures every day because that button is fairly sensitive and is placed on the side right where the heel of my hand fits. If I change to hold it in my left hand, my little finger rests on that button and triggers it. Hopefully I'll get used to this problem and adjust my touch.The phone has a good heft to it, feeling like it's made of good quality materials, but not so heavy that it bothers me. I have fairly large hands for a woman, and it fits just right in my hand. I bought this phone on the recommendation of a friend who has much smaller hands than I and the size is no problem for her.Overall, I'm happier with this phone than any I've owned in the past.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Standout Phone / Initial Impressions / Windows 8", "Author": "Publicagent \"Publicagent\"", "ReviewID": "R22LORSR05QYKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: this is my first smartphone. I have a Google Nexus 7, and Apple laptop and desktop. So why would I get the Lumia 928? 1) It's the best reviewed phone on Verizon. 2) I like what I have seen of Windows 8 touchscreens. 3) I am impressed with Nokia's direction. 4) I wanted a high quality camera. 5) It's free.PHONE - It's difficult to separate the phone from the operating system, but I will try. First, call quality is outstanding. I had my clearest conversation ever on this phone. The speaker phone works great. The pictures are superb with nice editing options from Nokia. Personally I like the size/shape. It feels great in the hand, and can stand upright. Te screen is just large enough for e-reading, and comfortable enough for the pocket. In fact, I am very impressed with the screen. It really jumps out.HOME SCREEN - Beautifully done. The Windows tiling system is the best option out there. I enjoyed customizing my Nexus, but just picking and choosing where you put apps is not the same. Sizing the apps (only 3 options), placing them, and coloring them is fun and makes for a more enjoyable experience. On the downside, the tiles are unequal in live updates. Some provide them, some do not. Some update better than others. Still, what I see in front of me looks great, and gives me critical information.GOOGLE/APPLE USERS - I was initially concerned. There is a Windows Phone App for Mac. I downloaded it as the Getting Started pamphlet suggested. I uploaded iphotos and isongs to the phone, no problem. Gmail is my primary email. The phone tells me when I have new messages on the lockscreen, and my homescreen email tile. The interface when opening gmail is black and white, and it doesn't separate the promotions, updates, etc. into tabs. Basically it does what I need, minus the ads. Also, it logs threads. The simplicity is actually refreshing. Google Calender is my calendar. Although not as slick as on Android, it gets the job done. I don't see how to view the calendar weekly, but all of my upcoming appointments are listed under \"agenda\" for as far down as I can scroll. Daily appointments are visible on a homescreen calendar tile.APPS - There are lots of free apps for ereading (kindle looks great), audiobooks, photos, flashlights, social media, news, music, games, etc. The Windows App market is growing rapidly. I have found their selection to be more than adequate in almost all cases. For particular niches, in my case chess (semi-serious player), the app market can be too weak. A great thing about the lower selection is that it's easier to find cool apps that get buried elsewhere. For instance, I found a white noise sleeping app that I would have never looked up. There are far more apps than expected, and Nokia's own apps are an added bonus.WINDOWS 8/LUMIA 928 - It's absurd that some have said Windows 8 is not ready for prime-time. It's far from perfect, but it's fun, slick and improving fast. I have composed audio emails and texts flawlessly. I was able to download super cool free ringtones from the App store. Pandora has no ads! The settings could have more options, but they do the essentials. Having a basic free Office program is nice. Explorer reads differently depending on the page, but it's usually very clear. The back button works better than Android. The keyboard is solid. All apps are one swipe away. Did I mention my homescreen looks great? No crashes or stalls.OVERALL - I am very happy with this phone. I was hesitant to finally make the $30 a month jump to the smartphone world. Now I can't believe I waited so long. My camera, ipod, tablet and GPS have been subsumed into one device that is ridiculously underpriced. Why get bogged down by particular platforms? These days it's super-easy to jump from Apple to Android to Windows and back again. Windows 8 is a solid 4 stars on the mobile platform, and the Nokia Lumia 928 is a definite 5. There is a reason why the Verizon attendant said no one is returning with problems with this phone, whereas they regularly do for Android. Nokia has been in the phone-making business for a long time and it really shows. Windows 8 is contemporary, and will only get better. They make a standout combination. Why get what everyone else has? You will stand out with this phone.UDPATE: Love Nokia Music, the free version that comes with the phone. Audio commands work quite well. Photo editing has been fun.

There is no lag. Every app runs and opens quickly. Shoot, nearly all of the apps look absolutely gorgeous on this screen.I have played a few games on this (Mass Effect: Infilitrator and Halo: Spartan Assault) and both games load really quickly and run well on the phone, although extensive high graphics gaming will drain the battery. Super fun games, by the way.2) The camera is just so so good. Video, photo, low light, high light, all good. It's only - only - weakness is if you're near a bright window, it always tends to make the subject dark. But, for the advanced photographer, it includes controls of Exposure, ISO, and white balance, as well as the typical \"scenes\" presets. With this you can overcome those problems. The flash is good too, but I normally choose to see the low-light power excel than use the flash.Add in Nokia's Photobeam, which lets you connect a slideshow of your phone's photos to any web browser on any screen, and it's a great photo suite. I haven't even touched Nokia's many Lens apps: burst shots, panorama app, etc.3) Nokia is awesome. Especially Here apps. Here Drive is their built in Turn-by-Turn voice navigation with OFFLINE function! So useful. Here Maps is just a plain good maps app, and if you want your direction in a viewable list, you use this.Here City Lens is a really cool app which lets you find stuff near you by just raising the camera, and it will list all local stuff in that direction. So. Nifty.The phone does all normal tasks super well, and it's special features just boost the quality of the phone. Nothing lacking here, I'd recommend anyone get it.

Had it for about 4 months and hated it.  Build quality was poor, battery performance was horrendous, and the screen was nearly invisible outside on a bright day, and totally invisible when I had my polarized sun glasses on.  Gave it to my daughter who loved her S3.  So I picked up the Nokia 928 Windows 8 Phone.  The phone has been awesome. Build quality is far better than the Galaxy S4 and has none of the screen visibility problems of the S4.  I can see the screen clearly in full sunlight and even with my polarized sunglasses.

It feels extremely natural in your hands, and it is a great weight and size, although compared to other smartphones it is a tad large. However, the size of this smartphone allows for a flawless 1080p HD display. The display on this phone is excellent, and it can even be viewed well from angles or in sunlight. The most prominent feature of this phone is the camera. The Nokia Lumia 928 takes unbelievably clear pictures, videos, and panorama; they look better on the phone than they do in person! It has stabilizing picture technology, and even if you don't have a steady hand the pictures and videos will turn out great. The camera also works exceptionally well in the darkness, better than those of other smartphones. The microphones (there are multiple) all work together to provide a flawless experience, people on the other line report my voice sounding just like it does in person, and voice recognition has yet to fail for me. The Nokia Lumia 928 has ample storage space for all of your needs and it is easy to transfer files between your phone and computer. The speaker on this phone can easily fill a room, and I prefer that in the interface it measures volume on a scale of 1-30, so you are allowed far more customization.That brings us to the next point, the vast customization you are given on the Nokia Lumia 928. Thanks to Windows 8 on this smartphone, the home page is exactly how you want it. You can adjust how big and small tiles are, where they are, what color you want them, if you want them at all, and you can add as many tiles as you want. You can also pick whatever theme of colors you want on your phone, and you can change it depending on your mood. No other operating system can offer such a unique experience that fits around how you use your phone. It is extremely smooth, quick, and easy to use. Internet Explorer, the default internet browser on this phone, works just as well as its competitors on other smartphones. However, with the Windows 8 operating system comes the biggest flaw of this phone, the smaller library of applications in the store. Not all of your favorite applications from IOS and Android will be available in the Windows Store, although many of them or their counterparts are. Don't let this turn you away from this phone, all app core functionality of other smartphones is matched if not surpassed by the Nokia Lumia 928. All of the big name applications are supported anyway, (Skype, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and you will find that you could easily live without some of your past apps on other devices. If you happen to own an Xbox this phone works quite nicely in conjunction with it using Xbox SmartGlass. It is a cool feature, but it doesn't bring too much to the table. There's also a wide variety of games to pick from either on the Xbox Marketplace or on the Windows Store. This Windows Phone also offers Microsoft Office right out of the box which is nifty for editing documents. You won't find yourself bored or having a lack of options, for there are plenty of things to do.The Nokia Lumia 928 takes no time to get used to. The battery life will certainly hold; it will make it through a day's usage.

I decided to try the Nokia with the mobile Windows because I resist following the crowd into iPhones and Samsung Android phones.  Also, I don't think I need millions of different apps to choose from - I find it kind of confusing actually.The Nokia Lumia 928 is attractive, simple to use, has some nice apps from both Nokia and Microsoft to try, and easy to customize - so far.  But I discovered that the first phone I received had a problem with its speaker phone.  I could hear everybody just fine, but they couldn't hear me.  So I replaced it via Amazon and the process of doing so was easy.  Now I've had the replacement phone just a few days and yesterday it locked up in such a way that I couldn't even shut it down because the slide screen (which you use to shut the power off) was totally unresponsive - or so I thought until I researched the problem online and found a means to a soft reset that worked.

I like to feel something before I spend this much money on it.This is my first smart phone on a contract; from a basic phone paid month to month, to this. It was very easy to learn, and customizable.Things I didnt like:All of your apps except music are all in an alphabetical list if you swipe to the left. In Android and IOS, you can drag and drop icons and folders to group things. In Windows Phone 8, its all just there. You can pin apps to your main screen, but it can get cluttered if you have too many there. Ive got just enough to not have to scroll down at all.If you add something like facebook or hotmail, all of your friends information will be imported into your \"People\" tile. This is your address book. I removed facebook on here for that reason, I dont want 200 phone numbers in there when I only talk to a few people.The contract can be expensive, Ive got 500 mb a month plan and its 99.70 a month. I barely use 100 mbs, but some people will used more-------------------------Things I like:Camera is good, I think. The most advanced camera Id used before this was the iPod touch 4. Compared to that, this is like HD.Battery is AWESOME. I can make it 2 days with use throughout the days, before hitting 0. On constant battery saver mode, I can make it 3 - 4 days. Battery saver with music on at all times will drain it in about 24 - 32 hours.You can sync all of your microsoft accounts, like hotmail, skydrive, xbox live; all that, to your phone and check updates for those on here.All of the pictures you take are auto uploaded to your skydrive.Its got nice, comfortable edges. Not super rounded like samsung, and not rigid like a brick. I like how almost the whole front face is the screen; makes you feel like youre in the future.There is a bing search button built into the screen, next to the windows button. Sometimes it might get in the way, but its nice when you hear a song and youre thinking, \"Ive heard this, what is it?\" You can run your search and click on the music note, and it listens to tell you.

The people on the other line can still hear you talking, but you can hear them at all.  It fixes itself if you knock the back of the phone on your leg, but that is only a temporary solution that you have to repeat multiple times a call.

There are a lot of good things in the phone that are more than praiseworthy.  Yet there are also just enough misses to make it tough to live on a platform with little traction.First, the UI is sweet!  There really isn't a better interface on the other platforms.  Microsoft should be given accolades for finding the right mix of form, functionality, and customization.  The lack of color options, however, is a detraction as the monochrome nature of the interface can cause eye strain.  Additionally, although Bluetooth is available, MS has restricted the use of some devices such as keyboards. Granted the virtual keyboard is fabulous, but sometimes one just wants a proper tactile keyboard. This is one of those moments where the phone gets close, but not quite.  Its got Bluetooth, but not the way it should.Similarly, the \"gloved mode\" of the touchscreen was a major selling point. Alas, by glove they mean something such as a batting glove.  Winter and decent leather gloves won't work.  NFC is available on the phone, but you cannot transfer files to Android devices which are far more prominent than other Windows phones.  The often mentioned Kids Corner works - but is not the separate login you might think.  Also advertised is that the phone comes with free music services.  Indeed, both Nokia Music and Pandora are free.  Pandora, however, is free only until the end of the year and the Nokia Music is no better than other services - unless you pay for the premium version.Another big selling point is the camera.  This was the biggest letdown. While good for a smartphone, the depth of the pictures taken paled in comparison to the iPhone and Galaxy.  The Lumia also added a bluish tint to the pictures.  Nothing horrendous but certainly something distracting. Admittedly, the low light pictures were better than on other smartphones but worse than on many point and shoot or slr cameras.  The Panorama mode also was somewhat frustrating as you have to match each shot with a little circle that appears.  If as you're moving the camera becomes uncertain where you are, then you have to start that shot again.  This can cause a panorama shot to take a few minutes to successfully shoot.  Admittedly, having the \"lens\" options is a very cool feature that other OSs should emulate.  Especially since there are relatively few useful lenses on the Windows ecosystem.As for the more standard functions, such as outgoing and incoming calls, the Lumia failed here.  For some reason the phone would have a tendency to make the call fade in and out or add static.  Someone suggested it has to do with the placement of the attena in the phone.  When the static or fading didn't happen the call was relatively clear with people on the other end remarking that I was as clear as if I were on a landline.  Its nice that WP8 offers caller announce.  Its unfortunate, however, that there is no notification center and there won't be one until at least sometime in 2014.Browsing the web was fast with the compression that IE10 offers.  Some sites, however, still don't render perfectly (whether you choose mobile or desktop version) and trying to close popups or jquery windows can become bothersome if not outright impossible.  This, however, might also have been related to the problem of the touchscreen sometimes being just slightly off and having to press above the desired point rather than directly on it.  It would, however, be prudent for IE to have a forward button.  The data sense provided by Verizon is something that should be emulate$ every carrier on every OS.Music playback through the headphones was exceptionally clear though lacking on the speaker.  Windows Phone, however, does have a problem playing aac or wav files.  The speech system offerred by Microsoft is pretty good at identifying what was said by the user, although not so good at actually doing what was asked.  In other words, when you record a note, it will be reasonably (not perfectly) accurate in what you say (and even keep a copy of your voice with the text).  If you give it a command, however, don't expect it to actually do what you ask.  Mostly that is because of the paltry number of command.  This will likely improve as more apps make use of the speech functions (currently many apps skip that functionality).The apps, of course, are perhaps the biggest thing hurting Windows Phones right now. True, Nokia's mapping applications are the best out there (shows speed, can eliminate tolls/highways/etc. from your trip), Skype is fully integrated, and there is even Microsoft Office.  There is, however, a very long list of missing apps.  Even the ones that are present are subpar or costlier when compared to their counterparts on IOS and Droid. Many don't integrate Live Tiles.  Even the ones that do, have a tendency to freeze, rendering the app to be little more than an icon on the alphabetized app list.  To have a chance at unfreezing it you either have to do a hard re-boot or uninstall/reinstall.

A few months ago I started running into annoying issues that are only getting worse every day.Pros:-Great camera that takes high quality pictures-Nice big screen-The phone displays a list of predicted words while texting, which is usefulCons:-Hardware and software issues. Camera only works sometimes - hard/soft reset do not solve it. The solution I found online is to apply pressure to the phone, which fixes it SOMETIMES.-The big feature of having a Xenon flash is eclipsed by the flash only working occasionally.-Lock button does not work sometimes-Phone gets caught in loops and behaves randomly when some apps are selected-Touchscreen is unresponsive a lot of the time-The backlights of the three face \"buttons\" are yellow and have dark spots that ruin the appearance. A common issue.-NO APPS. There are some useful apps you can find, but if you are looking for the latest trending apps and most popular apps (like flappy bird, instagram..) you're out of luck. You will have to deal with a buggy version that's on the market, because the official apps aren't available. Kind of makes you feel left out when Apple and Android have so many apps you are left out of.My phone probably has some of these hardware issues because I dropped it once or twice.

I've owned this phone for a little over a month and so far I am impressed with the overall package.The Windows OS was VERY easy to learn.  Took me about 30mins just playing around with the phone to be fully confident that I could preform any task that I needed to with the phone.  I was also surprised to find that pretty much all of the Apps that I used were available on the Windows App Store (I went the Windows App Store website to check). The only exception was my bank which turned out to not be a problem because I just Pinned a Tile (placed a shortcut) of the bank's website to my home page. App problem solved! What I was most excited about and also most concerned about with a Windows phone were the Live Tiles. For things like the weather, stock, and even the dictionary.com word of the day, information just pops up without having to open an App to see it.  This works beautifully and most Apps have an option to use the Live Tiles in someway or another.  I thought that with all my Apps updating live my battery would die quick and my 1GB data limit would be used up even quicker but I found that I could control if I wanted an App to update and I could also control the frequency so I haven't had a problem at all with either the battery life or with excessive carrier data usage (btw I haven't gone over my data limit yet because I download the major stuff via Wifi and use it while I'm out)Now as for the device, Nokia did a wonderful job creating this phone.Things I liked (LOVED).1. Offline turn by turn navigation- Nokia HERE maps and HERE drive (don't know HOW it works but I've set my phone to airplane mode and used the GPS many times already. Mainly to see if it would work as advertised...Needless to say, the Nokia passed with flying colors).2. Offline streaming radio playlists. So I love listening to music but I take trains where I don't have service so Nokia's Music App let's me download either a pre-made or created playlist to my phone for FREE so I can listen to music even without service.3. Wireless charging!4. The photos are awesome; especially for low light.5. I've already dropped this phone about 6 times now without a case and it still doesn't have a scratch.What I dislike about the phone1. The look of the calendar, I wish that the stock calendar App had slightly bigger font for the month view like the Apps you can get from the Windows App store.2. Wish that I could download my voicemail messages without get charged a monthly fee. (I think that's a Verizon thing)3. The media volume should be separated from the ringer volume.

Verizon customers can therefore rejoice that they can get their hands on one of the few high end phones on the market that isn't a \"me too\" phone.  Like the 920, the 928 has a 4.5 inch screen (a sharp and vivid 1280x768), a zippy dual-core 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, and a gig of RAM.  I've put this phone through the hell known as my backpack and the 928 has triumphed - still no scratches on the wall-to-wall gorilla glass screen or on the matte polycarbonate body.  Since one of the reasons I love this phone is the form factor, I'm very happy it hasn't been degraded no matter how often it gets jostled.I had a Lumia 900 for a long time before upgrading to the 928, and I'm impressed that in under 2 years, Nokia managed to put out a phone that I fell in love with.  This didn't happen the last time I upgraded my iPhone, that was more of a `ho-hum' situation.  This phone sits in the hand better and is easier to hold and use.  It's a little lighter and slimmer than the 920 but continues in the `bigger is better' recent smartphone trend.The really nice upgrade is the Carl Zeiss camera with image stabilization.  The xenon flash gives better low light performance and the 8.7 MP PureView camera takes superbly sharp and vibrant photos.PROS-Impressive photos, including better technology for low light / indoors-Wireless charging-Verizon's impressive coverage-4G-High-performance mic and speaker-Free turn-by-turn navigation, very easy to use Maps, virtual reality, and location-based apps-Still challenges you to be good at maximizing your battery time but less challenging than previous versions-Windows 8 OS, which is intuitive and easy to use, an impressive performer and highly customizable, and a hell of a lot better looking than the iPhone (OS upgrade is expected later this year)-Renders websites beautifullyCONS-Although I have found all of the apps I use regularly, a more app-driven person might not find everything they'd like on the MarketplaceThis phone is gorgeous. Just get ready to be asked a million questions about it when you take it out around a bunch of other people - and then you can tell them just how smokin' a deal the subsidized cost is.Update: I just had a friend visit and she dropped her phone and broke the screen. Being the nice person I am, I let her use my 928 for a couple of days (I roughed it with my old Lumia 920).

I don't sit in front of a computer emailing, twittering, and facebooking friends; and I'm not into games either.  All I really have used this phone for so far is to make phone calls which I could do on any 'dumb' phone.  That's something to consider when purchasing any smart phone.

It's superfast, has a lot of features that are (even for this old bat) very easy to use, and is fun.  If I wasn't pinching my pennies because of this bad economy I would keep it in a heartbeat.  But as the situation is now it looks like I'll be downgrading to a dumb phone.I'm updating this posting after contacting Verizon about switching back to an old fashioned flip phone.  After all is said and done the total savings per month would only amount to around $20 a month.  Seems Verizon has, along with everyone else, raised their rates and fixed it so that it wouldn't make economic sense to switch back.  So, even though I probably won't be using the phone as much as some other users might, I'll be keeping the phone after all. If you have any reservations about upgrading to a smart phone make sure you check out how that is going to change your rates first because once your rate gets changed to a different tier it will never go back to the lower tier again.  Live and learn as they say. When my contract is up I'll just have to switch to another carrier in order to go back to the flip phone rate.

Too bad they didn't stick with ; ) it but I can understand why. This is the perfect business phone.The good (not necessarily in order of importance):1) Windows UI: So much better than android and iOS in my opinion. I upgraded from an iphone 4 which was also an awesome device, but the usability of the Windows Phone OS is so much better, fluid, and easier to manage. iOS just seemed clunky to use in my opinion, even after over a year of heavy use. The Windows phone OS is really a mix of iOS and Android, easier to use than Android but offers more flexibility than iOS.2) Skydrive: Not perfect yet but very awesome none the less. I'm using the Windows 8.1 preview on my tablet/laptop and Skydrive is integrated now into your document libraries. Auto upload of photos and documents from the phone are available through explorer in Windows 8 and vice versa. It's also handy to have skydrive available from a web browser. No more dropbox for me! It works very well and there was no setup required with the exception of having a Microsoft account.3) Nokia Exclusive Apps: Not enough is said about Nokia's app lineup. Photobeamer, the camera app, the augmented reality apps, all very cool and useful. Their GPS navigation app works very well and is fun to use.4) The camera: Top notch awesome photos, good zoom, easily the best camera I have played with on a phone. Night time photos look awesome as well thanks to the fancy flash.5) Office: Out of the box editing word, powerpoint, and excel on the go! Sure, you aren't going to build a whole business presentation on a phone, but making quick edits is very handy. The email app is far superior to android and ios for my business use.6)  Hardware: Very high quality! The screen is top notch, very vivid colors and deep blacks. Videos look amazing. The 928 can hold its own up to a Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. The buttons are well placed, the speaker is loud and clear. Calls are much clearer than my iPhone was. I really like the placement of all buttons on the phone as well. Good spacing and easy to access. I'll also note that it went flying out of my hand screen down into a gravel parking lot. After letting out a loud sissy squeak, I was relieved to find no visible scratches on the screen. Very impressive. With that in mind, cases for this device are pretty limited for now as well as the screen protectors.7) XBOX Live: True they don't have the selection of games that Android or iOS does, but the integration of your XBOX live account is very well done and fun to use. NBA Jam is really fun and the controls/touchscreen work great.8) I could go on about more little things I love about this phone but will cut it short. This is the only Windows Phone you should consider in my opinion. If you are an app fanatic, the Windows OS may not be a good choice yet as they grow the app store. I will say the apps they do have are high quality. For business use, the Nokia with Windows is the clear choice. I may be a little biased towards Windows as an admin, but also enjoy and respect Apple and Google's interfaces as well.The Bad:1) I really don't have any complaints yet after a month of use. A couple freeze ups (thankfully no blue screens!) easily fixed by a reboot.If you are considering this phone, GET IT.

I've run this now for just over a month and only had to reset (power + down volume) 3 times when the OS froze after I asked too much. And I tried to hang the OS! Contrast this to iOS and Android where resets are normative, particularly on Android.Here are my observations:+Verizon's LTE blazes on this phone. I've run up to 8 other devices off of Hotspot and each device has run at multiple MBPS simultaneously. On tests, I've been routinely in the 6-10 MBPS down AND upload speeds. That's faster than most home networks. And unlike cable, which can peak higher, this service was consistent all times of the day.+Nokia's apps are the best. Here Drive+ (plus is free on Nokia phones) is a great driving app and works as good or better than iOS or Google's options. Here City Lens is an amazing app that adds augmented reality to your camera view - say you want to see where you can eat around you. Hold up your phone, select this app, and all the possibly destinations show up on your screen in the direction you are looking. If you find the one you want you can select it and then navigate to it. Nokia also does a great job of filling app vacuums with their own versions of the apps; they create third party apps like CNN, Groupon, FIFA 13, ESPN Fantasy Football, and so on.+The camera is amazing at 8.7 MP and looks even better thanks to the lenses. Nokia and Microsoft's camera apps make this already impressive camera even better. It can do everything that iOS, Android and even Blackberry 10 can do and most of it better. Panorama, Nokia's Cinemagraph (it makes gif like images where you select which parts of the photo to animate), Smart Shoot, and Photsynth are very well done apps all done by Microsoft and Nokia. Photo adjustment apps thrive with the great camera. The free Fotor is great for editing as well.+The OS is smooth, doesn't hang, doesn't freeze and multitasks as good as or better than any of the other OSs.+The Xbox integration is great. I love the games available and I love that many have Xbox achievements. If you are in to Xbox you'll want this. I can't tell you how many hours I played Shuffleboard to get the last achievement! I love Carcassonne, Civilization Revolution, and many of the Microsoft exclusive games available.+Almost all the apps I need are available on WP8. Facebook, Evernote, LinkedIn, Twitter, My Fitness Pal are all first party apps. Other companies have done a fine job of bringing over other apps until the official ones are made. So I still have access to Pinterest, Wordpress, Vine, Google Play Music, Instagram, and my banks.+I love the integration in the ME tile with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. It gives me quick ways to see and share with all my friends and acquaintances.-Battery life on the 928 is no better than your average Android phone. Some Windows Phones do have better battery life but not this one. However, it is not worse than any Android either. Just have a charger nearby. Especially for gaming.-Games are too expensive. Some very basic games, like Monopoly from EA, are normal price $4.99. Most of the games are free or a dollar, like all the Angry Bird and Cut the Rope games, but some are way overpriced. I expect this to change as more games come out. And to be clear, some are worth it. Plants vs Zombies is worth $4.99 and Order & Chaos is worth $6.99 (same as on the other OSs.)-Some obscure apps are not yet available. I really miss Sketchbook Pro (Android) for drawing, but the very well done Fresh Paint app by Microsoft is great for painting.-As of this review, there aren't a ton of great protection options. I've used three different cases and none are as good as an Otterbox. I spoke to an Otterbox rep this week and they were unclear when one would be coming. They don't historically make Nokia cases. But as this phone model continues to sell and Nokia gains back market share I expect this to change.This is a great phone for techie people, gamers, photogs, and for those who just want a phone that works.

It worked smooth and fast and very responsive as well. You can customize just about everything with this phone, the look, size and color of things and the tiles as well. And all change with easy. I like how the live tiles update and all your info is right there on the screen to your preference. The display is the AMOLED display and makes the screan sharp and clear and works nice even in the sunlight. The screen is 4.5 inches which is a decent size.The camera works well in daylight or even low light. It also has a flash which is pretty decent as well. It can record in HD 1080p with noise canceling as well. Call quality is also good, calling and receiving and the speaker on the phone works clear and your able to hear the person as well. It can run on the 4G network and comes with 32 GB of internal storage- I wish it had more but for most users this is plenty of space.

There are a lot of good things in the phone that are more than praiseworthy.  Yet there are also just enough misses to make it tough to live on a platform with little traction.First, the UI is sweet!  There really isn't a better interface on the other platforms.  Microsoft should be given accolades for finding the right mix of form, functionality, and customization.  The lack of color options, however, is a detraction as the monochrome nature of the interface can cause eye strain.  Additionally, although Bluetooth is available, MS has restricted the use of some devices such as keyboards. Granted the virtual keyboard is fabulous, but sometimes one just wants a proper tactile keyboard. This is one of those moments where the phone gets close, but not quite.  Its got Bluetooth, but not the way it should.Similarly, the \"gloved mode\" of the touchscreen was a major selling point. Alas, by glove they mean something such as a batting glove.  Winter and decent leather gloves won't work.  NFC is available on the phone, but you cannot transfer files to Android devices which are far more prominent than other Windows phones.  The often mentioned Kids Corner works - but is not the separate login you might think.  Also advertised is that the phone comes with free music services.  Indeed, both Nokia Music and Pandora are free.  Pandora, however, is free only until the end of the year and the Nokia Music is no better than other services - unless you pay for the premium version.Another big selling point is the camera.  This was the biggest letdown. While good for a smartphone, the depth of the pictures taken paled in comparison to the iPhone and Galaxy.  The Lumia also added a bluish tint to the pictures.  Nothing horrendous but certainly something distracting. Admittedly, the low light pictures were better than on other smartphones but worse than on many point and shoot or slr cameras.  The Panorama mode also was somewhat frustrating as you have to match each shot with a little circle that appears.  If as you're moving the camera becomes uncertain where you are, then you have to start that shot again.  This can cause a panorama shot to take a few minutes to successfully shoot.  Admittedly, having the \"lens\" options is a very cool feature that other OSs should emulate.  Especially since there are relatively few useful lenses on the Windows ecosystem.As for the more standard functions, such as outgoing and incoming calls, the Lumia failed here.  For some reason the phone would have a tendency to make the call fade in and out or add static.  Someone suggested it has to do with the placement of the attena in the phone.  When the static or fading didn't happen the call was relatively clear with people on the other end remarking that I was as clear as if I were on a landline.  Its nice that WP8 offers caller announce.  Its unfortunate, however, that there is no notification center and there won't be one until at least sometime in 2014.Browsing the web was fast with the compression that IE10 offers.  Some sites, however, still don't render perfectly (whether you choose mobile or desktop version) and trying to close popups or jquery windows can become bothersome if not outright impossible.  This, however, might also have been related to the problem of the touchscreen sometimes being just slightly off and having to press above the desired point rather than directly on it.  It would, however, be prudent for IE to have a forward button.  The data sense provided by Verizon is something that should be emulate$ every carrier on every OS.Music playback through the headphones was exceptionally clear though lacking on the speaker.  Windows Phone, however, does have a problem playing aac or wav files.  The speech system offerred by Microsoft is pretty good at identifying what was said by the user, although not so good at actually doing what was asked.  In other words, when you record a note, it will be reasonably (not perfectly) accurate in what you say (and even keep a copy of your voice with the text).  If you give it a command, however, don't expect it to actually do what you ask.  Mostly that is because of the paltry number of command.  This will likely improve as more apps make use of the speech functions (currently many apps skip that functionality).The apps, of course, are perhaps the biggest thing hurting Windows Phones right now. True, Nokia's mapping applications are the best out there (shows speed, can eliminate tolls/highways/etc. from your trip), Skype is fully integrated, and there is even Microsoft Office.  There is, however, a very long list of missing apps.  Even the ones that are present are subpar or costlier when compared to their counterparts on IOS and Droid. Many don't integrate Live Tiles.  Even the ones that do, have a tendency to freeze, rendering the app to be little more than an icon on the alphabetized app list.  To have a chance at unfreezing it you either have to do a hard re-boot or uninstall/reinstall.  The Live Tiles and Voice integration could slay the apps on IOS - but only if companies are willing to develop them for the approximately 3% of global smartphone users with a Windows Phone.Ultimately, this is a phone with so much potential.  It feels great to hold and can do many things.

Software wise, this phone runs the Windows Phone 8 OS. This OS is very different in structure than IOS for the iPhone. For example, while iOS greets you with a list of your apps (which can extend across several screens) the Windows Phone OS greets the user with a bunch of colorful square shaped icons that represent various parts of the OS, for example there is a square for games, and a square for maps and things that the designers of the OS feel that a user would want to have at their fingertips. To get to the apps list you swipe sideways to the list of apps and then scroll up and down to the app you are interested in launching. I don't see any point in comparing and contrasting the iPhone and the Nokia Lumia from a which is better standpoint, I think it is sufficient to point out that their layout is somewhat different. Personally, I think I could get used to the Windows Phone 8 UI but I will probably be keeping my iPhone simply because there are more apps for the iPhone at this point. If the Windows Phone 8 takes off, I am sure there will be more apps for this phone in the future though.In regards to the hardware, the OLED screen is great; the screen is brighter and bigger than my iPhone screen and a real treat to use. The Nokia Lumia has more hardware buttons that the iPhone. There are 3 buttons the bottom, a back button a home button and a search button. There are also 3 buttons on the right hand side of the device and this is where I ran into problems using the phone. I am left handed so I hold the phone in my right hand an navigate with my left hand. The problem is, my right palm would frequently press the button on the lower right of the phone and launch the camera. Since the camera takes a few seconds to load and then a second to turn off, this became somewhat frustrating.I should note that if you are a Mac user you can still use the Nokia Lumia on the Mac, there is a free app you have to download from the Apple App Store, that serves the same purpose for Mac users as the App Store part of the Windows iTunes application does for Windows users of iPhones.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fancy, Sophisticated Smart Phone", "Author": "LA", "ReviewID": "R1OA26R1ETTS5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using an Android smart phone for a couple years now.

And I really don't use a ton of apps or play any games! Just the basic stuff you want!I am now a proud owner of the Galaxy S4 and love it completely. Camera and all.

It's fast and fluid. It just makes sense (coming from a tech that hates Windows 8 on PC!).  I feel it has more polish than the later Android phones (S4 & HTC One) * Big * Feels solid. * Bright, visible in daylight (looks great) * Contrast (darker colors) and font are very easy to read.  Over-sized fonts used thematically actually works. * Wireless charging is great (costs extra for the charger) *  Memory management is good, it will auto-close background apps if it needs more memoryCons: * Heavy * Big * Light color as theme doesn't look good; text doesn't turn black * Glass is not perfectly flat across middle of phone (edges are nicely beveled), noted dimples in middle of glass (not sure it affects the image but I would imagine it has to) * Bezel is large, same size phone as Galaxy S4, but 1/2\" less screen.Use/design--------------------Pros: * Ability to change size and location of tiles is nice * Sounds are pleasant * Larger keyboard is nice, making it easier to type * Voice recognition seemed pretty good at first, more testing neededCons: * Tiles being all one color (stock tiles) is disappointing * Keyboard space is very large, leaving not that much room on display when typing * Sometimes difficult to get keyboard to go away * Spell check isn't as smart as iPhone (not just common typos but nearby letters on keyboard) * Live Tile for email (Linked Inbox) does not update if the new mail was deleted on a synchronized account * For multiple email accounts there is no way to setup a default account to send email fromBattery life-------------------- * Minimal built-in info  > Good app available to show history and time remaining * Decent life on LTE mixed with 3G (18 hours) * On strong LTE signal (minimal use) all day battery life is closer to 8 hours :(Bluetooth-------------------- * Nice search features via voice * When a txt message comes in it offers to read it to you, or you can choose \"ignore\".  You can also reply via voice. * It gets annoying when it's constantly chattering at you though! * It does stop/cancel it's voice prompting if you actually click on the txt on the phone. (good)Phone-------------------- * Phone history doesn't show call duration & no good apps to add feature * 2 click process to answer phone, a little annoying * Randomly seems to drop between 1X (cell signal) and 3G and LTE within a few feet (in a weaker signal area)Camera/video-------------------- * Greens appear saturated (in daylight) * Low light camera white balance is off sometimes. It appears to use a low-level red light to improve picture which causes the color to be off. * Low light (indoor) video is very poor.  Illumination light does little good, typically causing distracting reflections.Apps-------------------- * No keyboard (replacement English) or spell check apps * Calendar: pretty poor implementation;  > no week view  > month view shows # of items but no words, even in landscape view * Nokia Maps app could not locate a gas station within 15 miles, but my GPS showed 2 within 2 miles. * Can't edit excel cells opening from SkyDriveRandom Thoughts-------------------- * Some traffic from phone actually interferes with nearby computer speakers (this has not occurred iPhone4, 4S, 5) causing crackling noises.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "Ajay Goyal", "ReviewID": "R2ISWPK52AM41S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast, not too big, not too small.Very responsive, feels very nice and smooth in hand.Nice to be the only one in the room with this phone and already has around 6-7 converts.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Call duration in the call history?

I've been a long time Android user but was hoping to get everything under the Microsoft roof (Office 365 etc).  To its credit, the set up was easy.

The big shock came when I went to my call history to check the duration of a call and could not find it.  A lengthy call to Verizon tech support and a quick internet search confirmed my fear that the call duration feature was not available!  This is a very basic feature I have had on every cell phone since the dawn of the cell phone era!  I think Microsoft get's unfairly picked on quite a bit, but this is a blunder that is inexcusable.  Even worse, the Windows Phone user forums have been BEGGING for this feature for YEARS!!!  My business relies heavily on the call time and duration from the call history because that's how I get paid.  Seriously Microsoft, you need to learn to walk before you can fly!

Lucky or so I thought.  Initially I was impressed, big screen, loved WP8 (mostly but the OS issues I will leave for an OS specific review site), audio initially sounded great.My first major issue was the camera button, way to easy to push accidentally.  I took more photos of my pocket and side of my car then I had ever with all previous phones, granted they were great pictures, when they didn't blur, but basically useless.  The other problem I had was the cell reception on the phone.  It would constantly jump around between 1-5 bars, literally all over the place.  Initially I thought it might be my location, but I had two other Verizon phones (HTC Trophy & Casino g'Zone Ravine 2) that didn't have that problem.  Anywhere I went, reception was all over the place.  The bars on my phone were more hyper than a Jack Russel Terrier.Other than that I didn't have any problems, for about 25+ days.  Then out of nowhere, the camera failed, camera app would not load, even the flashlight app wouldn't turn on (flash on phone attached to camera).  Around the same time, the ear speaker also failed.  Voices would constantly cut-out, to the point where I could ONLY talk to people on speaker-phone.  I tried every suggestion to fix, soft-reset, hard-reset, hard-reset without restoring anything (that hurt).  Had to send the phone into Verizon and get a refurb (they already had refurbs less than a month after this model had been released, scary).  I got the refurb, and after less than two weeks (Verizon had not even received by first unit back by mail yet!!) the same problem with the ear speaker happens (voices cut-out, must use speaker-phone).  So now I am sending this back and they are sending me an HTC 8x WP.
