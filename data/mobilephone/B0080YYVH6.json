{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Casio Commando a great all around smart phone", "Author": "JT McClure", "ReviewID": "RHS1B3LHPNFH2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Phone Body: After having used BlackBerry for a while, I decided to switch to the Droid craze and finally settled on the Commando. If you're searching for a smartphone that looks as rugged as it actually is, then you cant find a better model. It seems the design of the phone incorporated a body that is almost like a protective after market case you see with other phones. It almost eliminates the need to even buy a protective case! The ports, such as the USB charging port and headphone jack have protective plugs that seal off like gas caps to prevent water leaking inside. The battery cover locks and snaps into place VERY TIGHT as well. Almost too tight at times though, which can be frustrating for a quick battery pull. However its a design limitation that sacrifices battery pulls in order to better protect the phone. So it can be a pro or con depending on your outlook. One notable feature I was was surprised by: THE SPEAKERS! These things can put out some good sound! They are actually louder than a few laptops I've used! I've had the volume at full blast before, with lots of sound and almost no crackling or sound distortion! Everything about this phone screams rugged! Keep in mind however rugged DOES NOT MEAN INVINCIBLE. This phone can be damaged, but its made to withstand wear a tear which it has done for me when other phones were already showing signs of wear. Fortunately I've had this phone for a few months now and it still looks as good as the day I got it. Its suffered a few drops, some rain water, and mud, but nothing hard core yet. While it is said that it can take more, I bought mine brand new so Im still playing it safe. To a certain degree you should take care of your phone as much as possible no matter what brand you use.The Touchscreen: The glass is very sleek, smooth coated, and hasnt suffered a single scratch yet. Ive gone months without the screen protector and have yet to actually do damage. I would still recommend a screen protector just in case though. In addition, having to switch from a physical keyboard of BlackBerry to touchscreen of Commando was a bit frustrating. It does take getting used to. But thats not really the fault of the Commando. The default keyboard works ok but I would highly recommend getting a keyboard app from Google Play (Google Play is the store at which you will be using to download apps and comes installed on the Operating System). I highly recommend SwiftKey or GO Keyboard, Ive used both and like them the best. GO Keyboard has extra themes and Red Fusion matches the Commandos look perfectly. A nice additional feature, the phone switches from portrait to landscape when you tilt the phone which comes in handy when you need to use both hands. The touchscreen can be a bit wonky, but almost all touchscreens have hiccups no matter what you do. There is occasional ghost touches and unresponsive touches at times, nothing major that really breaks the phone itself however. But another pro this phone has for it is the screen itself is a nice size, not too big to make the phone overly bulky but displays the images with nice resolution and clarity!The OS: As you probably already know, it uses the Droid Operating System. The version on mine seems to run smoothly. Keep in mind the internal specs of the Commando is nothing mind blowing, but it gets the job done. Also keep in mind if its your first time using a smart phone there WILL BE GLITCHES with the OS. I've used multiple smart phones and multiple brands and all have issues from time to time. They are computers and like all computers they have problems. But in comparison, I use my Commando more than I do my laptop, which says alot! I've played a few games and all seemed to work great. I played The Sims and a few other 3d games and had no problems. A neat bonus that comes with the Commando is the addition of GZ Gear. This program incorporates maps, thermometer, star gazer, compass, and more. All of which can be shortcut keyed to any of your multiple home screen panels. This is handy for outdoorsmen who use their phones for navigation, and gives the GPS a bit more usefulness.The Camera/Camcorder: Neither are nothing special but so far they are better than other phones I've used before. One thing I like is the Commando incorporates a flash, which is one thing I can understand why other phones leave out. A cool feature is the ability to use the flash as a flash light at the push of a button. Other phones can do this, but many require a third party app to be installed. But luckily here its included right into the design!All in all I could go on with all the pros and cons, so with those key points in mind, I love this phone. Its been the best one I've owned to date, and dont look to replace it any time soon!", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbreakable", "Author": "MeJohnBigTree", "ReviewID": "RBTR91OQ65YCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone absolutely will not quit. I have literally listened to Pandora on this phone UNDERWATER and have (accidentally) run over it with an 8 ton tow truck before, and it never missed a beat. It has endured abuse above and beyond the call of regular phones, and still continues to impress. I say abuse, because frankly, myself and delicate electronics have a very sad and expensive history together, and this little guy has been put through things that go far beyond \"hard use\". I rate it at 4 stars because of minor problems I have with the software, such as the inability to uninstall default programs like Bing (which I loathe. And Bing, if you happen to read this, Google has won. It's over. Let it go.) and low memory capacity, etc. Otherwise, I just couldn't be more impressed with it.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "cruz", "ReviewID": "R309AWH8F69S71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK first things first, its a great phone I have owned quite a few droids and have destroyed them.  This phone will work under water and take drops with ease.  The screen seems scratch resistant also.  The only complaints I have with it is the internal memory and the os system freezes up time to time but with that being said I cold have been running.to many things at once.  With this phone I HIGHLY recommend installing ES FILE EXPLORER its an app that let's you move files from your phone onto SD and clear the retarded caches that you gain when playing games on your phone but that happens on any smart phone.Besides that the camera is smooth, the use of the phone is easy and everything you wanted in a smartphone if u destroy your phone.  I'm no longer afraid when I drop my phone or get it wet I take shower and listen to music with this phone with no worries and when it gets dirty I run in under the faucet to clean it absolutely pleased with an SD card and the ES FILE EXPLORER you should never worry about internal memory problems ever", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone will survive.", "Author": "Cook", "ReviewID": "R3348YGQWBVEM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love love love this device, lost the same model 9 months back in the woods (#1 was with me for about a year, I hope to keep #2 with me forever and ever) and life was not the same. This thing takes a the drops, the water plops, it can take the heat and keeps on kicking. At work I us it to listen to internet radio with headphones (some head phones don't connect so be sure try a few if it doesn't work at first), while I drive I use a GPS the speakers are nice and loud, the screen is great (you have to push a little harder than a normal touch screen but not by much), photo quality is 'so so' but it get the job done (they come out grainy and higher res pics can't be sent out for some reason), I don't like the pre-loaded rooted apps like Bing but you can't get away from that (at least not) and I love that I can rinse (I make sure the seals are closed)  it off when it gets dirty.Battery life is like any other smart phone, it depends on your apps and GPS usage, if I'm using it to navigate it will last for about 2 hours, if  I'm listening to internet radio 3 hours, normal texting calling 5 hours so I just keep it charged.As a person who is prone to dropping anything I'm hold this phone is amazing. 2 of my friends got the same device and really like too... One fo them killed every phone she had within 3 months but not this one, this keeps working and she loves it more than I do.Phone call quality is great, other phones I had would drop calls or have calls go straight to voice mail (on the same service provider) but this little guy picks them all up. I get service where most other people don't (on the same service provider), there's one place I didn't but I think they have lead walls becase no one ever gets service there.Syncs with blue tooth easily.Bright flash light.Nice design.It has some neat 'adventure' apps pre-loaded, not anythig you couldn't download yourself but its there.Like any device it's has it's great, it's good and it's meh features. It's great features make up for any of the so so ones (for example I have stubby fingers and the 'trace' typing rocks)", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone except....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NKSNY6G4086", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over a year now.  It has held up very well to tough environmental conditions.  I like that I don't have to worry about my phone while at work or play.  I do have a few issues with it though.  It needs more on board memory, currently only 400MB available.  At least 1GB, 4GB would be nice in addition to the 8GB SD card. With today's technology I don't think that would increase the price by all that much.  It keeps freezing in the middle of applications and the only way to un-freeze is to take the battery out.  I can't have a lot of apps on the phone.  Even if I \"move\" them to the SD card.  I can't automatically move pictures and video to the SD card either.  The only way I can store photos is to email them to myself and reopen them to the SD card. A real pain. If they would come out with these upgrades I would definitely get another.

The phone's casing performs as advertised; tough, waterproof, dustproof, drop-proof.  I am completely satisfied in that aspect, however, the software is crap.  The phone comes preloaded with a bunch of nonsense that I will never use.  You cannot turn off the updates for the stuff you do not want, which is usually no problem, but this phone has no memory.  Having little memory would be fine if you could move apps to your SD card, problem is that you can only move some apps.  You can put maybe 3 apps on the phone before you are out of memory.  Then when my phone updates (the unwanted apps) I have to go back through and clear the update out because if I don't, that is wasted memory that I need so my phone will operate.  Also, there is no way to save pics and vids to your SD card and the only way to move them is to hook the phone up to your computer and move them manually (pain in the butt).  Casio really dropped the ball on this one.If I can make it through the day with my phone only crashing 2 or 3 times I count myself lucky.  Stay away from this phone.  If they come out with a revised version with (a lot) more memory and the option to save pics and vids straight to the SD card I will consider buying another one, until then HECK NO!!", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Grandson", "Author": "DonnaF Beckner", "ReviewID": "R3E78T02QJ4WWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my grandson he has a habit of getting mad and throwing his phone at the expense of breaking them.

I finally moved on because while it was very close to indestructible, it could not stand up to mischievous puppy teeth.This phone has to qualities that need rating, which is rare for a smart phone.  The hardware and the software.The hardware is top notch.  I took a plunge in the water, and was fine.  It has been hit with steam coming from a power plant's steam turbine, and has continued to function.  It's fallen 20 feet, and been fine.  It looks very tough, and it backs it up.The software seems to be what is doing me in, here.  I'm not going to complain about the OS, because I have literally nothing to compare it to, though it's a 3 year old OS, and one shouldn't purchase this phone thinking it's going to compete with a Sony Xperia Z1 or the Samsung Galaxy S [insert number here].  I'm sure it doesn't, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me.What is a HUGE problem for me is the sheer amount of bloatware that comes on this phone, and NONE of it is uninstallable unless you root the phone.  The G'z app is fine, and most people who get the phone will have no problem with it.  But it comes with Verizon Apps, Backup Assistant, Bing, Google Books, City ID, Clock Widget, Cloud background, Deep Sea background, Document Viewer, Gmail, Email, Emergency Alert, Gallery, Google Play Music, Growing Tree background, Guided Tours, Honeycomb Pattern Background, InnoPath ActiveCare, Mirage Background, Music (bringing it up to 2 music apps), My Verizon Mobile, News & Weather, NFL Mobile, Shock wave background, Shooting Star Background, Skype Mobile, Slacker, Social Beat, V Cast Media Manager, V Cast Music, V Cast Tones, Verizon Video, Videos, Nuance Voice Control, VPN Client, VZ Navigator, Waterproof background, Weather, and Youtube preinstalled.All 38 these preinstalled apps wind up eating up half of the internal storage, and you can't move them to an SD card, and you can't uninstall them.  If you let all of them update (which is an opt-out process), they wind up eating up a good chunk more of your phone's limited memory.So the hardware is great, but it comes pre-loaded with so much crap that it makes me long for my old dumb phone.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not new, Factory Refurbished", "Author": "GasolineAlley \"Greta\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZI3IFOZH49Q1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was in good cosmetic condition. A couple of nicks on the face, but all and all not bad for a refurbished. Did not come in an original box. Generic battery and charger. No manuals or paper work. No 8gb memory card.

I never buy anything on Amazon that's not Prime after dealing with second party sellers not Prime. I left eBay years ago when I found Amazon Prime.(But sometimes I go back because I can save some cash just to again be disappointed and remember why I stopped spending my money there) Independent sellers are either awesome or just lying pain in the butts.

It shipped on time, arrived on time, and even though I ordered a used phone, it was indeed brand new! Kudos to Amazon for their excellent job with that. The ONLY good thing about this phone is that it truly lives up to it's name of being \"rugged\". I have owned 4 different rugged phones (from T-Mobile, sprint, that other carrier that was affiliated with them back in the day, and Verizon). The only one that was indeed rugged was this one. I literally ran it over with my car, a truck, and a Humvee! Literally picked it up, wiped it off and carried on! Phone is built to last. I plunged this thing into a 12 foot deep pool (I chucked it in hard too), then I dove in, and took pictures and even made a phone call!!! (granted my wife couldn't understand what I was saying because I was underwater). Now that we have got that out of the way....on to the HORRIBLE. This phone is made for someone with patience. It is beyond slow, only works on 3G, Wi-Fi on it drops constantly (I put it literally next to my router and it couldn't connect until I restarted the phone), it constantly resets, and the keyboard goes all wonky after 30 days. I called Casio and Verizon and they did a software update.....THIS MADE IT UNBELIEVABLY WORSE!!!! I couldn't send text messages, make phone calls, and when I could get a call to go through, I would get a \"hello\" on the other end just in time for it to reset. It was after going through countless a**chewings from my boss (because I am in the Army and we need to be reached and respond within 30 seconds) I finally had enough. I tried to literally blow it up! Still did not destroy this machine!! So I angled it against my back tire and backed over it.....another fail....so I just gave it to my son. He likes it because he can jam out to tunes on it over the Wi-Fi (when it works) and because it has such a large speaker set, it cranks up. Besides the software and operating system being so degraded, it is a phone for the outdoorsman and clumsy people. Can also be subbed in as a great chock block.....that's about all it's good for. Seriously consider getting this phone for a young person! Not adult friendly or teenager friendly (unless you want to punish them).", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "needs front camera", "Author": "lisa ellis", "ReviewID": "R28D2588GSLP66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the only thing it doesn't have a front camera but otherwise it is a good phone, would recommend it to people.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2EDEVQRWDDT5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is like new.

I did not want another Commando because I have learned the hard way, that the phone provider and the manufacturer are very slow in acknowledging product faults. And you can waste a lot of time sending replacement phones back & forth while they sort things out. Note that when you visit a Verizon \"premium partner\" store you are not really dealing with a Verizon dealer but a glorified phone independent dealer. Unlike Amazon and real Verizon stores they will charge you a restocking fee to return a defective phone. You will need to call Verizon directly to resolve your issue.  Bottom line: avoid this phone until Casio figures out what the problem is.  Meanwhile if you need a truely darn near indestructible phone you may want to consider one of Casio's older models.

The battery life is worse than my old Palm Treo, worse than ANY cell phone I have ever owned including Motorola, Palm, Sanyo, Casio, and many more. I get between 16 hours and 1 day, 4 hours. The phone even kills the battery if you turn it off and leave it in your car over the weekend. I have taken to removing the battery at night to give myself some breathing room in the morning before I have to tether the phone to a wall. Remember corded phones? Remember not being able to walk across the room without yanking the cord tight and snapping the phone receiver out of your hand? It's like that.2.) The phone places every person in your Contact List who you call or receive a call from into the Favorites List. Do not confuse this activity with the Call Log, that is another list of call transactions. Unlike the Call Log, you can NOT remove a person from your Favorites List without deleting their associated Contact from your Contacts List. You can remove single entries from the Call Log. The \"delete\" is missing from the Favorites List.3.) The SMS Text application does not count characters as you enter your message. ALL the rest of the Casio phones (Bolder and Ravine) provide this essential function except the Commando. Why is this important? An SMS Text Message is limited to 160 characters. If you compose a message longer than 160 characters, the Cell System, not the phone, divides the message into a second message. this causes you to pay for two messages at full price even if \"your\" message is only 161 (or more) characters. This is compounded greatly should you be sending to everyone in a group. Imagine how quickly you can rip through your 250 message-per-month allotment should you NOT count those characters... ever try counting characters? It's hard.Update: I found a new bug. If you receive a call, say on Monday and you then go about your activities you will notice you have an entry in your Call Log recording this call. Very normal, nothing to review here... But wait, there's more. If you shut-down your phone at the end of the day, say like to conserve the battery overnight and then you take the next day off and do not turn the phone back on until Wednesday, you will see in your Call Log the call you received on Monday showing as a call received \"yesterday\". Tapping on this call to look at the details will show the correct date and time however when you return to the overview list, the call still shows as \"yesterday. The Call Log application fails to recognize the period of time which the phone was shut-down and reports the call as having been received on Tuesday, even when you know that both the call its self was received on Monday and the phone was powered-off all day Tuesday. I'll call this a bug not an \"issue\" as it's reproducible and persistent and demonstrates a failure in the software.Another Update: Twice, after the conclusion of a call the phone started to vibrate erratically. At first I thought I had done something to the phone so I showed it to a coworker while it was \"spazzing-out\" as he said. The display would rapidly shift between several screens and the vib motor seemed to be responding to the sounds in the room or sending me Mores code messages. We both tried to get it to stop and failed so I removed the battery and reinstalled it.This has happened twice, both times with witnesses. This sort of stuff may be why the battery in these phones doesn't last very long.I spoke with a representative of Verison (spelling error, I know) about the SMS thing and the other two issues. He said he could \"relate\" and was able to reproduce the Favorites and SMS problems on the phone he had at his disposal. He did not directly address the battery life issue but implied that he was aware of the large number of people in the Forum complaining of similar problems.I have other problems with the Commando, such as the persistent \"please unplug your charger\" nag message and the \"sticky\" rubberized coating on the casing. A \"rugged\" phone should be easier to clean as it's going to get dirty in use. Also, the speaker ports are trash magnets, the big magnets in there combined with the large and numerous openings contribute to a lot of stuff getting in there.Lastly, I would like to point-out that the phone will not sit flat on a table. If you turn it over and look you will notice that Casio put a protrusion around the earphone cover opening which extends below the common back surface of the phone. This \"bump\" makes for a two-point contact with the table top that makes the phone rock back and forth as you tap at the screen. A touch-screen phone that you MUST hold in your hand to get anything done. Ever try to get any work done with both hands on your cell phone? You can't even properly go to the bathroom this way.I was unable to get -ANY- support through my company's cell provider so I'm taking this advantage to warn others about this horrible cell phone.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything force closes", "Author": "John Ryan Walsh", "ReviewID": "R1HA0LGSMD70MK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has got to be one of the worst phones that verizon and casio has made.
