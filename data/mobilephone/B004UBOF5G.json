FAKE BATTERY2. WATER DAMAGE - the water damage indicator on the phone is red, which means it had gotten wet. (I didn't even know these phones had that indicator, until today)3. LCD SCREEN REPLACED4. RUST in the phoneI was very disgusted to make those discoveries as i had specifically ask if this replacement was a new phone and their response was \"yes. we only deal in new items\".This leads me to believe that the original phone i got was not at all new although the box had the seal on it.This has been my worst experience on Amazon ever.Wireovia should be banned from selling on Amazon.DO NOT purchase from the seller WIREOVIA they are deceitful.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lenis", "Author": "Lenis", "ReviewID": "R1WYK5YU31XTMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente producto, es muy rapido para las conexiones, la camara toma las fotos muy nitidas, incluso de noche, muy buena experiencia con el producto e incluso con el vendedor.
