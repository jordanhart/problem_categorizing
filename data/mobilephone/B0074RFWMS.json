It's a PHONE, right?) so this is the perfect solution. She gets an upgrade on the storage to 64GB and gets Siri without switching to an iPhone 5.  Saves us the huge cost of a new phone 5 which she doesn't want; she keeps the version (iPhone 4) she loves.IMPORTANT:Be sure you check the specific item details to make sure the phone you're buying is the right one for your carrier. We were lucky. The phone we bought said \"Verizon\" in the description and it only took us a few minutes to get it authorized as a replacement on our Verizon account. Consider asking the seller for the IMEI number (found in General/About/IMEI) to confirm the phone will work or is not stolen BEFORE you buy it. The purchase will take longer but is the only guarantee that once you receive the phone it will work.Hopefully your purchase will be successful like ours", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I phone 4s", "Author": "Jacquelyn", "ReviewID": "R1VPFAVZNPKTIW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The back of the phone broke the second week, the  was used or  refurbished it had 12 days on the history of the phone also the phone registers as a white phone not black.

They assured me it was, new and under warranty.  Of course, the day it arrives I switch everything over, and then the blue tooth doesn't work.  So I call Apple for support and they tell me that the phone is registered to someone else and that it isn't under warranty.  And it's used.  I call Amazon, get into all sorts of cues, get the total run-around and all I get is red tape and a lot of nonsense.  It's a third party seller, so all we can do is return it and you \"can try again and then see if you get a new phone.\"  So in other words, maybe we'll actually tell the truth the next time!  They even tried to get me to buy another phone and then get a refund when I sent the other one back--the nerve!  There is a reason people don't do this, avoid yourself the headache and just pay the extra money and get a real phone.  This experience has made me want to completely quit buying anything through Amazon.

The short term difficulty with registering it with Verizon were quickly handled by a Technician and then set up with Verizon's Pay-Monthly plan.  Short term use indicates no obvious problem with battery life or working of the iPhone. I find it unfortunate that Apple seems not to take into consideration the \"low vision\" users when making changes to the IOS. The seller was willing to answer what questions I had that he could.

Verizon is nice enough to send me a replacement phone but after all the software resets it was determined by the Verizon Rep over the phone that it would have to be a hardware issue. That seems very hard to believe considering my phone was always with a case, and one of the military grade screen protectors on at all times. This phone is in outstanding condition cosmetically but for some reason 2 days ago I go to check my email when I wake up, and the screen turns to a yellow tinge and shuts off with the apple logo. I check the crash reports in settings once I powered it back on, it had crashed 20 times while I was asleep. This may be an isolated incident but at the same time this just shows how Apple products can still be flawed. If this phone is going to be your end all be all, make sure you still have a backup phone. Luckily I had an old BB 9930 lying around that I could still activate in its place.
