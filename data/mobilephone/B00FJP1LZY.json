The software looks like Window mobile but it is difficult to use and you cannot download any apps. Even the color was wrong, I was shipped a yellow bootleg phone!! I returned it 2 days later after realizing it was a bootleg version of the 1020, and I now have the real phone as of yesterday.The real phone I received through another seller gets 4 out of 5 stars.Pros: Camera is easy to use, voice recognition better than Siri.Cons: No case fits if you have the camera grip connected.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FJP1LZY"}}
