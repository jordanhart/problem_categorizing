Classy understated looks, high quality feel (don't mind the rubber texture, no flex like Samsung devices). Squares with round corners, very surprised apple didn't sue them over this one. Don't bother with a screen protector, the edges curve which causes lifting and an air pocket that propagates. Even if you cut your own perfectly fitting cover that ends before the curve, it seems without a bezel the corners inevitably find a piece of dust that works its way under the edge, and air, air pocket once again. The gorilla glass has held up better than I expected. Small scratches, nothing terrible.The speaker quality is extremely good (don't judge it by compressed speaker phone calls, try listening to a high quality podcast without headphones, it sounds good).I don't ever use front facing camera, but its there.Screen is nice. Processor is sufficient. Its not as fast as my quad core tablet, but I don't feel impatient like I'm waiting for an app to load.Using phone with ATT sim card from straight talk, 45 a month w/ 4G LTE in the bay area, contract free, very satisfied.CON:the main camera is sub par. Forget low lighting. Even ideal lighting gives mysteriously fuzzy results. I have noticed that the lens coating appears to be wearing off of my camera (it looked like scratches at first, but the more I cleaned my lens the worse the scratches got, to where it looks like now they are retreating towards the edges and no longer present in the center). Sometimes I get a picture that is ridiculously well focused but for the most part its sub-par. Software or hardware? Don't know but flash helps a lot. If not for this, would have been my dream phone. Still give it 5 stars because it does not detract enough from the overall experience and value. This might have had something to do with why this phone was considered a marketing failure (a facebook phone with a bad camera???), take advantage of the liquidation and pick one up for a fair price.First thing you're going to want to do is disable the facebook UI and download a third party launcher app (I suggest ADW).TETHERING:You will need to root this device and get a tethering app. Factory option locked. If you are on the same service as I am, you will need make sure you set up your connecting device to use the PHONE CARRIERS DNS server (download CompruebaLiP or similar app that displays DNS information), all of the public ones are blocked. You can still use 8.8.8.8 as your alternate for regular use (Google's DNS). It took hours of googling to find an obscure forum post that explained this.

Unjustly so. This is a solid device that runs flawlessly. It is either for you or not for you, but if you appreciate the dexterity and diversity of Android as well as if you are an avid facebook, instagram and tumblr (yes, these are also integrated into the lock-screen), then this is the device for you.

There can be no repair done on the phone if the glass broke or the battery can't be replaced. Absolutely, there is no way of getting into the phone.
