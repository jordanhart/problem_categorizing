I could hear fine, but people complained that it was hard to hear me clearly when I used the speakerphone-- something that's important to me, since I prefer not to have all those cancer-causing microwaves right next to my head that many hours! (Holding a celphone to my ear consistantly makes my ears ring anyways).DON'T get this phone if the speakerphone is an important feature to you. I suggest the Nokia 5310 Music Xpress. It's thinner and sleaker, with much better speakerphone.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Romantic Phone!", "Author": "Noms Services Ltd \"Noms\"", "ReviewID": "RSAEPNMZEWQMG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone looks and feels romantic. It's ok for an xpress music. The sound quality is good too. The picture quality is manageable compared to the price.Pros:-Good and unique feel-good sound quality-good price-scratch resistant skinCons:-not good for watching 3GP videos-not 3G phone-plastic and fragile music buttons on the side instead of where other xpress phone buttons are...as in, near the screen. The music buttons are on the side n u need to turn the phone to its side to access themAside these, it's a sweet phone and perfect for a romantic gift to a deserving girl!", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "An Underrated Phone", "Author": "Milliardo", "ReviewID": "R1TY1P5SL5E70L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Probably one of Nokia's underrated phones. It's not exactly a smart phone, but then it can give the more expensive ones their run for the money. I had this phone for 2 years; probably would have and still use it now if I haven't lost it, but that's another story. This is one tight phone to have, and you'll just keep on loving it. Great as well for listening to music. One website actually reviewed it and says the sound quality is so much better than an iPod, which is a compliment for this phone. TFT screen though would wash out if you're using this under the sun, but then again how many people you know actually use their cellphones outside on broad daylight? Overall this phone is one you'll keep for years, and if I do find one that is brand new I'd buy it at once.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "CLP \"C\"", "ReviewID": "R28233KY33C6SG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost 2 yrs.  When I first got this phone I didn't think it would last 6 months because it felt so light and not as solid as other Nokia's. Let me tell you; this phone has been dropped almost every other day, stepped on, lightly chewed on, dropped in a hot oven, dropped in a snow bank and still works perfect like the day I got it!  You can't go wrong with a Nokia.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS VENDOR", "Author": "jk101", "ReviewID": "RICZJPNWI7F9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HassleFreeCell sent me this phone and it had ARABIC SCRIPT numbers and letters written on the keys (NOTE: the amazon site photo shows a phone with LATIN NUMBERS on them). Well, HassleFreeCell, I don't happen to read Arabic, and furthermore, the only languages I could set on the phone were English, French and ARABIC. What happened to Spanish and German???? I want to use this phone in South America and I need to send texts in SPANISH.When I called them, all they did was make excuses. Among them, they claimed the phone came directly from amazon.com and not them (even though the address label clearly showed HassleFreeCell as the sender, not Amazon). That's when I hung up and called amazon.com to tell them to get rid of the vendor HassleFreeCell who clearly misrepresents its wares on the amazon site.This is a HORRIBLE company, which is backed up by another comment by someone who also said HassleFreeCell sent them the wrong phone.DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THESE CLOWNS!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite", "Author": "Damy34", "ReviewID": "R3SRD3C7TZRS07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone from the Tmobile store years back and i loved it. it was \"nearly\" indestructible. i abused the heck out of it daily, throwing it around and such as a way to pass time. the music controls on the side broke quickly but the phone still worked perfectly without them. also this phone is still the only phone that I've owned to date that allowed me to put Gif. files as wallpapers. other instances where the phone has taken massive amounts of damage and still worked would be the many times it's fallen in lake or bath tub. to sum it up im planning on getting another one of these or one just like it since im fed up with my lousy exhibit 4g which always messes up or crashes, i havent even thrown or drop it yet.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for music lovers", "Author": "ALR", "ReviewID": "R2W98Z9HRZATHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a bit small and slippery for us clumsy guys, but that is it's only gig, well, and a small keypad. I am not a smart phone kind of a guy, and I know that eventually that will be all that is offered, but until then I will go kicking and screaming into that goodnight, and this phone will be my combat buddy. Anyway, it has an MP3 player that is better than any player I have ever owned, and the radio picks up stations quite well, even inside (Sony Walkman eat your heart out). The beauty of the MP3 side of this phone is that you can get any size memory card for it, and the earbuds that come with it are very durable with a good sound.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "BUEN CELULAR, VERY GOOD!!", "Author": "Alis Linares \"ALi\"", "ReviewID": "R12B3HBZ8W1UU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Desde que me llego este celular en febrero y hasta la fecha ha funcionado muy bien (algo resbaladizo por su delgadez), resultando ser bastante completo y practico; claro, aun no he explorado todo su potencial, pero una amiga que lo conoce muy bien me da referencias de que es un  excelente aparato.
