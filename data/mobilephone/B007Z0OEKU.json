I didn't use it while on the charger, I let it die at least once a month, yet, one random day when I put it on the charger, it said that is was charging as usual, but my battery continued to die s if it weren't on the charger. I tried using different outlets, chargers, and source, yet nothing worked. I assumed it was the battery, so I got a new battery to day, and it is doing the exact same thing, it won't charge!", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kinda surprising..", "Author": "KM", "ReviewID": "R39I39SWM0BHUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my phone for a while now and I do truly love it. The screen is so huge! Resolution is perfect! I did get the AT&T; version of the phone instead of the international version pictured, which was kind of misleading but it was new and in perfect condition. I use a sim card anyway and AT&T; phones have a sim slot so I'm happy with what I got.
