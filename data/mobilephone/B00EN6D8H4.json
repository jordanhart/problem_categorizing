{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Flip Phone", "Author": "NotWorthmyPhD", "ReviewID": "R33EO57Y2Q5GQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This newly-released phone is a great option for those of us who have no need for a Smartphone. It has a nice size and weight and a much larger screen than you would expect from a flip phone.  It also has many more features than are obvious at first glance, not all of which are sufficiently explained in the downloadable user guide.  For example, if you wish to see incoming calls on the front display rather than only the clock, you have to specify this option in the Exalt display setting.  Also, if you choose to insert a micro-memory card, it gives you a great opportunity to interface with your computer to transfer pictures and songs.  Be warned, however, that any files assigned to the memory card folders beginning with \"my\" will not be displayed on the phone.  Only folders such as Photos, Music, Ringtones will be accessible and I had to figure that out the hard way.  The option to group emails by contact in addition to chronological order is a nice touch.  If you are willing to spend some time getting to know everything this phone has to offer, you will enjoy this little technology-packed powerhouse.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fails in primary function", "Author": "sandrasue", "ReviewID": "R1C9ISGRAB6PEZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a basic phone, it makes texting needlessly time consuming. The T9 word mode is worthless since there is no way to scroll thru and select other common words when the wrong word appears. (e.g. hand vs game; on vs no)Instead you must erase and switch to the abc mode. Nor are there any punctuation shortcuts; again, you must switch to the symbols mode. Problem with the abc mode is the wait between typing letters on the same numeric key. The directional keys are under utilized; yet there is a designated alarm key? It seems there are too many unnecessary functions that slow down navigation for the basic operation of this device: calling and texting. As a plus, the screen is large and easy to read, and I like the voice command to call without looking up numbers. Finally, since user manuals must now be downloaded or read online, why not include with the phone an online link to the manual?UPDATE: Although Verizon salesperson and LG customer service rep said otherwise, this phone DOES have a key to select word options when using T9: it is the zero/next key. Huge improvement when texting. I would now rate this phone 3 or 4 stars as a good basic phone to talk and text.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone and it was free!

I had an LG chocolate was happy with it and let my upgrades go to others on my family plan, but it started to die, saw this phone in the Verizon store, searched the net and got a code to get the phone for free, (plus the fee they charge to start up a new phone) I went in the store, they did the set up, transferring all my contacts, photos, ringtones,my groups, my speed dials and my preferences. This part is important as I do not text or surf the internet with my cell phone. So all got transferred over seamlessly. The sound quality is excellent and the mic pick-up is very good if I want to use the speaker function. I do love the display where I can tell who is calling at a glance. and larger-sized numbers! I cannot speak to the quality of the camera as I haven't used it yet.So if you want a basic phone with largish keys and display, I recommend this mobile phone.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone However Read My Review", "Author": "JHM", "ReviewID": "R17591EHP7SFV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was one of the first customers to obtain this phone from Verizon back on 9-5-13. Everything was fine EXCEPT I could not get Backup Assistant to work. After numerous calls to tech help at Verizon, it seems to work now however, they were as confused about it as I was. They even sent me a replacement Exalt which did the same thing! I now think the fault was with Verizon and not LG. It took them over 2 weeks to fix this at least on my phone and I know as a fact that many new Exalt owners were or are experiencing the same problem. The problem is that it keeps trying to communicate with Verizon's Backup Assistant and an error message comes up that it \"cannot authenticate my account\". I ended up having a Verizon store transfer my contacts since my older phone was still working. The Backup Assistant was the only problem I had with this new Exalt otherwise, it is really a nice phone with big numbers and screen and fine sound! It's perfect for someone who needs closeup glasses!

I really liked that phone, but because it was not connecting to some Bluetooth devices I decided to finally upgrade. Amazon had the best price out there on the Exalt (and phones in general), so pulled out the wallet. This was an upgrade, which meant some learning curve. I'm getting used to it.As others have noted here and at Verizonwireless there is an issue with Backup Assistant. Some have suggested the problem has been fixed, others have proposed a fix. It doesn't work on mine. I USB'd my phone to the computer, and it did update the software in the phone. Backup Assistant still didn't work. Following the directions from a user posted here at Amazon I tried to update Backup Assistant, but the phone won't connect to the web.Fortunately, I was able to move my contacts and pics from the Convoy to the Exalt using the micro-SD card. The only issue I had was the Exalt was not finding my contacts or pics, because they were stored on the card in folders the Exalt didn't like. Using the computer I was able to move the pics from \"my_pics\" to \"photos,\" and \"my_contacts\" to \"contact.\"Otherwise, the Exalt is certainly not as solid as my Convoy I, so I guess I'll get one of the hard cases available for this phone. The back cover is cheesy, and flimsy, and I was afraid of breaking it when I swapped in the micro-SD, which is under the cover next to the battery. I would certainly not plan on removing it very often.The screen is large and bright, and compared to the Convoy I like texting much better as I can see conversation history, a new feature my Convoy didn't have. It also seems to have more menu items, so I guess I'll sit down and see what those are all about. I'm not much on the front screen. It really don't give much information, unlike my Convoy, and those LEDs are hard to read.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "good basic phone, don't drop it!", "Author": "Linda B", "ReviewID": "R2TK04C7WO7RXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I understand what others are saying about 'slippery'.

Any upgrade would just be newer, not better, then I found this phone. It has an external LED dot matrix display for the clock and caller ID that I can read ....without glasses.....outdoors, a really big plus for me. On the other hand, the only negative I have with this phone IS with the external display for caller ID. It's a scrolling \"marquee\" style and instead of just showing who's calling, it alternates a phone icon between ID's, taking twice as long to ID a call if you look at the wrong time. This is the only reason I don't rate this a full 5 stars.The other features I really appreciate is a large font option that I can read without my reading glasses and a high frequency enhance option for the audio which really does work. The screen is nice & bright too, also viewable outdoors.There's a lot of other features on this phone that I don't use but it has the three most important ones I've been looking for. If you text a lot, be aware that you won't be working with a full keyboard but the T9 option does a pretty good job anticipating the words you're trying for.I read some reviews complaining about battery life and have found that to not be an issue at all with mine.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Did not like", "Author": "Amy J Jordan", "ReviewID": "R30C49SKVO1VGU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very large phone when you opened it up.

I chose this one for her because of the larger screen size for a basic phone and it exceeded all of my expectations.
