{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HTC = excellent, true free GPS, camera, phone, WiFi  5/5!", "Author": "12review \"SF_BAY\"", "ReviewID": "R2PM3G9OX4CL8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my phone from \"Mobile City Online\" because of their high ratings andhighly recommend them.Now about the phone. HTC has long been great company, now they made the best HTC phone so far.I never considered iPhone, sorry, but \"think different\" iPhone users aren't ;)PROS-----SIZEIt is compact. Easy to carry and pleasantly small compared to iPhone or HTC HD2.CPUCPU is very fast, which means always smooth performance.WiFiI am in US, and I do not want to pay for mobile Data Plan. This phone lets me do it.This is how.Free WiFi areas in many cafes and other places throughout US make free internet WiFiconnection quite easy to find. The phone has real WiFi that needs no cell phone towers.GPSGPS in HTC is real. It needs no data plan. The phone talks to real satellites.One only needs to buy GPS software (CoPilot is great) or get free GPS software,some of which is phenomenally good, despite being free.The phone is a real pleasure. Screen colors and contrast are great, look is great, programs run smooth,touch response is great, camera works surprisingly well, even when compared to the legendary [...] camera,which I have.SOUNDvery goodSIGNAL RECEPTIONvery goodMEMORYPhone comes with 2GB card in a separate package.I bought 16GB card for $24.That's plenty to hold GPS maps and music.CONS-----I wish bundled software like organizer, GPS etc was better so I don't have toinstall my own.VERDICT----I love Windows Mobile. Version 6.5.3 that this phone has is very good.I know some people like Apple and some like Android, but I can't think of any advantagethey could possibly give. Windows Mobile is GREAT.The phone is a technological wonder. Get one.I got two ;)Thanks HTC.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "htc hd mini", "Author": "Sophia", "ReviewID": "R3BCSFJ4AKMH30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: The phone (htc hd mini) arrived in a timely matter and on the date it said it would. It looks and works as it should. New item.The phone, itself, works great. It's fast. I am an Android user so Windows phones don't appeal much to me. I actually bought this one for my bf. He likes it a lot.Cons: Since it is a Windows phone, nobody has really made great apps for it (yet?). Another thing (about the seller), the package did not come with a North America wall adapter so I had to order a separate htc wall charger that is compatible with my wall outlet.Other than that, if you are a Windows phone user, get this phone. It's fast, sleek, and you can't go wrong with HTC phones.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!!", "Author": "fRANCISCO j. aRMENTA", "ReviewID": "RFQ9OY7M1SIOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW!!!!I have had my new HTC HD Mini for about a week now and I can honestly say that I have been very very happy with my new Mini.The size, weight, and responsiveness of Win 6.5 are just great.It is all that I expected it to be and then more.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "simply... perfect.", "Author": "tito", "ReviewID": "R2IFA7OBPYMV7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you are looking for the best windows mobile phone with an affordable price.. it's the hd mini..why?!because it's so far contains all features which you might be looking for..for example..the good processor 600 mhz which is very enough to handle every thing for such a mini sized phone.enough ram and rom to install all programs you need.. plus expandable memory up to 32 gb..perfect working GPS and wi-fi... you will rarely need to turn on your computer.. hd mini is a real computer.the voice quality and the polite and smart HTC SENSE.. will make you love your phone \"to the limit that you will feel that you want to kiss it... really\"i know that almost every one can read more about the phone on the htc website..but, i can tell you about my experience with the hd mini..\" I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I PAID FOR \"HTC HD MINI is SIMPLY PERFECT.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome little phone", "Author": "GRIFF", "ReviewID": "R2NKOW62UR1UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am about a week into usuing this phone. So far, I am very please with this device. I have purchased HTC products before: T-Mobile Wing, HTC Touch Pro, HTC Touch Pro 2, and a few of the latest android phones. The mini is a dream. The HTC Sence interface is great, the phone size is great, battery life and reception are fantastic. Compared to my expierence with other HTC products, this one is top dawg. The processor also makes this lil thing fast. No cons for this device , all pros; Only thing is I wish my fingers were just a bit smaller. If your going to buy this phone, you better get two.

I'd say, you're probably better off getting the Aria subsidized than getting this at ~$400.  I do like this phone in general, but since it's Win Mobile and and doesn't have 3G, I wouldn't want to pay a premium to get a phone that's \"previous generation\" and has its better days behind it.  Either wait for this price to drop a little or get the Aria subsidized.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0038JDF34"}}
