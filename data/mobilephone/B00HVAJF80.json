{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a dual  standby phone.", "Author": "Seno Afuga", "ReviewID": "R1SJLN3K3MF8D1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ZP980+ is not dual standby. Once on a call the other sim card is practically dead until the call ends.  It's dual standby is only when both sim cards are not on a call.The  micro sim card( sim 1) goes off and comes with an error message : \"SIM CARD 1 NOT DETECTED\". You have to remove battery and sim and re-insert for the sim card to be detected again. Zopo Engineers need to go back to the drawing board. I had the worst experience on mobile with the zopo zp980: the sim card 1 slot could not detect a sim out-of-the-box. I Tried about three sim cards that work fine with other brands of phones like Samsung, Huawei and Sony. Performance-wise the phone is ok but if you are looking for a dual sim phone, please don't buy.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HVAJF80"}}
