My reference for this phone is my Galaxy S3.  It's definitely smaller, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It fits in the pocket much easier.  It's probably 1.5 times thicker than the S3.The screen seems nice and crisp, as you would expect from a Samsung phone.  The screen is definitely A LOT smaller when surfing the web and such.  The buttons and layout are the same as the S3.As far as performance, it is definitely not as smooth as the S3.  It's a little choppier than the S3, but that's to be expected.I also want to mention (since it's not in the description) that the internal memory is 2GB.  Definitely invest in a MicroSD card!Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase.  For the price, it's definitely a great way to get Samsung quality!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is GREAT", "Author": "Ashlie Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1RIOP8U5U6NEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my new phone today but so far it is GREAT!

When I first bought the phone a few months ago, I was using it for everything. From email, facebook, watching videos... It was not long before it froze up. Had to completely reset it to factory settings (lost everything I downloaded). Now the memory keeps filling up, not sure why? I can start the day with 500MB of the 2GB used. And somehow without downloading anything, 1.9GB of the memory is full. I cleared the cache on every app and program and it does not make a dent. Checking the forums, this is an issue with this phone. Even deleting the 5 small apps I downloaded will not free up the memory. The only option is to reset the phone to factory settings. Had to do this 3 times in the last 2 months. I reset to factory settings last week and the memory is full again. I have only downloaded 5 apps, under 200MB's in total. Boost Mobile support will just tell me to reset it again.

Perfect set up for a reasonable price.  Got it with Boost Mobile so no contract.  That was a must.As I have seen mentioned in a few reviews, it seems to stop and reboot randomly.
