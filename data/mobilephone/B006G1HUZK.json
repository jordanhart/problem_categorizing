{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sooo much better than the prevail!!", "Author": "Chantelle Houston", "ReviewID": "R3GZUCIWAU8CK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the prevail about 3 months ago, from Target. It was my first smartphone and I was in love with it. That is until I started borrowing my other friends smartphones and seeing how many apps they had installed. How?, I wondered. Well I found out that other phones came with much more internal memory installed, this being one of them. At first I was skeptical about purchasing this phone because there were no other reviews of it, but I am very happy that I did!!Pros:Front-facing camera -- I love this thing!! Skype finally works correctly!Large Screen -- The screen is so much larger than the prevail, and so much clearer!!Keyboard--Being an avid texter, I love the feeling of the keys under my fingertips!!1GHz Processing speed -- This is super fast!! My apps open up quicker, and the screens can slide so much easier!!Flash - Finally I can use all those LED flashlights on the market!Bloatware : It doesn't come pre-installed with the bloatware that the prevail did, like Hookt, and that weird game ScavGR, or whatever it was.Cons: Moving Icons : The only con I've found so far, is that when I am trying to move icons out of the drawer or across the screen, they seem to auto-stick into slots. Wish there was a setting to change this!!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Transform Ultra from a big man's perspective... who also modded his phone...", "Author": "J. Tirelli", "ReviewID": "R3NU5MKW4J78E5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung Transform Ultra is a mid range phone but it performs very well for it's price range. I bought mine for $120.00 during a black friday sale and have been using it since then. I am a large man, I am 6'5\" and I weigh in at 290 lbs (just lost 13 pounds last month woot woot!) I chose this phone over the warp because it has a qwerty keyboard and I am glad that I did. I do NOT enjoy using the touch screen keyboard.. The Qwerty keyboard works just fine for me, I don't ever fat finger any extra keys. In short I am in love with this phone and in this phone has caused me to love android.From a modders perspective this phone has an active community. There are at the time of this writing 4 custom roms, an over clock kernel, a recovery tool based on clockwork mods and a one click root tool. Cyanogenmod 7 is in the works and Cyanogenmod 9 is being talked about and worked on by one enterprising individual. Let me say that in clearer terms... this phone will likely have an ice cream sandwich based rom built for it. I would recommend this phone to anyone and everyone because as I have mentioned I am smitten with it.AnTuTu Benchmark with no tweaks 3532Highest Performance for this device 4695 (cpu clocked at 2016 Mhz)Specs:Qwerty KeypadARMv7 1 Ghz cpuAdreno (TM) 205 gpu370mb ram1gb onboard memoryCons:It has a touch screen issue where if you stop your finger while dragging something it forgets your finger is there. This is well documented and seems to affect all phones of this model. The modding community is currently working on a fix for this.Phone battery length is short, however I feel this is a con across all smart phones. The drain comes primarily from radio usage, I can turn off wifi and 3g while I am using it for a game or an ebook and it will last much longer. A battery extender app is a MUST. I use juice defender ultimate and get 2x battery life through location based wifi activation and turning off network connectivity (wifi and 3g) while screen is off, it checks in every 30 minutes for facebook updates etc. Heavy users should expect to charge this phone twice a day, giving it an afternoon nap charging and once again while you sleep. But when I say heavy I mean constant use like I do. If I use it only moderately I will go all day with one charge.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love IT", "Author": "scherry", "ReviewID": "R15ST2C9VGP23V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phone the more I play with it and use it.It is a great phone I got it promptly and appreciate the service.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Phone w/Boost Mobile", "Author": "Il-Rev", "ReviewID": "R1IYED4H6U3ET5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was skeptic because I've never had an Android phone before, and I've read some reviews about a touchscreen problem that comes with this phone. I decided to get one anyways because the problem was small, and indeed it is.Overall, the phone is very enjoyable to use. Smooth interface, good sized touchscreen, width/weight is good, the slide keyboard is responsive and I really enjoy the feel of it (contrary to some of the other reviews posted here on Amazon). I guess it's a preference thing. In addition, I am a heavy user of this phone and I find the battery to be good actually (I am comparing this to a brand new i-pod touch, which has the lifespan of a headless rat, and I only use that for music). The battery is good, considering you download an app to manage your battery better (I use Juice Defender. Otherwise, it's moderate.With the positives come the negatives. The phone is a bit slippery in terms of grip, and although the back design is nice, this baby can slip n' slide miles away. The camera is simply not up to par with today's standards. Pictures are quite grainy. There is that touchscreen problem, but I am not affected by it at all.As for the Service being BoostMobile, it runs very well. I get service mostly everywhere, calls are clear (more clear than U.S. Cellulars from what I've experienced, 3G is fast, and a monthly shrinkage plan down to 35 bucks a month after 18 months is a pretty decent deal. That with no contracts, I will take it.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal on a great phone", "Author": "Una Nelson-White", "ReviewID": "R222K90YXRHK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. Has a great slide out keyboard. If you use slide out keyboard all the time, you can turn off the screen keyboard to save on memory. Large screen and a great, detailed paper manual. The ID packs included are great. They include twitter and facebook, with a facebook gadget that shows your favorite friends latest wall posts. Boost mobile is a great flat rate deal a mouth, for everything. Unlimited calls, texts, emails and web.  It goes down in price every 6 mouths if you use auto pay. This is a good phone for someone who is new to texting, because the keyboard is much easier to use then on screen version.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "jabronie03", "ReviewID": "R10D3IQP8NC7J3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say that I had my doubts.  But this phone is truly a few steps up from most other phones offered by boost.  I just received the phone a few days ago, and have been fiddling with it since then.  I let the battery completely die after I initially turned on the phone.  Then I fully charged it.  This has seemed to help its performance.  It does take a while for the battery to fully charge but that is the only con I am seeing so far.I will write another review in a few weeks.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "(Almost) Totally satisfied with my Transform Ultra", "Author": "Richard J Byrne", "ReviewID": "R26JU88Y56XHIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been living with my new Samsung Transform Ultra from Boost for about 3 weeks now, and I have to say I love it. It's not perfect, but the things it does, it does very well. I'm an independent contractor and entirely dependent on my phone and laptop to make a living, so this was a key purchase for me.The highlight so far has been the processor speed and the capacity for apps and other storage. I had switched from a Blackberry Curve, and the improvement in speed was very noticeable. My Blackberry could not handle too many apps and the available selection was lacking. The Transform Ultra loads new apps quickly and they run great. The browser is plenty fast at 3G speed from Boost Mobile. I don't go to many graphics-heavy websites, so your mileage may vary on that. Boost has no 4G phones yet, which is odd because it is owned by Sprint, which seems to be the leader in 4G network at the moment. But this phone suits my purposes very well.A word about apps: Google, the Android proprietor, recently changed the name of the Android Market to Google Play, and reorganized it into 4 categories. This is fine, except that all but the most plugged-in of users appear not to know it as the launch has not been well promoted or announced. The changeover happened about a week after I got my phone, and I spent an afternoon fooling around with figuring out where my Android Market went. This is a marketing/support issue, though, and the new Google Play works as it should.Google did make it very easy to port over my contacts and calendar entries from my Blackberry via my Google account. I really was worried I'd have to re-key all my contacts when I switched from the BB platform to Android, but it was totally seamless.The size of my phone was important too. This one is a little smaller than most of its peers, even those from Samsung, like the Stratosphere. If you are bothered by the bulk of your current phone in your pocket, you should consider the Transform Ultra as it is a bit more compact.The slideout QWERTY keyboard is adequate, and getting a QWERTY keyboard was the main reason I chose the Transform Ultra. I do a lot of keying on my phone, both for emails and text messages, and have found that using the touchscreen to key is too difficult for a fat-fingered male like me. You ladies with your slender fingertips -- and in my girlfriend's case, long nails -- may not have as much of a problem with a touchscreen, but I kept making typos by hitting the wrong key, so for me, there is no substitute for a QWERTY keyboard.  If I can get on the soapbox for a moment, word has it that the cell phone industry as a whole is moving away from phones that offer a QWERTY keyboard, to more touchscreen-only devices. BIG mistake in my book.If you read around on the internet about the Transform Ultra, you may read a lot of negative remarks about the sensitivity or responsiveness of the touchscreen. I have to say I have experienced no problems with this. After a day or so of familiarizing myself with the inherent sensitivity of the device, I have had no errors or problems. My guess is those remarks came from folks who have become familiar with another device and have struggled with the transition. If you're thinking about buying a Transform Ultra, this isn't something I would let hold you back.I haven't used the camera much, but the photos I have taken are very good, at least as good as my Blackberry's. No complaints there.I will say there is one tradeoff that I am enduring with the Transform Ultra. Because of its smaller form factor, it has a 4-line keyboard, where competitors have 5. The top line contains all the numbers and requires use of the \"function\" key. This is a little inconvenient, and the clearance between the top line of keys and the slid-out chassis is tight. But this is the price you pay for having a phone that is a bit smaller in the pocket. I've played with a friend's Samsung Stratosphere, which has a 5-line keyboard, and it is a noticeably bigger phone overall.(Understand, too, that I am limited to what is available through Boost. I am wedded to the no-contract concept, and considered switching to another carrier, but I'm happy with Boost service, and if you want a better-than-average smartphone without a contract, they are the best deal going -- unlimited talk, text and data for $50 a month, which goes down to $40 with their \"shrinkage\" concept.)The only big downside of the Transform Ultra -- and you will hear about this from others -- is how slick the case is. This really was a hindrance when I first got the phone. It made it easily dropped, and it was even difficult to slide the phone open without using two hands. But the problem was easily conquered with a rubberized snap-on case that I bought on Amazon for under $5 -- which had the added bonus of making it harder to inadvertently launch the camera or change the speaker volume with the side keys. If you're buying a Transform Ultra, immediately order some kind of grippy case or cover.The package deal I purchased from Amazon included a nice leather (or is it synthetic? I can't tell) pouch that has both belt loops and a clip, and it works great with it's magnetic lid. The deal also included a car charger, which was a must for me, although my car stereo also has a USB port which, if you purchase a USB 2.0-to-USB-mini cord, you can also use to charge the phone on the run. Kudos to the seller for this package, which was delivered a day or two quicker than they told me it would be.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Good Investment!", "Author": "CGSandsJr", "ReviewID": "R318J68A64VYBN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is so sensitive that it will make calls that you didn't dail, but the more I used it the more I was able to control it.

The onscreen keypad had text prediction so you can choose which word to use, or not and the screen quality is vibrant. Calls on this phone are clear. It has a nice slide out keypad that is great for texting if you don't want to use the onscreen one.This phone reminds me so much of the Samsung Epic and I could not be happier.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone.", "Author": "RC", "ReviewID": "R3B3GFLQCKXBMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Earlier models of the Transform Ultra had infuriatingly bad touch-screens.  I'm glad I took another look, because it seems they fixed it newer batches, and mine works great.The horrible shell is slicker than a wet bar of soap, but there's a rubberized case that'll make it infinitely more gripable, and protected from drops.  Unfortunately it adds quite a bit of extra thickness, but I still call it a required accessory.The screen is lower-res than you'll see in top-rate smart phones, making apps take more real-estate and making smaller text in the main font unpleasant to read, but it's managable.  The screen is also closer to 4:3 than 16:9, which works better for some apps than others.The keyboard feels flat, doesn't have a nice raised texture to help you feel when your fingers are centered on a key, but I've gotten used-to it.  It's lacking several symbol keys I want to use frequently, instead having a \"Sym\" key that pops-up a menu.  But, infuriatingly, \"less-than\" and \"greater-than\" symbols are absent, making my frequent typing of quick HTML code painful, for no good reason.Still, even for all my complaints, I rate it pretty highly.  Its the only respectable Android phone on a prepaid provider, and thankfully it's a slider.  It'll run all your Android apps including Flash and Firefox, unlike other, equally inexpensive smart phones that skimp on the CPU.  There are exceedingly few apps that have issues.  The 2GB SD card is intolerably small, so another required accessory.Battery life is right on-par with other Android phones...

I give this phone 4 1/2 stars.  I really like it so far.  The voice quality of calls are great and it has all the features I need and want.  The only negatives are that the keys are a little small so even with my small fingers, when typing I often hit multiple keys and have to correct this; also, I have to remember to hit the power button after I'm finished so that I don't accidently call someone or start an app.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very, very satisfied customer!", "Author": "Tiltawhirl", "ReviewID": "R31V48H6JN5NSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new phone. It was very easy to set up and get familiar with. I have consumed hours of my life playing with this phone, seriously addicting and easy to navigate. I liked this phone so much that I bought one for my husband.I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants an iPhone, but doesn't want to pay a fortune for the phone and the service. Boost has never been a problem for me at all, no dropped calls, no waiting for texts or picture messages and the internet works very well on the go.The only problem I have with this phone is the camera. The shutter speed is SUPER SLOW, but I will sacrifice the camera for all the other things this phone has to offer.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "the best!!!!", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "RHTTEBPTCMCKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the first new phone I want to get from boost and I had to get a different one but then I found this price for the phone and thought no way cuz in boost its 230 and I got this cell new and a car charger with a hip case for half the price and accessories then paying a lot in the store and only getting the phone ...
