{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Apple iPhone 4S, Does it Live up to the Hype?", "Author": "The Gifted One", "ReviewID": "RU8SSJU4T6AUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I entered the smartphone world back in 2008 staring with the Apple iPhone 3G.  Coming over from my old Sprint flip-phone, the iPhone 3G was a major upgrade and blew my mind with how much it could do.  It was amazing that cell phones had advanced into a sort of mini-PC.Fast forward to the present-day and I have now used and experimented with various smartphones, different cellphone companies, and smartphones OS's (iOS, Android, Windows, etc).  I also run my own small cell phone shop and get to play with these devices on a daily basis.  Back in the iPhone 3G days, there were only a few smartphone options to choose from.  Today there are literally hundreds of devices across several carriers.  All with different functions and designs.  I'm going to cover how the iPhone 4S stacks up to the competition, what the competition is, what the 4S can do, and what improvements it makes over its predecessor, the iPhone 4.HARDWAREThe iPhone 4S is almost identical in hardware design to the iPhone 4.  It features the same rectangular shape with the flat gorilla glass back and front screen.  The front and rear camera are in the same position.  The only visible difference on the outside of the phone is that the volume controls are slightly moved on the 4S.  The real difference in the hardware is on the inside.  The iPhone 4S uses a dual-core \"A5\" processor.  This makes it significantly faster than the iPhone 4.  The processor is the raw power that apps need in order to operate fast and fluidly without slowdown or hiccups.  With basic use, users probably won't notice much difference from the iPhone 4's speed.  The extra power boost mainly shows its worth when playing some of the more high-end iOS games and apps.CAMERAIn addition to the new processor, the iPhone 4S has an improved 8 megapixel camera.  It also now has the ability to capture full 1080p HD Video.  Unless you're a professional photographer, you will be blown away with how great the 4S is at taking pictures.  It is on par with most of the dedicated point-and-shoot cameras that are currently on the market.  Images are clear, crisp, and very colorful.  I even sold my 10MP Canon point-and-shoot after using the 4S for a few weeks.  When comparing pictures taken with the iPhone 4 side by side to the 4S, the difference is like night and day.  As for the 1080P videos, they're also very beautiful.  Just like the photos, the videos rival dedicated point-and-shoot devices and look absolutely gorgeous on the iPhone's retina display screen.  The only drawback to these 1080p videos is that they can take up large amounts of memory.  So if you plan on shooting a large amount of video, you may need to consider getting the 32GB or 64GB iPhone 4S.SIGNAL RECEPTION AND DATA SPEEDSThe iPhone 4S has been expanded to include a 3rd US carrier Sprint.  This brings your total choices to Verizon, AT&T;, and Sprint.Signal reception and data speeds will vary by carrier and location, so I'll give you some basic information about what to expect on average.  Signal reception is greatly improved compared to the iPhone 4.  The antenna problem from the iPhone 4 has been removed and the 4S uses separate antennas for incoming and outgoing calls in order to increase overall reception. AT&T; is a GSM carrier while Sprint and Verizon are CDMA carriers.  Verizon has the overall largest and most expansive voice coverage of the three, closely followed by AT&T;, with Sprint in third.  The 4S Data speeds will largely vary by carrier and location.  Being a GSM carrier, AT&T; is the only iPhone carrier capable of using the 4S's improved HSPA+ data speeds.  AT&T; users will notice their iPhones showing \"4G\" in the top left corner rather than 3G.  Though this is faster than standard 3G, do not confuse it with the much faster 4G LTE network.  The iPhone 4S is not yet capable of using that network.  Verizon is second in 3G data speeds, with Sprint bringing up the rear.  Again, these are average speeds from across the nation.  Individual results may vary depending on your location.  It is also important to note that Sprint is the only carrier that still offers unlimited data.  This may be an important factor in choosing a carrier for some.BATTERY LIFEiPhone owners have come to expect excellent battery life from their devices.  Previous iPhones have ranked among the most impressive in terms of battery life compared to rival Android devices.  In the past each new iteration of the iPhone had better battery life than the previous device.  With the 4S however, the overall battery life is about the same as the iPhone 4.  Apple claims this is mainly because of the dual-core processor used by the 4S as well as the more demanding iOS 5 software that is included with the iPhone 4S.  Due to this, there were some widespread complaints about the iPhone 4S battery life initially.  Apple has since addressed the issue with their iOS 5.1 update.  The iPhone 4S now ranks among the top smartphones in overall battery life.  I can easily get through a full day on one full charge of average use.SOFTWAREUsually when comparing the iPhone to other phones, it comes down to the software.  There is a big ongoing debate among techies between the iPhone's operating system \"iOS\" and Google's \"Android\" operating system.  It's comparable to the famous PC vs Mac debate.  Rather than type a whole page comparing the two, I'll just cover a few basics.  The main difference between the two is choice.  Customize or not customize.  iOS is more fluid and crisp out of the box.  All iPhones/iPods/iPads use this standard OS.  Less powerful iOS devices are often able to move as fast or faster than more powerful Android counterparts.  However, major modifications and customizations of Apple's iOS are not possible.  The standard 4x4 row of icons is what you will get.  Android offers tons of customization options.  This is great for advanced tech users, but can be overwhelming to novice smartphone users or those not really interested in editing and customizing a lot to get the device to do what they need it to do.  I usually recommend iOS to customers new to smartphones due to its more simple and easy to use interface.  If you like customizing and making your the software on your phone look different from everyone else, I recommend an Android device.The other major software difference between iOS and Android is the Apps.  The Apple app store still has by far the most support and overall apps from developers.  Most developers create an app for the iPhone first and port it later on to Android, or sometimes not at all.  From personal experiences with both, I can say that many times the iPhone version of an app usually runs better or has more features.SIRI Personal AssistantUnless you've been under a rock for the past few months, you've heard of the iPhone 4S's SIRI personal assistant software.  Apple touts it as a feature that allows you to speak voice commands to your iPhone and SIRI will do whatever you ask it to do.  Well it can do some things, but not quite everything.  SIRI is great for finding places for you.  You can say simple things like \"I'm hungry\" and SIRI will open the Maps App and show you the location of all restaurants in the nearby area.  You can also do things like tell it to play a certain song or artist from the music stored on your iPhone or ask it the Weather forecast for any given day.  SIRI can also be pretty entertaining when asked random conversational questions.  Questions such as \"How old are you?\" will cause SIRI to respond \"Does this concern you?\", \"I didn't think so\".  Or saying silly things such as \"SIRI I love you\" will cause it to say \"I'll bet you say that to all your Apple products\".  Overall it's a pretty nice added feature, but not a major selling point at this time.  It's limitation is that it currently is only integrated with the standard apps that Apple provides on the iPhone.  Once it is integrated with more of the third-part apps, I can see it becoming a seriously useful feature.Overall I would definitely recommend the iPhone 4S.  From the sleek hardware design, the beautiful camera, and the very large Apple App store, it's my top phone at the moment.  The iPhone 4S has the battery life to last most people a full day and in terms of overall speed and ease of use, it is currently among the best available.  The only people who I would not recommend the 4S to are current iPhone 4 owners.  With all of the iPhone 4S's improvements, I don't feel like they're significant enough to spend more money to upgrade from your iPhone 4.  You will be better off waiting for whatever iPhone Apple releases later this year.  However if you're looking to purchase your first smartphone, tired of your old Blackberry or Android device, or just have an older iPhone 3GS or 3G, I would strongly recommend getting the iPhone 4S if possible.  Using a smartphone has never been easier.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Siri, Call...Siri, Send An E-Mail to...Love This new iPhone", "Author": "Vincent E. Martin \"Darkbard\"", "ReviewID": "R1WSYPW281JIVZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First a confession: I make my living installing, configuring, and supporting Microsoft products, and I even own a Windows Phone 7, but I am fast becoming an Apple convert.  My portable MP3 player is an Apple iPod Touch (4th) Generation and I am on my second iPad!  The Apple name has become known for innovative products that just work and work well. Sure they're a little more expensive than their competitors, but the company's product are well worth the entry price.So, even though I own and use a Windows Phone 7, I had to spring for an Apple 4S 16GB phone not long after it hit my local Best Buy.The \"iPhone 4S 16GB\" FactsThe \"iPhone 4S\" is the latest and greatest smart phone from Apple. The top-of-the-line unit features an Apple A5 Dual-Core processor, IOS 5.0 & iCloud, all new 8MP camera and optics, 3.5-inch (diagonal) Retina widescreen Multi-Touch display with 960-by-640 pixel resolution.  And introducing Siri, a truly remarkable voice recognition system that has thus far lived up to its considerable commercial billing.The 4.9 pound iPhone 4S is the same size and weight as its predecessor the iPhone 4, but is an improvement over its older sibling.  Other new features include: 1080p High Definition (HD) video recording, all new optics, Notification Center, Photo Stream, iMessage, iCloud, and Twitter integration all made possible by IOZS 5.0.No matter what hardware version (16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPhone 4S is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the top to the right left of the power button.  Along the left edge of the ultra-thin (0.37\") iPhone 4S you will find the vibrate/sound slider switch along with the volume control buttons.  On the bottom of the unit you will find the proprietary USB power port. And since it is proprietary you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord, you can plug it into your computer and sync with iTunes and charge the device.  There is also a standard 120 volt plug-in so you can change the unit via an outlet.Siri Likes MeBefore I picked up the iPhone 4S a friend and colleague of mine purchased one.  When I asked her about it she stated that Siri \"was not her friend!\"  When I asked her to explain further she stated that about the only thing she could get Siri to do was wake her up in the morning; the voice commands were just not producing the expected or desired results.Needless to say I was a little apprehensive about Siri myself, but my experience with the technology has been vastly different from my colleague's.  Siri has never failed to deliver for me, not once and I am in love with the convenience the technology represents.What is Siri?  Siri is billed as an \"intelligent assistant that helps you get things done.  All you have to do is ask.\"  Siri is voice recognition software taken to a whole new level.  Now the technology has been around for years, but it has never been perfect and never heavily commercialized, but the technology is now ready for commercial debut in a big way.With Siri I can make phone calls, ask for directions, send text messages, dictate and send e-mail, schedule meetings, set reminders, locate hotels, restaurants and other commercial establishments in a given location, etc., all of which I have done successfully with Siri.  So, I can only conclude that Siri likes me!iCloudApple IOS 5.0 ships with Apples' newest innovation iCloud a technology that allows one to sync all of your various Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod) wirelessly via the \"cloud.\"  iCloud \"stores you music, photos, electronic books, apps, mail (only @me.com e-mail), contacts, calendars, and documents (only iPage documents). Once turned on it works automatically across devices.  Add something to one device and it will show up on the other device when it syncs.Now this does not mean that all of your music will suddenly appear everywhere.  Default space for iCloud is only 5GB (more space can be purchase if needed; 10GB: $20.00/Year, 20GB: $40.00/Year, and 50GB: $100.00/Year), and only purchased music is synced via iCloud unless you sign up for iTunes Match a technology that allows you to access all your other music from iCloud -- including music you've ripped from your CD collection.  Price: $24.99 a year and requires IOS 5.0.1.Setting up iTunes Match is a three step process and takes a while to complete.  All of your various devices will need to be setup for use the service once it's completely set up.  I signed up for the service and it works rather well.First Impressions:I really, really like my new iPhone 4S 16GB with a couple of reservations; 1. the phone doesn't always place a call the first time a number is dialed.  When this happens I have to hang up and dial again.  Another gripe is one I share with most iPhone 4 users: battery power, or the lack thereof.  The unit is only good for a day of moderate use.  Standby time will last a little longer, say 48 hours.Like all Apple devices setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; when turned on the antenna continually looks for new Wi-Fi connections and once connected, it remembers and automatically connects to the Wi-Fi network when next encountered.What make the iPhone so useful, far and away more than any phone I have ever used, are the Apps.  And iPhone ships with plenty.  New with IOS 5.0 is iMessage a texting app that speaks via e-mail address or phone number.  Texting is automatic between iPhone, iPad, and iPod.Heat & NoiseThere is neither of both; end of story.ConclusionsThe iPhone 4S is a winner in my book, despite the lack of a \"5\" moniker.  The combination of light weight, functionality, and connectedness is far better than phones I have used in the past.  The Windows Phone 7 comes close, but falls short of the mark in several arenas.  And Siri, I like Siri and Siri likes me.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE APPLE but lukewarm on iPhone 4S", "Author": "wcorcoran", "ReviewID": "R3JWJ66A3OQEUT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my Apple Products and will continue to buy them.  However, am a little disappointed in the new 4S.  The mapping features have a lot of inaccuracies.  Siri can sometimes help, but is mostly annoying.  She stopped being funny a long time ago.  I have four kids that can get smart with me.  If she was more helpful, it wouldn't be as annoying.  But, in all honesty, I find it easier and less distracting to simply use the internet.  An important footnote.  If you are new to the iPhone, I think getting the 4S is a good idea.  It is the best of the iPhones.  But if you have an iPhone 4 (like I did), you might just want to wait until the next generation!", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent little device.", "Author": "Kelsey Beaudion", "ReviewID": "R3O1YTXLJ4WX8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I begin, I have to say that I did not purchase my iPhone 4S here on Amazon; instead, I upgraded through AT&T;'s website, so I cannot speak for the speed of shipping, packaging, etc.I upgraded from the iPhone 4 because my fiance dropped it in a bucket of bleach water.  Despite the fact that it did dry up and work again, the speaker when making phone calls was completely shot.  I was hoping to hold out until a significant change in the iPhone lineup came out, but things do not always go as planned - I am sure you all know that story.The call quality seems to be much better than my old phone, as long as I have at least two bars or more of signal, even though they may not differ much in the looks department.  Friends and family have also reported being able to hear me better as well.I LOVE the camera.  The picture clarity is unbeatable.  Unless you are an aspiring photographer, I really feel as though I do not need to carry around a camera, too.  Since you can now double click the home button to get the camera to launch, it does not take nearly as long as it used to.  Love that feature!  I was initially concerned that they had removed the zoom feature, so that would have been my only complaint with the camera.  However, while playing around with it on, I noticed that if I touched two fingers to the screen and moved them outwards in opposite directions, the zoom option appeared.  I decided to test it out and take a few pictures, and the quality is still great even zoomed in!  Pretty impressive, considering when I zoomed in on my old one, the quality diminished significantly the more I zoomed in.iCloud is a fantastic addition, too.  I love being able to track my iPhone in the event it gets lost, though I surely hope it does not!  It is quick and easy to locate, if necessary... and yes, I have had a blast testing that out as well.I have had no issues with Siri.  I do have a pretty strong southern accent, so I find myself having to think about what I am saying and adjust the way I say some words.  Siri almost always gets what I say right.  And I love being able to set reminders for myself... being forgetful is definitely disadvantageous - especially for me.* Why I took off one star.I took off a star because battery life is very important to me, and it seems that this phone does not live up to my expectations.  I do not do much on my phone as I work 8am-5pm every day, but I do check Facebook every now and then and I play Tiny Tower (not really enough to make a huge difference).  With that being said, I do expect the battery to drain because of this - I am not expecting a Super Batter that only loses 10% throughout the day.  However, when I get home around 5:30pm and have 5% battery left when it hardly got used, that's not entirely acceptable to me.  Through a little research, though, I learned that if Location Services was turned on, it drains battery life even if you are not using it.  I have not noticed much difference even when I have Location Services off, so I really cannot comment on that.Over all, Apple did a great job upgrading and fixing many issues I had with the previous models of iPhones.  This is my fourth iPhone, and each time I have upgraded, I have been pleased.  This is no exception.  It is a great little device full of everything I expect.  I am happy.  While this phone may not be for everyone, it is great for me and I absolutely love everything it can do.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Siri and iCloud make me lazy...", "Author": "M. Hagler", "ReviewID": "R39N2P777SYK44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not want to upgrade to the iPhone 4S.  My 3GS was fantastic, did everything I could want it to; why spend the money?  However, the battery charge port on my old and trusted sidekick started to have problems, and I was eventually left with no other choice.  In the beginning the differences seem subtle, and I missed the 3GS.  While the screen sports a much higher image quality, it is also slightly smaller than my fat fingers expect it to be.  Otherwise I noticed no difference on day 1. In a couple of hours I adjusted to the screen size and we were rolling.  The retina display does make a difference, and you will notice as you upgrade apps and spend time with the phone.  Pictures look much better, web pages are less eye straining; it's a good experience.  The camera is much better than my 3GS; the 4S sports an 8mp HDR camera that captures portraits and sunsets with ease and quality comparable to a high-end point and shoot camera.  It is great for days I want to leave my DSLR and camera bag behind.  There is a flash built in, but you will find yourself using that more as a flashlight than anything (there's an app for that).But we haven't gotten to the feature that really sets the 4S apart from its' competitors and successors.Siri.I can not say enough how much I love this feature.  \"Send my dad a message saying I found his wallet\".... and it's done.  \"Where is the nearest place to order chinese food\"... and there's a map and a phone number.  Driving and receive a text message?  No problem.  \"Read me that last message...\" done... \"and reply with _____\"... and done.  You do need access to signal or wifi, but any more where do you not have one of these things?  Initially I did not use this feature much, but as I have grown accustomed to having it at my disposal and learned how best to command it for proper results I have become increasingly inclined to use Siri over navigating between apps and typing.  There are a few things I think Siri should be able to do that it can't (like enable/disable bluetooth, wifi, location settings, etc.), but as this software is in beta I can't be overly critical.Buy this phone if you don't have an iPhone.  I'm not a fan boy and this is the only Mac hardware that I own, but it is a great piece of equipment that will make your time on your phone more productive.If you have an iPhone 3 or prior model, buy this phone at your next upgrade.If you have an iPhone 3GS or 4, you may as well wait.  Siri is great and the camera is nice, but the differences in processor speed and screen resolution are not, while noticeable, mind blowing.  At some point there will be another major hardware overhaul.

I have an iPod Touch but I wanted to try an Android for cost as well as Sprint's unlimited data plan.  I found that the Android didn't do a good job as a music player like the iPhone.  I had trouble finding apps that always run like on an iPhone.  I found that unlike the iPhone, doing simple things like powering on and using the GPS was laborious and very slow.The iPhone simply works.  It turns on quickly and turns off.  The GPS is not always in use but it's always ready and providing location data.  The form factor is elegant and substantial.  The iPhone interface is wonderful.  Having a phone integrated with your apps, music, and video can't be understated.  Take it from someone who tried to have an iPod and a smartphone.  You're so much better off having everything in one device.The Androids just have varying levels of hardware capability, whereas with Apple they control the hardware and the app store so everything runs fine.  Also, unlike Android, you have one memory store for everything.  No more moving apps to an SD card before running out of phone memory, and then finding out the app publisher disallows you from moving the app to the card!  With an Android you find yourself needing to do system code changes to get admin privileges to do the things the phone should do itself, all the while risking turning it into a \"brick.\"  Unless you want to play around with your device all the time, get an iPhone if you just need something to do a job fast and neatly.A few words about Siri: she mostly works well.  I find I use her when I want to find something out but am driving or unable to type, or just don't feel like opening Safari and typing something in a search engine.  I should use her more often.The only thing the Android had better was Google's navigation program.  Apple's map program isn't a good GPS.  Fortunately there are two programs you can download that are in Apple's Top 25.  The one I chose is comparable to Google's GPS program, and it has the traffic integration.

I was able to find a deal on iPhone 4Ss through the online classifieds and sell my and my wife's iPhone 4 for a very good price so in the end it cost me about $120 in the end.Primarily the camera has been upgraded to 8MP and improvements with the lens. In real life usage compared to the 4, I noticed sharper photos and better exposure and it's taking more time away from my point and shoot and SLR. Video quality has improved dramatically, there's much better clarity with 1080P, less hunting with the autofocus and image stabilization makes it slightly less jerky when moving. It also does startup faster where you don't have that 4-5 seconds of looking at the closed shutter, but perhaps 1-2 seconds pause. We take a lot of pics and videos of my son, so having the better camera really is nice to have.In terms of CPU speed, the iPhone 4S is noticably faster but hard to describe because it's not that the same apps won't run fine on an iPhone 4. It's mostly just snappiness in starting up apps, navigating menus, games, etc and this makes is a pleasure to use. The 4 has a small delay once in a while after installing iOS5 that makes you wish it has just a bit more power and this delivers.The other aspect of speed is the improved 3G speeds which is really hard to compare between cities and locations. What I can say is that in areas of strong signals, you probably get the same speeds as the iPhone 4 as the bottleneck tends to be the cell carrier. However if you're like me you're not always in the best areas, my office tends to get awful signals due to the walls and I'm on the edge of getting between No Service and I've mapped out my desk to one location I can get 2-3 bars with 3G. The 4S doesn't give additional bars so don't assume that if you had a dead zone, that the 4S will solve that problem. However for weak signals, my speeds are significantly faster with 2-3 bars, going from a barely usable 0.5 Mbps to 2.5 Mbps. Since I'm at my work the most, I found this made the iPhone more useful and productive. I can download podcasts, stream videos, install apps, etc.The last point from upgrading to the 4S is piece of mind. I was out of warranty with the 4 and buying new provided me another year of support and as well I reused my case which was $30 saved.Again, the list is small and sounds like it's not worth upgrading, but I  really love using the 4S, it really does feel this refined and perfected where the 4 was 80% where they wanted to go. This is the sleeper model similar to performance cars, STI for Suburu, SRT for Chrysler, M3 to BMW, AMG to Benz, etc. It's not for everyone to upgrade but if you use an iPhone everyday, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the market.", "Author": "MTH", "ReviewID": "R23LLFFORDPVDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AWESOME phone. like other people, i LOVE all the previous iphones i've encountered. and this is one of them.I do have to admit, i'm a bit biased because i'm a fan of apple, so i seem to like everything good about the product and omit the bad things.if you're still deciding on an iPhone 4, 4s, or a 3gs, here's how it goes:only big difference i noticed in the iphone 4 and 4s is that the camera is better, faster loading(I tested), and of course, who could forget the sexy robotic voice, SIRISIRI: Honestly, Siri isn't that smart. she repeats everything she said. her favorite line: \"i don't know what you mean by....\" so, if you're thinking of the iphone 4s JUST for siri, then i suggest you wait for the iPhone 5, they'll make siri better, or add more money worthy features.CAMERA: I LOVE the new camera they put in. the aperture was completely flawless, just like i took my pictures of a $1000 camera. it's just amazing.

The one downside is she won't pick up on my three and a half year old niece's voice (\"Siri, do you know what my daddy's name is?\")And the screen! It is so f'ing nice to touch. My finger just glides across it. It's like running your finger over a cloud. A cloud full of puppies.Also, the battery life is quite good. I can play games and surf the web during my entire three hour class, and the battery does very well. I don't know if it'll hold up for long (though I can update you during the fall semester). I do have to charge it every night, but that's not really an issue since I'm sleeping.The rear camera is super nice. My pictures are always very clear. There is also a flash in the back. The front camera could be better. The pictures are a little grainy, but they're still good enough to put on Facebook.Literally the only bad thing about this phone is I can't take pictures of myself using it and looking cool.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent professional smartphone, the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts", "Author": "Jaffrey W. Ali \"Relentless Pursuit of Technology\"", "ReviewID": "R42H8OAWFFFCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I have owned an iPhone 4S for around a year now, the purpose of my review is for someone who may be considering the iPhone 4S as a current buy. Getting straight to the pros and cons of the iPhone:1. Extremely well balanced feature set that makes it ideal for everyday use. The redesigned antenna works very well even in low signal areas, the music player, the web browser, the email client, the App Store, the camera and battery life are all best in class in my opinion.2. Out of the Apple services, the Maps app has a very good UI and is good for turn by turn navigation but the points of interest database isn't as good as Google - BUT you can always use Google Maps over the browser if you like so that is NOT a limitation in my opinion, AirPlay is very useful if you also have an Apple TV at home, iMessage and FaceTime are not unique in that other platforms have similar inbuilt apps, but the iPhone 4S implementation is simply better because the UI is much more straightforward and it never ever locks up the device or causes it to crash.3. Siri works very well for voice commands and has gotten much better of late. iCloud is also another well executed service if you want to store music and movies in the cloud and then access it from any Apple device. The iPhone 4S integration with iCloud is very good and with it, you don't need to ever connect an iPhone 4S to a computer. I have never connected mine to a PC in a year.4. The screen is very clear and is easily visible even in direct sunlight - even at max brightness the iPhone 4S has more than acceptable battery life. All the other large screen phones I have used, at max brightness the battery life start declining at very fast rate. In a nutshell, with the iPhone 4S one is not compromising acceptable battery life for screen brightness.5. While some may find the Apple UI boring, the advantage is that the UI is not intrusive and let's a user focus squarely on using apps and not on fiddling with features and functions on the device.6. The size is smaller than the typical Android phone, but the iphone 4S has a very good overall feel and for my daily use it is very convenient. I guess if you play a lot of games then a larger screen may be acceptable, but as a daily smartphone the iPhone 4S is extremely well designed aesthetically and in size. The iphone 4S is completely one hand operational without any issues whatsoever. The phone is also very well balanced to hold.7. The glass back is likely to break and that is probably the biggest drawback of the iPhone 4/S design. If you are someone who drops their phone then you simply have to get a bumper, with the bumper the phone is pretty much shatter proof. I have dropped mine with a bumper several times and the phone is still scratch free.In my opinion, the iPhone 4S is a true classic. It will easily meet the needs of most people who use smartphones. It is extremely well balanced with features and design. I didn't really mention games as a strong point, but the Apple App Store easily has the most compelling games available for a smartphone even if the screen is smaller on the iPhone. In the end the difference in screen size between the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 is only half an inch and between an iPhone 4S and the larger Android phones it's only an inch or so. In terms usability, the extra screen real estate does not matter much especially since the UI on the 4S is so smooth and responsive and zooming in and out is not an issue. It is much worse when you have a larger screen but the phone's UI stutters and apps crash and you need to remove the battery every now and then to reboot it.The iPhone 4S is one of the best consumer electronics products I have ever owned. It is so well executed that I believe it will be considered a classic. The 4S is a much better phone than the 4 and justifies the upgrade, but in my humble opinion the jump from 4S to 5 is much more subtle in terms of what more the phone can do.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Iphone4s vs Galaxy epic 4G", "Author": "Gerald Brown", "ReviewID": "RBJT409E3L89A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i had both phones and at first i thought the galaxy was gonna be better cause it had the larger screen and the swype text mode and other little featuresbut......the iphone 4S is actually better i was shockedthe 4G that the galaxy has is very fast.....its faster than the iphone 4S but its not that much faster.........the screen on the galaxy is bigger than the iphone...however the iphone is still the better phonethe reason why is because the set up.......iphone has 1 home screen button that brings you back to the main screen it is much easier to navigate through the iphone than the galaxy....if i need to get to something fast i can do it much faster on my iphone than on the galaxy...also if i need to do something without looking on the screen i can use the siri function which although it is overrated , it is very useful sometimes....also because there is a bigger screen on the galaxy you also have more clutter..which means you have to fish through icons to find what you want to get to...the video display and pictures on the iphone are amazing...OverallAndroid has nice phones but there are sometimes too much stuff on them......keep it simple with the iphone you will be happier...easier to navigate on the iphone 4S", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone! but seller not good at all!", "Author": "G.

Firstly it's a beautiful phone, both externally, and in terms of interface. Everything is gorgeous, smooth moving, and clean looking. The interface never becomes jerky or slow, unlike with my Desire, and although that sounds like a minor thing, it actually makes a huge amount of difference: Just using the phone is enjoyable, everything feels really \"solid\".The keyboard is also FAR improved to the one I had to suffer with for two years on my HTC Desire. I've only had my iPhone a few days and I'm already a fast typer than I ever was with that phone. Well done, Apple!That said, there are few things that my HTC Desire did better:1. The Desire came with an LED indicator that would flash green if I had any updates. That meant that I could glance at my phone across the room and see if I had any texts, missed calls, emails, Facebook updates, etc. It was very handy. The iPhone 4S has a feature to use its flash in a similar manner, but it actually only flashes the instant you receive a text or email. Then it stops, meaning it's pretty useless.2. The Desire came with a way to control the cursor. The \"home\" button on that phone also detected finger movement. If I was typing something and I wanted to go back a few characters, I could just move my thumb across it, and control the flashing cursor between the letters. It was extremely useful and I find myself trying to do it on the iPhone. Unfortunately on the iPhone all you can do is hold your finger on the screen and drag the cursor to where you want it to be (you also had this option on the Desire, but I never used it because the other way was far more efficient). It's a little glitchy and a lot slower. Shame.3. When I wanted to search the internet for something with my HTC Desire, I could just press the \"Search\" button on the case. It was quick and intuitive. On the iPhone it's astonishingly laborious: You must go into the web browser and select the \"Google\" bar on the top right hand corner of the screen. It's not THAT bad, however, because there's a shortcut that allows you to zip up to the top of the screen.4. Although the scrolling is wonderfully smooth on the iPhone (certainly smoother than the Desire was), it's a lot slower. On my Desire I could \"flick\" the screen with my finger and it would keep scrolling on its own, with its own inertia (it would eventually slow down depending on how fast I had \"flicked\" it). This was fantastic when all you want to do is check for new comments on a blog post. You could quickly and easily scroll down to the bottom of a page, without any finger strain.On the iPhone the scrolling stops soon after you let go, making navigating long pages a very arduous experience indeed.5. On top of the lack of an LED indicator, the iPhone is also lacking with regards to keeping you informed of updates. On my HTC Desire there would be an icon at the top of the screen, no matter what I was doing, letting me know if I had any updates. A different icon for each update: An email, a text message, a missed call, a Facebook update, a new Twitter message, etc.On the iPhone you get informed, but then it's gone. It's hard to explain how this isn't as good as the Android equivalent, and I understand that it probably sounds minor to those who have never used an Android phone.Update: I've actually gotten used the Apple way of doing things, so while it may jar for those who move across, chances are you'll adapt like I have.6. One of the best Apps on the Android is a free one called \"FoxyRing\". It has a terrible name, but it's brilliant: It automatically adjusts your ring/notification volume for you, depending on the loudness of the ambient sound around you. Just walked into a Library? It will turn the volume down for you. In the middle of a gig? It will turn it up for you. All done automatically. You can also set it so that your phone automatically goes to silent at a given time, every evening (say 11pm) and goes back to normal (i.e. automatically adjusting your volume) at 8am. In other words, I never had to worry about my phone's volume, it was just taken care of.Sadly Apple do not allow Apps to have this sort of control, and they don't have the equivalent system built in to their OS. It's a real shame because I think it will eventually become standard in the future for people not to have to worry about their phone's volume.Anyways, this is a minor concern, because a lot of people won't have that particular App.So ultimately, while there are flaws with this phone, they don't ruin the experience. It's a little shocking to me, as a new user, that Apple has seen fit to focus their attention on gimmicks like \"Siri\" (I don't know anyone who really makes use of it), when there are could be some great improvements made to the interface.Would I go back to an Android? Nope. At least, not right now. The experience on the iPhone, however frustratingly idiosyncratic at times, is still an enjoyable one. The little graphical touches, the slickness of the presentation, and the simplicity of use, all make it really satisfying. After the many quirks of my Android phone, it's really nice to have a phone \"that just works\". It may not do exactly what you want it to do, but what it does do, it does extremely well.Final note: Be prepared to spend a bit extra on a case and/or screen protector. Not only is the iPhone notoriously fragile and prone to smashing if dropped (I know about five people with cracked screens), it's also pretty slippery in your hand compared to other phones. A rubber case will make it less likely to take a tumble out of your hand, and a screen protector will keep that glass screen scratch free. It's an unfortunate hidden cost, in my opinion.Additional note: If you're an Android user, you may also be shocked to discover how lacklustre Apple's support for Facebook and GMail are. Both of these apps are not as good as their Android counterparts at the time of writing, and there's no way to \"link\" phone numbers to Facebook accounts. Another annoying, but minor, quirk of the iPhone to be aware of.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nightmare to Set-Up; Fun To Use Afterwards", "Author": "Eric K.", "ReviewID": "R3TFU8MWPT617U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that setting up the iPhone initially is a nightmare that can take -- literally -- days.  I can't even imagine how horrifying it would be for someone who isn't familiar with network connections, programming issues, etc.  There's this connection, that connection, linking it up to iTunes on a computer, contacting Sprint to resolve issues, contacting Sprint again to resolve more (or the same) issues.  I had better luck with reception in the 1970s with a sheet of tinfoil and a TV antenna.  I've had the phone for over a week, and I'm still contacting Sprint to resolve set-up issues.The iPhone activated in stages.  An hour after \"activating\" it online (and connecting it to iTunes), the phone part started to work so I could make outgoing calls.  Two hours later, the Internet kicked in.  Three hours later, texting became available.  Why it's not \"plug and play\" baffles my mind in today's fast-paced, instantaneous world.Then came issues with the phone calls and texts.  We finally discovered that it was because the Airave that Sprint sent us because we have poor Sprint reception at our house (in a heavily populated neighborhood) wasn't/isn't compatible with the iPhone.  It \"hiccups.\"  Phone calls go straight to voicemail.  Texts won't send out.  Multiple same texts come in.  Over and over and over again.  After reading up online about other people's similar problems and contacting Sprint over and over again, we finally just unplugged the Airave.  It was the lesser of two evils.Another problem that arose was that when sending texts to email accounts, they showed up as picture mail, regardless of a picture being attached or not.  Several chats with Sprint later, there's still no resolution.  We've given up on that.  Similarly, when sending these \"texts\" to email accounts, the email address shown was a randomly generated email address based on the first person's name of the shared family plan.  That became confusing when the person sending the text wasn't the first person on the plan.  Two hours of chatting with Sprint, that was finally resolved.  (You can't manually change it online yourself for whatever reason.)The actual iPhone itself is fun to use.  The apps available are numerous, and you have to hunt and peck to find out which ones appeal most to you, download them, arrange them, and learn how to use them.The sound on voice calls isn't as good as my last non-smart Samsung phone, but I'm getting used to it.With my old phone, I could charge it every three days or so.  With the iPhone, I have to charge -- at the minimum -- nightly.  It drains energy/power faster than a half-working air conditioner in NYC in the middle of summer.  And this is just casually using it during the day, not heavily.  I also practice steps to reduce the power usage: toning down the screen brightness, closing all apps after use, etc.  I recommend getting multiple charging adapters -- for home, work, and car.  But make sure to only charge them fully when they're close to being out of power.I went with the iPhone 4S vs. the iPhone 4 mainly for Siri.  I thought that would be a great addition/concept, especially while driving.  Unfortunately, Siri has a mind of her own and only wants to work when she wants to work.  I'm constantly getting, \"I'm sorry, but I cannot take requests at this time.  Please try again later.\"  Isn't the main purpose of asking things of Siri because you need that information RIGHT NOW?  Like directions?  Or to remind you of something later because you'll forget?  In those cases, \"trying again later\" isn't feasible.  My advice is to NOT get the 4S for Siri alone.  Get it for other features/reasons.  Otherwise, stick with the very similar 4 and save yourself a hundred bucks or so.Do I recommend it?  Maybe.  Once you get over the huge hurdles of set-up, it can be fun to use, and the features are nice to have at your fingertips.  I don't have any comparisons to other smartphones, though, so I can't say whether the iPhone is better than others or not.

Oh, I've phoned Apple customer support about both the battery and vibrate issue and have been told there's nothing they can do about either. Have another computer at home and/or at work where you get a lot of e-mail?  Don't plan on deleting it easily from your iphone 4s:  there is no \"select all\" or \"delete all\" option on the inbox.

Call me an old curmudgeon, but I just call them like I see them. I got the phone when it first came out, so have had it for some time.Bottom line is that it is not a very good telephone. The number one reason I have a telephone is to make telephone calls, and I would like that part of it to work exceptionally, and it does not. Here are my list of concerns.1) Dropped/Missed calls- I live very near an AT&T; tower, and have a clear line of sight to the tower, but rarely have more than one bar at my house. The phone does not ring when someone calls me, but informs me later that I have had a missed call. Similarly, it regularly drops my calls, or gives me a \"no service\" error message.2) Poor Battery Life- I would expect a cell phone to get me through the day on a full charge. I do not mind charging the phone every night, but I want it to get me through the day. I have found that you can not depend on this phone to make it through the day. Even doing things like turning the bluetooth off and all that does not get me to the point that I can even moderately use it and not have the battery dead before I get home.3) Poor sound quality- When on the phone, I do not get crystal clear voice quality.4) Jams up - Phone jams on me every couple of weeks and I have to reset it.

Again, the battery drains real fast which is a bummer but I had the same problem with my incredible R.I.P so I guess it's a general smartphone issue (still a drag though).I know it seems like I have more bad than good to say about the iPhone, and it is a review I'm posting after 5 months of use, but I'm aware that a lot of this negativeness is due to me getting use to a different platform.

Not too much of a fan of the iCloud services especially when it comes to my music library. I have about 15,000 songs in my iTunes collection.  iCloud, from a iTunes standpoint, was an absolute nightmare. It is nice to be able to sync pictures and email between all of your Macintosh gadgets but this is a service that needs to mature for a year or two more before it is really ready for prime time. It works okay but, there are glitches that need to be worked out. If you have multiple accounts and you want the iCloud service for all the music your purchased from iTunes, you're going to have to pay for each separate account. They don't have a way of combining accounts and rolling them all together.The ups:Siri, the Camera, and the Messaging Capability:  All integrated. This is a product that you can't live without. I go everywhere with this iPhone, I dictate about 30 to 40 pages of work a day into this telephone, I take scads of pictures everywhere I go, and by using Siri I can fire off texts  so many times per minute that people tell me it should be illegal to be able to text as fast as I do.

Such a huge leap up from my old 3G it's unreal. I even found a way to get siri to cuss at me! I tell her to play a song by Pantera, \"F***ing Hostile,\" and she says, \"playing F***ing Hostile.\" Cool. That siri gal has a bit of an attitude, too! She will give you some snarky answers.So anyway, I realize this phone is a stopgap to hold people until the REAL iphone 5 is released. I realize I'm locked into this phone for 2 years, and it won't be the newest thing for all that time. So? This is way better than the one I had, and I'm a patient person. I'm enjoying vastly improved performance and features I never had before in a phone. It works very well for me, and it has yet to drop a call. In 2 years, I'll see what the iphone 5 looks like, maybe I'll go for it if it's a big enough step up over this phone.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Iphone 4s 16gb", "Author": "hamza malik", "ReviewID": "R2CT7OURTDTJPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Top Phone My tips  The Calendar on the iPhone is a wonderful functional tool to help you get organized.

It's an extra $100, but it means that you can get the phone fixed 2 times for $50 each time, rather than paying the $200 per incident that it will cost without the agreement.2) Purchase a case to protect it.

I was a heavy Blackberry user in the past but as everyone knows that company has gone downhill. At that point, I made a conscious decision to switch phones and I had to decide between Android, Apple, or a Windows based system. I use a Windows laptop at home so I thought I would go with an Android or Windows phone. I tried many Android and Windows phones but did not like the user interface. The Android phones seemed so fragmented in that there was no standard; every phone manufacturer has their own version of customized Android. For me I like things simple. I next tried a Windows phone but that was the slowest phone I had ever used. I'm not sure how Metro will be but hopefully they fix a lot of those issues. I finally tried the iPhone and fell in love with the ease and simplicity of the phone. I really like iOS and how simple it is to operate. I do have to say that I would not have gone with the iPhone if it could not sync with Outlook but luckily Apple built an Outlook plugin which works very well.In terms of the phone itself, the screen is beautiful and the 8 mg pixel camera is great. The phone is quite fast running any type of app and battery life is pretty good. I thought that I would never get used to the touchscreen keyboard rather than the Blackberry physical keyboard but it is actually quite easy when you turn the phone horizontal. The accuracy is still much better on the Blackberry but you get used to the touchscreen pretty quickly!

It has 80% left the next morning.Today I used my Iphone 4S to record some street walks. One recorded file is ~439MB. It ran out of disk space. So I pulled out the BlackBerry to record more. Returning home, I copied several video files off the BlackBerry including one ~450MB to my Free Agent external back up hard drive USB2.0. It went just fine. Then I copied several video files off the Iphone 4S. It hung on the 439MB file for ~2 minutes. Then it gave up without warning. That is, on the USB hard drive, it shows 0 KB. I then carefully inspected all the videos files of similar sizes. There are 6 files set at 0 KB on the destination USB hard drive.In my personal history of copy and pasting, first time a system copies and sets the size to zero as the Iphone did. This never happens even when coping files with a floppy disk. The USB hard drive has about 100GB left.Using password log-in is  not very lucky. My password once started with number 9. When I put in number 9, it often landed on Cancel key. I had to try several times to make it work. I also have to push the OK key several times to make it accept the password.This is a phone my company gave me. I have no plan and intention to buy anything from Apple Store.

Very Fragile Watch out! IOS is not as good as android's Ice Cream Sandwich which is way more refine and way more powerful.  The best features of this phone is a copy of android features but the copied features are not good.  Too Little to Late.  Multitasking (taken from android) still need work.  It is still not true multitasking.  The New notification bar (taken from android) not even close to android, androids notification bar is customization. Siri another rip of google voice command from 4 years ago still needs work.  Icloud another copy of android cloud sync is still in the baby stages.  Apple is copying android, the features copied from android are still in the baby stages as you can tell when you use the phone.
