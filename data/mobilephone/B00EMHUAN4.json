She doesn't even need a smartphone but she can't read the numbers on the basic phones lol. She actually set this up on the phone with me without too much cringing on my end. This proves that this phone is the easiest thing ever to set up. I can report that the sound is clear and she's had it for two weeks without asking me how something works, which folks, is some kind of magic, trust me.I cannot review the apps, as I don't have it and my mom is miles away, however I can tell you the responsiveness could be a bit quicker but it's not slow by any means. Usually if she presses something and it doesn't work immediately, then it must be broken of course, but there wasn't much frustration on her end learning how to use it.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the $", "Author": "Kurt", "ReviewID": "R3Q37IDWC72FFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is it a high end Samsung or iPhone?  No, it doesn't claim to be.  For an \"I need a smart phone, not social status\" it's a nice choice.  It seems durable & responsive enough for basic tasks.  One complaint tends to be battery life.  I've found with this phone - and others - turning off services you're not using goes a long ways to extending battery life.  Not using blue tooth? Turn it off. Same with WiFi & mobile data.  If there's not a connection available, the phone will send out 'mating calls' looking for a nonexistent connection and using quite a bit of power in the process.  Enabling/disabling services takes less than 5 seconds, very simple.  Just remember to re-enable what you need when it's available.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Mischa", "ReviewID": "R14FK3YDFXHO89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone and I love it.

The camera is not on par with some other smart phones, but it's a fraction of the price and I have an actual camera so I don't think that's a deal breaker at all.The battery lasts a long time even with frequent use (I charge it every 2-3 days). Charging doesn't take too long either. And you can download basically the same apps as you get with a more expensive smartphone. It definitely does what it needs to at the price range I'm comfortable with.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great little phone", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R2UU0Z7H1Y8PY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this as a replacement phone for my son to get away from the iphone  and going back to android were back on the android and not looking back at all the iphone had some issues had to get it replaced under warranty 1 time this little phone keeps on rocking and stays up with current events for him and the games on android or a lot more fun then what apple lets you get for free and the price was cheaper on amazon then in the store even with shipping the phone came to my home in 3 days so if you need a back up phone and a good one at that get this one not slow at all just buy it you wont regret it at all", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "first smart phone", "Author": "Richard Carroll", "ReviewID": "R3BSIOYM09A9NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first found the avail phone at an AT&T; store.

Android 4.1 is great.  I have it set up with Google Voice and talkatone for free calls over my wifi.  The camera works ok outdoors, but you should use a real camera for your photos.  I miss it not having a front camera, because you can't use it for video chat. I don't like the ATT call plan.  ATT will not sell you the pay per minute plan on a smart phone.  You have to purchase the $ per month plan, and buy a separate data package.  I can burn through their $5 data package in a couple of days if I don't have Wifi available. The speaker on the phone is excellent, I often use it to play music. It has a place to put a micro SD card.  However, you have to take off the back cover to put in and take out the micro sd card. The phone seems to be built cheaply, the back cover is flimsy.  But it has held up well for me, no problems yet.

It broadcasts so much radiation it burns your ears after just a few minutes.  I often try to type  text messages or enter names in contacts and no keyboard will pop up.  It needs to constantly be reset.  After dialing a number, you have to wait till it starts ringing to put the phone up to your ear; otherwise, it will hang it up.  You often can't hang up a call and have to wait on the other person to hang up because the screen is black... no matter if you shake it move it back and fourth from your head or whatever.  If you power it off to hang up, the mic does not always turn back on so people can't hear you.  The reception is poor even when others with AT&T; have no problems.  The 911 contact is on the home screen and can be dialed on accident when you grab the phone even when the phone is locked.  My 3 year old has dialed 911 many times.

Don't be fooled by those monthly plans that only require a small down payment for the phone.  Over time, you pay big money for the smart phones that everybody wants.  If you get complacent and don't change your plan, you'll pay for it TWICE in 4 years.  People just don't realize what they pay for phones over time with those convenient \"plans\".  I've had my Avail 2 phone for a couple of months now and I'm very satisfied with it.  I don't have a data plan, I don't need it, and 10 cents a minute is a tremendous bargain.  Most of those lovely plans obligate you at 10 cents a minute and you can't roll the minutes over.  Between home and work, I'm around a computer and telephone all day long.  Why pay for internet access while driving home, or at the grocery store?  Why pay for minutes you never use?  Ha!  For those who talk a lot and do need a data package, there is a nice voice and data plan available for $45/mo IF YOU OWN YOUR OWN PHONE.  A Go Phone is the way to own your phone.

Normally all i do on my smartphone is instagram snapchat texting and calling and this phone seems to not be able to handle that, i would suggest no one to buy this phone (especially for teenagers and children, games on it would be horrible).", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had to take it back to the store!

About the only difference appeared to be the Android version and amount of storage, but once I got it home I discovered many problems.  The phone's camera is worse than horrible.  My 5+ year old dumb phone takes better photos/videos.  The wifi kept losing connection every 2-5 minutes when every other wireless device I have was working fine.  It was also painful to use Android on it because it was rather laggy and scrolling/swiping was difficult when randomly items would get selected on you.
