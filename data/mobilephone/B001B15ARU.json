I got my Motorola tracfone stolen a month ago and Tracfone was kind enough to transfer my minutes (over 1000) to a new Tracfone. They didn't have to do this but they did. As far as the phone goes - this Motorola w376 is the best tracfone you can get. It feels solid, it has great battery life, camera, good clearity and unlimited double minutes. The tracfone service is very good. I've never been unable to use my phone and I travel alot and everywhere.

This phone has many features for the just under $30 price and I highly recommend it.  In addition to the description, the camera has a 4X telephoto lens and produces acceptable pictures.  The \"phonebook\" holds 500 entries and talk time is closer to 8 hours.  To access the owners manual, go to TracFone.com and select this model.  From there you may download and print the Motorola manual.This is my second cell phone from TracFone and have never experienced a problem with reception or customer service.  Their coverage is as good as the \"big\" networks without the need of a more expensive contract.  Now, this phone comes with double minutes for the life of the phone.  For a modern looking phone with lots of extras, this is a very good buy.

Got on the Value Plan at TracFone after purchasing this phone-with the DMFL of this phone, that gives me 100 minutes a month (minutes rollover every month) and an automatic renewal every 30 days (don't have the hassle of keeping your plan from expiring) for only $9.99/month-can't beat that for price? If I need more minutes, I can still buy airtime cards etc.Now for the BIG caveat-they've crippled the Bluetooth/USB function on this phone! I see a lot of folks wondering how to get pictures etc off this phone-since the USB/Bluetooth file transfer function has been crippled, you have to e-mail pictures to yourself at a cost per minute!From research I knew of this, but figured I'd never use the Bluetooth except for earpiece hookups etc, so my preference of the W376g keyboard over the LG600G TracFone determined my choice. When I connected via Bluetooth to my Sony NV-U94T GPS, the phone function works fine (can make/receive calls hands free from the GPS), but when the GPS offers to receive transfer of my phonebook from my W376g, no go-I've hit one of the crippled Bluetooth functions!PROSCheapest plan I've found for emergency/light useSeems to be a quality unitLike the entire keyboard lighting up at nightExcellent sound qualityFM radio (works/reception great) with RDSCONS (and this is a biggie)Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions crippled!Web browswer key easy to accidentally hit (while scrolling). If you do so, 1/2 minute air time gone!If phone choice makes little difference to you, and you really hate the Bluetooth/USB file transfer function being crippled, you might opt for TracFone's LG600G. Far as I can tell, it's darn near equivalent to the W376g (no FM radio) but apparently they've not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions.Rated 3 stars-if they had not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfers, I'd up it to 4 or 5 stars.EDIT: Just got OEM Motorola Stereo Handsfree Headset # CHYN4516B / #HS120 for Motorola Q/ MPX220/ A630/ V710/ E815/ E816/ V365/ V361/ V360/ V325i/ V323i/ V235/ ROKR E1 Cell Phones (from SF Planet) and am really impressed with the FM radio.

I use my phone to talk and text daily but it is still functioning like new and just shows a bit of wear on the outside. I spend a lot of time in rural Vermont but I still get excellent coverage; on a recent camping trip in Southern VT I was the only one of my friends to get cell phone service. The phone itself is very durable and has endured everything from drops and falls to subzero weather. The camera is a nice bonus although it is impossible to transfer a picture to a computer unless you send the picture to another phone. The internet service, while primitive, comes in handy if you need to know the weather and don't have access to television, radio, or computer.

I know people who pay $150+ each month for cell phone service! That's just crazy to me! The phone works perfectly for its purpose of placing and receiving calls. Don't expect a great camera or any fabulous toys on this unit; it is a PHONE! I have never had a call dropped or lost service and I live in a somewhat rural area. The only thing I miss from my last phone is the voice-dialing. This unit doesn't have it and I used it a lot on my last phone. The built-in FM tuner is really cool and even includes RDS, but you have to have a headset plugged in for it to work. I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but plan to soon. The phone and service are so good that me, my wife, my mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and niece all have this same phone!

In just two months, the phone has paid for itself: I paid ~$33 for the phone (and double minutes for life) and $21 for 120 minutes (60 min + double minutes).  With Verizon, I would have paid about $70 for these two months.About the phone: the phone itself is very simple: it doesn't have many whistles, but it does its job just fine: making calls.  The only part I didn't like was the fact that I had to type in all the entries in my phone book since Tracfone disables the communications with a computer.  Some people didn't like the fact that you can't transfer pictures taken with the phone to a computer for free, but you have to send them to yourself as an email, using airtime minutes.The bottom line is that this is a very nice phone if you don't need any fancy stuff.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone and great value!", "Author": "T.Carr", "ReviewID": "R91ZJXZN4E1BR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one great phone! I got mine via TracFone's site. For under $30 and double minutes for life, you can't go wrong. I even am able to browse the web and email photos, including to twitpic for twitter! I got a 1 yr. card and then I called TracFone and they transferred my minutes and remaining time from my old TracFone to the new one and deactivated the old one. Easy and great customer service. And it works with a Jabber Bluetooth headset I bought at a local Walgreens! Three caveats though are no voice activated dialing and they disabled the USB port so you can't connect to a PC. The USB port is for charging the battery only. The third thing is that they don't allow short-code SMS. So you can't use it with things like Twitter (unless you email a photo via twitpic).

Like what most expect the Motorola is a good phone and with this one you can access the web and text friends as well though as said by an earlier reviewer you get charged minutes off your airtime total when you do this,  but when I purchased this model Tracfone had put an added bonus with it double minutes meaning as most would expect you pay for 60 minutes and 120 minutes is added to your airtime.  Now the real question for a buyer is probably going to have to be are you using the cellphone for just calls and some texting or the added bonuses of listening to music watching videos and such an such(Though you can download some news and sports information with it costing you airtime minutes),  now you can listen to music on this phone and download some wall papers or new ring tones if you wish but sadly there's no video streaming on this model but for myself I have no problem with that since I feel that if you're going to watch a video than see t.v. or if you're going to listen to music get an mp3 player or Ipod.  So for anyone who's ever been in a situation regretting not having a cellphone here's a great one to check out but for the younger generation or those who wish to have the newest fad on cellphones than you probably want to try something else.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "Matt Pal", "ReviewID": "R3E1S00UKMCX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent value for your money.

But this time after purchasing a TracFone from Amazon the difficult issue with TracFone really went beyond difficulty.  After receiving the TracFone from Amazon, I went on line to activate the phone and after entering all the necessary information suchas phone model, serial number, SIM Card Number, name and address, e-mail and phone number, I was directed to an automated phone number because the SIM Card Number was in error.  After entering all the same information again, I was again directed to call the 800 number for Technical Support.  I spoke with someone that I had a very hard time understanding what they were saying, plus they must have been in one large room with other people dealing with other people's issues like myself, as the voices in the background were very distracting.  After going through the same routine as before, I gave them the same information again.  I was told the SIM Card Number was no good and they would send me a new one in seven to ten days.  I received the new SIM Card Number and installed it according to the directions.  The phone would still no work.  I went through the same routine as I previously described.  I was told that the second SIM Card Number was bad and they would send another new card in seven to ten days.  After 14 days, I still had not received a new SIM Card, so I called TracFone again.  They said they didn't send a new card because of an error in their computer.  I was then connected with a supervisor, who was not sure as to what was causing the problem with the SIM Cards and was not sure as to what the next step would be, but she would have someone call within 24-48 hours.  No one ever called, so I felt that after spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone with three people, I was not going to call them again, so I finally had enough and decided to return the phone to Amazon for credit.

Vancil \"thevancils\"", "ReviewID": "R1QZIDIGSBLKS0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone last December.  I have since discovered that this is a reconditioned phone and have had some problems.  The speakerphone is extremely garbled and to hard to hear even when it is mere inches from your ear and the volume is maxed out.  Sometimes I miss calls even thought THE RINGER IS ON and the phone is close by. (It will chirp when it goes to voicemail, but at random times it will not ring when I receive a call.)  This is my third tracfone, and I had very good past experiences with their customer support in the past, however regarding this phone I only received a \"helpful\" email to remind me to \"make sure the ringer is indeed on\" and let them know if the problem continues.  And to top things off, the power on/off button only works when it wants to.  I have to be quite careful to never let the battery get to low because if it powers off, it will sometimes take up to 8 or 9 tries of holding the button down for a minimum of 40 seconds to get the phone back on.If the features (and all the buttons)on this phone were fully functional, I would not hesitate to give this phone a 5 star rating.

Coverage in my area of the country is limited, thus cell phones aren't all they are cracked up to be. This motorola W376 seems to work ok. Needless to say I don't use the internet feature. The double minutes are a boone. Not being able to easily download pictures to my desktop computer is a disappointment. (A search for a workaround on the internet was fruitless.) So the long and short of it, I bought it for the convenience of the occasional call I needed to make that the shortage of phone booths are not helping. It has clear reception. I would probably buy another one if this one broke. Battery life can be improved if you don't leave it on all the time (it likes to search for a signal all the time... power drain alot of places I go.)

Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R29PTHFJH6WU82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The W376 is an excellent low cost phone for those who do not literally LIVE on cell phones (yes, those people still exist), but who want a reliable device that does the very basic thing a cell phone should do - make calls.Let's not compare this phone to major carrier contract phones - you can't.  This phone and most all others from Tracfone, Net10, Straight Talk (etc) are built to a price and sold for cheap prices.  In this case, $20.00.  You can't compare their build quality and features to phones that cost $150 to $300 from the carriers.  But they are surprisingly good for the cheap prices they're sold for.  I will refrain from the controversy of radiation these things may shoot off though.  There's a lot of debate as to how dangerous excessive use can be with these, and let's face it, the W376 and those like it are all cheap plastic - most likely cranking out enough stuff to boil an egg given enough time.  If you like to use cells for hours on end - get something with better shielding \"just in case\".  That being said, for what I use this for (very light use), I don't consider it a concern.Call quality and the ear speaker are very good.  I live 25 miles outside of Atlanta not near an Interstate Highway, and I get 3-5 bars at all points within my house.  Sound is clear.  Battery life is good.  There is a lag between pushing the keys and hearing the confirmation \"beep\" and seeing the digits/texts appearing on the screen though, so this takes some getting used to (again, cheap phone).  The camera - let's be honest, it stinks.  A very low 640 x 480 pixel resolution is the max size, and even at \"fine\" quality the photos are horrible, resembling a watercolor painting more than a photograph (think of cell phones of 8 years ago for reference).  So if the camera is important - look elsewhere.Keywords here - \"for the price\", the W376 is an excellent phone.  If I were comparing it to a smart phone or touch screen phone from the carriers I'd give it 2 stars, but we're again talking about a cheap phone with cheap call prices, so for this price, it's highly rated by me.  Get the double minutes for life, use the coupon codes included in the package, and for lighter users, this could be a perfect solution to give yourself cell service while at the same time giving the financial finger to the big greedy carriers who charge way too much in fees.Now, with all of this being said, I HAVE to add, that the Tracfone/Net10 customer service is among the WORST I've ever experienced. You will on 100% of your calls be dealing with reps in India.  Reps who speak little English, and those who do, do so poorly and with heavy accents.  Many are under-trained and reading from scripts, and will give you inconstant information.  If you are switching or \"porting\" a phone number from an old phone of theirs or another phone via a different service, expect a long call with a series of codes and number to be given to the rep, then what can amount to an extremely long wait for it to be transferred, if, it works at all (prompting another call to try to get it fixed, etc etc etc).  If there is one thing that is almost worth the high price of contract carriers (AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile), it's that the customer service for them as much as we complain, is actually WORLDS better than from Tracfone/Net10.  So to sum up, these phones are great for certain uses as very basic and sometimes very reliable phones.  But if customer service is as important to you as the phone service price, avoid this service.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Service and Family Plan is a scam", "Author": "Dylan Alliata \"BookMafia\"", "ReviewID": "R3DF0L4HYG4KED", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's an okay phone nothing special in opinion but beware of their family plan.

Clem", "ReviewID": "R2C9T9LQ06BW3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I previously owned a TracFone and Net10 Phone and never experienced any problems.  However, the purchase, porting, and activation of my Motorola W376 TracFone has been the worst customer service experience that I've ever had in my life.I began the activation process on the internet in early February 2009 by requesting that my old Boost Mobile cell phone number be ported to my new cell phone.  Initially I provided only my old number as I didn't have an account number.  I was contacted by TracFone and they requested that I contact Boost Mobile and obtain my account number.  I obtained my account number and advised TracFone customer service.  I then receive another phone call indicating that I needed to provide a Pin Number. So I provide that information as well.  I then receive repeated phone calls claiming that the information I provided was not correct.  Eventually, a three way phone call between TracFone, Boost Mobile, and myself was arranged.  Boost Mobile confirmed that the information that I provided was correct.  So again I wait, assuming that the problem was resolved.  Then in late February I receive a letter indicating that the porting of my number was \"delayed due to incomplete or inaccurate information\" and was advised to contact another number for assistance.  At this number I was advised that my SIM card wouldn't port, and that I would be sent another SIM card through the mail.In early March I thought finally my problems would be over.  I received and installed the SIM card and called back as requested.  The phone was finally activated and I indicated that I would add additional minutes online.  After all the delays, I had forgotten that my phone came with double minutes for life and ordered the 800 minutes with double minutes for life at the price of $139.99.  To my surprise the minutes were not added to the phone and I again had to call customer service.  The lady on the phone was nice enough to inform me that I made a mistake in my order, but to my surprise was unwilling to correct it.  I complained but it was obvious that I was getting nowhere.  The minutes I ordered were added to the phone.  I decided I would call back and would insist that the second double minutes for life be removed.  I figured this would result in a $40.00 refund to my credit card as 400 minutes (doubled to 800 minutes) costs $99.99.  I called back and again got nowhere with customer service.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who was apologetic but indicated that there was nothing she could do.  She indicated, however, that she would refer me to a higher level and that someone would get back to me.  Well I waited over a week for a response and received none, so instead of calling again and getting the run around, I decided to send an e-mail.  By e-mail I was provided a number to call for credit card adjustments.  I thought I was finally making progress, however when I called I was again advised that nothing could be done.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was informed pretty bluntly that it was my mistake and there was nothing they could do about it.I subsequently wrote a letter to the Tracfone Resolution Department. In response I received a phone call offering me 30 additional minutes of airtime.  I turned it down as it does not adequately compensate me for my time, trouble, and expense.

It isn't too bad, but not that good either, and inputting the text takes forever.The main problem, though, is that when you try to send pictures, it only works a portion of the time, most of the time making you have to resend it. Not reliable at all. And not only are you charged a minute for sending a picture, you're charged for how long it takes to send. And then again if you're resending it. And even if it does send, it's glacially slow.I've never had a problem calling someone, that's the one thing that's consistent.

After a couple years carrying around a thick black LG I decided I wanted something smaller and more sleek. That was a couple years back, when this Motorola wasn't so dated. I happened to take a trip through the state of Missouri, traveling from the southwest corner to the northeast corner in a van, when I had both phones on me. There were several times when this Motorola could not get a signal but the cheap little LG was getting two bars! After a couple times trying in vain to make calls or send texts with this phone, I went back to using the old, thick, black plastic LF flip phone.Oh, and the buttons are all flush which makes it virtually impossible to text without looking carefully at your fingers and the screen to make sure you are pushing the button you think you are pushing.

Great basic phone, it would hold a charge for 10 days or more. I thought I was upgrading when I got the Motorola W376, with double minutes, etc. This thing has never held a charge for more than 72 hrs. (standby, no calls). If you don't have the Motorola charger it won't charge at all, even though it has a USB port. There is an XP driver for it, but it must be installed on the computer you are charging from. The data transfer (pictures) is also disabled over USB, so any pictures youi take with the thing MUST be sent as data files, quite expensive. The headphone jack isn't the standard 3.5mm, so you can't just plug standard headphones in and enjoy.

From the start, we had trouble with tracfone service.  I purchased minutes online twice, and both times was given a code that was invalid.  Finally I called tracfone to get it fixed. After several hours on the phone in several different sessions, I finally got a valid code -- however, I was still charged for the first two purchases of minutes which, due to the invalid codes, I was never able to download or use.  After calling again and spending agonizing time on the phone with multiple service reps, tracfone finally agreed to refund my money for the minutes I had purchased but not received.  Thank goodness.  Unfortunately, they only refunded the money for the first purchase, and never refunded my money for the second purchase.  They said they would, but I never received the credit and when I called about it again, they couldn't find any records.  At this point I had already decided, \"enough of tracfone!\" -- when the minutes are gone, we're getting a different phone.  Then last week my daughter's phone was stolen at school.  I called tracfone to deactivate the phone and transfer the minutes, but whoever stole the phone had already used the minutes, and tracfone refused to give us credit for them. They certainly were not obligated to give us credit for those minutes, but I know they sometimes do it as a courtesy.  For whatever reason, they chose not to.

I am 20 yrs old and most kids at my college carry iphones. I would LOVE one, but I simply cannot afford food, rent, tuition, books, school supplies, and a phone plan! This tracfone did a good job while it lasted.I have owned it for around 1 & 1/2 yrs, and just recently it really started falling apart. The charger slowly needed me to adjust the wiring for it to work, as the battery also began holding less of a charge. Anyway, yesterday the charger completely broke, and even after using the school Mac (I have an AWFUL HP laptop -- check out my review on it if you want to see a pathetic situation noting I can't afford a replacement) for two hours just to charge my phone...I kept my phone off afterward -- it had FOUR bars. I turned it on just now to see if I received any missed calls and I only have ONE bar. >:( I have an important phone call coming in tomorrow morning >:(Anyway, the phone worked pretty well so here are the CONS (Pros being that it is a cellphone -- nothing special although I appreciate the \"mirror\" on the front):*sometimes I would not receive calls/txts*many times I would receive things such as four new voice mail messages, only to find out they were from a couple weeks ago AND all four messages were copies of each other.*difficult to take photos of yourself*runs out of battery too quickly -- after a few months the battery needed frequent charging, even though I hardly ever used the phone (ex. maybe one text every day)*Easy to accidentally hit the web (aka TRACFONE [don't expect actual internet]) browser and lose minutes.The above are my only real complaints. Overall, I liked this phone for the time I had it.This is a TRACFONE which is aimed at the poor, elderly, non-tech saavy, and people who either don't use cellphones much, but want one or...criminals.Unfortunately I am a young girl using Tracfone, but if you are a young guy and stuck with one of Tracfone's behind-the-times phones, then my advice to you in looking cool and getting chicks is:Dress like a pimp, act like a pimp, and girls will think you are using tracfone \"cuz u so gangsta and cool dealin them drugs for the thousandsa benjamins.\" You can even use a computer program to text yourself suspicious messages so you have proof of ur pimpin-lifestyle, and we ALL KNOW that most girls like bad boys!Anyways, I just ordered the newer tracfone, so Im pretty stoked.PS: The Tracfone company is AWESOME! i wish they offered fancier phones though, but ah well -- they are a great price and work! :)", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Death Hath No Mercy", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2NPDFKH5MQVU3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Whoever created this cell deserves to have his/her back shaved with cheese grater for countless hours.
