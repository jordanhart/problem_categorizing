I thought it would have some minor scratches or scuffs, but I can't see anything on it.  It's pretty much perfect.  I bought this phone to set it up with straight talk and it works great.  Very easy to set up.  The only problems I have with the phone is that there is some minor glitches while operating sometimes the phone would go into dock mode, and the only way to get out of it was to turn it off and back on.  However it was really easy to disable the dock mode through the settings and I haven't had any more problems with it doing that.  Also when i place a call the phone automatically goes into speaker mode, but i don't mind easy enough to just hit the button and turn that off as well.  Another problem is when turning it off the phone always comes back on, on the car mode dash screen another easy fix just turn that off.  I looked these problems on the internet and it seems to be common with the phone.  But like I said they are easy to get around these bugs.  Overall the phone works awesomely and I couldn't be happier buying a used phone with this company.
