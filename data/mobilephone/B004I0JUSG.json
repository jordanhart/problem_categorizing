{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A few issues - works fine - summary of research and usage", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R2D7M6OL5I40YI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off - I bought this phone as a \"temporary\" replacement for an AT&T; phone.  I did some initial research, took the plunge and bought it.  I went into this knowing that it is an unlocked T-Mobile phone being run on the AT&T; network.  As forewarned some features may not be supported.  I have three issues that I can live with for the short term until I can get a decent contract phone (like the Motorola Atrix) without paying full retail.1st issue:  Sending/Receiving embedded pics via text messaging does not work2nd issue:  Does not recognize the AT&T; 3G service (if someone out there does have it showing the AT&T; 3G - please let me know).3rd issue:  Processor is underpowered.More research and drudging through the Android forums - I found that someone else acknowledged the lack of supporting the AT&T; 3G service.  If you can update to Android 1.6 (I have not yet and won't till I have my contract replacement phone and will risk doing the update then), that seems to improve performance - at least in some of the reviews I have read.  Unless you are running this over a T-Mobile network - you will not be able to do an over-the-air update.  The 1.6 update is available at:  [...]  There seems to be two updates you have to apply.  Once I do this (probably in a few months - I will update here).I do like the phone.  It is nicely sized, has a good feature-set.  The camera and video quality is pretty decent with a good set of controls.  The call quality is excellent as is playing music out of it.  I do use it as an alarm clock - though be forwarned.  For some reason - the alarm clock version that comes with the phone does not allow you to add music from your mp3 collection to wake up to.  But the Timer app does.  Go figure.BATTERY ISSUE1 other issue that I am NOT down rating the phone for.  I bought this phone back at the beginning of June.  Battery life was as advertised - but this week has rapidly declined in performance daily.  Today as example - started off the day with a fully charged phone - only sent/received 3 text messages.  I am assuming this is a product that sat on the shelf for a long period of time.  It is under warranty with the seller (BluetekUSA).  I have sent this issue to them and am hoping to resolve this shortly.Hope this helps.  Good phone.  If you are buying to run on the T-Mobile network - by all means go for it.  If you are a novice user and don't want to mess with updates - see if your reseller in this marketplace will do the 1.6 update for you.  Doesn't hurt to ask!Robert", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R30EOWF2XNXXKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these phones for family in Brazil.I have an iPhone and was quite impressed with this phone.The camera is just like a real digital camera with all the options (e.g. face recognition, portrait mode, flash, etc).

The unit itself has a limited Android as it is 1.5 and needs a upgrade.  The phone itself is nice enough as it does not have a option of downloading Apps as only you can get those compatible for this phone unless your on the Android Market to get them.  My brother has a Lg phone and his phone has alot more options than this phone.  The call quality however is good and the web has 3g speed which is ok.  If I known this I would have spent a little more for those type options with a better Android version but I will keep this one for now as I am not totally happy with this unit.  The 5.0 mp phone is really nice and that is the best feature of the phone.  I have a couple of Samsung Products is the reason I bought the phone but wish it was not so limited and Android Market oriented as I would have like to have the capability of downloading apps to the phone from the computer.If your new too Androids its ok", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "my review for Samsung Behold", "Author": "ZM", "ReviewID": "R33SBGVSVLYC4C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was sold with an old battery, I charge it and after talking for a little bit overhalf  hour and I need to charge it again.

Fontana", "ReviewID": "R36S9BUUIE9480", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had mine for about three months now.  I wanted to use it to give Android and t-mobile's no-contract service a test drive after being an AT&T; customer for many years.  This phone is a predecessor to the current Samsung Galaxy line of phones that are selling like hotcakes.  It is the very first SGT series phone to feature the Android OS, but it is an older (1.6) customized version produced in early 2009.  While that may not seem old, in the phone and electronic world, it is relatively ancient.  Because of this, you are going to see features and functions that are complicated to use.  While you have a touch screen, there are many functions which must be done with functional buttons, and there's half a dozen on this unit.  For example, you can't expand a picture or webpage by pinching the screen - you'll have to use the \"mouse\" button in the center of the phone.  Because of all the buttons on the phone, it is quite easy to hang up or place a call on hold while in conversation, or perform a myriad of undesirable functions when trying to navigate to an application or task.  Even though there's smartphone elements to this device, it is rather clumsy to use them compared to current Android technology.  Then there's the proximaty functionality in this phone - because of it's quirky, sensitive touch-screen, you can often cause a screen or app to turn on/off against your will.  This is probably a bug, because Samsung suggests resolving it with a case (which can be had quite cheaply - as little as a dollar), but it took me weeks to figure this out.Finally, the version of Android on this phone was customized (euthanized might be a better term) by Samsung in an attempt to differentiate if from the competition.  So while you get an excellent camera function, you get a quirky and useless \"cube\" application, several other games and marketing apps which are useles sand can't be removed, a browser which is rather slow, and a 3G bandwidth that seldom seems to pick up a 3g signal.  Luckily 2g is just fine in my area.All in all, you can get this phone for about 1/3 the price of a newer model with more useful bug-free features, so I'd suppose you're about getting what you pay for.  There are many blogs on the internet about \"rooting\" this phone and loading a non-custom version of the older Android OS on it.  While they address many of these issues, they cause many more, and most of this work was done a couple of years ago, so support for it is pretty much dead.My suggestion is to keep shopping until you find an unlocked GSM phone in this price range with at least an Android release level of 2.0 or more, and very little custom software plus at least 1g of memory to handle today's demanding apps.  Keep in mind that future apps will demand even more, and probably won't be available for the one that you pick!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good service", "Author": "Ecuadorian", "ReviewID": "R3F2VFMHL4PUUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bougth this cell phone like 3 weeks ago, and i just got it, but you have to know that I live in Ecuador, so I had to buy it and wait for the time of delivering.
