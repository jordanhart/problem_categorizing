VZ has a nice selection of 4g LTE phones and this is the best one available in my opinion.

No phone is perfect but I don't have many complaints with this one.  The OS is fast and responsive and screen works great with swype.  Camera is very good too.

It lasted up until last week of July.  I am under warranty, so I got a replacement phone at no extra charge.  That is the good part.  The bad part is that phone lasted 3 days before the phone had an error that would not let the phone turn on.  So, I ended up getting a replacement for that (still the same model phone) and that lasted a total of 6 days.  The next phone lasted a grand total of 5 days.  All the same model phone.  All with the same hardware malfunction.  The upside- I'm getting a Droid 4 by Motorola.  I don't like to badmouth companies, but that Droid Charge is garbage.  The Droid Company in itself is great.  That phone is their one and only failed experiment.  Droid and Android are still good phones.  Just one bad phone.  Do not judge the company off of the failures of their one flop of a product.  I highly recommend a Droid 4 or a Razr of some kind.  Do NOT get a Charge.

And the only way to fix it is to do a factory reset deleting everything which so painful. Also since the phone is old, some apps will not work or can be downloaded and god forbid you get a 3d game. it will lag to the point where you have to remove the battery or wait for it to reset itself.
