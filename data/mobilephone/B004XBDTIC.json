Got the white version (seller actually shipped black by mistake which we returned, black with green is horrible looking).My wife is not very tech savvy and needed a good looking small phone with touchscreen. All she wanted is a new generation good looking basic phone.Pros: 1) Very Good looking in white color2) Small size - easy to keep in pocket3) It actually works good as a phone4) Biggest advantage is that it has Android OS5) Web-browsing is great. Sometimes, I play youtube videos on it connecting it to wi-fi at home. Screen is sharp and speakers are great.6) Camera is average, videos recording it very good (resolution is not very high but in small size, its quite clean).Cons: Battery life could have been great.We purchased it more than 6 months back. Its all plastic but build quality is good. We have a small baby who mishandles this phone often but there are no issues yet mechanically or cosmetically.If you wish to have a small sized and sleek phone with touch screen, wifi connection to internet, android OS, average camera, you will not go wrong with it. If you want a phone with much higher capabilities, look somewhere else.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "arrive safe and as described", "Author": "Rhamadinna", "ReviewID": "R3VG14TQGAKI5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love this phone! very good for android beginner user like me. item is in good condition and works very well! it's british product. and i like the fact that this phone doesn't has emblem like at&t;, verizon or other carrier like some other unlocked phones that i see and that my friend bought. only samsung brand on the phone. love it! the only flaw is the adapter for US plug isn't working. so, i must use my own adapter. next time please check the adapter first. other than that everything is great including the headset.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Carol_Vzla", "ReviewID": "R2TWRDY9IXM1PV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. quality, comfort and good designall for a low price.

Then I called again, describing the problem. However, he did not firstly answer my question, but told me that I have accent and asked where I am from. It was quite insulting! For the whole process, he was impatient. And finally when the conversation was almost done and he said he would send me another charger. I heard he murmured from another side:\"holly\".  I have called so many customer service so far, and this was my first experience to meet such an unprofessional and impatient one. If you care more about people's accent, then you do not do customer service.However, I have called the manager today. His attitude is sincere and he has apologized.
