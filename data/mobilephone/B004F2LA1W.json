This is a review of the overall experience and not just of the phone.1. Seller: Excellant. Ordered the phone a thurday, and phone reached on Saturday (all the way to west coast from NY). That was prety impressive.2. Using phone with ATT. I had a prepaid ATT connection, and my exisintg SIM which worked on a feature phone wasn't detected by the new phone. (The sim had a gophone label on it). Initially, I thought this was because of a hardware problem in the LG optimus, and got in touch with the customer service at Hasslefree who confirmed that the phone was indeed unlocked. Meanwhile, at work, I tried one of my friend's SIM card, and it was detected by the phone. Long story short, I went to an ATT store, and get a new prepaid SIM, which was detected.Since I was keen on not using a data plan, I was able to turn off ATT's data connection on the phone, and so far, the phone hasn't sent out any data packets on the wire through ATT network (saving me money).Meanwhile, the phone was setup to use the WIFI at home and work, and data transfers over WIFI work seemlessly. Main usage - browsing and outlook sync.3. Voice quality: It works. Nothing great or nothing terribly bad about it.4. Package: Everything in the box was in sealed plastic covers except for the headphones which was in a tiny zip lock bag. One of the in-ear buds looked used as well. I'm not sure whom to blame for this. Anyways, there were additional ear buds of smaller size which fits my ear, I chose to ignore this issue.5. Phone Restarts while plugging in the head-phone / car audio connector. This by far has been my major issue with the phone. I'd planned to use my phone as a proper Mp3 player to take along while running, but this defect has terribly hindered the plan. The issue happens randomly, and my guess is that something is getting shorted  when the audio jack is inserted in the device causing it to restart.6. OS:  Coming from a feature phone background, it took a little while to get used to a new smartphone OS. Changing to speaker phone was a direct option in the screen in my old phone, but in Win Phone 7 OS, It needs two clicks (since the menu is hidden by default). It took some time as well to figure this out, since this menu is visible only when a call is on (expected), but the focus while calling is to talk, and not to figure out the phone controls. ==> New V1 OS, so not everything is intuitive.Summary:I got what I paid for ( 275$  for a smartphone is not too bad ). However, I doubt whether the phone will last 3 years. (My old LG feature phone is still working well even after 3 years of rough use, being dropped many times etc).I like the fact that I can check my office exchange E-mails via outlook (when I'm at home), This is something which works well all the time. Calender and mails were the main reasons I got a smartphone, and these two works reliably.Battery Life: I still haven't able to judge how long the battery last, sometimes a day, sometimes 3 days, and the usage patters were pretty similar all the time. This is something which I need to figure out.Responsive UI. The reason why I didn't pick an unlocked Nokia was this. The phone has decent procesor and built memory (both RAM and disk space) So, its very responsive while switching from one application to other.Other Hardware: Flaky. Connecting ear phone is the worst thing you can do to this phone. Volume automatically goes down to 0, phone restarts, etc happen in my phone when the ear phone is plugged in.WIFI: good. Even though either the OS or firmware has a weirdness when it connects to wifi. It refuses to connect to the wireless router if the internet connection is unavailable, and gives an unhelpful error code saying password is incorrect. All the other wireless devices connect just fine, yes, we're unable to browse, which is expected, but this phone does something beyond just connecting to router.I've never used a Iphone or android, so I cant compare this with the other phones in the league.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best WP7 phone", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3CLA2O7WNCEAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time looking at the different WP7 phones out there before taking the jump, and I'm really happy that I chose this one. The phone has a solid, sleek build about it that makes it stand out from the other wp7 phones -- in particular the other phone that had caught my attention was the Samsung Focus, but it had a cheap, plasticky feel that made me lean towards the Optimus 7. I think the 3.8\" screen is just the right size and it feels very good in the hand. The screen is NOT AMOLED, but on putting this phone side-by-side with the Focus I actually preferred the colours on the Optimus 7, with the one downside being that the black on the Focus was darker.I was very impressed by the WP7 UI which is very sleek and very user-friendly, and is a step above the iOS and Android at least in terms of look and feel. There are some downsides: it's somewhat difficult to search the marketplace for specific apps directly on the phone (I prefer to do that on the Zune on the PC; the NoDo update later this month is supposed to fix this), and there are fewer apps out there than for the other two platforms. An omission was that from the settings panel the phone's MAC address wasn't listed and I had to do a web search to uncover a hidden engineering panel from which this could be retrieved (so that I could put the phone on my university wifi).Also LG gives users 60-days of free app downloads from the LG store and they do have some good apps, so that was definitely a bonus. The camera itself was solid but there's not particularly many settings and it's a bit grainy indoors.This LG phone was very nice for me and I recommend it to others.

The 2 phones have changed 4 hands in the last one and a half years, so I am speaking for all the users.I would give it 3 stars - cutting one for the poor quality screen that broke on a single drop and one for crappy Windows 7 software.* Overall - great phone for the price, screen is quite smooth and responsive, the hardware is reasonably sturdy and looks impressive unlike some cheap phones out there with tacky plastic. The camera is quite decent. A friend tells me the Windows 7 app store is very comprehensive, so he doesn't miss anything with this phone.* Software - Windows 7 for phones has a ton of issues. You can't delete contacts in groups/bulk, so if you sync your device often, you end up with a terribly bloated contacts book and the only way to delete contacts is ONE BY ONE. Several other such small but annoying software issues- though over the last year, the updates sent out by Microsoft have made it slightly better to use. Don't even get me started about the stupid idea of needing Zune installed on every PC that you need to sync the phone with. :(* TMobile issues- as another user pointed out, multimedia messages don't work with TMobile on this. The folks at the local store I went to didn't seem to recognize this model at all.* Works with regular simcards - these phones were used for the large part in India/USA and they work well with all SIM cards in India.* Screen - The screen on one of the phones smashed after a friend dropped it once.

I have had several windows based PDAs and Phones and I was more than happy with them but this new one...Well.....  At the moment I have identified the following in just a week of use:1. As boxed it has not cut, copy and paste functions!!!!! Can you believe it? The good news is once you update the software you can have copy and paste (but not cut)2. If you want to pass a document (Power point, Excel, Word or just text)  from your phone to your pc or back you must have a online connection and use either an e mail, a SharePoint or use his service named SkyDrive  pass it to the site and then download to your phone!!!.... No direct connection via USB for this propose is possible.3. Music, Photos, Or video can be moved from your PC using Zune software using the USB port putting the files in specific folders4. You just can copy contacts FROM your SIM but not TO the SIM so you cannot come back to a regular phone if you want, not without invest some hours recapturing your contacts manually.5. Talking about contacts you should be online again to copy/sync contacts to or from your phone to an e-mail service like Hot mail (of course) upload your contacts there and then download it from or to your phone.6. The GPS as is just can be used with Bing Maps (one more time online) is not possible use GPS offline since does not has maps stored in the phone, you cannot even have the basic service you can expect from a GPS Coordinates and compass. The good news in his \"market place\" there are several options of GPS decent software that you can buy by something between $15 to $45 dollars.7. You cannot install software to your phone in other way than using his \"market place\" (this is frustrating) of course the idea is to concentrate the selling of software for the OS to Microsoft (good for them, less freedom for you) fortunately the amount of software available is growing.8. The OS at this moment do not have support to SD cards or similar.9. Good news for the LG customers, in the \"Market Place\" there are several interesting an FREE tools you can put to your LG phone, they are tiny but very useful.10. You don't have the freedom of put your custom sounds or music for the ring tone, and some other similar restrictions not critical but nice to have.The bottom-line: The Hardware simply is excellent (just no external memory but for most applications the memory included is enough) , This version of windows phone is very fast and simple but has a lot of restrictions some may be due to a too early release other probably because the commercial strategy that Microsoft has decided to take. I hope future updates can make the operating system a more enjoyable experience and providing more freedom and options to user. If you like to have a expensive, nice, easy to use and vey restricted phone then you must buy a Windows Phone 7, If you like to buy phones to crack them and install new operating systems this telephone is great!. If you are a Windows fan like me keep yourself in that way, be happy look for a Windows Mobile 6 phone there are several excellent in Amazon cheaper than ever or simply wait some time for a better version of Windows phone.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "WORST PHONE EVER", "Author": "giokvara", "ReviewID": "R1I9G2TFPI19KD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi, i purchased this phone and it is piece of crap, it overheats and restarts by itself, doesn't boot properly and screen gets stuck at LG logo, whatever i tried doesn't work it cools downs some time after and works for 5 minutes then shuts down and gets stuck again, I sent them seller two emails about the issue and they dont answer, since I'm not in US I don't know what to do... do NOT buy this phone, 2 weeks of waiting and dissapointment", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Muy buen equipo aunque con algunos detalles mejorables", "Author": "3vils33d", "ReviewID": "R2HMULQFF3154R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El equipo es realmente atractivo y bastante delgado.Buen tama\u00f1o de pantallaAun no se que tanto le dura la bateria puesto que no lo he usado lo suficiente como para decir si es buena.Las personas que compren este equipo deben comprarse unos audifonos pues en lo particular no me gustan nada los que trae.El sistema operativo por otra parte, me ha encantado.
