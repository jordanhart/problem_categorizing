{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It works... Mostly...", "Author": "Michael D.", "ReviewID": "R1KUV3CEPQ821M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using Android phones since Google first released their OS. I have owned over a dozen Android phones and am something of a collector (hey, don't judge we all have hobbies). That being said lets get down to the overview of this little gem of a phone:Overview:In the Box:- Two batteries (for a reason, one of my would not take a charge)+ Two backs, one standard and one flip cover (...is that nagahide!?)+ Snap-on smoky cover/protector for the back.+ Preinstalled screen protector+ Non-specific user manual.+ Earbuds+ USB charger/data cord+ USB to AC plugPros:+ Nice size screen, good for those who have trouble reading and want to blow things up to be visible.+ Android 4.1+ Jelly Bean is always a plus when looking at a device (check out Google for comparisons between versions).+ The phone does not feel cheap when held in the hand.+ Setup was fairly easy on Net10. after the APN settings were all set correctly I was up and running. Net10 directions OK.+ I was very pleased to see 4g active on my phone (I came from verizon, I am easily impressed).+ Good GPSCons:- No Netflix (just sits and grinds on all types of connections).- No Google Movies and TV (not a recognized device).- Slow dialing and input on keypad in phone functions.- Analog TV does not pickup well, or at all (not a feature I would use though).- Camera seems a little lacking (but again I do not reach for my phone for pictures anyway).- Arrived with 2 batteries (and yes, one does not work)Apps I use that work:+ Audible (I must have my audiobooks).+ Google Drive+ Documents to Go+ And Bible+ Amazon (of course)+ Fandango+ Firefox+ Flash Player+ Gmail+ Jewels Star+ Google Maps+ Hi-Q MP3 Recorder+ Next Launcher+ Go Locker+ Play Books+ PF Voicemail++ Play Music+ SuperGNES (yes, only roms of games I own are loaded)+ Temple Run 2+ Google Talk+ Twitter+ USA Today+ ZArchiverIf anyone would like me to test an app on this phone just let me know. (Comment in the Review). I will be adding to this review as I use the phone some. Overall it is OK but it would be a killer if Netflix and Google Movies worked.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Unlocked Phone for the Price", "Author": "C. A.", "ReviewID": "R3SINCPW31UKFB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decent unlocked smartphone that is very similar to the Note.  I've only had it for two days, but I'm impressed at how quick this phone is.  It boots up very quickly, and it's very easy to set up for your carrier (SIM/GSM only).  It runs up to the current HSPA 3g speed (what most carriers call \"4g\" speed).  Call quality is good, GPS works perfectly, and the Google Play store works flawlessly.  I haven't had issues using any apps so far.  The phone has a rather large screen, but despite this it has good battery life for a smartphone.  I get about 8-10 hours straight of regular use (calls, games, texting) before it starts asking me to plug it in.  I ran Antutu Benchmark on the phone and it came in at 6396, which is higher than what is in the description.Pros:1. Running Jelly Bean (4.1.1 Android)2. Decent to good battery life for a smartphone3. 4g capable (3g HSPA)4. Easy to set upCons:1. Camera quality is good (enough), but I don't think it's quite 8 megapixels. Both (front and back) cameras work well for what they are.2. When the phone is plugged in and charging, it can sometimes make the screen overly sensitive while using it.About the seller (Electronics Mart):This seller was wonderful, and was very quick in responding to questions and concerns that I had about this phone.  Usually, they would respond back within an hour of messaging them.  A+++ for this seller.  One of the best I've come across in the Amazon Marketplace to date.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD SMARTPHONE", "Author": "Charles Ukwe", "ReviewID": "R3VSB7AW0UNHUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the fact that I can browse with the phone. It has clear letters. It is better than most phones I have used from other reputed mobile phone manufacturers. However, the manufacturers did not write their name or logo or trademark on the phone. So, it is difficult for people to look at the phone and say it is this or that, for example, other phones have Samsung, Nokia, etc. written on them but none for this one. To buy it, you have to find PAE 8000 (and people ask, what is PAE 8000) in the internet but it is not everybody who wants a smartphone has a computer and internet connection. The product name should be written on the phone.The phone works well. It has a long lasting battery which is very good. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a cheap smartphone that can do almost everything Samsung galaxies and other smartphones can do. One sour point is its poor camera quality. It is very poor snapping a picture in the house or in a poor lighted place. I hope they can improve the camera quality", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "happy", "Author": "Autumn", "ReviewID": "R1IL85FUXRV0DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

The phone arrived earlier than expected. It looks neat and stylish. I inserted my sim card and it worked instantly, It does what it says it does. The phone brings everything you need from screen protector, multiple attachment accessories, batteries, you name it. The phone is HD quality.The only issue so far is the internet. The best so far has been 0.57 download and 1.07 upload. I can't even open a youtube video with this speed. More than likely its an incorrect a.p.n setting by me . I contacted the seller yesterday regarding this situation, so lets see what the outcome is. Beside that the phone tends to get hot.So far the phone is great, my wife downloaded candy crush (it took her over 15 minutes to download the app) and for the time being thats has kept her happy. The phone works perfectly when it comes to incoming and outgoing calls. If the internet situation can be fixed i would give this phone a better rating.Once i get contact from the seller I will keep updating on the product. So far not bad at all, except for the internet issue.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "dropped calls all the time", "Author": "Paul Rawlins", "ReviewID": "R21RV5KEMDC3L0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I sent the phones back for a refund, sames sims card in my other cell phone  - which is a  HTC phone - worked just fine, in these phones I got no connection  or 1 bar...for a second and then the call was dropped", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "cannot activate phone", "Author": "hollywood123", "ReviewID": "R49A5Q6MGO3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am having a lot of trouble activating this phone.

When I take it out, most people instantly say, \"wow you have the latest galaxy\". I usually smile and say no it is just an android phone. The phone works as described and I also did the Antutu benchmark rating and got a higher score than some very high priced name brand phones.Pros- looks decent, feels good in hands, the screen size is excellent for watching videos, accommodates up to 32gb sd, good wifi range.Cons-lack of cases that fit it properly (although it does come with a case), lags sometimes (though not often)-due to the speed of the processor I suppose.Overall though, it is a good buy for the price for someone who wants the latest version of android at a fraction of the cost of the big name branded phones.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would not buy again", "Author": "The Otter", "ReviewID": "R3U5HEZCY13XDL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wife wanted replacement for older LG \"slider\" phone that quit working.  Ordered this phone because it was claimed that it had a 1.2 Ghz processor and would \"Ship from California\" which would get the wife running sooner.  Ordered from the primary listed seller (Kkbox), not an \"other seller\".To be fair: I did get a android device and it was running Jelly Bean.I rated this purchase 2 stars for the following reasons:- Actually shipped from China, taking 2 weeks to arrive - not 3 days by ground from Calif.- What was actually shipped was an older model N8000 running at 1.0 Ghz - 20% slower than what is advertised.- When received, the screen/touchpad would shut down when a call was dialed or answered - preventing use as a phone.  As no manual comes with the phone and there is no tech support, I had to search the internet  to track down the solution to a proximity sensor mis-adjusted from the factory.  Was reacting at 2 feet rather than 1 inch or so.- Unit performs poorly on AT&T; system - often won't connect, constantly drops calls or has garbled sound.  Don't have any problems with LG, Motorola and Samsung phones on same network & same locations.  Does connect at 3G+/HPDSA (H icon) for data.- Wifi range very poor - our other phones, tablets & laptop connect 50-60 ft away from MIMO 450 router thru multiple walls on the 2.4Ghz band. This phone drops to 1 bar or loses connection if not in the same room as the router.- The \"8MP camera\" is not - it is really a 5MP camera- The phone came with a FM radio that got only 2 static filled stations - tried every head phone & earbuds we have (they are the antenna)- won't pull in any stations.- Also chassis space taken up by analog tv tuner & pull-out antenna (useless in all digital tv USA).  The space could have been used for better radios & antennas for phone, data & wifi functions.- Getting a response to issues from the seller takes 2-3 days and their response is If I'm not happy to send it back.  Given that they already misrepresented their shipping and phone model, I'm not going to send it back to China at my expense and hope they actually refund my money.  Will give to friend and get wife a real Samsung.UPDATE:  Got wife a refurbished Samsung Galaxy - was more money, has slightly smaller screen, but performance as a phone on AT&T; is much better.  Wifi connects throughout the house and out on the deck.  \"PAE8000\" relegated to play-tablet for short-range wifi only.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "so so phone", "Author": "rose", "ReviewID": "R1LFDXTZL1P4A6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i have tried both straight talk sims card and a new at&t; sims card both cards are the unlimited it will not send or download pictures data on either card it is hard to talk on and not many people can understand half of what i say if they can hear me at all in my home i am lucky to have two bars i life in the city limits and about a mile from a tower. tomorrow i am going to a at&t; store and see what is up with the sims cards and  the data not working if you want a phone to play games on it is great for that, i put the 32 gb micro card in it and had to put the games on it it ran out of internal memory and turned a lot of stuff off until i transferred all of it to the micro card three games should not have done thisi had high hopes for the phone, which straight talk was not to happy i purchased it they wanted to sell me another sims card for forty dollars at&t; was twenty five and both cards are using and say at&t; on them so beats me as to the difference and straight talk suggested that i buy yet another over priced straight talk phone, i am currently using my old phone to talk and the new one to play games on sad real sad", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "PAE8000 an Okay Phone", "Author": "Jonathan Smith", "ReviewID": "RUIPQ9SBKS0AA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NegativesThe phone takes too long to charge and you have to have both batteries on hand.
