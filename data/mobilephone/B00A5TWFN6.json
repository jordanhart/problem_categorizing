On top of that, this product is not new. It came with small scratches, looks like it was used for demo, or by someone before. It is unbelievable.Beside that, Lumia 920 is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Windowsphone platform. It does not relate to what it does, but how it does.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good device", "Author": "Felipe Melo", "ReviewID": "R258FWE1FZ6ZKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best devices I had.

I thought it WAS FACTORY unlocked.  AT&T; told me they were so very sorry that my phone was actually owned by two previous owners & I had to give them both prior owners information in order to apply to them to unlock the phone.The phone was in a sealed box, all items were in plastic baggies (sealed). The phone had a sticker on the front of it.  BUT it had scratches on the back.  They weren't bad.  I liked the phone enough that I was going to keep it if it worked.  Well... It did not work!  AT&T; said they could not help.  I returned the phone to Amazon.com.  Thank God -- and many blessings to Amazon.com!  I went to TMobile and got a Nokia 925 from them. It is $20 off online right now. With the plan it cost me $480. I had to pay taxes and a small shipping fee. Not a problem.  My payments on my plan and phone will be the same as my old plan ($5 less actually).  I'm happy with TMobile and Amazon... but not the JERKS from Tablet Distributors! Be careful out there people! There was no warranty either, so with 2 other owners, it was a sure bet there was something wrong with the phone. I'll never try something like that again! BUT the nice little case I got from Amazon.com won't work with the 925 either.Phone said I had 10 tries to get the unlock code right or the phone would lock up & become unusable.

The phone's screen is big and seems very sturdy. I really like the tiles concept of the windows phone. The big screen really helps my aging eyes. The phone takes good photos day and night as well. Setting up e-mail is easy.However, there are some cons:1. The camera button is either extremely hard to press or the response time is too slow. I just can't get a handle on whether the picture was actually taken or not. I look later to find that some photos weren't taken because of the inconsistent button.2. The 'Bing' tab on the lower right hand side of the screen seems so sensitive that even the slightest touch, brings up a new Bing screen for searching the net. Just wish this button was for the camera instead (at least I wouldn't miss shots)3. Once your directed to a new internet page, i.e. via  facebook or other applications, you can't get back to that particular application unless you exit and tap the application anew. - i.e. you can't get back to the spot in facebook that launched the internet page.
