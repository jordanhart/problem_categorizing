{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice design/crippling specs", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R15DJR3KTE2JM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tried this phone recently for a period of few days. This is a midrange 4\" 480x800 pixels (Gorilla Glass) phone in a growing and crowded market of smartphones. This is a lower end of lower-end version of the Windows Phone 8X by HTC, but unlocked versions are available for relatively cheap. This is not sold by carriers in USA. Compared to Android, the market of Windows 8 phone is limited. However compared to Lumia 920 and HTC 8X this is a cheaper alternative. Has Qualcomm\u00ae S4 1 GHz, Dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM, 4GB onboard storage, microSD card slot which can take up to 32 GB. Beats' audio is available on several smartphones, but speakers are of decent quality in this phone. Battery capacity 1,700mAh which is not that great. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. One main thing is this has a microUSB port and can be connected to computer for drag and drop of files. This is great! MicrosSIM standard, has standard GPS. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now even on this phone which is way underrated. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year.Overall though this phone is cheaper compared to other phones in an unlocked versions, the 4GB has a crippling effect in all, and may turn out to be an issue in the long run once app space grows. Still giving 4 stars as it cannot be ruled out for a Windows 8 enthusiast.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It didnt work at all", "Author": "Rahma Javed", "ReviewID": "R3VQR7NL6L3XG0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There was a fault in it, didnt work at all, I wasted my time on this, not happy at all.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B89ZIK4"}}
