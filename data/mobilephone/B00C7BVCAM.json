{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Amazing Phone By Sony!", "Author": "Gumpert", "ReviewID": "R20GXHTEVNT010", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. The display is gorgeous, the processor is very fast, the camera is great, and it is waterproof!The Display:The 5 inch display on this phone has a resolution of 1080p. That is the same resolution as your HD tv on a 5 inch screen. This makes for 443 pixels per inch which results in an incredibly sharp picture. You cannot see pixels at all. The display also has Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 which enhances color contrast while watching videos and viewing pictures. This really makes the pictures and videos pop, it makes them incredibly vivid. When the BE2 is not running the display's contrast is not as high, but you don't always need oversaturated colors. The viewing angles are far from stellar but most people will view the screen straight on anyways. Gaming with this screen really is a treat. The display is one of the best around.The Processor:This phone is powered by a quadcore 1.5 ghz Krait S4 chip coupled with 2gbs of ram. This results in incredibly fast performance even when multitaksing. The phone almost never lags. The Krait cores are very quick and are more than adequate, even with a 5 inch full HD display. All the games I have played run well. Browsing the internet is equally as snappy. Pages load quickly and smoothly. Zooming in and out is very quick as well.The quadcore processor in this really flexes its muscles in benchmark tests. I got around 7900 in the quadrant standard, over 2060 on the Geekbench 2, over 20,000 on Antutu, and over 2800 on Passmark Performance. All of these scores are higly impressive and show you what kind of power the device has. The performace does carry over to real world usage.The Cameras:The rear camera is 13.1 megapixels and takes incredible pictures. It has the Exmor RS sensor which adjusts numerous things for you. For the most part the results are stunning. Images come out clear and the colors are very vibrant. Occasionlay you will need to change a few setting around to get a better picture though. For example disabling flash. The camera never fails to impress me. With a camera like this there is no need to carry an actual digital camera around.The front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and can shoot 1080p video. This is very impressive for a front facing camera because most of the current ones are only capable of 720p.The Buttons and Interface:This phone utilizes the on screen android buttons. They are very responsive and don't take up too much space. The side buttons (like the power button and volume rocker) are responsive and easy to press as well. I have no complaints about the buttons.Sony has there own overlay for the Android OS. It is very light and very pleasing to the eyes. It has many great features such as small apps. With small apps you can open a miniature app while running another at the same time, both on the screen. For example, you can open a calculator while on the browser. This feature can be incredibly useful and convenient. I prefer Sony's overlay over Samsung's TouchWiz. My only real complaint when it comes to Sony's overlay is that it lacks a default task manager.The on sceen keyboard is very responsive and auto-correct works well. Turning the phone sideways gives you a lot of room, especially if you have larger hands.The Music Player:A lot of people use their phones as there music players and some phones have horrible audio quality. This phone is not one of those phones. Audio quality is great and there are many different settings that you can adjust to get the best sound. You have five band equalizers and all kinds of different options such as a dynamic normailizer which adjusts the volume differences between songs. Even though the phone has all these options I find myselfy using the \"Clear Audio+\" option. This automatically adjusts the equalizers for each song and the result is great. All the songs sound nice and, well clear with this feature.The music player is very nice to look at, it changes color based on the album artwork which is very neat. You can create playlists on the phone and even edit the music info. If you spelled the name of a song wrong when transfering it, you can fix it right there on the phone. If you are missing album artwork you can get it right on the phone. I am very pleased with the music player on this device.The \"Waterproof featue\":This phone is designed to survive under one meter of water for up to half an hour at a time. While most people will avoid getting their phones wet it is a comforting feature to have. It is also a unique feature for a high end smartphone. It means you won't have to say \"bye\" to your phone if you drop it in the bathtub.The Battery Life:Battery life on the phone is decent. It is nothing great. I get about 1 and a half days of moderate to heavy usage before I have to charge it (with stamina mode enabled). The phone has \"Stamina Mode\" which turns off things while they are not in use. This does help the battery life quite and bit and is a useful feature.Connectivity:This phone is a GSM phone and is capable of HSPA+ 4G. This one is NOT LTE Capable. This is not a factor for me because my provider doesn't offer LTE.The wifi connector on this phone is good. It has a good range and is allows for a quick and strong connection. Of all the devices in my house it is able to get the fastest upload speeds on the exact same connection.Storage:The phone comes with 16gbs of storage but allows expansion via a micro sd card slot. Only about 11.7gbs of the internal storage are available for usage but if you have a micro sd card you can have more than a sufficient amount of storage for your pictures, music, videos, and applications. My only major complaint with the storage is that it doesn't allow the transfer of apps to the SD card. This feature would be very useful.Conclusion:This is an incredible phone and is a great deal. It offers incredible performance and an amazing display. Sony has a great overlay that is innovative and light on the processor. The camera is of stellar quality and the overall build of the phone is as well. It is not a cheap plastic phone. In addition it can survive being submerged in water which is something that no other phone in its class can boast. This is an outstanding phone and I am very satisfied with it!UPDATE (1/2/14):The phone is now running on android 4.3 and the newer OS brought many small improvements with it.Main Changes:-The Music Player is now much louder. It's about as loud as my Ipod Touch now.-The Camera UI has changed slightly. It's now more similar to the one found on the Z1.-You can now download additional theme packs from the Play Store.-The color calibration in the home screens and app screens has changed slightly.-Synthetic Benchmark scores have improved. The phone now scores about 9000 on Quadrant Standard.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "works very well in Venezuela", "Author": "alejandro", "ReviewID": "R18C1PBGKYQW01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from Venezuela and my phone works perfectly with Movistar.

I bought it because it met most of my criteria. It's water proof. I'll take their word for it. I had a bad experience once with a Motorola Razr that was supposed to be waterproof as well but turned out not to be as water proof as they said it was. Moving on, I also wanted a quad core with a decent amount of ram and Sony delivered very well on both. I updated mine to 4.3 as soon as I got it and it's very snappy, no lag at all. I also wanted an SD slot so I could transfer the 32gb card from my old Samsung along with all my data. Plus I wanted an android phone. I have an iPad and really like apple products but I find iTunes to be more trouble than it's worth. I run Windows 8 on my desktop and like Windows but not on my phone. Windows RT has a long way to go before it's ready for prime time. To me, Android is the only viable choice for a smart phone.I also wanted a decent camera with a flash and Sony delivered here as well. It takes pretty decent pictures but it's not perfect. In my opinion the iPhone cameras are more user friendly and take slightly better pictures. The thing with the Sony camera is you have to play with the settings to get nice pictures. It has a superior auto feature that is supposed to take nice pictures without any manual settings but they seem to come out better if you set it up manually. In daylight the pictures are perfect. It's the low light where things get tricky. There's a lot of camera software and options on this phone that you won't find on any other smart phone. If you're willing to play with the different filters and focus options you can get some nice low light pictures with it. I find the single auto focus and backlight correction seem to produce the best low light pictures. For me it doesn't quite replace my pocket camera and definitely not our SLR camera either but for a smart phone camera it's more than adequate.I also wanted high speed mobile data and the HSPA+ is way better than my old 3g Samsung. It would be nice if they would include an LTE radio on the 6602, but it's not going to happen. If you want a US market Xperia Z with an LTE radio in it you have to get the 6606 from T Mobile but then you get a T Mobile Logo on the back, and another T Mobile logo on the lock screen and it uses their custom boot loader so for me I'd rather live without the LTE radio and stay with the unlocked model. And by the way, don't buy the 6603 model if you're planning on using it in the US. It's designed for use overseas and will not give you LTE or HSPA+ bands in the US. It will only give you the old Edge network which is like going back to dial up.The other thing I wanted was an NFC chip. This is actually my biggest gripe about the Sony. It has the NFC chip and supports android beam but due to the secure element it is blocked from working with google wallet for tap and pay. There are some work arounds like rooting the phone and using root explorer to change the device name to something like Nexus or Galaxy but you shouldn't have to root your phone just to be able to pay for a cup of coffee with your phone. My current solution is using the google wallet debit card. Also from what I've read the Kit Kat update which is due out this month is supposed to fix the google wallet issue.My other requirements were for it to be unlocked and it is. I wanted to have tethering built in natively without rooting or apps and it is. Also SIP is built in natively and works perfectly, no apps required. I needed GPS and of course it has it and it works very well. My other and one of my main requirements was good sound and Sony hit the nail on the head with the sound quality. I love the Walkman app and also the built in FM radio is a very nice touch.One of the other best features on this phone is the chipset control widget. It's very nice to not have to go in to settings to control wif, Bluetooth, mobile data, nfc, backlight, etc. You can control them all from the widget. Very useful. The battery life is very acceptable, no complaints there. I also wanted screen capture which is built natively into Android now and works great by pressing the power button and volume down button for one second.And probably my biggest requirement is for the phone to work well and it really does. The first call I made to my friend Jim, he said \"Where are you calling me from, it sounds like you're in the next room.\" Very clear calls and great cellular reception even in areas with weak signals where other phones would be dropping the calls the Xperia just works.One thing lacking at this time is a built in emoji keyboard for texting friends with iphones. It comes with Whatsapp pre installed with an emoji keyboard that works great. However, I understand that the Kit Kat update will finally add an emoji keyboard as well so hopefully that will be resolved soon.What I really like about this phone is how thin and light it is. I also like not having the same phone as everyone else. And the size of the phone seems to be more in the phablet category than the phone category but that's ok. It still fits in my pocket and since I got it I don't have to carry my iPad around with me at work anymore because the 5\" screen size is big enough to actually read email and view web pages on.Basically there are way more pros to this phone than cons. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality, unlocked, GSM smart phone at a reasonable price. If you're a hard core tech junkie and want the latest updates as soon as they come out and an LTE radio in an unlocked phone then maybe you should buy a Nexus. For a skinned, unlocked android phone, the Xperia is the best of the best.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Charles W.

As a long-time Sony-Ericsson customer, the new Sony phones were interesting but the biggest drawback was Android and Google's lack of respect for my privacy.This last point, Android, was in mind the single most important reason to switch to something else, and the Nokia and Blackberry were intriguing choices. After reading all the reviews and analyzing the phones, I was all set to select the Nokia 920...but for the arrogance of Microsoft.Microsoft announced that they were discontinuing support for Windows Phone 8, an OS they introduced only last year. That, along with their refusal to listen to customer feedback on the desktop version of Windows 8 completely turned me off, and now there was no way I was going to buy anything with Windows. So, now I was back to Android despite my privacy concerns about Google.I tried really really hard to like the Samsung, but for a $600+ phone, i wanted something that looked it and couldn't get over the plasticy feeling and cheapness of Samsung's build quality. Additionally, because of my prior business experience in dealing with Korean companies, I was already deeply suspicious of the Koreans cutting corners in quality.Now all my other candidates were eliminated and I went back to Sony to see what they had. One look at the Xperia Z, and I was sold. Others may have better hardware specs, or better software, or better hype (I'm looking at you iPhone), but the Z topped them all in a nice balance between hardware, software, and looks. Best of all, it felt well built and sturdy, yet sophisticated, with blazing fast responsiveness.I bought the Z, and whereas before I'd use the phone strictly for communications (phone/messaging), now, for the first time, I am really enjoying using my phone as a complete computing device. My laptop use has dropped to less than 50%.Well done Sony!!", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A flagship phone with some problems", "Author": "dreipasou", "ReviewID": "R1O5R28QPONLZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using the Z for six months now. There are pros and cons to the phone. Make no mistake, it is a expensive flagship phone with a lot of processor power and memory. However, I have to rant about a thing or two.First of all, the wifi reception is horrible, almost making you want to stop using wifi at all. Of course, wifi is more battery-friendly than mobile data, so you really can't.Also the gps works bad. It takes many seconds for it to find you. It often also loses the satellite connection. This is especially annoying if you, like me, travel a lot and depend on offline maps.What's more, the camera could be better.Bottom line: would I buy this phone now that I know better?

I was in the market for a tablet at the time. In an effort to get even with apple I actively sought an alternative to their ecosystem. After looking at several android tablets, I settled on the Sony tablet S- their first android tablet (I should probably identify myself as a Sony fan boy...). It has been a year and a half and have been pleasantly surprised- in fact, I'd say that I prefer android now.So with that as a backdrop, I'll now tell you about the Xperia Z- I have had it for just short of two months. At the start, it took some adjustment to how it gets things done versus iOs- subtle differences that were unfamiliar at first. After working thru that break in and learning how stuff works, I can say that I am very happy with this phone. It works without hiccups and has been very smooth. Every function I've tried has worked- \"throwing\" media to a dlna compatible device is still a bit jerry and hit or miss. Integration with other Sony products is solid to the extent that the other Sony products are modern enough to be integrated. The phone is well made, thoughtfully laid out, and sized to be functional in the hand. The screen is responsive to touch, gorgeous to behold. Sony's tweaks on stock Android are unobtrusive and often very functional additions (my wife wishes her Samy phone could run some of the Sony \"small apps\" and a few of the other proprietary Sony stuff). Android 4.2.2 came a few weeks ago and offers some enhancements over the previous edition. Sony also introduced a \"find my Xperia\" function which seems to work well in the testing I've done with it. It's nice to be able to wash this phone off too. I purposely avoid wristwatches, and footware that are not waterproof- to not have these items waterproof just doesn't make sense in my life. And I would add a phone to the list of things that will have to be waterproof in my life going forward. It's hard to think of another  item that you use daily while you are out and about, that you handle in public places and then put up to your face without washing it off. It seems to be catching on as a concept too- I saw a new version of the Samy galaxy phone is available in a waterproof edition. It only makes sense...I would also recommend you consider purchase of a phone thru amazon where possible (without a contract) the \"bloatware\" that at&t;, t-mobile, Verizon and others put on phones you get from them is just about useless, and only serves you adds from the carrier- no thank you. Alot of it cannot be removed from your phone either.In summary, I would gladly order this phone again, and I would recommend it to others.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone...Ever!", "Author": "Carter Hooper", "ReviewID": "R3ECB0VISTVB4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and I've had quite a few. After learning it's lesson with the heavy-handed (and painfully slow) Timescape, Sony's Android skin is smooth and silky, never more so than on the Xperia Z. I am honestly surprised how much I fell for this phone, as am huge tech junkie and go through 'em quick either through contract or importing 'em outright. But the Z is solid, the weight is great, and is sexy as all get-out. The update Walkman app is a fine and fluid hub for all your music, and with the SD card slot, you can really pack 'em in. Camera is fantastic, tho can't touch Nokia's Lumia 1020 (who can?). Forget the nitpicking you've heard over the viewing angles of the screen-with clarity and color like this, you're gonna spend all your time staring at it head on. Waterproofing is lagniappe but very cool. While Samsung is busy copying and churning out the same old stuff and cheap design, Sony is going through the stratosphere on sleekness, speed and style.

It's very thing but the edges are squared so you can have stand anywhere level at both portrait and landscape view.If you still did not know... this thing is COMPLETELY waterproof.

Some of the apps responded slow but with the latest android update (Version 4.3 at the time of this review) its become almost flawless. The camera is great, even in low light conditions and Sony recently added a lot of new features for it.Now for some less common details. I have not had to root the phone yet. Sony bundled in some handy features. One of them is external drive support. What that means is you can buy an 'OTG' cable (2 or 3$ from Amazon) and use that to plug in an external flash drive or hard drive and transfer files to and from it. Not sure about other android devices but on my Nexus 7 in order to use that feature, it had to be rooted. So far its supported my 1 TB external drive without problems.The other feature is native support for PS3 controllers. Combine a PS3 controller (or any usb gamepads) with the OTG cable and you can use that to play games on your device.I had originally bought this for about 530$ but its even cheaper now.

Smile detection, Burst mode, 1080 Video , 1080p 5in beautiful display, Bravia sync and the ability to use a Ps3 controller for games . The phone is a I phone top competitor in my book and about $250 cheaper. I can't wait to see where sony takes this kind of thinking for the future. Its also water resistant to 3 feet for 30 mins so little splash while listening to music in the shower or by the pool is ok.
