{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very nice basic phone", "Author": "Alan Weiss", "ReviewID": "R1HKD1XGLBPUCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is marketed towards youngsters. But it is perfect for older people, such as myself, who don't use a cell phone much, yet want to have one \"just in case\" or for occasional use. Over the past few weeks I have found it to be reliable, it holds a charge a long time, and has pretty good voice quality. It is quite tiny--no need for a folding (\"flip\") phone. Virgin has increased the number of services it offers: either 25c/minute, and only spend $15/90 days to keep the service active, or else 35c/day for 10c minutes. No roaming or domestic long distance charges. Very few taxes and no extra fees. The service is not cost-effective if you plan to use the phone heavily, but for light use you will not find a less expensive service.I found a few deficiencies in the phone that keep me from giving it 5 stars. As others have noted, the screen is hard to see when not backlit. Some features are hidden in menus--for example, there is a speakerphone, but just go try to find out how to use it! It isn't described in the manual. (It turns out it is a menu option when you receive or make a call, but if you just look through the menus you won't find it.) The provided ring tones are too funky for me. So I surprised myself by paying for a old-fashioned ring, $2, which actually sounds pretty good.So if you want a small reliable phone that holds a charge well and has good clear sound, the Shorty is worth a look. Just be sure that the Sprint network (which Virgin uses) is available in your area before buying any Virgin phone, as they have no capability of roaming onto other networks.*****Added after several months with the phone*******My phone does indeed have the \"auto shut-off\" bug. It didn't bite me for several weeks, but it has happened to me several times over the past few months. The phone shuts itself off despite having plenty of power left in the battery. The remedy, as others have reported, is to take the battery out for a second. When reinserted, the phone acts fine again. It doesn't happen to me very often, but it does happen. Since it happens so rarely, perhaps once every few weeks, it doesn't bother me much, but I can see it would be infuriating to some people. It is rather amazing to me that Nokia claims not to be aware of this bug.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great utilitarian cellphone", "Author": "The Amazon Shopper", "ReviewID": "R3JDNJIPHBSPB9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I never bought into the hype of colour screens and attached cameras in a cellphone. I just want a cellphone that has long battery power, easy to carry, and does the talking well.One of the nicest thing with this phone is the signal strength indicator: it has seven bars in total, giving a very clear indication of how the signal is, and whether you feel confident having a conversation at the spot you are at.The battery lasts about a week on standby and light talking and turned off at night. It is lithium-ion battery so is very convenient in terms of charging. Charging time is about five hours to full.The display is very large. It has the usual usability of a Nokia phone. It does not have an antenna, and the mic is quite far from the mouth, but I have never needed to repeat myself even in quite noisy environments. The sound is clear, and it includes an integrated loudspeaker.Now, a few issues. The included ringtones are few and fewer still are the \"professional/discrete\" type. Auto-key-lock failed once so I had to restart the phone. The keys are a bit small and hard so they require some getting used to.Also, on several occasions it refused to be turned off. I had to take the battery out to force it to power down. Not sure why, but it really shouldn't happen.Overall, a very economic functional phone without bells and whistles (except for the integrated flashlight). It works like a telephone.", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great tiny phone; just one problem.", "Author": "e", "ReviewID": "RMCLA1S66OX6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a tiny phone; it fits in a pocket very well. The sound quality is great, and people can hear me well. The \"Shorty\" is a great little phone (with the exception of the screen--it's difficult to read the time of day display). I particularly like the loudspeaker feature, which enables me to put the phone down next to me while driving and hear and be heard well.  It's easy to navigate through all the features, although it might be more difficult for someone with bigger fingers; I use my thumbnail to push the buttons.  Easy to find out my balance, too.  I just use the phone for making and receiving calls and not for the downloadable features and games, so I haven't tried all those.  The existing ringtones are I suspect aimed at a younger crowd--they sound kind of hip hop.  They also sound kind of tinny.  But, as I said, I'm using it mainly for a low-use phone; so this didn't discourage me.What did discourage me was the one little problem:  My particular phone has a little problem of powering off on its own without warning every few days--even with a full battery charge. So I'm walking around with a phone that is not on thinking I can receive emergency calls when actually I can't, because it has spontaneously turned itself off. Nothing I do gets it to turn back on.  It is just dead. I figured out I just remove the battery and put it back in (which the trouble shooting page on the nokiausa website confirmed), and this enables me to turn it back on. I find this unacceptable in a phone and am returning it. Virgin Mobile customer service was kind and polite and offered to give me a new \"Shorty,\" but I declined, because I found the minutes disappearing too fast with the Virgin Mobile prepaid plan.  I believe, because they start counting off your time the second you push send when you make a call.  So, you are paying for the 15 or 20 seconds it takes your party's voice mail to connect AND the message you leave on his or her voicemail.  This adds up.  Had I not been unimpressed with the Virgin Mobile plan, I probably would have taken them up on the replacement offer, because I really like the phone.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Big Features in a Little Package", "Author": "Fishstick", "ReviewID": "RZL7UZETLUED3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice, sleek looking phone from a simple pay as you go wireless provider.  Virgin Mobile uses the SPRINT PCS network and charges you as follows...$.025 a minute for the first 10 minutes of the day, then $0.10 a minute after that.  Or, $0.10 a minute plus $0.35 a day.  You pay $0.10 per text message you send and it is free to receive them.  You must top off your account at least $20 every 90 days to keep your account active, but you keep the minutes you have already purchased.  If you don't use your phone a lot your looking at $6.66 a month for a cell phone.  How simple is that?  No other hidden fees involved.The Nokia 2115i is the smallest Nokia I have ever seen.  It stands less than 4\" tall, less than 1.5\" from side to side and less than 3/4\" thick.  There are limited accessories for it at this time because it is new to the market.  You can send and receive text from other phones or email addresses.  There are tons of downloadable stuff from the web site as well.  Other features include a speaker phone, built in flashlight, voice dialing, voice memo recording, games and more.  Anytime your curious about how much money you have left in your account, you can check your balance right on the phone.  It takes about 5 seconds for the account information to be zapped back to you in a text message.  You can also access your account on the web site.If your like me who got tired of spending over $50 a month for cell phone minutes I never used, this is for you.  I like the convenience of having a phone, but do not have a need to have it glued to my ear all day.  Virgin Mobile pay as you go is simple and in my case money saving.

I suspect bad software loaded.But even if it does, I doubt I would ever recommend VM.  They have the worst customer service, I have ever experiened.  How many times do they expect their customers to beat their heads against a brick wall?My experience with Virgin Mobile REMAINS most unsatisfactory.  I do not recommend their service or the Nokia Shorty. If VM does remedy this issue, I will edit this review.My original Nokia Shorty phone also turned itself off.  Virgin Mobile sent a replacement with same problem.Today I called VM customer service and requested a different model phone to replace this second defective phone.  The representative said she could only send me the same model.  I asked to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor was unresponsive and condescending, implying the phone was turning off because it was in my pocket and \"operator error.\"  This in spite that the phone turned off once during the night on my dresser; and this was a known issue with the Nokia Shorty.  Also, she could not explain why it was necessary to re-insert the battery to power the phone back on.She repeated VM would only send the same phone in exchange.  She said her supervisor does not take calls, and there was no one in Virgin Mobile she would refer me to.As it stands now, VM is sending me a third Nokia Shorty.  If this second replacement has the same problem, what are my options?  The customer service representatives gave me no options except  to send me another and another replacement and so on.Apparently VM does not give its customer representatives the freedom to make decisions on their own in order to satisfy VM customers.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Small phone - good quality", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "R35XGKB6MIRCIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Virgin Mobile user for about 2 years and this is my third phone and the best so far.

Nothing more, nothing less. I've yet to drop all call in my area, but your mileage may vary since it depends on the Sprint network. Activation was rather quick and painless. It was on within 5 minutes of my call to VM.Medium points:  I'm a light user who already has a home phone, so I don't really mind the rates. I barely even spent five dollars on minutes this month. I usually end up making a few extra calls I wouldn't do otherwise just to burn up some minutes before top-up time. However, if you don't already have a home phone, you'd be better off with a regular monthly plan from another carrier. No stars added or taken away because of this point, since your mileage may vary.The flashlight is a nice added bonus, which comes in handy since I work nights and it gives enough light to unlock my door, but not much more. This point is kinda trivial, so it doesn't add or cost any stars from me.Bad points: Several reviewers have mentioned the spontaneous shutoff, which I find trivial, but enough to cost a star. Pop the battery out and put it back, it's just fine for a couple of weeks or so.Also, the regular speaker is not as loud as I would like, so every time I make or get a call, I have to press the loudspeaker button. Maybe this should not have any bearing on the review since my hearing has been damaged by years of loud rock'n'roll, but there goes another star anyway.Overview: It just works.

You just can't beat it for the price. It runs on the Sprint PCS network which is generally second only to Verizon in terms of reliability.

Oh, and the speakerphone is very screetchy and tinny sounding.

More, I had to find out from the manual that it was a no-no to cover the top of the phone with your hand, as that blocks the internal antenna - not easy to do with so small a unit.Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint network. I've found the phone works most places I need it to work, but I was in the mall a couple of days ago and saw others yapping happily on their cells. Deciding to test this, I got no signal. Not sure if this the phone or Sprint.Finally, I bought the phone at Amazon rather than a \"brick and mortar\" store because only Amazon offered a package deal with a free $20 'top up' card.

I have to open up the battery cover, take out the battery for just a second, and then replace it, at which point the phone will power back on. I actually returned the phone once to get it replaced because I thought I just had a bum one. Then my replacement kept doing it and I realized there's just some sort of general problem with this type of phone. I searched the internet and have found many other people saying the same thing about it suddenly dying. I'm not a big chatter and use this phone solely for receiving important emergency-like calls from family members. And in saying that, it's very frustrating to know while you're walking around with the shorty in your pocket, the phone might be dead at that very moment.Besides that, it's a really cheap seeming phone. It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is. When you call customer support you are greeted with a recording that's all \"hey what's up!\" instead of just a regular professional environment. And the phone doesn't offer any free 'normal' ring-tones. There's only a couple crunked out ghetto ones. I just keep the phone on vibrate anyway but it'd definitely be nice if they could have the decency to throw in a normal ring-tone for free rather then only low-rider crunky music.It's a good phone if you're dirt poor like I am. If I had any money I'd get rid of it in a heart-beat.Oh, I have one more complaint. There's no volume scroll thing or anything, so you have to press the keypad during conversation to turn up the phone. But if you've been dialing numbers (like if you're calling your bank \"press 1 for checking account\" etc, then because you've entered numbers into the phone, you have to clear them all out before you can turn up or down the volume.

After a couple years we thought we'd try the Audiovox.  My phone didn't work right from day one.  My family kept theirs. I waited for the Shorty.  Just an inexpensive phone with an inexpensive plan.  Works great.  I text a lot more than make calls.  I enlarge the text so I don't need glasses, and select loudspeaker and hear just fine.  Yeah, it could be considered boring, but if you simply need a phone - it works great.  I haven't had a shut off problem I've read about - I never turn mine off. No external antenae is a plus.I have all the latest gadgets so I'm looking for a decent phone only.My fiance on the other hand...Can't stuff enough stuff into a phone for his taste!", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "An adequate performance", "Author": "S.

Make no mistake, this phone is for one thing only: talking (okay, or texting). The lack of a color screen, camera, any game you want to play, or MP3 capabilities is an asset, in my book.I live in the Boston area and find network quality to be excellent; always a signal. Typically that's the case when I travel as well.This phone isn't for everyone. I purchased it for the pay-as-you-go plan. (I use it relatively little, only spending about $15 every 2 months, on a \"20 cents for the first minute, or 10 cents per minute per day that I use 10 minutes or more\" plan. I believe Virgin Mobile no longer offers this plan to new subscribers though.)How's Virgin Mobile customer service? My wife's VM phone, a 1-year-old Vox 8610 (still under warranty), just died 2 weeks ago, and after a quick customer service call, Virgin Mobile Fedexed us a new one just 2 days later. Also when I've called with any questions, I've been extremely happy with the attitude of the reps, and their ability to resolve issues.Downsides: the battery did occasionally need to be popped out and put back in when the unit wouldn't start, but that problem has gone away. (Given that the phone was essentially free, this isn't a big problem to me.)The only thing I'd like to be different is for it to have a built-in headset jack. (Also, buying one of the available laptop-to-cellphone-via-USB chargers is a big help.)All in all, it's a sturdy, great little phone.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good very basic phone.

I also get clear signals and very few dropped signals.I am on the $34.99 a month plan with Virgin Mobile and that's sufficient for my use. I like that there is no contracts required and you can easily switch plans as your needs change or even deactivate for awhile. I did research before I bought this on amazon and liked the reviews.
