When I do talk on the phone it is crackley. After only a few minutes use the phone heats up and is hot to the touch. I am unable to download anything. I think this phone was a refurb sold as a new phone. When I received it, the phone was not in a Virgin Mobile box and there was no Users manual. I just wasted my money and time.

It was a little touchy and a little tough to get it up and running, something about the network connection.  But after doing some online swapping by me, and a pleasant conversation with customer service things were up and going quickly.  As previously google play was slow to get going (I remember that from my previous smart phone) but once it connected we were rolling quickly.  As with any phone there is a little learning curve and figuring out the subtleties and how things operate.  I've added many apps and widgets quickly I love the Accuweather display clock and I've really removed a lot of the embedded apps  from the display screens.  But that was a personal choice and I'm not holding against the company.  It makes a call quickly and effectively and I love being able to quickly sync with my Google contacts, long gone are the days of tedious entry (unless you have a Grandma phone).  I'm happy this is a great phone.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "not happy", "Author": "tania rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R28NCJFT5XDFCJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my sister her birthday was Sept.29 today is Oct 9 and the phone don't work I though the battery might have been bad so I bought another one and no its this dam phone now its just sitting in the junk drawer $90.00 Down  the toilet.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's practical", "Author": "Jessica Fortson", "ReviewID": "RZ5F5GS45VTLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone does the basics of what I needed it for, however it is extremely slow at times and it randomly deletes applications.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "no charge", "Author": "Rosemarie", "ReviewID": "R2OFUXTY4I7BOX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my fianc\u00e9e....we waited a week for it.

My 4 year old Samsung Mantra flipphone had only 1 or 2 bars and worked extremely well.  Activating this LG resulted in reception & performance so poor that I reactivated the Samsung again. Since the LG is 4 years newer I figured that it HAD to have at least the same or better performance. Not so. At least with smartphones, it seems that you do get what you pay for. This was a surprising learning experience for me. In fact, I'm quite surprised that VM sells it for their network... They do not offer the same signal strength as the Sprint network does, even though VM is owned by Sprint and broadcasts from Sprint towers. The reason is that Sprint costs more and so their performance sort of HAS to be better than VM. This I learned from a very candid Sprint sales rep. Of course, your mileage may vary.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "jmford", "ReviewID": "R1D1YRKWSIP0O1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i absolutely love this phone. its easy to figure out. its thin and very nice. getting my daughter one as soon as possible", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is not a cheap phone so i dont know why people are saying that...", "Author": "Jaizelle Hardy", "ReviewID": "ROXZGYYPAQR7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was only a bargain on here compared to the actual price online on the virgin mobile website, the phone is 149.99. So that may be cheap to people who have it to blow like that but i saved up quite a bit to get this phone and so far it was worth it. I ended up getting a deal on it through amazon thank goodness. I was overall impressed with how the phone looks.The face of the phone is sleek and easy to use the touch screen when unlocked. u will need your sd card if u will be transferring apps and contacts from an old phone.
