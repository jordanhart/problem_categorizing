Yeah software is a little old (android 1.5 cupcake) but I already updated it on the motorola webpage to android 2.1 eclair and it works wonderfully, motoblur is good, and as I say... you don't get a slide qwerty key pad really often in this price range... (exept for those useless qwerty keypad phones who don't even have wifi conection, and do not even run android).Well I've had this phone since it came out, and I was really happy, then I changed it to the nokia n8 (wich sucked by the way) and I couldn't find myself using the onscreen keyboard, I looked around for phones with D-pads on the left for videogames but guess what? NONE!! so I had to order this one again and now I'm happy with my phone again.1. Gorgeous design2. It's fancily heavy3. Has the best keyboard4.

There are many apps you can add at the android market, but many of them are really useless and they make your phone really sluggish.The camera it's ok, though it does not have a flash.And finally a noteworthy aspect of this devise is that it doesn't have a hung key, therefore sometimes its annoyingly difficult to find it at the screen.Overall, this phone is fine for what you pay but if you are looking for useful devise this is not the one you are looking for.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone works for you depending on what you need", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1OPU2XF7HL2OG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I purchased this phone because I needed a physical Qwerty keyboard but still a huge screen to watch videos with. I also needed a phone that took a sim card. This phone came up as what I could purchase and the price was great, $140, and it looked nice and sleek. So, I'm going to go down the line of what I thought of certain aspects:Pros1. Text messages- It's similar to the i-phone in which it does the bubble text messages and you can see the whole conversation which is nice.2. You can copy and paste what you write, which comes in handy.3. You can check your gmail on the go, which is nice.4. Calendar is nice. Its synchornized with your gmail calendar. You can also save expired dates.5. I love the apps you can get but I wish they had scrabble.6. Camera and video recording is nice.7. Youtube is nice but could be faster but it could just be youtube.8. Found a free music download app which is good.9. Phone calls are crystal clear.Cons1. Android 1.6- The only thing I don't like is that it's not a Android 2.1. I imagine it would run faster if it was and I'm not sure if I can upgrade from 1.6.2. Internet- It could be because of the carrier I'm with but the internet is not so fast. The facebook app is not as quick as I would like it. My previous phone was not an android phone and it's facebook was faster.3. GPS- My gps is stuck on whether I want an upgrade and doesn't give me the option of finding where I am. This could probably easily be solved but I havent found out yet.4. Google maps just shows your home location and doesn't change the map when you are away from your saved address unlike the i-phone in which it picks up where you are instantly.5. Battery could be better. If you don't use the phone all day it will die even though it's fully charged. It doesn't help much when you turn off the wi-fi and gps. Might as well should turn it off.Overall, I enjoy the phone and it works for what I need.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stable Phone", "Author": "Alanwms", "ReviewID": "R2CZ61W978OG7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has been the most stable phone - no lockups, and fast.

After about two weeks, the phone started to deteriorate. At first, it lagged a little bit. Then, when I would try to click on a contact or an application, the phone would just return to the home screen. Now, when I am receiving an incoming call, the phone sometimes does not show who is calling (name OR number) and sometimes does not display the \"Answer\" and \"Ignore\" buttons, making me unable to answer a call. The few times that I am able to hit the \"Answer\" button, I cannot hear anything----not even static noise from my end. When I am lucky enough to make an outgoing call or successfully answer an incoming call, I cannot expect the call to last very long. My phone now cuts off when it feels like it (usually while I'm making an important call). This has been the most frustrating phone I have ever had--and it is the most expensive one (first smartphone) I have ever had. This phone has definitely not been worth the trouble. I was going to revert to a talk/text phone until I found out T-Mobile would send me a replacement phone. Not only has the Android update ruined the phone, the battery does not last very long.

Although the technology is a bit outdated as far as the Android OS is concerned, most reviews gave this phone high ratings especially for the Qwerty keyboard.  Since receiving the phone I've updated the OS via the Motorola website and it now has a little more mojo.  I used standard free shipping and got the phone in less than a week.  My current T-Mobile plan doesn't include data but using WI-FI works great at home or at hotspots.  So far the only fly in the ointment seems to be that the battery takes a very long time to charge up.  Not sure if this is because the battery is old.  I've ordered a replacement online and will see how it charges.  For the price I think I got a good deal.

It could be related to the MotoBlur feature, which at first appears to be very exciting to use, but not that much after a while using this device. And the seller makes no statement about the 3G bands used by this phone, so I learned that I couldn't use it with my (then) current operators and I had to buy a new SIM card from the sole operator that uses that band in my country.

My last phone was a Blackberry Curve.  Overall the Cliq is a solid phone from a hardware perspective, although the left-handed pointer is rather odd given the majority of the population is right handed.  Unless you are ambidextrous or left handed, the pointer will be unusable.From the software perspective, the Android operating system is horrible and barely usable.  While it is cool to surf the Internet because of the larger screen, the phone is barely usable as a phone.  On incoming calls, pushing the big green \"answer\" button typically does nothing.  Most of the time my incoming calls end up in voicemail while I repeated push, tap, hit, or beat on the answer button to no avail.  Then I have to call the person who called me, which increases my minute usage.  Android also has an odd habit of pocket dialing people in my contacts list, particularly those on speed dial, even while the screen is locked, further increasing my minute usage and resulting in odd call backs from friends and business associates.The Android marketplace is as well designed as Blackberry's which means it stinks.  Applications are not properly tested or vetted (like Apple does for the iPhone) so there is a huge quantity of junk and non-working applications many of which crash the phone.  Some applications, particularly Twidroid, seem to updated daily causing constant downloading and reinstallation over and over again.If I had to do it over again, I would have upgraded to a newer Blackberry.  If Apple would sell the iPhone for providers other than AT&T;, which has the worst coverage in the Phoenix metro area, I would look at an iPhone.  If you have an iPod Touch as I do, the primitive touch screen interface of Android takes a lot of getting used to.Battery life is horrible!  Plan on buying and keeping 1 or 2 spare charged batteries because the Cliq turns into a brick around late morning unless its continuously charged.  And don't think plugging this puppy into a USB port or the wall for a quick 20-minute refresh will do anything.  Plan on 6 hours to recharge.  You will have to charge nightly and several times during the day.  In comparison, my Blackberry only needed to be charged every 4 days with the same amount of usage.Google should stick to search engines and browsers because they don't know the first thing about making a usable phone operating system.
