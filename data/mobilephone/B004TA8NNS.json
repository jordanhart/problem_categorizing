It is especially good for people with disabilities.  I am disabled and I can hear the numbers on the pad when I dial a number.  I do not text or twitter or go on the internet, however it does have the ability to do all those things. Oh, and it can take photo's too.Being disabled I like the speaker phone ability.  I would say that this is the best cell phone I have ever had.  I use sprint, and have been with them for over 10 years.  I also think this is a pretty phone.  When one hangs up and closes the phone, a little butterfly is in the front and flies by and leaves the time.  I am not computer or cell phone smart.  I just know what works well for me.If you know someone disabled, this is the phone for them.  They can, or someone can program in doctors numbers,etc and with one touch of a number, it will call that person or business.  I have my Doctors in there,  a cab company, so if I can drive, I call a cab.  I also keep the Ambulance number in there.I guess this is a review, but I love this phone.  It is small yet has numbers that light up so you can see to dial in the dark.Great Phone !Donna", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome fun basic phone!", "Author": "Charmed One \"charmed one\"", "ReviewID": "R2PASY29222N2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this phone in blue and I love this phone! I hate hate, strongly dislike all the current phones out there. seriously I am a flirty funloving woman - why would I want a large, black MANLY phone??? and I refuse to have a phone that look like everyone elses and that is all that is out there! so I have had this phone for 4 years now(yes, 4!) and it still works great,though I notice that the ORIGINAL battery has to be charged more often. I love the way the case is semi translucent and Ilove the butterfly that appears and then flies away when you close the cover. NO BUTT DIALING and it is nicely compact to fit in my pocket. I am seriously considering getting this one in pink, cuz I love the phone and I love the color. I have enough other toys - great laptop, digital camera and ipod,so don't need all that in a phone. rather save my $$$ for shoes!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "R2R224F95UXW2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over 3 years and love it.  It is getting beat up, but it is the best little phone ever.  I want to Upgrade w/ sprint, but they don't make Katana anymore.  So I might not upgrade.  All of the few basic phones that are out there have super bad reviews.  So I might be stuck with this phone.  Which is great, but I know it won't last forever.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004TA8NNS"}}
