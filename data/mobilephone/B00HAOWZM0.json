{"Reviews": [{"Title": "These \"old new-stock\" Nokia phones are THE  best for basic cell phones. This seller & his product....not so much", "Author": "katrenco", "ReviewID": "R117J8SZ7HEGV6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ad says Nokia 2126i, rcvd Nokia 2126.  (Important difference between 2126 & 2126i:  2126i is a single rate phone [2126 uses double-minute, out-of-area roaming], 2126i uses .3 mins for texting [2126 uses .5], 2126i has GPS capability for 911 calls [2126 does not]). Contacted seller (Pageone Plus) but hubby had already opened the pkg so I had to keep it.  Tried activiating the phone w/ Tracfone, got the minutes, got the airtime, but could not get service.  Tried different battery, tried different locations (in different areas in my house, outdoors in wide open space, in a neighboring larger city), still no service.  Tracfone says the phone is defective.  This phone was to replace my original Nokia 2126, which I've had since 2006 w/ no issues regarding servcie so I must assume Tracfone is correct & the phone is defective.  Worst of all, I nearly lost my existing cell phone number in the process of trying to get this new phone to work.  I have home health clients, disabled and/or elderly, and the loss of my cell phone number would've been disasterous!  Five calls and 4 1/2 hrs later, I was able to get my phone number reactivated & air time back to my old phone (which cost me $). Be very wary if you are considering the purchase of this phone from this seller.  (Watch eBay for unopened [in original pkging] Nokia 2126 & 2126i phones.) If you order here, you may or may not get a 2126i, and it may or may not work.  I ordered a new phone thru Tracfone & will be using my old phone until it arrives & can have my mins & phone number transferred.  This phone is headed for hazardous material recycling.
