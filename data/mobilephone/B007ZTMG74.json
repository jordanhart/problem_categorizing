It does have an older android operating system and maybe too many AT&T; apps on it, but it was made for them. I have only had the phone for a couple of weeks so something could go wrong, but as of right now, great phone.The phone has over 350 reviews over on Ebay, where it has 4 1/2 stars and I just thought that there should at least be one review here.I got the phone for the wifi, because I would rather use that to make and receive my phone calls. Am just tired of paying that phone bill. I got the 32gb card so it holds like 10000 songs and 20000 pics, or 120 hrs of video. The phone does a lot and for me will pay itself off in just a few months.phone, 32 gb card, case, screen protectors, and headphones all for under $140, great value.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesomesauce!", "Author": "queenblades", "ReviewID": "R2UY4VJ9TUAMVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to use for straight talk, and it works great! only thing I don't like is the battery life and the phone didnt come with a micro SD card and memory is horrible. but besides that, it has been working great! I had to partition the 16 gb SD card I bought, so I could link apps to it, and it helped alot. Taskiller also saves the battery. I use to have to carry my charger to work for only 8 hours and would have to charge it 3 times. but now it lasts a full day even when calling people and messing around with apps! Android came as 2.2 instead of 2.1 so that was a plus. Overall, this phone is really easy to understand and has been great!! I would totally recommend!", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Few positive aspects to this phone.", "Author": "Brock", "ReviewID": "R2AX1P451N8BI4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is cheap for a smart phone, but you do not even get what you pay for.1. Keyboard is not very responsive and I have to do a lot of backspacing to make corrections.2. Reception is poor. Others using the same network with different phones have a signal when I have nothing.3. Camera takes mediocre pictures and half the videos I shoot are unplayable.4. Battery life is just ridiculous. I use my phone very little and find myself having to charge it after a day and half of idle time. I don't have wireless or gps enabled.5. Back cover comes off too easily.1. Call quality is decent and have not experienced a dropped call.If I were the type of person who was remotely serious about my phone, I would have returned it and spent a little more for a better phone.UPDATE: I wanted to reinforce my opinion on how terrible this phone is. If you take a video that is more than a few (30 seconds?) the file will be corrupt and unplayable and you have to perform a hard reboot to get the camera to work again. HATE THIS PHONE SO MUCH!UPDATE 2: After reinstalling factory settings the standby battery life has GREATLY improved. I did shoot 2 videos in excess of 2 minutes without a problem. Before you yell at me for breaking my phone know that I have not installed a single application and made no alterations whatsoever. It seems this phone came with some glitches in its OS as all these problems occurred right out of the box. I have upgraded my review to 3 stars. IF YOU GET THIS PHONE, THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULT BEFORE POPULATING IT WITH APPS AND CONTACTS.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a great cell phone!", "Author": "Dwight D.

With her new phone she is able to do so much more!  Best of all it is compatible for our business use!  This phone has so many features, and built in apps that her old cell phone looked like a toy!  She got it as an early birthday gift and has been enjoying every minute of it!  It works great with the internet and is super fast and makes me envious that my older cell phone is not as COOL as hers!

It came with Android 2.2 that is just fine. It is an unlocked phone so I could brought it to my country Colombia. It has a very nice navigation bottom and the screen  is very nice and has good resolution. I like the qwerty keyboard. In general is a 3 starts phone in comparison to other phones.I don't like  it came with a lot of AT&T; apps and they are usless at all, at least in my case (not using it in USA). You can't delete the apps unless you root your phone. It is also quite difficult to upgrade the android version for this phone. It hasn't been possible for me. There are only 2 things I find very annoying about the phone. First, I can't play videos on Youtube. Second, the memory on the phone is not enough to download more than 3 apps. It always keep saying that the memory is full (internal memory).

It won't stay on unless it's plugged into the wall charger, and it won't charge when it's plugged in because it says it's fully charged. As frustrating as it was, technical problems do arise sometimes, I contacted customer service only to find that apparently this product is packaged and shipped from Amazon but not sold by Amazon so while they paid for the shipping label to return it, they would not do an exchange and I would be forced to wait up to two weeks for my refund before I could order my replacement phone in which I would pay additional shipping and wait an additional 2 to 5 business days depending on the shipping I chose.

It wouldn't take any photos until I put an SD Card in it, but now the camera works very well.  I absolutely love the slide-out keyboard for texting and e-mail.  It is much easier to use than the on-screen one.  Using the FM Radio is a pain because it always tries to get you to subscribe to AT&T; radio first.  It charges quickly and notifies me when a text or email come in and lets me read them while charging.  The trackpad does work, but it seems to be an unnecessary feature, as there is really no reason to use the thing.  It is much easier to just touch the screen.  My biggest issue with the phone is that there is not much storage area.  It is always telling me I need more space, even when I try to update apps like YouTube, which came pre-installed on the phone. apparently the SD card is not used for any storage except photos or videos.
