My Nokia was 100% better at texting and in call quality. But, its a phone and it works and its cheap. This was for my son so the texting is more important than the calls so from his point of view - it sucks but that translated means - it works and I have a phone :DThe phone came fast. No worries with the company. They actually sent me 2 phones, tried for four days to get them on the phone to get the second one back. Finally got them and they said they would send a shipping sticker to me... never came. Cant get them back on the phone either.
