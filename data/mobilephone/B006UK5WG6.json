No big thing as it is unlocked. Pretty quick delivery on standard shipping. The white is eye catching. I bought this for a cousin who refuses to put a protector on it. OS is fast - I used it minimally. I just don't like the BB OS anyhow. I think it's OS 7. Stock as is, it doesn't seem that the battery life is all that great when compared to the 9800 it replaced. Don't know if it needs to have a few charge-and-discharge cycles. Even though it's not mine, I've given it 4 of 5 stars as it is a decent phone as far as smartphones and Berries in particular go. It takes good quality photos, call clarity is very good.

The phone also stops working if I use it for over ten minutes. It has issues with the battery life as well. My other blackberry battery used to last about two days but this device uses the whole battery in half a day. I am also trying to contact the seller to make arrangments for the return.
