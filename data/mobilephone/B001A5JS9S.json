{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What An Incredible Phone For My Blind Mom!!!", "Author": "--", "ReviewID": "R2MII76XJ3MUIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is truly amazing.  I got one for my 86 year old blind, arthritic mother who is in a nursing home, and liked it so much (I'm 61) that I upgraded my old Sony Ericsson to a Pantech Breeze.  I ordered hers with voice dial and all she has to do is open the phone, press *8 and the phone asks her what she wants to do.  She says who she wants to call and it dials the number for her.  When she is done, all she has to do is just close it.  I couldn't figure out how she could use a Bluetooth headset with voice dial.  That is due to Bluetooth controls, not the phone.The keypad is close to as large as a regular phone, with keys that are slightly raised in the center.  I measured the size of the numbers on the display screen, and they are a full 1/2 inch tall!  The size can be adjusted.For the most part, I was able to start using it without really reading the user's manual.  I had never used Bluetooth before, so that took more time.  I took it to my local AT&T; store and they transfered all of the contents of my address book.  For my Mom's phone, I put her address book in via the internet.  She lives in California and I live in Illinois, so being able to manage it at a distance is a real plus.The phone has great clarity and although it is considered a entry level phone, it beats my old phone hands down.  Some people call it the \"little old lady phone\", but to me, it is more of a cradle to grave phone.The only thing I wish they had done differently is the cover for connecting the charger and wired headset.  My Mom, even if she could see, would not be able to recharge the phone without assistance.  I even have a hard time gaining access to the connection slot.AT&T; states that the talk time battery life is at least three hours.  Well, I got almost 10 hours which is partially due to the fact that both of us have a very strong signal and I don't send graphics, read email, surf the net or take pictures.Some people have complained that it only comes in white, but I could care less. Clarity of sound and ease of use are of higher priority.All in all, this phone does everything it claims to, and then some.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's *loud*!", "Author": "Vickita \"vickita1961\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1Z8K31H5HEE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, I've had this phone for a couple of weeks, and I like it quite a lot.  It's slick-looking, thin and pearly white, lightweight, and fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans.As others may have said, the battery seems to hold a charge for a good long time, and the big buttons are nice.  I haven't had the opportunity (?) to test out the sturdiness of it yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner or later.The thing I like best about this phone, though, is that it's LOUD.  I do concert photography, so I spend a lot of time in noisy bars and at outdoor music festivals, and I can actually hear this phone when it rings, even when it's in my back pocket.  I had to turn down the receiver volume from the factory default setting, because it was uncomfortably loud.  How great is that?I changed the menu setting from the EZ setting to the advanced setting, in order to have more options and control, so I can't honestly say I've noticed the menus being any easier to navigate than any other phone I've ever had.  And it may just be because I haven't gotten used to it yet, but entering text -- phone numbers and text messages -- seems more awkward than with other phones.  The button that I instinctively expect to use to delete characters, instead throws me out of text-writing mode and the phone asks me if I want to save what I've entered as a draft or not, without giving me the option of saying, \"Oops!\" and going back to continue entering text.  I don't like that.  I've abandoned more than one text message from frustration and not having time to try again, that way.So: I like the phone.  I think I'll get used to the texting weirdness, and it's all worth it for the YAY!VOLUME! and -- if it turns out to be true -- the tough, takes-a-lickin'-and-keeps-on-tickin' survivability of the thing.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "EZ Phone", "Author": "ROD \"SYSOP\"", "ReviewID": "R35WTOEIT8M7GY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 3 months and it is for EVERYONE! Large buttons.. bright screen.. Bluetooth.. my own mp3 rings assignable to whoever calls (My wife's call says I LOVE YOU).. easy to use in both the EZ mode and advanced mode, etc. The only thing wrong is that it has low signal strength when on the fringes. Other phones have 2 bars when this one has none. But if you mainly are within a good cell signal, look at this phone seriously!

Why not allow the consumer to pick and choose which numbers to keep in her own phone book is a mystery to me.While the phone is touted as particularly usable for elderly people, the power plug is finicky and requires a lot of coordination to use correctly. In various parts of the interface, large font becomes tiny and hard to read.It's clear that Pantech is headed in the right direction, but they still have a way to go.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good, But Has 1 Annoying \"Feature\"", "Author": "TomH7259 \"TomH7259\"", "ReviewID": "RQ1IFBKK1LOZ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The things that I like best about this phone so far, are the large display, the large raised buttons. Also, the sound is very good, and the ringer seems to be very loud. That being said, this phone currently has a major drawback for me. The keypad light only stays on for abot 5 seconds. There is currently no way to change this light on time in the software. You can extend the time that the display screen is lighted, but not the keypad. For others this may not be a big issue, but for me, I am finding it very difficult to use the keypad in low light situations.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone! I LOVE everything about it!", "Author": "Just My Opinion", "ReviewID": "R2V5PAJ6TZ4HV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had many cell phones and bought dozens of them for a large family.  For the ADULTS, this is the best phone I have ever had! I don't text or use social groups so who needs a smart phone? This has nice large keys, 3 speed dial keys- see 1,2,3 buttons under display(you can program more)voice activated dialing, easy menu interface, I can't rave enough about it.  For a basic cell phone plan since this is not a \"smart\" phone, I was able to get internet access and email access for just $10 a month. With this phone I have everything Iphone users rave about for so much less. I am VERY happy with this phone. In fact, I will probably buy a few off ebay as interest and prices decline so that I have a spare in the future. Not a kid phone because it is not really text friendly, but if you use your phone to TALK, like old folks do, you won't be sorry you bought this one - if you use your phone to TALK this is THE ONE.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS PHONE!

I've had it for a year now and it is SO durable and dependable!I've dropped it too many times to count even on hard concrete and it did not harm this phone one bit! It's easy to use and the reception is wonderful. I love the large buttons and viewing screen. I'm also an avid texter and I appreciate the large buttons for texting purposes. The ONLY problem about this phone is when I try to pry open the cover for connecting the charger it is very difficult to open. I have to pry the connection slot open with the blade of a pocket knife or scissors! Still I would not trade this phone for any other.

Big buttons.Cons -1. Programs (games) and phone numbers you CAN'T delete.2. I can't crank this thing loud enough to hear people unless I'm in a quiet room.3. Phone must be centered very precisely over your ear or it sounds muffled.4. Perhaps I have a lemon, but this phone constantly dies and tells me I have no service.
