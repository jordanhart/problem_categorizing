Very littlle memory, applications that want to auto-update and run out of memory, once in a while it restarts on its own, and the camera is only marginally better than my kids Barbie cam.Here is why I like it anyway:1. It is the dirt-cheapest smart phone on the market, so you can just buy it, no saving for it, no financing it, no 'I had to get a contract cause I needed a new phone'. And if it falls into the lake, you are not out five hundred bucks.2. Since it is so cheap, there is no reason to get yourself into a two-year contract. You can simply shop for the best plan around and change it whenever you want to. No early termination fee either.3. It gets the job done. The most common apps like Google, Email, Facebook, Messages, Gallery, Map, Web Browser, Craigslist, eBay, News, and Online Banking work just fine. Just once in a while, you have to cleanup the data Facebook leaves behind to free up memory.4. Expensive phones are not necessarily better. I have several friends with fancy smart phones that have the same problems that the Concord has. So why pay more?Two must-have extras: An SD memory card for more storage space (apps, pictures). And a silicone protective case, so you can drop it safer.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Deventhsi", "ReviewID": "R1LRB3SPMBBI4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very sturdy phone.

I should've edited my review sooner, but better late than never, right?  Here goes:  This phone works okay if you need a replacement smartphone or if you don't plan on doing much, you may as well get a feature phone.  This phone runs out of memory a lot.  All I had to do was install iHeartRadio, Facebook & Dropbox and my phone is already telling me that the internal memory is low.  That's my biggest complaint with the phone.Old ReviewI bought this phone a few days ago because my old phone provider, Virgin Mobile, wasn't good in terms of coverage.  Sure, their pricing was okay, but I could hardly use my internet because I only got 1 bar at home, 3 to 5 in town if I'm lucky.  I was hardly able to use 3G in most places.  There was 3 areas where I could go to use 4G.  In either case of 3G or 4G, internet speeds were subpar at best and ping was a bit high as well.I decided to make the switch to T-Mobile.  I  had them once before, but with an iPhone 3G (at the time, I wasn't able to get 3G yet).  This phone is cheaper and certainly more features than the iPhone 3G.When I bought this phone, I went through the Walmart Family Plan deal.  For those of you wanting to do the same thing, be warned: T-Mobile/Wal-Mart does NOT provide you with a sim card.  You have to pay $25 ON TOP OF the service plan.  I didn't know this before buying the phone.  Even though I can get a discount through my work, I'd rather not pay that much just for a sim card if that's all it is and no credit towards the first month.  However, seeing as this is a T-Mobile phone (Wal-Mart Family Plan is covered by T-Mobile), I was able to get a hold of a temporary T-Mobile sim card and it worked.  I'm glad Wal-Mart decided not to block you from using a regular T-Mobile sim card to get you to use theirs.  I did see T-Mobile sim cards for $10 and that they still have a $30 unlimited text & data (first 5gb's of 4G) with 100 minutes for new activations.Internet:This phone does have 3G (1700/2100 band).  Living in a rural city, I get about 2 or 3mbps download speeds.  I tested this phone in two other cities.  One suburban area gave me about 4 mbps and the other area gave me an average of 5 to 6mbps.  I saw the Ping around 100 to 150MS with a decent signal.  I'm impressed by that for 3g.  I saw upload speeds around 1mbps to 2mbps.  If 3G is that fast, I can only imagine what 4G will be like when I go to upgrade to a 4G phone.  The one thing I did not know is that this phone also has a Mobile HotSpot feature.  That's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.  Last time I remember, it does cost $15 extra per month to use it.  Up to 8 devices can connect to this phone at one time for internet service.If you need to save your battery until you get a hold of a charger, there is an option to enable 2G only.  My speed tests shows I get about 100 to 300 kbps download & upload speeds in 2G mode.  However, 2G doesn't seem to work in some areas.  I went to a supermarket and 2G didn't show up inside or outside the building, leaving me with no internet.  Turning on 3G did the trick, but will burn through data faster if you're not already throttled (aka going over your data limit).Camera:T-Mobile/ZTE advertises that this phone contains a 2MP camera.  That is false information.  After looking in the camera settings, this phone takes 3MP pictures.  The photos come out okay, but I've used worse cameras for pictures.  The shutter is a bit slow, so make sure your target isn't moving until after the picture preview shows, or your subject will come out blurry.  The camera does not include Macro, which means it can't take photos up close (less than 70cm away).  The phone doesn't have flash either.The camera can record videos as well.  Like pictures, it's not the worst quality I've seen.  This phone records at a video resolution of 640x480 at up to 15 frames per second from what I've seen in my tests.  According to the quality setting mode, I can record 30 minutes at high quality or 10 minutes for YouTube.  At high quality, I believe it records at 1.5mbps.Memory:The one thing I highly dislike about this phone is that it has very low internal memory.  About 128mb's I believe.  At least a 4gb memory card was included.  I already ran out of memory once while trying to install an 8mb file, even after moving all the apps I could over to the SD card.  Turns out some apps were taking a lot of memory.I will update more later when I try the other features, such as the mobile hot spot.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First Smartphone", "Author": "Robert C. Hallden", "ReviewID": "R1GZWTCSDVH3IP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for under 100.00 at WalMart and I got the 2GB sim card which I of course had to pay extra for but it is worth it.  The phone so far to me has not let me down.  With the phone you get the unlimited web, talk, and text for 45.00. What I don't like is the web only has 250 mb of memory and in order to receive more memory you have to pay extra for 1GB which is 10.00/month and for 2GB is 20.00 I believe.  I only have had this phone for a few days and found out with this phone that it needs to be re-booted at least once a day or you will lose your ring tones like I did until I re-booted the phone.  I guess with any electronics you would have to do that.  But the phone is attractive and light make sure you get a case for it, probably for any phone as well to protect your investment. To me the phone is a learning experience with all the bells and whistles since my last phone was a flip phone that really did not have a lot of features.

My phone did have the same issue of freezing up and uncontrolled screen lock several times after updates.  It is caused by the internal flash memory.  The phone does have a small amount of internal memory for storage(only 512 MB and about 256 MB user accessible), whenever the internal storage memory has reached its capacity, it will shut off android OS service thus freeze up the phone.  Simply by moving your apps to flash storage card manually or installing few apps will solve this issue.Now as for the phone itself it is a very decent phone for starter.  Its hardware is outdated compared to modern phones, considering it is still running Android 2.x.  The processor is a bit slow and the screen has a rather slow refresh rate and not optimal for video streaming but it still renders very good photos and text.  The phone has an elegant design, along with its rubbery enclosure and small form factor, makes the phone very comfortable to hold.  It's interface is rather primitive and can only be compared to first generation smart phones, but I personally find it simple design less frustrating and rather easy to use.  For the past few months using this phone I was able to get pretty good reception on most of my calls and browsing 3G internet was a but sluggish mainly due to it slow processor and an outdated web browser.  But since I only use it to check news and highlights, it is tolerable.  Let me sum up all the pros and cons below and let you have a better grasps of this phone.ProsElegant design, small form factor, rubbery feel enclosureLong batter life(2-3)days of usage between chargeGood reception for callsGood build quality against dropsReliable3G Enhance speed 7.2 mbpsConsSlow processor, low memory capacity(only 512 MB)Screen could use better viewing angles, its slow refresh rate makes it not optimal for videoObsolete OS, it is running Android 2.37 and won't support modern appsSmall internal storage capacity, user can only use 256 MB of the storage.

The manufacturer was helpful, and identified it as defective, but said I had to go through TMobile to get it repaired under warranty.  This took multiple contacts with TMobile who wanted me to talk to everyone else but themselves.  Also had requested an unlock code at this point which met their requirements.  They said it would wouldn't be an issue getting a replacement unlock code.  Just like the warranty, getting a replacement code was a hassle.  Contrary to my understanding from multiple chats with a supervisor and agents, Tmobile imposed new time constraints because they replaced the original new handset with a refurbished one with what appeared to be an older serial number.  They repeatedly failed to issue one the unlock code.  When I finally did get a code - it appeared to be for a different IMEI number - but they said it was basically the same as my number and would still work.  I still can't unlock the phone.  Possibly the refurb they sent me was no good as well.Another seeming defect:  On all three of these that I own for my family, sometimes the unit will not respond to the touch screen (you can't unlock the screen by pressing the circle ... nothing happens).  FIX: the only way I found to fix this is to remove the battery, because the power button won't function either - so no orderly shutdown - just pull the battery, wait, and reinsert it, then turn it on and wait for boot again. Meanwhile, hope you weren't expecting an important call.Save yourself some time, and skip Tmobile branded phones.

I got it from shopcelldeals. Web browsing and memory intensive apps are a little bit slow, but for $50 it's perfect for occasional use. If you are going to be using apps or internet all the time, you should invest the extra money in something faster, but this is perfect for looking things up on the go. It can be tough to select links in small font when browsing, but that may be correctable by changing zoom or using a stylus. Try to write your apps to the  micro SD card to save processing space, and you really should have a micro SD card to make up for the minimal memory capacity. I was reluctant to leave my physical qwerty keyboard, but the swipe to text keyboard is faster once you get used to it, but you do need to proofread for typos when it occasionally guesses wrong. Camera, voice recorder, microphone, and touchscreen perform well with no issues except the two glitches.Glitches: I've heard that it will freeze up or shut off when the memory capabilities are overloaded, though I haven't experienced that, and it is apparently fixed by using an SD card for the majority of the storage. However, the touchscreen has completely failed to respond on three or so times in the 6 weeks I've had it, so I was unable to select the power down option, and had to pull the battery. It restarted and worked fine. I am using a screen protector, but I don't think that made a difference in responsiveness.I'm using this case, and it was unaffected after falling ~5 feet onto hardwood floors, though the phone is inexpensive enough that a nice case may be unneccesary. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4R5EW2/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I have a question", "Author": "Shelby Dismuke", "ReviewID": "R77DUF0QAQRYZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this phone, but have any of you figured out how to turn the camera around so that you can take selfies lol", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I think we got a lemon", "Author": "AustinGal", "ReviewID": "R3JX8GSQLVV044", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone locks up when battery drops below half.

Once I located the spec sheet that included the wifi calling support detail, I see that it confirms that this phone doesn't have tmobile UMA wifi calling.The amazon description should clearly state this since it does state it has wifi, and virtually all phones with wifi support tmobile wifi calling.I can easily imagine the screen being quite fragile, which is evidenced by all the cracked screen ones that show up on ebay.Overall, a nice inexpensive simple starter smart phone for those who don't want wifi calling (a HUGE benefit of free calling (doesn't even use plan minutes) when traveling overseas) and prefer to put a board to their face instead of a REAL cell phone (flip phone).  <g>  I don't!, but the Blackberry 8220 flipphone drops wifi calls regularly (tried several with different o/s versions) and is much slower navigation and browsing.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done.", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "RXP5OE7EVVSTP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is a \"you get what you pay for deal.\" I have never gone above a flip phone until this because I have issues with touch screens (and fat fingers), but that wasn't the issue I had with this phone.Pros: Very comfortable without a case  Downloads apps easily  Works well for users like myself who just upgraded  Easy user interface  Price is low for Android phone  Comes with a 4GB memory card  Camera is decent quality  Has 5 home screens to save shortcutsCons: Gets bulky with any case, and cases are hard to find (I have only found them on Amazon)  Touch screen cuts off occasionally (mine and my wife's phone both had this problem), have to take the battery out to restart  Phone memory is fairly low, and almost every app has to be loaded to phone before it can be moved to SD card  Gets stuck on a tower and has to be restarted to do anything that requires network  Fairly flimsy compared to my previous phones; get a shield!

If you need a lot apps, do NOT buy this phone.3. USB connection have bugs, my Mac can not read with USB connection.
