One of our employees purchased the phone and put it through its paces. Performs extremely well and is completely water tight. The thing people do need to realize though is this. This phone is rated for up to 6ft of submerssion for up to 30 minutes. Any longer than this, and you risk water damage.To make the phone water tight, after the back is snapped into place on the phone, you have to press firmly right under where the camera openings are. You'll hear a pop in the middle. When you hear that, and only after you hear that, is the phone water tight. 90% of the water issues people are having most likely could be avoided by either the carrier remembering to press there firmly or the associate informint the customer. Make sure you're pressing there if you plan on exposing this phone to water, and please do NOT go scuba diving with it. Not desiged for that length of submerssion.Hope this helps when making a decision on whether or not to purchase the phone!", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tips to ensure you phone stays waterproof; painful warranty", "Author": "R Gibbons", "ReviewID": "R95OSDI1TAOA1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have both the S4 and S4 active, The Active is only a tiny bit larger, but doesn't support the flip shield on the front. They are both very nice phones.If you are interested in Warranty experience, see note on painful service at end.AT&T; offers a one-time-replacement for water damage, as of Aug 7 2013.There are a few things to do, to help your phone not be damaged by water, (based on instructions for my Panasonic underwater camera).1) The seals on the back must be perfectly clean before closing it up. My underwater camera comes with a brush to ensure no hair, sand, lint, dust... is on the seal before closing. A dirty seal can allow water to enter at that spot.2) Don't jump in water or swim with phone in hand (better to slowly wade in, with phone in pocket). The water pressure is Much greater than 1 meter submersion, when you have a sudden gush of water during a dive or jump, (same goes for being hit by a wave, or under a hose/faucet).3) Don't open the back up, till the unit has been rinsed in clean fresh water (so hard salt crystals or mud don't form near seal), wiped off dry on the outside, and air dried for an about an hour. (You will notice that the seal only covers half of the back of the phone, the other half can hold drops of water, that once opened, can drip and turn the white H2O indicator red, and void the warranty).4) Don't depend on the phone actually lasting 30 minutes 1 meter under water in the future, Seals wear, and degrade with age. (In a few years you may only have 10 minutes at foot under water, depending on wear).5) Don't show off the phone's water resistance more than necessary, There are occasional manufacturing defects, that are hard to test for submersion. Use the phone for the minimum time and depth needed for a picture. I plan to use mine mostly in the rain, (and my underwater Panasonic camera, rated at 12 meters for 2 hours for most underwater pictures); Or maybe a few drops of sweat when exercising with music.6) Don't forget to seal the USB port very well. It doesn't snap closed easily, needs to be slid to the side while pressing in for complete closure.  The USB seal will wear quickly since it is opened daily, and easily pops open.I'm also content with the phone cases I bought:  The belt clip case (Black Horizontal Leather Pouch Carrying Case Holster with Belt Clip and Loops for Samsung Galaxy Note S4 Cell Phone) is large enough to fit the both the S4 Active with the thin TPU protective case (TUDIA Ultra Slim Melody Series TPU Protective Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 Active I9295 (Blue)) for extra drop protection.Edit after owning phone 10 months, reduce from 5 stars to 3 stars:POOR WARRANTY SERVICE:  The USB Cover tether became disconnected.  I called Samsung, they said it would be a warranty repair, Neither AT&T; nor Samsung would provide a loaner during the repair. After a week, The repair was put on hold, waiting for payment of $160 for LCD screen & Touch pad (even though both are in perfect condition).  Samsung said the warranty does not cover a replacement LCD, and they would have to replace it as part of their repair to get to the USB port underneath the LCD. This stinks, Customer should not be charged for warranty repair, for parts the repairman needs to break in order to save time on the repair. Calls to Samsung repair center lead nowhere. Email to the \"office of the president\" [President@sta.samsung.com] resulted in a free repair, but took several hours of my time.Russ G.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone That Works", "Author": "William Ayers", "ReviewID": "R1ZKPFSJ45UFPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm deployed to Afghanistan, and was worried about the dust.  I knew I wanted an Android phone, so I did my research.  After learning that Samsung made a water/dust proof Galaxy phone, I figured I had to give it a try (as I wanted an S4, and thought this was the best of both worlds).  I was a little nervous about the screen, as this phone has a TFT LCD (where as the Flagship S4 has an OLED screen), but so far I haven't had any issues.  In fact, as I was researching this phone to make sure it was the best choice for my needs, I read that the TFT LCDs are actually better for outside use (as they don't get as washed out by the sun - something I was concerned about), and so far I haven't had any issues viewing the screen outdoors (even in direct sunlight).I would absolutely recommend this phone for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, but still want's a smartphone.  My only complaint about this phone is that I can't use a lot of the really cool add-on's/accessories that are available for the S4 (such as Qi wireless charging, or the flip cover that shows the time through a window on the front, etc...)  Other than that minor qualm, I've been extremely satisfied with this phone.P.S. - Yes, I've tested the \"waterproof-ness\" of this phone, and it works like a champion - just make sure you do what the directions say and verify that the back is completely on (being mindful of the clip/latch under the camera on the back).", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "S4", "Author": "Heather \"Heather D.

Although pretty pricey it is literally a \"Smart\" phone. The phone may be a little bit bulkier than the other phones in the past, it is life proof, literally. When I purchased the phone the first thing I did was test it to see if it could last in water. I poured water straight into the sound output then played music straight after, and the sound quality was perfect. Another test I tried was to put the phone in a cup of water and let it sit for 30 seconds. After I took it out I opened the back and saw just a little bit of water in there, but I was still able to turn the phone on and off smoothly. This phone literally blew me away and I will continue to use it for a very long time.

In other words, we thought we could use it and if it got wet no problem. Turns out it's not water resistant really..It got wet in the pool and got water in it. When we tried to swap it out at the store we bought it at, they said they couldn't take it back bc it was water damaged. Then, I called ATT, they too were surprised that it got water damaged but also would not warranty replace it. 0 for 2. I called Samsung, they told me that they will look at it and if the technician deems that it has excessive water damage, they will not replace/repair it. FYI, the warranty says the phone is not covered for water damage even though the thing is supposed to be water resistant. Also, I looked up a bunch of other reviews and lots of people are saying the same thing. Samsung told me that they have been getting a lot of calls about this same issue. If I can save you the heartache of going through what I am, then that's great. Phone looks great, loved it but it's useless now. It's no more water resistant than a piece of paper towel under a running faucet.

I play Real Racing 3 and it performs fantastic, the only issue is when I got some apps opened in background, those slows it but it's normal, just be sure there are no more than 4 apps opened when playing this kind of games.So most of the time it performs fast and smooth.I really like the camera even if it has less pixels than the S4. It's very good! Take pictures underwater is not the reason why I bought it, but tried as it's water resistant. Went to my friend's house and took some pics of her huge aquarium. The results were amazing! The only issue is that water penetrates where goes the headphones and then if you try to call, the phone gets confused and thinks there are headphones plugged in; so you cannot talk properly. In my case, I were able to listen to the other person well but when talking that person were not able to listen to me. So the best thing to do is to wait for about 5 hours or more to talk properly (Resolved this by using the speaker).I found that this is normal concerning this device so it's ok.Battery life is ok, not great but it handles the day. If you want it to last the entire day, then don't play games,don't connect to wi/fi and do not download too much things.The sound is great and the screen is amazing, just when you are in outdoors it gets too dark and it gets difficult to look at the screen. Mostly when it's sunny or too lighted but it's ok, not big deal.Add that it comes with the \"torch light\". A gadget to use the led at the back to illuminate in the dark. I found that helpful.I like this phone and I recommend it.No problems to me going into the humid woods of Costa Rica as it's water resistant.

So we tried to return it and the store gave us trouble about putting it underwater even though none of the water damage indicators are set off.

I compared it to my friend using an iPhone 5 and the i5 was by far better. Especially at night. Under night conditions the camera is TERRIBLE. Either too dark, or when there are lights, the lights are way too bright.Software - Touchwiz UI is slow and poor at multitasking. Too much Samsung bloatware!

I can get all of my music and movies on the card, but the movies don't play and the music will suddenly disappear from the phone... no kidding!  I had 32 Gb of music on the phone and the next morning it was down to 3.2Gb, the rest of it just disappeared from the card!  I reloaded and lost the music about 20 times on several different brands of SD cards proving that the issue is with the phone.  You can put movies and music on the internal memory and that works fine but you only have 8 Gig to use.  Also, you cannot move Apps to the SD card.I thought initially I had a bad SD card... but then after trying 6 different cards, I googled the issue and found that its a very common problem with the phone that Samsung has yet to acknowledge.The other features like Smart Screen and Air View are cool, but they don't work consistently and are pretty much useless so I turned them off.  I had smart screen on and my movies would p+ause even if I didn't look away - that gets really annoying after a few minutes so much of this technology sounds great, but not practical as it is still buggy.One final thing; I dropped the phone off the table and now the corner is bent, this phone is not very sturdy so be careful.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "no USA adapter", "Author": "leo", "ReviewID": "RPP6Z0PNAVFIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had no adapter to charge it here in the USA....no problem if I was going to take it to europe but im not :(", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "everything is perfect besides echo during calls", "Author": "newS4activeowner", "ReviewID": "R349CKD2AT2VL2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi, I just ordered the Samsung Galaxy S4 active from mercate group.
