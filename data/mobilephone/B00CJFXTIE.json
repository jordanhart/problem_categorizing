It's simple to use if you've had a 'dumb' phone before.  I don't like predictive text so it's fine to send old fashioned text messages (90% of what I use it for).  The alarm is LOUD and that's good.

When I got to Europe I bought another SIM - still wouldn't work - then went back to the store and bought yet another SIM - wouldn't work - and I realized it had to be the phone, which clearly can't be unlocked although it says that it is.  I bought another phone from the store and was able to use the SIM without a problem.  This cost me two days of non-connectivity and a lot of time running back to the store, as well as the cost of another phone and a second SIM I didn't need.  I wanted to return this phone but can't since I'm unable to find the charger that came with it - probably left in a hotel room while I was still trying to get the thing to work.  I'm annoyed at the monetary cost, but more annoyed buy the time and effort wasted.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "Cellular Band - Quad-Band 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 Mhz", "Name": "BLU Aria T174 Black Blue Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Bar Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X2eK4y6SL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CJFXTIE"}}
