{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Voyager- almost three years later...", "Author": "A. Gift For You \"GradStu\"", "ReviewID": "RDMARHCX42QF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this exact model since May, 2009 and just last week it finally stopped charging properly, though it still works.  Although it isn't a smartphone, it does have internet capabilities (very slow, I might add), and you need not be in a hot-spot zone (if that's the correct lingo!) to use the internet.  The inside qwerty keyboard is large (which I love), and I have yet to find a phone similar now that I want a smart phone.  I've just ordered another one of these phones (awaiting its arrival), just to serve out the remainder of the two year agreement I have with Verizon. Since the phone was working well when my upgrade came available, I opted instead to get a Samsung tablet (which I dropped, it cracked, and now it doesn't work!!!) I've no complaints about this phone, and just transferred all my photos and videos from it onto a micro card just in case it (my current phone) goes completely dead.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Lg Voyager Vx10000", "ReviewID": "R3Q3Z81H1NDD2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really wasn't sure to expect, being a used phone. It turned out to be great. The price was reasonable to! I love this phone and it does not require a data package for Verizon Wireless.

All in all this phone met my expectations.  The touch screen freezes from time to time but corrects itself.  There was only one flaw in this phone that bothered me, they inside keyboard lights dont light up and it makes a beepying noise.  I however cannot expect this phone to be perfect as it is a refurbished phone and not brand new.  It works great for the things I need it to do such as call and message.  Every feature that is availiable works.  For a refurbished phone this is about as good as it gets.  The battery on it holds a pretty good charge as well.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as desribed.", "Author": "Stacy", "ReviewID": "R3HNI5MVNBK4G9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the phone on time. But I received it nt as described. It said that it was used but in very good condition. That is not how it came.

The only problem is that, after a year of use, the connections in the flip start to come apart, and the phone stops working. Only good if you need the phone to last you a year or so.

For the most part this phone will do the job texting and calling. audio clear and loud.  Did have a problem with no display but from that I could press on a edge of the phone and the display returns. I did not have to press to many times working fine except for the battery. Battery got where it would not hold a charge, ordered replacement battery found out after a week of use the battery was not a Motorola type and would not work. New battery cost as much as the phone.
