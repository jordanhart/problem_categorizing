Hoover", "ReviewID": "R8QGBKADICHO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have studied this phone for at least 2 months before I decided that this was the phone for me. So, I did some research on the price of this phone & discovered that AT&T; wanted $450.00 for this phone. And now they are wanting $489.00 for this same phone. I also looked on E-Bay for this phone, however, someone always out bid me right at the last second of auctions end. So, I decided to check out Amazon. What a relief, I was so happy to find this phone at a reasonable price, that I did not hesitate to purchase this phone from Amazon. The phone was purchased through Amazon from a store called Cell Source. What a deal. I am so happy that this phone is living up to my expectations. Anyone, who is looking for this phone, ALL I CAN SAY IS: BUY IT, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT YOU CAN GO WRONG. Thank you so very kindly, Mr. Donnie C.

I am always on my boat in the salt water and this thing is a tank.  Sand, salt water spray, dropping it on the deck...not a problem.I did notice a few weaknesses though.- The touch screen won't work very well when your hands are wet.- Don't charge it anywhere near salt water.  I killed one when a drop got on the contacts and it almost immediately rusted out.- Don't drop it into 50' of salt water while using the flash light at night.  This will also cost you all of your pictures and contacts...I'm going to try the S4 Active now and I'm sure it will be even better.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone & Seller are awesome", "Author": "mikefle", "ReviewID": "R3KMCY138OF7DY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The sellers' description and customer service were outstanding.The phone itself was unlocked - so was able to use it on T-Mobile with no issue using their 4g network..It feels very comfortable from a size perspective - the built in protective cover feels very secure - but since my young son is carrying it - we went ahead and added an extra level of protection with an otter box - so hopefully with both the phone will be protected..", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugged phone, enjoyable to use", "Author": "snowyghostowl \"snowyghostowl\"", "ReviewID": "R2TJ9EINN4GXEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in Alaska and like to be out in the rain and mud for recreation. I also have four small children who play games on my phone, and I'm a gadget enthusiast who enjoys a well-functioning device. I wanted a phone that would work at least as well as my Asus/Google Nexus 7, and I was pleasantly surprised by the Rugby Pro. After disabling all of AT&T; and Samsung's bloatware and installing AT&T;'s updated firmware, it is a very usable Android device. It is also tough enough that I don't worry if it gets dropped or grimy in the rain. I liked it so much that we got another for my wife. I don't know why most phones are made so fragile. For me, this one is tough enough for daily carry and powerful enough to enjoy using.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Rules!!", "Author": "Reaper01", "ReviewID": "R2UNAO9OR5I2DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, bought it to replace my galaxy note that got coffee on it.

It would be really cool if this could make it through the cold cycle on our washing machine, but I'm not gonna hold my breath!The Bad:Mine arrived with a spot the size of a pencil eraser on the glass that was heavily scratched as though someone had deliberately removed a mark the size of a logo...yet there were also logos on it, so I have no idea what the reason for that was.  Perhaps a prior user had engraved his initials into the glass and they were obliterated by the seller?  I don't know.  It was in the far upper right corner though, not obscuring anything in the main screen area.It was difficult to properly close the back after I swapped the SD Card and SIM.  I'd think I had it, but one little plastic tab along the edge would be open, I'd push that into place and another would pop out.  The screw lock thing that is supposed to lock it down turns very easily and feels like it could accidentally move to the open position just from jostling in normal use.  Aside from the fact that if one of the port covers should ever break, the waterproof dustproof etc. feature will be shot, I question whether the back of the thing in its closed position (as best as I could get it) will fulfill that promise either.  I'm not a beginner when it comes to gadgets, I've never had a phone's back panel be quite this irritating to attempt to properly close.The screen does not look as nice (resolution) as the other phone I bought for my other child, which was an HTC in a similar price range.  However, this phone has 5 homescreens for apps and such, whereas the HTC has only 3.All this being said...I put a case on it to make it just a bit tougher, what with my concerns about the back and all.  The case happens to also obscure the scratch spot on the glass more or less.  But with a case, this phone becomes a big, clunky heavy brick-feeling monstrosity of an object.  So the bad news is my son can't carry it in his pants pocket like he wants to, but the good news is...that my son can't carry it in his pants pocket and forget and leave it there when those pants go into the wash, so my wondering about whether it would survive what killed one of his former phones...is probably a non-issue.TL;DR version:  My mind is NOT blown.  There are better phones out there.  But it'll do.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Ryan P. \"JPjunkie\"", "ReviewID": "R3W0IDCI9X806U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Very durable! I've dropped it many times with no damage.Water Proof. I can use in the rain and in the shower!They got rid of that absolutely stupid \"search\" button on the bottom of the phone and leave you with the 3 that you actually use.Setting the \"quick launch\" button or whatever it's called to bring up the camera when pressed is extremely useful.Cons:Screen could be a little brighter (I also have a screen protector on, but still...)Many USB charger cords do not work with this phone. Due to the design of the water proofing the port is deep inside the phone and larger USB cords will not fit.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "thanks good phone", "Author": "Stephen R.", "ReviewID": "R451E8CPEG3ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have hade the rugby flip phone for the past two yrs but this is my first smart phone.

I have thrown ,dropped, submerged, and run over both of mine. The only thing I have found that this phone cant handle is being ran over. Its main vulnerability is it screen which is glass but it is still tough none the less. Other than running over the thing its about as rugged as they come in the smart phone world. I work as a park ranger so it has really taken some abuse without a problem. My last one I had for a year and a half and never having any problem other than I had to order a new battery after 15 months of abuse because it would no longer charge completely. I will definitely be buying another one as soon as possible it meets my every expectation in ruggedness, and surpassed my expectations in functionality it takes better pictures than my girlfriends Galaxys4 and all of my friends Iphones.  The two I have had are both now in smart phone heaven losing both to being run over by a car.  Only improvement that I could find needed is replacing the glass screens with something more durable.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Recommended for kids tough on phones", "Author": "pkg40", "ReviewID": "R2W53PDVZFLZS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I now have bought one for each of my 18+ year old kids.

I poured the very small amount of the liquid on it just a couple of times and it stopped being able to charge. I removed the back cover and everything including the battery was wet. I removed the battery and let it dry, and it worked well after having dried for a few weeks. After that, it won't change at all and I feel I need to do something with its USB socket.I don't recommend it to anyone seeking a warerproof phone.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Smartphone", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R30P6UNSM62DD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've gone swimming with this phone in the ocean for about 20 minutes when I forgot it was in the velcro pocket.

The case has never cracked, but dropping it countless times on the way to class (yes people still walk places) listening to music, only the case has been scratched, but not enough to order a replacement case quite yet. I'm also a power lifter, and this phone used to see a few 100 lb dumbbells every now and then. NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.
