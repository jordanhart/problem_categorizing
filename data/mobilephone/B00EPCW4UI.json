I love the phone and shipping speed was great.It has been three days now phone works great had issues with internet. When you get byop card from straight talk istructions tell you to set up an apn in your phone. Well I have no cell service at my house so I tried setting it up by hand. DON\"T wait until you get message from straight talk download the app via wifi and follow those instruction. You must still enter by hand on this phone as it has android 4.2.2 installed and will not accept automatic app text placement in apn areas. Once you have the instructions entered internet works fine. I have yet to try mms messaging and I hear it may not work will update later.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EPCW4UI"}}
