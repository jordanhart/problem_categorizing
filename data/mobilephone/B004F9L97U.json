I only paid $35 for it way below the market price of $150. It is a very difficult phone to operate, I would recommend this phone for people who are smartphone advance users, and for people who have to take their work home. I have not fiqured out how to do half the things the phone is capable of doing, but it is a very attractive sleek phone. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small smart phone", "Author": "A.

The touch screen is quite defective, and everything freezes as often as twice in one minute. I have to keep taking out the battery and replacing it every time it freezes. Also, the battery itself will not hold a charge. The software is also out of date and won't work with my phone or my computer. Generally, it's awful.The seller hasn't responded to me even though I sent them a return request. Very unsatisfied.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost threw it away until I learned some things...", "Author": "JetJagger", "ReviewID": "R6JFS83ROAOC3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I purchased this phone, I was talked into it by the retail clerk.  She said \"Windows Phone\", and I said, \"Ugh, I'll try it.\"  Little did I know these things...1. The OS is Windows 6.1 from 2009 (aka, PocketPC). Windows 8 is the current version as of this writing.Doesn't matter to me.  It is still a \"smartphone\".2. It has a only has 400MHz processor.Fine if you aren't gaming or watching too much video.  I don't game, and rarely watch videos on my phone, but I can still multitask.3. It comes BARE-BONES.In other words, you are going to have to install your butt off.  A lot of the features that come with smartphones today need to be installed on this phone.  For example, you need to install a YouTube viewer, a better media player, screen capture software, QR software, etc.Understand, this phone is FULLY capable of doing what other \"low-end\" smart phones can do, but you just need to hunt for the apps.4. It is not intuitive or very customizable...in the beginning.Windows 6.1 is a fair attempt at offering a good \"out of the box\" experience, but you aren't going to have much of an ability to customize the phone until you find and install 'home screen customization apps'.  Personally, I tried several apps and actually like the default home screen best.5. On-board memory is minimal.Purchase a 32MB MicroSD card.  You'll be glad you did.6. Because this phone is from 2008 (and is an HTC), you will need to purchase an HTC headset with a Mini USB connector...NOT a \"Micro USB\", and certainly not a 3.5mm headset.The phone DOES come with an adapter for a 2.5mm headset, but all I had were 3.5mm from previous phones.  I purchased an aftermarket adapter that works with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and Mini USB for about $6, and it works great.You will think the phone isn't capable of doing certain things you'd expect from a smartphone right out of the box, and you'd be correct.  But, it will do NEARLY everything any other smartphone can do if you install the apps.As far as the look and feel, I like it.  It is different than the usual \"black box\" and has a \"classy\" look to it while feeling great in my hand.  It definitely isn't the 'end-all, be-all' smartphone, but that's not what I was after anyway.  I only spent $70 on the phone, so I'm happy with it.Phone call quality is normal.So, is owning this phone more trouble than it is worth?  Not really.  Among all of the black boxes our there, my phone is unique.  Among all of the Androids and iPhones, my phone is unique.  Maybe that will be worth something to you, too...then again, maybe it won't be.I enjoy using this phone the more I get used to it, and I don't regret my purchase...now.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love phone very much, won't stay charged.", "Author": "Blues Lady \"New RV'er from Maine to FLORIDA f...", "ReviewID": "R1NBKONBAH7O2N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone is awesome! Unfortunatly, after about a month the thing stopped working.  Would not stay charged.  I then purchchased a new battery, to no avail.  After a week, the problems started all over again.  Which leads me to belive that it's the phone.  Unfortunatly my purchase is beyond the 90 days return.  I think the dealer should acknowledage the purchase price, as the problems did not occur day one.  I am very upset at having to spend more money for the battery.  I might have been better off to throw the $$$ in the toilet!!!!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "k6900", "ReviewID": "RX8X0H42FTQYF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I always wanted this phone and I'm really glad I purchased it.
