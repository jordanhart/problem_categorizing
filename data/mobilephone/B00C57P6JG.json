{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia Tablet Z WITH 3G/4G LTE capabilities", "Author": "Ki Lee", "ReviewID": "RFEULTPNAAKNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is living up to what most folks are saying. It is a reliable tablet with the additional functionality of having 3G/4G connectivity as long as you are willing to register and pay for the 4G service with a provider. My purchased Xperia tablet Z has WiFi AND the option of the 3G/4G service which is currently not available in the US model. It is very sleek and lighter than any of the other 10.1\" tablets I've tried. It is on a Android platform and works very well. There are limitations such as not having Adobe Flash plugins, but that would be across the board with all current tablets on the market. It comes standard with 16GB for storage. However, I've purchased a 64GB micro SD and it functions well. The sound quality is not as good as the Apple iPad. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEWARE - 'unlocked' is a relative term for this tablet (at least in US)", "Author": "CAconsumer", "ReviewID": "R2WBA6RS88F8HY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, let me be clear that if you want a WiFi only version of this tablet, BUY IT! This tablet is better than the iPad, Galaxy Note / Tab, Nexus, ...etc tablets out there. It is a work of beauty! It was sculpted :) Essentially as light as an iPad Air, better processor, better cameras, more RAM, thinner, waterproof, less expensive, and on & on...However, if you want to buy Wi-Fi COMBINED with the cellular enabled technology, there are some issues you need to know. Since they sell this cellular enabled model in the US, I was disappointed to discover wasn't truly 'unlocked' in the US. I purchased this tablet and then went to a Verizon store to purchase a SIM card & set up a month to month broadband account. Try as they could, Verizon could not push the model / codes through their system (for over an hour). Their system wouldn't recognize the tablet (IMEI#). In the end, they told me they couldn't help me so I went to a nearby AT&T; store. In total, I spent 5 hours in the AT&T; store while they went though the same process Verizon did. AT&T; personnel even tried 'dummy' IMEI #'s, 2 SIM cards but no luck. The tablet would display internet bars but no 'LTE' indicator meaning it wasn't receiving data. One of the technicians even put his personal AT&T; SIM card from his cell phone into the tablet and that didn't even work. In the end, they told me the same thing Verizon did. So I returned the tablet to Sony and explained to them what I had tried. One of the Sony associates pulled out a T-Mobile SIM card from his cell phone and inserted it into the tablet. Lo & behold, it worked! He told me the tablet 'sometimes' works with AT&T; service and 'sometimes' it doesn't. What is that supposed to mean?? He asked if I wanted to take the tablet around the corner from their store to a T-Mobile store to sign up for a data plan with them, but T-Mobile wasn't a good provider for where I live, so I just asked for my refund.Evidently, at least so far, the 'unlocked' tablet will only work with T-Mobile. I was really disappointed because I really wanted to keep the tablet but I need a broadband option with a tablet. I have purchased many great, lasting products with Sony but they really need to go back to the drawing board with this one and refine it to make it a truly 'unlocked' tablet (or make 1 or 2 models specifically with AT&T;, Verizon, or Sprint broadband technology in them - like iPad). Better luck next time, Sony. If anyone has any suggestions or experience in how to get this tablet to sync with AT&T; or Verizon networks, PLEASE PLEASE reply to this post. This model would be flying off the shelves......", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Evelyne", "ReviewID": "R2WVMB322PXHUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since i received my tablet Z I cant take my hands off it.I love every bit of it apart from the battery life which I had researched and knew it was not all that.
