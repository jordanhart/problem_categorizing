I was averaging about 8 hours of low usage, which meant the phone would be dead before I got home at night. The 2.1 update (that took an extremely long time) made this somewhat better, but Sony has shown that they are terrible at rolling out updates at a reasonable pace.That actual deal breaker is a problem with the USB connection. Forums online have shown that it fails after 4-6 months, and I too have had this problem. While some people are successfully having it covered under the warranty, not all are. And the warranty is only a year long, so there is almost no chance this phone will survive the entire length of a 2 year contract. I'm hoping that SE comes up with a remedy for this fault, but I won't count on it.

Nominally the specs were high end with a 4-inch 480 x 854 pixels display and 1Ghz processor. With initial retail (non-carrier \"subsidized\") of $600-$700, it was certainly priced as such. But in reality it only supports 65K colors (like computers from 15 years back) and performance was horrible with unacceptable user responsiveness. Incompetent designers and developers at Sony saddled what should have a marque product with buggy low performance. Hey ... let's put in Timescape so you when touch the screen it won't respond till 1/4 or half second later. Also smooth scrolling is so boring let's make the UI move in fits and starts with random stops in between.Prospective buyers can search for reviews on websites. I am not the only person unimpressed. I knew all this beforehand, but I bought it anyway. There were several reasons for this. Poor reception in the marketplace and introduction of new Xperia 2011 models means the X10 is now selling for a substantial discount to the introductory price. I also bought a Amazon-Warehouse highly discounted used, like new unit. Furthermore there seemed to be some improvement due to Android 2.1 update. By Q3-2010, there should be an Android 2.3 update, hopefully with more improvements.This particular model is sold as an unlocked international X10i (as opposed to American X10a). It has GSM 850/900/1800/1900 and UMTS/HSPA 900/1700/2100 frequencies. What this means is it will work fine for voice calls and 2G data just about anywhere in the world that has GSM carriers. It will work with 3G in most parts of the world outside the USA. In the USA, it will work with T-Mobile 3G, but will not work with AT&T; 3G (unless you get the X10a model). Unlocked means you can put in any SIM card you want without some evil carrier preventing you from using something you bought and paid for.The phone comes with a very large choice of UI menu languages including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Greek, some Eastern Euro (Czech, Polish, ... etc.), Bahasa Indonesian, Malaysian, Chinese Traditional & Simplified, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, some Arabic languages, plus others I cannot recognize. THANK YOU, THANK YOU Sony for realizing there is a large world out there aside from English.So the GREAT language support, SIM unlocked, and 3G for international as well as USA T-mobile was the reason I bought the phone. There aren't that many models on the market that can meet these criteria. The Samsung Nexus S is one such.The model I received was actually a unit destined for Germany. But that doesn't matter as you can set the Language to be any of the large number of supported ones. Included in the box were phone, battery, 3.5mm jack/handsfree, Sony earphones, USB charging/data cable, USB charger with European prongs, European to US prong adapter, two plastic screen protectors, and a soft case.The USB wall charger is of course dual-voltage (100-240 VAC, 50-60Hz) and puts out 5 VDC 850 mA. This is more than a typical computer USB-2 port which puts out 500 mA. So charging with the USB cable plugged into the wall adapter is much faster than charging from a computer USB port.The boxy squarish design is quite unimaginative. More importantly the square corners with wedge shaped edges comes together as a sharp point with the fatal habit of painfully digging into the palm of the hand, especially when one reaches the thumb across the screen for UI touches. On my unit the flimsy plastic back cover does not snap on tightly to the chassis. It moves and creaks when handling the phone conveying a strong sense of cheap inept design. The top edge is a glossy piano black finish that reeks of tacky.________Update 2011-07-29:Sony has now released Android 2.3.2 for this phone. Be aware that if you have a carrier branded version, the update may not be available as you are at the mercy of your carrier. The UI does feel substantially faster and snappier. Practically speaking all the \"slowness\" problems have disappeared. Timescape no longer supports Email notifications. The dominant theme of the UI seems to be light gray on dim gray in order to diminish contrast so as to make sure the user has trouble seeing it, especially outdoors. If the phone is in flight mode and you ever try to access the \"Contacts\" (for off-line composing or just for info) the stupid thing will prompt you to import contacts, again, and again, and again, every time you access \"Contacts\". You still only get the crummy 65,000 colors that was standard for two decades ago.I tried playing some games that requires fast touch input and found that the touch screen response has a lag of one-several tenths of a second, which rendered fast pace games like Fruit Ninja unusable. This was verified with a handwriting recognition input keyboard that shows the strokes as you draw them. The lag is quite noticeable.For the good news, WiFi tethering now has built-in support due to Android 2.3. That's much easier than dealing with usb modems and drivers, but power drain will be high.I also have a Samsung GT-5830 (Galaxy Ace) which is considered a mid-range phone. In just about all design aspects, it just runs rings around this piece of crud. The Samsung display is far superior in terms of brightness, contrast, and power drain (although it is lower resolution). Icons are designed with good easily visible colors, and prominent appearance that give useful and tasteful info at a glance. Capacitive soft buttons for \"menu\" and \"back\" are much easier to use than the poorly placed hard buttons of the Xperia line. The Samsung Ace has a nice sliding door for the USB as opposed to a tacky rubber plug; microSD card is hot swappable without removing back cover, fit and finish is far superior.On the Samsung when the phone wake from power saver, it takes only a few seconds to reconnect to the WiFi. For the Sony X10i, it can take as long as 10-30 seconds, under the same circumstances and with the same WiFi access point. In fact often times the Sony will not reconnect at all even though it claims to have found all the access points in the scan. You have to turn off the WiFi and turn it on again, and wait wait wait.The X10i music player will burp whenever the screen rotates. One would think a 1Ghz processor could play music smoothly with competent engineering. In fact, it sometimes glitches for no apparent reason. I have all accounts and sync stuff turned off. This is really pathetic from the company that invented the Walkman and owns a music label.The X10i email client is broken with IMAP accounts. IMAP email does not allow access to all the folders available on the mail server. It does not properly cache downloaded emails. It will often lose sync with the IMAP server and previously downloaded headers disappear, requiring a time consuming and unreliable complete refresh of all messages. The client does not offer any option to move messages from one folder to another. In essence, it is nonfunctional.Using the same microSD card, the Samsung can write files transferred from a computer at over 10MB/sec whereas the Sony gets about 5-6 MB/sec. The touch screen on the Samsung responds much faster than the Sony.Other Samsung touches include things like putting a \"recent\" and \"contacts\" button next to the \"To:\" field when you compose emails lets you avoid typing in the email address manually - although the Sony will list matches once you do start typing. On the Samsung using the phone dialer will also do number or name matching. So you just begin typing the name or number on the numeric keypad, it will bring up all the matches and let you select. That's much easier than scrolling when you have more than a dozen or so contacts.IMO for anybody considering the Samsung Galaxy line vs this X10 or the newer Xperia models - no question, go for the Samsung Galaxy line. Samsung appears to have gone over their Galaxy designs with a fine tooth comb, trying to make every possible feature good for the user. Sony goes through their design and sees what they can fake for specification and marketing games, never mind the actual performance.I lowered my initial 2-star rating to 1-star. For this X10 phone, the more I use it, the less I like it.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Product for your money", "Author": "Luis Torres", "ReviewID": "R112VBIKQ8ZKWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This smartphone with Android 2.1 is my phone every day.

Look no more.  Here is a great product! After my nightmare with a defective MOTO Backflip, The Sony Experia X10 is truly an amazing device and is the rival to the iPhone/blackberry.  For my needs it's perfect. Great sound and video. Pictures are amazing at 8mp. Sure the battery life can be better but most devices are this way especially if you are a heavy user. Note: AT&T; has a great deal on these phones.  Droid phones R HOT! Checkout amazing wireless deals and more at Amazon. **UPDATE: X10 will be upgrading up to Droid 2.1 in October/November**Here is a video showing you some features of X10.

The phone doesn't have a good antenna either, when I go inside a store, the signal is gone. Two weeks after I bought this dinosaur, it started to give me serous problems, when I am in a call I CAN'T END CALL, I have to wait for the person I am talking with to hang up on me, also during a call the touch screen dialpad will lock up, and I CAN'T use the dialpad. Also I can't connect to some bluetooth devices such as my laptop, printers, and my Motorola ear piece using the phone's bluethoot. I have called AT&T; and reported all those problems, it is now almost the end of January 2011, and I am waiting my 3 replacement handset from AT&T;, hopefully the 4th handset will work and I will finally have a phone, if it doesn't I will buy another phone, since the X10 is garbage.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD PRODUCT", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R1LINIHYB4UC0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VERY GOOD ANDROID PHONE - THE PROBLEM IS THAT I WAS ROBBED BECAUSE OF IT' S QUALITY - IF YOU BUY BEWARE THE THIETS", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone and delivery", "Author": "Otavio", "ReviewID": "R36R6ZYKWNAIXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Both phone and delivery were amazing!Only problem I had was with UPS phone support, that was lame.

The facts: It'll drain your battery like Obama did to our economy. 2)The Android OS that ships on it is pathetically outdated and is marred by imperfections and stagnation that trips up at odd times. 3)Has no 'real' way to kill an app easily like (as I hate to make a reference here...) the iPhone does. 4) And probably the most important thing here presenting it in a full unbiased tone - simply lacks functionality refinement compared to the iPhone's interface and touch sensitivity for correctness on exact touch location recognition.The phone itself -- IS ROCK SOLID! This is a huge plus and the music earbuds that come with this are impressively impeccable! Sound is truly ONE of the strong points on this phone. Sony by no way impresses me after the 90s and this product is no exception. It lacks just the right amount of overall polishing that the iPhone delivers amazingly well and rightfully puts the Android OS at a clear sub-standard venue. Don't get me wrong; I'm NOT an APPLE fan by no means, but product vs product, the Sony Xperia simply is not polished as people make it out to be.I think a better marriage would be for Sony to substantially push the LATEST Android OS out as being mandatory. Not sure if they could do this, but clearly other phones with the latest OS are amazingly better in touch interface capability - which is ONE of the main reasons we 'like' smart phones - right?", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Display: 4.0 inches 854 x 480 pixels, TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen display, 262K colors, Scratch-resistant surface, Accelerometer sensor for auto-rotate, Timescape/Mediascape UI\nQuad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz.
