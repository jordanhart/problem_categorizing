I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are much much improved.Lets make this review simple and straight to the point, with a few comparisons to other phones:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. And WOW, what a screen it is!There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from the Note 2's 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a lot brighter. This screen has been technically measured to be the brightest screen of any phone, and just now bested by the Samsung Galaxy S5. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(as tested by DisplayMate).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). I can finally use it in the bright sunlight now!* Touch input response is lightning quick. This means when you touch something, it responses nearly instantaneously. It even beats the iPhone 5S, the previous champion, and is only just bested by the HTC One M8.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content! This phone is AWESOME for gaming.3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all - there are literally over 30 features! One of my favorites is the Smart-Stay feature, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle your hand and risk dropping the phone to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app. Also, there are tilt and hand-gesture features for when you want to scroll web pages, emails, zoom in on photos, switch to the next or previous photo or music track, answer a phone call, etc. etc. etc!5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud mono speaker is more useful than having two expansive speakers that space the sound out wider and making it harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use. Although the new HTC One M8 has much improved and louder speakers than the older M7.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly, usually from 20% to full charge in about 2.5 hours. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place. from about 10am to 2am, with heavy usage, I usually end the night at about 30%, which is actually quite amazing since I am on it constantly - phone calls, checking emails, web surfing, checking sports stats and news, and spending hours using my Pulse News app.CONS:*There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. The plastic back nice a nice leathery LOOK, but it is still cheap plastic and feels just like it. Thank goodness most of us cover our phones with cases, so in that aspect it's not a big deal, just that for a $700 phone it should have been made with much better materials and craftsmanship. With rumors of a new Galaxy luxury line, this may be changed very soon though.*The Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. There is a minute, but noticeable lag when you open certain apps or switch between apps with the multi-tasker. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will not satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it in one hang, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative, period. Samsung dominates the phablet market, and that's because this is a nearly flawless multimedia machine with an excellent, crisp, brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and AWESOME battery life.

Some command cannot be used like when you push the power button and the volume down together you can see a different window which you can use to do other things instead of opening the phone. But this phone cannot do that. and when i open it first time, there is no tutorial to set up the phone, it has already been set up. and The charge is not for using in USA, one is for China, the other I do not know. The sim card plot is not very good design, you cannot by pushing the card to get it out as what you can do in S4, you should use a pin to pull it out which upset me a lot. As to the system, I am a ATT user, I can use the phone to make a call or text, but you cannot use the 4G or LTE which I can use in the past time by using my old smartphones, and their title for this phone is 4G, so absurd. I have tried my whole day to research online to use this phone. At the beginning there is not internet, and finally I figure out the APN of my carrier's (like my is ATT) and wrote it into my unlocked phone to make my phone get some sort of internet looks like H+, (somebody said it is 3G) I am not sure. Anyway, it is very troublesome when you bought this phone if you want to use the internet. And I will suggest you to look at their policy of returning or repairments , it is very unkind, read carefully and decide whether you need this phone or not.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone in every way possible", "Author": "T.
