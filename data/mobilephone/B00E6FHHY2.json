It does what it is supposed to do.. device functions are great- camera, bluetooth, IR flasher, etc. etc. etc.Going from an iPhone to this, I am insanely impressed by the sensitivity, clarity, noise cancelling, sound processing of the microphone-- it is hard to believe but I can actually talk to my phone like it is advertised, giving it commands and talking instead of typing, a very welcomed change-up from talking to my iPhone in a robot voice and dialogue that even the phone didn't ever really understand.The battery is mildly impressive compared to almost any similar device this powerful, and gives me 2-3 full days on average, making calls, sending texts, browsing the web, just light to average use. Usually only a day or 2 with heavy use.Reason it doesn't get an awesome rating?MAIN REASON--Warranty does not cover water damage..so it was almost a waste to pick this device instead of something else. .. that's right your \"water resistant\" device is not protected by any warranty if there is any water damage. Great to find a company standing so firmly behind it's products and how they are advertised.Also, there is a lot of bloatware that requires you root your phone, install this, uninstall that, back-up that, delete this....I spent the first 2 weeks figuring out all that crap and reducing the amount of information my phone was recording and sending and that is totally unacceptable to have to work so hard to protect my privacy and simplify my device.Would I buy it again? good question....", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "lisa1774", "ReviewID": "RHP6J7G7BXXK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So easy to use.

The audio quality for the people calling me is horrible. Whoever calls me.....and I mean every person who calls, here's a horrible echo. Every time, on every call. If I put them on speaker phone or use a bluetooth headset, the audio quality is crisp and clear. It could be a defective phone, and I may try to send it back thru Samsung, but that's what happens when you buy on Amazon, or Ebay. It's tougher to take care of problems like this.  The rest of the phone is GREAT....Camera and all. I like the way the phone operates, it's easy to use, and I can carefully rinse it off when i wish. I won't dunk it in water...It's water resistant, but it shouldn't be taken into under water situations...it's just too risky.So, as long as you have a good headset...this phone is tops!Update 2-2014I decided to see if Samsung would replace the phone under warranty...Sure it's been over 6 months, but it's got a year warranty on it... or does it??I spoke to tech support at Samsung....He was going through his little repair script...Ok, lets clear the phone cache...Ok, lets check this setting and that... Finally I said, Ya know, I've done a wipe and a hard reset of this phone at least twice. A few weeks ago, it's firmware was upgraded to Android 4.3 .  Still have the horrible echo. The tech even called the phone and confirmed the echo. Yup it's bad alright. Then he said..........Call your provider for service. You mean, Samsung won't service the phone?  No, talk to your provider.  But I bought the phone on Ebay...New, with receipts, and I use Net10 as my provider. They didn't sell me the phone. I use the ATT Network with Net10, but ATT certainly isn't going to help me.  He talked to his supervisor and that's all they would tell me.....Talk to your provider. Anything else we can help you with today? Thank you for choosing Samsung.SO, I guess i should have purchased a warranty from Square Trade or similar. Square Trade claims they will cover your device even when the Manufacturer won't.Ok....Next time.....", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3DUZTSMA30Y99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've own this phone for around 2 months now and it has work smoothly without any issue.It has already been on the water for around 15 mins and is still working.

For the first 4.5 months, everything was perfect.  I was happy that my phone resisted water properly.  Stories about water leaks with the S4 Active scared me at first.  However, last week was the start of my one problem with this phone.  I held it in my hand and to my surprise, one of the back cover tabs wasn't secured.  I blamed myself for missing one tab and was lucky that the phone was nowhere near water.  A couple of days later, the same thing happened.  I found that same tab popped out so I popped it back in.  Now this tab pops out every few hours.  A trip to the AT&T; store where I bought it didn't result with a new phone.  Instead I was asked to call back the following week to see if they have any S4 Active returns and that they would just swap out the back covers.  I was also encouraged to contact Samsung.  That didn't go too well either.  The support person I'm currently in contact with has no sympathy and immediately told me that the back cover is not covered by the warranty.  This is the main part of the phone that keeps the water out of the batter and sim card compartment.  If there is something wrong with it, shouldn't it be covered?  I should also mention that the battery door has only been removed a few times since I bought the phone.  The phone, outside of the back door issue, actually works well for me.  I loved that it was at least water resistance in case the phone accidentally gets wet.  I was excited when it was marketed as a waterproof phone as all our vacations usually are some sort of water.  The phone has nice features and the performance is fine.  Battery lasts a whole day, which is fine for me.  Every now and then I would charge it during day to make sure I have enough power for the evening.  I love the bigger screen compared to my old iPhone.  I recommended this phone to everyone I met.  But with this battery door issue is killing me.  It would  be fine if this is a standard S4 since a replacement door is easily available.  But there's nowhere in the world right now to get a replacement back door for the S4 Active.I would still recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good performing phone that could resist water in case of accidents.  However, I strongly caution you to check those tabs frequently to make sure they are still clipped in.  When those clips start to pop out, hope that there will be more replacement doors available because Samsung won't cover them.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the market as of right now", "Author": "Dave Gomez", "ReviewID": "RSVFEH316R9DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a very fast phone with a long lasting battery that has more adaptability than ive had with any other phone. to buy an OTB cable for this thing is almost a need, to be able to move stuff from flashdrives/cameras/etc to the device or anything else is amazing. i can even plug in a xbox 360 wired controller and play games.On top of all that its the Active series, meaning its water resistant allowing to take it for runs in the rain and what not, then also its more durable, im a very active guy doing parkour and freerunning so its nice to have a phone that can hold its own, but then back to the side of me thats computer science having the processor to b able to keep up with speeds so i can control my desktop at home!

My friend flipped when her boyfriend clumsily spilled some Velveeta on my phone and I casually ran it under the kitchen sink to clean it. I also take calls in the shower. There are a few problems with the hardware drivers, one being that it has a terribly difficult time telling how dim the screen should be on auto when it's not in direct light. I keep turning off and on auto depending on how I want the screen to be, in other words manually adjusting it..

Slowly enough so, that I could back up all my data as the only problem was really that the power circuit was broken and the battery could no longer be recharged. Once I backed everything up, I snapped the phone in half and tossed it to prevent anyone from salvaging anything that could be reused to their advantage or profit, when obviously, I could no longer enjoy what still had outstanding payments.The guys at the Samsung store at the Grand Canyon mall in Haifa, Israel, recommended the Active version for my purposes. What can I say? 2 weeks into purchase, the battery started bloating to a point where my phone uncontrollably switched itself off. When I took it to buy a new battery at a non-Samsung store, the guy told me I had been lucky because the battery had been so bloated it was about to blow up in my face.Then, around 2 months after purchase, after having used it paranoidly gently to make sure nothing ever happens to my expensive phone again, the charger/USB bus cover just snapped off from premature wear. I had kept it out of reach of my pets, and since I could tell just by looking at that tiny strip of rubber, I knew I had to be very gentle. Despite this supposedly being extra rugged...Now imagine my disappointment: as a passionate snorkeler and diver in the red sea's coral reefs, I can no longer do what was the other reason to get this phone: underwater shots of dolphins and reef life. It is no longer waterproof. What is it good for now? Since Samsung had already, for some absurd reason, reduced the number of megapixels, and the pictures taken are visibly worse than the ones taken with the regular S4, this was another major blow. I can't really carry my gigantic SLR with me everywhere, can I?About 2 months ago, I had my phone in my pocket for 10 minutes while walking the dog. I did not fall, I did not even use the phone or bump the pocket. As I pulled it out, there was a diagonal crack all the way from the upper right to the lower left corner of the screen. Nothing obtrusive, but there is a CRACK in my \"rugged\" phone from being in my POCKET.I would really like my money back since underwater photography was dear to me and all these repairs will cost me. I know for sure they are not covered by warranty, because they all look like blunt force trauma, when I really just used it normally and, in spite of all of Samsung's promises, extra carefully.Ah, and the bloatware. I had to complicatedly root this device just to get rid of the obnoxious shutter sound. Why does Samsung want to force me to pretend-play \"real camera\" with redundant sound effects? For the technologically inexperienced etc. the sound should be optionally available, but for those who don't want to tell the world that they've just taken a selfie, it needs to be optionally mutable.I have hundreds of dollars still to pay off, when the phone itself has worn itself down to the value of a Fisherprice phone.
