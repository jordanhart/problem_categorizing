The integration between apps is amazing.  I like the selection of apps from the android market - and the HTC Sense UI makes the whole thing really quite intuitive.  This is my first touch-screen phone (I've always had physical keyboard'd phones previously).  This is easy to type on, the predictive-text is great.The cons:  With heavy usage, my battery will last me about 12 hrs max.  With regular usage then 2 days is typical.  The AMOLED screen is awesome, but fairly hard to see outside.  I didn't think it would matter that much-- but the place it impacts me is if I'm taking pictures (need to see the screen as the viewfinder).  If I place my hand over it for shade, it's generally enough, but still makes me wish I could see it better.The speed of the device is great.  I'm actively recommending it to any of my friends who are in the market right now.l", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best phone in its class.", "Author": "J. Lin", "ReviewID": "R350B3CA2NS3H7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a deep study of similar products such as Sony Xperia X10, Nokia N8, Samsung Wave, HTC HD mini, and HTC Desire (and even the upcoming Xperia Arc and Play), I decided to buy this one b/c of its build quality, price, and specs. The HTC phones all have the HTC sense UI which is the best in the market (youtube it if you want to know more). Also, the unibody aluminum case makes it very strong and beautiful. Best of all, it has an optical mouse that's non-existence on other similar phones.  After buying the phone, I decided to root the phone and upgraded it to Froyo 2.2 (a mod based on HTC's official release, not cyanogenmod). The phone plays games exceptionally well. If it doesn't play, it's the software and its developer's fault (e.g. EA sucks!). I learned it the hard way for getting NFS shift to play on this device. Overall, this is a strong, small, and very powerful phone that I would recommend to anyone who's looking to buy a phone of this class. Two words, BUY IT!PS: The AMOLED screen is beautiful, but I kept the brightness low to save battery most of the time. The 600 MHz CPU is actually quite powerful and energy efficient and it has a great GPU on this unit. The battery life is great. With WIFI off and proper SETCPU config to under-clock CPU when the screen is off, this phone can last 3+ days without recharge. I usually keep the WIFI to \"always on\" and use it to call and receive SKYPE calls to save phone bill, you should do it too if you're usually under WIFI coverage.3/28/12 Note (For those of you trying to flash the ROM to Cyanogenmod 7 or else):With Cyanogenmod 7, SIM no contact list issue is SIM dependent (resolved via replacing the SIM card itself).", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Hugo R", "ReviewID": "R299UA4Q90BSL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, the shipment was within the time specified.I use this phone in Peru and works very well with the existing cellular network.

MP3 player + album management5. great email sync (particularly for Yahoo Mail)6. GPS + navigation capabilities7. decent built-in camera8. ability to add storage later9. apps (games)10. Quad-band GSM (so that I can use it here in the US and also in Asia)3G capability was not at all important for me, nor did I want to pay hefty monthly fees for non-WiFi (3G or 4G) data access. If I need to get on the net, I can wait until I get to a WiFi location.The HTC Legend met all this criteria soundly. It's essentially a palm-sized computer disguised as a top-notch cellphone. Have had it for two weeks, and am using it on a postpaid plan on T-Mobile without any data plan. For my needs, works beautifully. I plugged in a 16GB microSD card, the SIM from my 6-yr old phone, and everything powered up and has been running great.What I also like about this phone is that besides being such a great multi-talented device, it's also aesthetically very pleasing. It's just the right size and weight.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "worst phone i have owned", "Author": "P.

My SIM card was already unlocked, and I expected to be able to put it in and go, using my existing phone and data plan. The phone worked immediately, but I could only get email and Internet when I had a wireless connection; I had to go to T-Mobile to get settings changed to get data over an EDGE or 3G connection. Even now, with data roaming turned on and 'correct' numbers input in a place I can't find via settings, it only gets data in the US.However, the data issues aren't a huge problem; I don't really want to pay for data on an international phone connection anyway. Otherwise, it's a great phone. The screen is much clearer and more vivid than the Nexus One's was, and the camera is great. Battery life is also longer; with GPS turned off, I can get 3 days out of it. Operationally, it's an Android, which is pretty standardized, I think. One person I know, who's been thinking his next phone will be an iPhone, now understands why I think Android is better -- and this is the nicest Android I've seen. The T-Mobile tech who helped me set up mobile data was very impressed with it too; he said he'd been wanting a Legend and asked me a lot about where I got it and what it cost.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "a bit of a lemon", "Author": "Anneki", "ReviewID": "R2A2VOJJZYR5PQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone was received last month and i found its looks appealing. My first HTC  but unfortunately it  has been a major disappointment considering the positive reviews received so far. As at today the screen is unresponsive and i have resorted to soft and hard resets on a daily basis for the past 3 days. A quick look into android forums reveals that this fault is not uncommon with the particular phone. HTC has been contacted and i expect them to provide a replacement. If that fails then its the iphone for me.  Unable to give this more than 2 stars for now.UPDATEBelow are responses from the HTC personnel i contacted. it is clear that support is somewhat non-existent. Especially response 3 where i have been asked to contact china to discuss repairing a phone purchased in the states.RESPONSE 1.Thank you for taking the time to contact HTC America Technical Support via E-Mail with your concern regarding the unresponsiveness of the screen on your Legend.

This is my first touchscreen and I have to say that it is pure amazing.Its not as fast as some other HTC phones, but it makes up for it with android. It is smooth scrolling and fast loading.

I own mine for one month now and I couldn't be happier with it.The unibody design ironically looks extremely Apple-ish. It's like the Legend came out of the same factory where MacBook Pros are made. Looks great and feels great. Build quality is stellar.It is certainly not the most powerful phone in the Android space (600 MHz processor vs. Desire's 1GHz), but I haven't noticed any performance problems with the phone (and I am using the thing pretty heavily). Maybe some will find the screen a bit smallish (3.2 in) but on the other side the smaller size makes the phone more compact and it fits better in my pocket (and my palm).The Android OS is great and in my opinion this is where the future lies. I've been watching Android since its very beginning and the progress is anything but amazing. I like it much more than iOS4 (I have an iPod Touch running iOS4).The HTC Sense UI on top of the Android OS is very very nice. It needs some polishing here and there but overall it adds even more to the value of the phone. The downside of having Sense is that you'll have to wait a bit longer to get the newest Android versions.My take in 2 words: simply brilliant.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "HTC DOES IT AGAIN...

It seems to be good quality, it's heavy, and it fits easily into my pocket. I liked that it's a bit smaller than the iPhone/Desire, as if you're wearing a suit/slacks/etc., they make large pocket bulges.* The touchscreen does work good, the tactile feedback is  nice, and I'm happy with the sensitivity and brightness.The really annoying negatives:* HTC has locked the O/S, and have pre-loaded a bunch of applications I don't want. These applications constantly load up (like Plurk, Footprints, Stocks, etc.) into memory. This makes the phone slow down (literally, about 10 applications will constantly be opening up) considerably, and also probably eats into battery life. I don't want these applications, i don't like them, and I want them off my  phone. Oh, but you *can't* uninstall them! It drives me nuts. I have to download a task-killer, and have it constantly set to kill these apps, but even then I find them open frequently. My only solution is to find a way to \"root\" the phone, get O/S root access, and finally uninstall these apps.* Battery life is miserable. If I'm doing some wireless browsing, talking, and sending SMS's the battery won't last a single day. That's unacceptableSomething else to consider:* One thing I thought I'd like about Android is that it's an open O/S, which allows applications to access core functions (you can download new SMS software, etc.) However, while this is cool, I also find that you also have a heap of fairly unregulated applications going up in the Android Market, which I'd think could easily pose a security/virus/malware/privacy issue for those of you who are concerned about that. Sure, iPhone apps track where you are, etc., but Apple seems to do a better job of ensuring applications meet higher standards.Soooo, in conclusion, I think my next phone will be (wait for it...) an iPhone. Yes, I'll give in...", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Serious signal strength issues", "Author": "Flaus Marti \"Claus\"", "ReviewID": "R1TZVD7DI3069K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received HTC Legend rapidly and in new working condition. This 'phone has some serious and crippling issues that cannot be resolved. Firtly, the signal strength for GSM telephone connection is extremely variable, but invariably weak. I have never had an issue with any cell phone until now, but this model drops calls all the time while I'm sitting in my house. Signal strength flies up and down seemingly at random. I have tried some tweaks I found on the internet, switching to GSM only or GSM PRL settings but to no avail. So as a telephone, it's pretty hopeless.How about the smart functions? I don't have a 3G connection, so WiFi is the only option I can comment on. And it's hopeless. It connects, disconnects, drops signals, and only works reliably if you practically sit on the wireless modem. It won't reliably work on the other side of the room from the wireless modem, a distance of around 4 metres. Even if adjacent to the modem, it is still surprisingly flaky. I have also tried all of the tips suggested on the internet, to no avail. I am tech savvy, so there shouldn't be too many operator issues here.I invite any prospective buyer to type \"HTC legend wifi problems\" or \"htc legend signal call dropping\" into your favourite search engine to find out how widespread these problems are. True, some people report that they have no problem with the WiFi, I suspect it's some form of compatibility issue with certain wireless modems, however I cannot change my wireless modem as it's rented from the cable company, and they don't run any other models. So if you buy this telephone, I suggest you cross your fingers and hope for the best.In summary - for me, useless as a telephone, and useless as smartphone.
