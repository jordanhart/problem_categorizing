I like the fact that it has the little touch pad as well as a slide out keyboard.  These features, I think, give it an edge over my friends who have Droid X phones.  It makes it easier to type as well as navigate around the screen without accidentally clicking on things.Things I don't like so much:I have had to do a factory reset on my phone about 5 times now... and I've had it since July (7 months).  Every once in a while, all of the applications that aren't preinstalled will force close like crazy and you have to uninstall and reinstall all of them...  Or I'll notice that my lock feature and home button refuse to work.  Because of the design of the phone, I get stuck on screens if I cannot hit \"Home.\"  Also, the only way around this and the lock issue is to download apps which override the phone's lock and home features.  Then the buttons magically start to work again, but this usually triggers all of my apps to suddenly corrupt and force close.Also, because it's a touch screen and maybe the shape of my face is weird, while I'm talking on the phone it will randomly hit the speakerphone key.In conclusion; they need to patch the OS or something because it's obviously not stable and I know I'm not the only one who has had the same issue.  The crashes are something I can live with.  The factory reset leaves all of my contacts and since all my personal info is stored in my Google account, all I lose is the installed apps and data from them.  For me, it's no big deal.  Just annoying.  Otherwise, it's a pretty good phone.  The speakerphone thing is something that I can overlook, be more careful, and maybe see if there is an app to lock the button or something.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seriously, this phone is great.", "Author": "Mega Man", "ReviewID": "R3CGS8P4I7YHT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone used.

However I was able to use verizon's web page to remotely upload my old contact list which vorizon kept for me, Verizon's web site gives you the option to download your contact list in a \"CVS\" file. All you have to do is download the contact list in a CVS file and then connect to your \"Motoblur\" account online and upload the CVS file as directed. Simple as that! The website remotely updated my contact list on my phone!AUDIO / MP3 playerMy Ipod touch has been giving me problems lately... So I simply uploaded my music to the SD card on this phone and I use it as my MP3 player also. Seriously, it's pretty awesome. Thanks to a headphone jack on the phone it really makes it simple to listen to my MP3s.Bottom line... Sure it is not the latest and greatest, but regardless it is pretty great. For the price you get a LOT of features and functionality. I gave it 5 stars because my expectations weren't very high because I realized that I wasn't paying 700$'s for a phone without a contract.

I am currently waiting for my husband to upgrade his Droid, so I can switch to it, and get rid of a phone that has limited apps, and shelflife.

Not only does it seem slower, and have a terrible camera with no flash, but the directional key on the side is too small and inaccurate to use reliably.  Editing a text message or any other text for that matter is a royal pain.  The Google maps app installed is also a lot bulkier and hard to use than that of the original Droid.  In fact, I had to download an additional program to even begin using GPS nav at all.  Not a fun proposition as I was already lost and had to spend another 10 minutes downloading, restarting and accepting terms and conditions before I could get directions. Previous Droid was set to go right out of the box.  Also, this handset regularly power cycles when headphones are removed from the headphone jack.

It also does delete contacts sometimes, which is annoying. Sometimes it will fail to boot up. All of these things are solved (at least on my phone) with a hard reset. Google it, it's very easy to do.

I explain these things up front because my intention is not to use the A555 long-term. If I can get a decent Verizon cell phone signal in the places I go the most, my plan is to buy an iPhone I can use with the Verizon network. So we're not talking a long-term relationship here. I also bought my A555 used from a private seller, so I didn't pay anything close to the listed retail price.So far, I like the Motorola Devour A555. The phone easily located my existing Google Play (Marketplace) account, and I was able to download apps I'd paid for to use with the last Android phone I'd owned, which was a few years ago. Some of the apps wouldn't work with the A555, but the Google Marketplace is able to warn you ahead of time that the app won't work on this new phone. I was also able to pick new apps on my computer, and they automatically were downloaded and installed to the A555.The slide-out keyboard on the A555 is easy to use. The phone is easier to hold and it isn't a brick like the earlier generations of Android phones. The reception is clear and steady, even with 1 bar of service, inside the house. I will post an update to this review if anything changes with the phone.Updated review after 6 weeks of use:I love this phone! There are enough apps available on the Google Play (aka Marketplace) that I can get this phone to do most of what my last phone did. Not everything, of course, but Google Maps runs fine and I'm using the phone's built-in email app, which is good enough to get the job done. I did finally abandon the A555 in favor of a Verizon iPhone, but that was only because I found a deal too good to pass up...A few notes. With prepaid service, Verizon navigation was turned off - you can't even pay for it, the feature just doesn't work - unless you're a regular customer who has a cell phone with a contract. Also, if you're interested in maximizing the time the battery stays charged, shut off the wi-fi if you don't need it. On this phone, and it may be a fatal flaw for some users - the wi-fi signal drains the battery right away, even if you're not actively using it.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not working so good", "Author": "perkeltweety", "ReviewID": "R3UPD378L5HDNW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a present the to my mom early for Christmas as her phone kicked the bucked now she is forced to learn new however wish I payed attention better there was no charger or battery cover :( After having this phone for a little over a month it is now spazzing out and not working bad phone", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Didn't work after a week, tried to deal with it.

They were awful. An awful OS on an awful wireless connection...being a touchscreen handheld device was about the only thing they had going for them. The last Windows phone was the Omnia i910 about around the time the iphone 2 was coming out. I was resistant to get an iPhone due to there price and their Appleness, so I took a bet on Google and switched mobile OS's to Android...and this Motorola Devour was my first Android experience.This phone is my favorite of all the Android phones (and legacy Windows Mobile phones, for that matter) I've ever used. Now the Devour is a legacy device and I look back extremely fondly of it. The metal body and the slide up display were so smooth and sturdy. It was just so great finally having a smartphone that carried an OS specifically designed for a phone and not just a highly limited cutback version of Windows Desktop. With every new phone that I get I remember how much fun I had with the Devour and wonder (and sometimes google) the possibility of a Devour 2. All metal with the QWERTY. I would pay full retail for that.This phone had a lot of flaws, but I like to think of it as a beta device that help introduce Android into the world...and then I remember why I so easily looked over the flaws. I was having too much fun. Poor battery life? Psshhh, it was just maintaining healthy doses of fun. If you want a good phone to give Android a try, do not pick this one. As awesome as it WAS, its now an artifact of awesome. Get the latest and greatest phone available for Android, and some day that will be your \"Devour\".", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": ":)", "Author": "B.
