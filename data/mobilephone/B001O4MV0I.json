No long-life battery available for this model.Also, I keep getting annoying solicitation calls and there is no way to block them. I contacted Virgin Mobil and they didn't offer any viable solutions except for changing my phone number, (ahhhh, no thanks!).Great for younger kids. Easy use.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001O4MV0I"}}
