This is really strange because my S4 has a signal of 5 bars in the same room and my laptop is the same.  Neither of my other devices drops their signal, so this is a major concern.I am really hoping that there is something I can do - and that someone can tell me what that is since it is such a new device!", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IB0W6BC"}}
