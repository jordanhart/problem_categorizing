Stephens", "ReviewID": "R1MMVD0D60HTLW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not a fan of touch screen phones at all.  I like having actual buttons to press--it makes texting and things so much easier which is why I've stuck with flip phones.  Of all the flip phones I've owned, this has been my favorite one.  I love the modern, stylish look of it and how easy it is to use.  However, the battery life on this thing is terrible.  After using it for about ten or twenty minutes during the day, the battery meter drops down a bar or two.  If you take a picture or someone sends you a picture message, it uses the battery up even faster.  By the end of the day it usually only has one or two bars of battery life left.  At first I thought the battery was the problem so I bought a new one, but nope, same thing happened.  The phone uses so much power that you have to charge the battery every day or sometimes twice a day depending on how much you use it.  I owned an LG Accolade before this one and the battery on it lasted forever-- I could go three or four days before I had to charge it.  I'm hoping Motorola makes a new version of this phone that doesn't use up the battery so fast.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
