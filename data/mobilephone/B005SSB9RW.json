Do not just look at the price. Read the description and check the sellers' feedback scores. A lot of the reviews you see for the phone are actually seller feedback, which is not what I am here to do.I just bought a used iPhone 4S here in the Amazon Marketplace, and I love it. It runs all of the features I need from iOS 7, including the moving wallpaper (well, okay, maybe I don't NEED that). Performance is excellent, with a noticeable bump over my iPhone 4, which is also running iOS 7 quite nicely without the moving wallpaper. This is the first version of the iPhone that had Siri, and I'm surprised to find that I am using that feature quite a bit.There is also a bump in network speed over the iPhone 4. Is it worth it to upgrade to a 4S from a 4 at this point? For me, yes. I use T-Mobile and wasn't on board with signing a new contract to get a 5C or a 5S. This works fine for me - I use it as a phone, a text messenger, a lo fi point and shoot camera, iPod, and e-reader. It does all of these without a hiccup, and I don't owe anyone any money.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like new", "Author": "John Lloyd \"John Lloyd\"", "ReviewID": "R3MSZ0IA0PLYU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family purchased several of these directly from amazon because Amazon offers a 30 day return policy.

In addition, my family has really enjoyed Apple's macs, Ipads, and Iphones. However regrettably, I am taking a leave of absence from the Apple family after being treated so poorly by their associates and investing hundreds of dollars in a malfunctioning product. I have sent two messages to Apple corporate with no response. In addition, my experience at the Apple store was very much disappointing. Their associates were not helpful nor were they sympathetic to my situation. I was told that my malfunctioning Iphone could not be traded in since my product was one month over warranty. My broken Iphone which was confirmed by three individuals(AT and T, third party, and Apple associate) to have no water or dropping damage was deemed unworthy of a trade in or replacement. The associates said that this happens and they could not replace my lemon. When investing into an Iphone, I was told that my phone would be technologically and environmentally superior to other phones. On Apple's website, their products are advertised as being environmentally friendly, well designed, and technologically powerful machines. My experience has been quite the opposite. I do not wish to invest hundreds of dollars for a product that damages the environment, malfunctions, and has a poor support team. After my disappointing experience at their store, I visited a corporate AT and T store who deemed my Iphone to be worth a $200 trade in. I was quite confused since the Apple associate stated that my product was worth nothing. Apple, a billion dollar corporation, is more concerned about money then they are about customer satisfaction. Apple has forgotten that they are creating a product for people not making a product for themselves. After this experience, I will think twice before investing into another apple product.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "truong", "ReviewID": "RH1ADT3PZTKLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, I think that this is a good phone.

I ordered an iPhone 4s that was considered 'like new.'Their definition of a 'like new' product is:  A \"like new\"\" item sold on Amazon Warehouse Deals is in perfect condition, but due to the condition of the packaging, it does not meet Amazon.com standards for new product. For customer-returned product, it's possible that the previous customer opened and removed the product from the original packaging. If a returned item comes back in perfect physical condition and through our testing process we determine the working condition is perfect, the item may be deemed \"like new.\" Physical damage to the outer box of a factory-sealed item in our warehouse can also lead to the condition being taken from Amazon.com \"new\" to Amazon Warehouse Deals \"like new.\"My iPhone arrived in the mail and I took it in to the AT&T; store to get it set up. Right away the employee who was working with me told me that my phone was damaged. The home button is wobbly and loose and when you talk on the phone with someone the quality of sound is terrible--I was told it already has a blown speaker. I would not consider this phone in \"perfect working condition\" at all. This leads me to believe that Amazon either tested the phone and still sold it as \"Like New\" while knowing full well that the phone had issues, or it was an oversight on their part. Either way, very disappointing purchase.
