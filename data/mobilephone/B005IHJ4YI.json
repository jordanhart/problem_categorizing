I was worried cause the picture provided by the seller doesn't match the actual product. But I took the chance and it was the real thing, just like the pictures provided by other customers. The product works perfectly with CLARO in Guatemala. It can use 4G (HSPA+), 3G (UMT5850, 1900, 2100) or 2G(Edge, GPRS, GSM, 850, 900, 1800, 1900). The language con easily be changed to Spanish. The only disadvantage is that it doesn't come with a MicroSD as an extra memory, although it already has 8GB of internal memory.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "MUST READ", "Author": "Linda K.", "ReviewID": "R32GW98LZ4SJZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone, before you buy this please note that this is a Brushed Aluminum Case in BLACK.
