The best thing about the phone is that the whole package just works so well together. The integration of all the features makes me want to get rid of my Samsung GS2. (I bought this for my son)The processor is very quick, there is virtually no lag in this phone at all. Switching from app to app is almost instantaneous.  The user interface, HTC Sence 3.5, is very user friendly and beautiful. The call quality is great and the speakerphone works very well. The phone is very thin and light, but has a metal case, so it is very durable.Lastly, the camera is awesome. It takes great pictures and gives you lots of options of what you would like to do with them.Again, the whole package is very comparable to my Samsung GS2, and in many respects is better. This phone will fit the bill for almost anyone, unless you need a giant screen or a more powerful processor, which for most people is probably not necessary. I paid $205 for it and consider it a steal.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thin, solid, fast, bright, beautiful display.", "Author": "J.

Tyler", "ReviewID": "R3PO19G396MGCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing phone for under two hundred bills.  This would be an amazing phone for five hundred bills.  Some reviewers are calling this a basic phone or a budget phone, but trust me, it is a premium phone.  It may not be the very, very latest, but it works flawlessly.Here's what's good:+ Build quality - it feels really solid in my hand.+ Screen quality - AMOLED looks great.  It could be a little higher resolution, but it is not at all a budget screen.+ Perfect size - I do not like carrying around a phone the size of a notebook.  But I also don't like straining my eyes to see tiny writing.  This one is just right.  And it fits in my front pocket perfectly.+ Speed - Everything is butter.  It is really a flawless interactive experience.  I don't bog down my phones with 100 apps, though, so keep that in mind.+ Stability - Has never crashed.  Not even once.+ Wifi Calling - This important for me because I live in a hole where no carrier signals can reach.  The wifi calling works just as it should.+ Camera - Man, this camera is great.  It is not a DSLR, nor is it on par with the $700 phones of 2013, but it is excellent.  The best I've had out of all seven of my smartphones.  HTC has always had good cameras, though.Now, what's not so great:- No SD card.  Really too bad.- No dedicated camera button - I wish Android would follow the Windows Phone lead and make this a hardware requirement.  I hat tapping the screen to snap a photo; it is just weird.- Flush power button - It can be difficult to push.- Bad notification light design - it is under the earpiece and very difficult to see.That's about it.  If you buy this, I would suggest that you leave the Power Saver feature on.  It dramatically increases the battery life, but I can't tell any difference in the performance or frequency of app updates.  I don't know what it's doing, but it's doing it well.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Naturalez", "ReviewID": "R10KL32MY661E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a year and a half, I lost it last weekend and I thought about getting the new htc one, however for the price and what it can do this phone is awesome, so great I'm ordering another one..

I had a Samsung Galaxy S II but it seemed that I was charging the battery more often than it seemed I should have to for as little as I used it.  The battery life on this is GREAT, and it's even better if you turn off accessories that you don't use i.e. sync, compass, gps, location, etc.  There is a lot of bloatware, more than normal imo that can't be removed.  You can disable them but that's not really the point, they still take up space!

Bottom line is if you want a prepaid phone that won\u2019t constantly crash and have no need for an 8  inch screen that could never possibly fit in your pocket, then buy this. You won\u2019t regret it. My only caveat is the data availability and speed on T Mobile can be dicey here in Florida (and many places I have traveled).

HTC Sense 4+ UI is pretty decent without a lot of bloat-except for the e-mail client which I've replaced with K-@Mail and the keyboard, which is decent, but Sense seems to not want my other keyboard (which is Thumb) to remain active, so I'm having to periodically reset it to the default, which is really aggravating, but not a dealbreaker. Calls seem to have developed an issue by going straight to VM sometimes when I have call settings set to Wi-Fi preferred rather than wireless. Have yet to figure out if this is T-Mo issue or phone issue, but T-Mo support forums indicate the One S experiences this over several years, so you have to keep wireless as the preferred call mode. Don't know if this will solve problem, but will find out. After 6 months of experience I would say the phone is very nice, but the network likely needs attention (at least in my area).

They were practically drooling, especially after I told them what I paid for it. The only flaw is that you really need to charge it every night and you need to be gentle with the power button.

I bought this phone on ebay from this seller. They shipped this phone really fast. I like this phone so far. the only drawback for this phone is no more software updates from HTC.The price was the big attention getter and since I had been wanting one for a while, I couldn't pass it up. I had a Samsung Galaxy S II but it seemed that I was charging the battery more often than it seemed I should have to for as little as I used it.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good!", "Author": "STEPHEN W.", "ReviewID": "R2E3CEU0SK9K5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had few problems with this phone.

The HTC One was very well reviewed, so I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed, and will be returning it.Let's start with the good. The phone looks well designed -- it is sleek-looking and feels good and well-balanced in the hand. It's the right size for me, too -- neither too big nor too small. The screen looks sharp, and its seems fast -- no major delays or hangups.BUT... I found it has two major flaws that make it a poor choice for me.One is the on/wake-up button. It is located on top, basically flush against the body of the phone, and quite hard to press -- I often have to try several times and use my fingernail to get it to respond. There's really no excuse for such poor design, especially since this one of the most frequently used functions -- you press it every time you want to wake up the phone!! I compared it to my wife's Nexus 4, where the button is on the side of the phone and much easier to reach and to press. With the HTC, you literally need two hands to wake up the phone, since it's hard to reach and press the button with the hand that holds the phone -- extremely inconvenient.Second, I found the camera quite poor. I took some pictures around the house, and non were even halfway decent -- blurry, poor colors, red eye, etc. Now, I know it not easy to squeeze a decent camera into the form factor of the phone, but still, the results did not compare well to photos taken with the Nexus 4, or with iPhones I've seen. And since a main reason I wanted to upgrade my phone is to get a better camera, this is a major flaw for me.So these two things -- the poor design of the ON button and the disappointing quality of the photos -- are the reasons I am returning this phone. There are other things I don't really like -- the lack of physical button for the \"home\" and \"back\" functions, for example. But these I could easily tolerate if the phone was easier to turn on and took decent photos.It's really too bad -- I wanted to like it...", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent phone for the money", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R392MDGFLR6CTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love this phone, functions really well, has all the bells and whistles i need. and holds a charge for a long time. like it a lot better than an iphone that we've used.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "christopher", "ReviewID": "R31ZBEBVI3BS1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it was good, very good for a 200 dollar phone, no problems yet and works just like any other smart phone", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It was a great device, loving it!", "Author": "Mahsa", "ReviewID": "R1T1HFAZ0ZD160", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great device and very well priced!Absolutely recommend it.But it doesn't have headphones coming with it ( my old hTc HD had those included in the box) but not a big deal, and it was also mentioned on the website.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "SMOKING DEAL!!!!", "Author": "EricNSTL", "ReviewID": "R3GBZG11XQKMTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a replacement for my wife's phone.
