{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Seems like a great little phone", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2OYRKYZOBJGGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It might even be worth 5 stars, I haven't had it that long. As other reviews have pointed out this arrives with the language set to Spanish and a manual in Spanish. However, an English manual is easy to find online in pdf. Using this it's easy to change the default language of the phone, even without the manual a little scrolling around would do it. So don't let this language issue bother you.I was afraid it would be too small but it's about the same size, and similar in appearance, the the Samsung I've been using. It's small but not unusually so. Despite the small size the sound is fine and the volume is capable of going quite high.There are a lot of features for such a small cheap phone. I'm still figuring these out, which is a bit of a challenge when you're used to a different phone with a somewhat different layout. However, I really just wanted to be able to use the phone and send/receive simple occasional texts. With two SIMS.The dual SIM feature is great as long as it works when I add a second one in another country. I took the ATT Gophone SIM out of my  old phone and put it in this one and everything worked fine right away. It looks easy to use two SIM cards at once but we'll see.Since I just received this I can't comment on durability or longevity. But it appears to be as well made as my otherphones have been, all of them budget models and all of them having lasted long enough.I don't leave many reviews but I especially wanted to dispel the myth that language is a problem - just download the manual in English or your other preferred language, change the default setting on the phone, and you're set to go.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, seems like a great deal", "Author": "notwarrenbuffett", "ReviewID": "R1RV3SBX1CST0D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now, and bought it to use while traveling internationally.  Here's what I've discovered so far:1) As others have posted, the instruction manual that comes with the phone is in Spanish.  If you're not fluent in Spanish, consider downloading the English manual BEFORE the phone arrives (easily found via Google).  (See point 8, also.)2) The first picture instructions you see upon opening the box show you how to remove the back.  I still couldn't do it.  I was lifting the little lifting slot on the bottom of the phone (step \"A\" in the picture) but it would barely lift one millimeter and if I tried to change my grip, it would drop shut again.  I looked around for suggestions in other Amazon reviews but couldn't find any tips.  Then I finally decided to apply some more pulling pressure on the little lifting slot and the tabs holding the back to the chassis gave way--at first I was afraid I might break it, but it turned out OK.  (Later on I decided the best way to open this thing is with some kind of thin flat-blade tool. A dime works too: twist the dime to lift the slot and crack the seal, then slide the dime around to the side as you twist it.)  The back feels like a really flimsy piece of plastic, but for under $40 for a dual-SIM phone, I'm not complaining about that!3) I put in the battery and the screens came up in Spanish (no surprise, now).  I know just enough Spanish (and icons) to figure out how to switch it to English in less than a minute.  (a) Left soft key (menu). (b) Select the gear icon [second row of icons, on the left; not the icon with the phone AND the gear, like I tried the first time] (c) select menu option 2 \"Configuraci\u00f3n de tel\u00e9fono\" (d) select menu option 3 \"Idioma\" and you should be able to figure it out from here.  Then use the right soft key \"Back\" until you're back at the main menu.4) After activating the phone (with H2O Wireless, which wasn't exactly an intuitive process, but I figured it out reasonably quickly) I successfully used the menus to configure some appearance options, and set the time and date (before finding the setting to keep it automatically updated).  But then I couldn't figure out how to simply place a call!  It may have had something to do with a SIM card setting I changed.  When I set that back the way it had been before, I was able to simply hit the number keys & dial my call. (And as others have said, the keys and their labels are REALLY tiny!  I'll definitely be using my bifocals for this phone!)5) The Call/Answer key not is not labeled with any icon, or in the usual green color, so that's not helpful, and its location will simply have to be memorized.6) The first time I received an incoming call, the ringtone was HORRIBLE, with laughing baby sounds!  So the next priority was to figure out how to change that!  Found it under User Profiles, and I couldn't find a SINGLE built-in ringtone that I liked.  Good thing I checked other settings because the default SMS Message notifier was the same incredibly annoying laughing baby sound!  (A couple of weeks later I figured out how to create my own custom ringtone, which I'd never done before, and it worked fine.  In short, I used iTunes to create the MP3 audio clip from a song, then used Bluetooth to send the MP3 clip from my laptop into the phone, and assigned it to the \"profile.\")7) I had great difficulty installing the second SIM card, into the #2 (top) slot.  I was trying to slide it in flat, parallel to the SIM in slot #1.  I finally figured out that if I tilt it up before trying to slide it in, it goes in easily.  After testing the phone for a few days with a new H2O SIM and their cheapest option (a $10 PIN), I had them port in my existing Page Plus number.  Once that was complete, I could use the Dual SIM feature, and after figuring out a few things (like configuring two different voicemail inboxes, and trying to find out what happens when I switch the SIMs between slots), I had no trouble making or receiving calls or texts on either SIM.  Usually an extra step or two is involved in each case (mainly when dialing or texting--you have to let the phone know which SIM to use), but it's not a big deal.  Honestly I don't expect to really NEED to have two active SIMs at once, but for only $40, why not?  I'm planning to do some long-term overseas travel, and I figured that this way I can have a cheap U.S. phone that's immediately ready to work when I land back in the U.S., as well as a way to have a cheap local number in most every other country in the world.  (The cheapest setup I've been able to find is H2O's Pay-as-you-go, which for $10 every 90 days will keep my U.S. number alive; I will have to manually \"recharge\" it over the Internet every 90 days, but I don't think that will be a problem.  Their auto-recharge system's biggest time interval is 30 days, currently.)8) It was a bit of a headache to figure out how to get this thing to use data on H2O Wireless, but I eventually figured out most of what I needed to do to configure it to at least browse the web (old-style \"WAP\" mobile sites, only).  Turns out the built-in web browser (Opera Mini) is also in Spanish and I haven't yet figured out if it's possible to change that.  Of course, the pages you surf to are still in whatever language you want, but (assuming there's no way to change the browser language) it will help to know a bit of Spanish to use the few menu choices to navigate the browser.  I haven't found any kind of built-in email client, but I successfully checked my main email account (Yahoo).  It's painful to use, but it might help in an emergency.So I've been using the phone for only 2 weeks now, in the U.S. only, but I haven't yet used it for the main purpose for which I bought it, which is to travel internationally and pick up cheap local SIM cards to use as I go.  But I've been happy with the overall performance and the sound quality (and my elderly mother says she can hear me better on this phone than on my previous Verizon Motorola Droid X2).  The battery life looks like it's going to be great, and it's very tiny & light weight--I hope it will be a very good traveling phone (and one that I won't worry about if it gets lost, broken, or stolen).One other note:This phone uses \"Mini SIM\" cards (25 x 15 mm, sometimes also referred to as \"Standard SIM\" cards).", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Value Value Value", "Author": "LingCPA", "ReviewID": "R1H2CRW9206LKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does the job, slim and easy to use.

I think it worked perfectly.  I used this phone through Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungry w/o any issues.  This doesn't have data access or all the bells and whistles of what I would want in my daily life; however, as a solution for buying a SIM card in a foreign country, this works perfectly.  In the two cases where I bought SIM Cards (Czech Republic & Austria), I was able to activate them using the SIM card instructions and use the phone immediately.  There are only 2 things I would warn about the phone, which is why i've given it 4 instead of 5 stars.  1) the factory setting comes with the language set to spanish and directions in spanish only.  You'll need to know (or have a friend who knows) spanish to change the language setting, since its require going through a number of menus to get to the language preferences.  2) The phone does not save a copy of outgoing text messages, so you can't go back to see what you said to a person.
