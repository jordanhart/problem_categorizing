I bought mine just recently, and, while it is clearly not as awesome as one of the later model iPhones, it is a really great phone that runs the most recent operating system quite snappily and runs all of the applications I use flawlessly.  And I didn't need to commit to an expensive contract or data plan.  I'm super happy with this phone.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "My mind has been changed!", "Author": "kmd", "ReviewID": "R2S2UPH6Z0X3TA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I purchased this phone I was concerned purchasing this iPhone 3gs 32GB online but I can tell you that I am absolutely pleased. My iPhone 3gs was destroyed but fortunately I backed up my information.  As long as I could find another iPhone, my information should be able to be saved to a \"new\" phone.  Price was an issue.  My Upgrade was not due for another  6 months and I could not afford to spend alot of money.  The price for this phone was reasonable and although this iPhone listed is sold as used, I can not tell that it's ever been used. This product came in pristine condition, in a sealed box and did not look as this ever touched human hands.  I \"restored\" this \"New\" phone from my destroyed but saved old iPhone data and I have now had my iPhone for a few months and have not had any problems what so ever.  Everything transferred over as it should and truly this product (iPhone)  has made this Amazon customer very happy.  I would purchase this product again through amazon.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "best christmas ever", "Author": "michael", "ReviewID": "RQK230KMUZWG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "hello, i just recieved my iphone 3gs 32gb white model a couple days ago and i have enjoyed it. it came in the original box and they even included the wall charger as an extra which was nice. anyway it has minor scraches and has a little notch looking thing in the middle area. but all in all i cant complain too much lets just say i got i really good deal and im satisfied", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "For a first time iPhone user you will not be disappointed - great versatility & utility - absolutely amazing. ... read on...", "Author": "AgogoLive", "ReviewID": "R15YCE9FVPKP17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little marvel will literally become your new best friend.

ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF REALLY... even a scanner that turns your \"scans\" into pdf format for emailing etc.It loses 1.5 star only because of being an \"older\" model but the price makes up for this.Fully charged the battery powers on for days (if you know what to turn off to energy efficient mode) and QUICK CHARGES.  I am constantly amazed at how quickly it charges to 100% virtually within the hour.I have the white - which is STILL THE BEST LOOKING. (biased yes)If you are willing to fork out more, obviously the new model has improvements. One marked improvement is DEFINITELY THE CAMERA RESOLUTION OF THE 4G.
