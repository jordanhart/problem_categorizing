{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One phone to rule them all?", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R35XDV7V8SWEQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are reading this, chances are that you have heard about the galaxy s4 and that it is a very real possibility for your next phone. I will go in depth into the features of this phone and I will compare it to the S4.Design: this is the reason why I chose this phone. The industrial design is second to none. It is beautiful, smooth and cool to the touch. The \"chamfered\" edges and curved back allow you to have a good grip on the phone while also allowing it to nestle into your palm. The phone has an aluminum unibody, but requires plastic so that the radios can get reception. To mold this plastic into the unibody, HTC uses a gapless manufacturing process that molds it perfectly into the aluminum. Let me say this: the time that was spent designing this phone and the manufacturing detail that went into crafting it is absolutely marvelous and shows when you hold and use the phone. The lines are clean and the phone has a premium feel in your hand. The only little issue I have with the design is that the home button placement and power button are kind of awkward to hit in normal use. You have to move your hand up and down the phone in order to reach them, but you do get used to this quickly. A small thing about the design: Sprint did not place any carrier branding on this phone making it look much more clean. Bravo Sprint! The Galaxy S4 uses a polycarbonate body. I personally don't have anything against plastic. However, the S4 has a smooth finish that makes the phone feel greasy when you hold it from the oils that accumulate on the surface. My last phone was a Galaxy S2 (with textured plastic so the oils didn't accumulate) and I loved it because I never worried about damaging it. I can't say the same for the One. I always fear that if I drop it, the phone will dent or scratch which will be very noticeable. However, my love for the gorgeous aluminum body and precise manufacturing far outweighs the fears that linger in the back of my mind of damage.10/10Display: the HTC one features an LCD 3 1080p display. What does that mean? It has as many pixels as your HDTV crammed into a 4.7-inch screen. The colors on this phone are accurate and pleasant to look at. Coming from an AMOLED screen (what is on the s4) to an LCD was a very big change. An AMOLED screen has much more vibrant and saturated colors, whereas the LCD has more true-to-life colors. Honestly to me, I really like the accuracy in colors and sharpness that the One provides. The S4 will provide the same sharpness, just with more vibrant colors. Truth is, more people like the AMOLED than the LCD, but it is all person preference. Here is what I can say: like the design, I believe that this screen is incredible and second to none. The color reproduction and sharpness just cannot be matched by other display technologies.10/10Camera: Here is where I begin to get mixed feelings about the phone. People argue \"it's not 4 megapixels, it's 4 ULTRApixels..\" Here is the truth: yes it is ultra pixels, but ultra is just a marketing term used to make people not look down on the fact that it is 4 megapixels and a megapixel is a megapixel. The fact is that the megapixel is the only metric that a consumer has ever been taught to gauge a camera by and more megapixels does not mean better images. In fact, a 4 megapixel camera takes a 2240 x 1680 picture. That is a good deal larger than a 1080p display. So what is the advantage of an ultrapixel over a megapixel? The answer is light. I won't bore you with the science of it all, but basically each pixel allows 300% more photons to be absorbed by the sensor, which leads to crisper images. Every pixel on the HTC one gets a more accurate snapshot of what it is photographing. Another advantage of the ultrapixel is since it lets in more light, it takes incredible lowlight shots. Where other cameras see darkness, the One can get a clear image. If you want to just use your phone to capture images for Facebook, instagram, snapchat, or even to show on a 1080p screen, the HTC will perform better than almost any phone on the market. However, if you want to edit your photos in something like photoshop or zoom in really far on them, this isn't the best camera. So the advantages of the One's camera: excellent image quality for the pixels that it has, phenomenal low light performance, rapid snapshots and fast storage. The disadvantages: it is only 4 megapixels. I have really mixed feelings about it. It is certainly a great camera, but I really wish that it could capture higher resolution. I cannot ignore, however, the amazing technological feat that is the ultrapixel and I applaud HTC for taking the phone in this unique direction. This camera at 8 megapixels would be the best smartphone camera to ever exist, but as it stands now, it is only good.7/10Reception, radios, and call quality: I have to be fair, my last phone, the S2, held onto a signal like no other phone. Maybe it is just the stark contrast of going from a phone that did such an excellent job to an average phone, but I have to say I am really underwhelmed by reception. I still can get reception almost anywhere, and this truly is not a large problem. This phone has a plethora of radios within: NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, wifi a/c (newest standard that I am impressed was included; makes this phone future proof for wifi), an IR blaster to control your TV, GSM (yes, GSM!) radios for global roaming, standard sprint CDMA radios, and 1900mhz LTE radios. I am really let down that sprint and HTC only have 1900mhz radios inside of this phone for LTE, and let me explain why. As Sprint builds out their 4G LTE network, they will be deploying in two frequencies: 1900 and 800. 1900 has its own set of advantages, but one disadvantage is that it doesn't have the best building penetration, 800 on the other hand does. By not including a networking technology that they will be deploying next year, HTC one buyers will have to \"enjoy\" a poorer network experience inside of buildings in comparison to those with 800mhz radios in their phones. This isn't a deal breaker, and 95% of the people with this phone wont even know the difference. Call quality is superb. What makes it so great is the noise cancelation that this phone has. I was in a crowded concrete stairwell and was practically shouting into my phone to overcome the perceived noise around me. The person on the other end asked why I was doing that. The noise cancellation was so good that they could hear me, even when I was talking in a normal voice. Props for that HTC. So for this lengthy section here is the rundown: lots of good radios, many future proof, but no 800mhz LTE, reception is acceptable but not exceptional, and call quality is superb.8/10Performance: This phone is seriously overpowered. It has a 1.7ghz quad core processor, that is more processing power than most computers have. Couple that with 2 gb of ram and you have a powerhouse. Combined with the very well optimized software, there is no hint of lag anywhere.10/10Software: HTC sense. Well it is sense. Some like it, some don't. I will probably root my phone and put on a stock rom. For those who don't though, this software is very clean and modern looking and also very optimized for the hardware so the system shows no lag. One thing is for sure: it is much better than touch wiz (samsung's software). My one minor quibble: the one is not running the most recent version of android, but that truly isn't a big deal as it has almost all of the same software features as 4.2.9/10Battery life: This phone has been regularly lasting me all day and I will plug it in when I get home at night or go to bed. I haven't really had any trouble with it, although others complain that they do.9/10Marketed specs: what's a gimmick and what is useful?Ultrapixels: Useful. They capture incredibly crisp photos even though the megapixel count is low.Zoe: Gimmick. I have yet to find a good use for this. If I want a bunch of high-resolution photos, I would just do the rapid capture and choose my best shot.Blinkfeed: A useful gimmick. There are times when I go to blink feed to quickly get a look at news, but should it be your default home screen? No.Boom Sound: USEFUL. This is one of my favorite features of the phone. Let me start by saying, I HATE beats. Beats in and of itself is the larges gimmick of all, it is just a customized audio filter. However, on the One HTC optimized the speakers and beats to work very well together. The result: The BEST phone speakers that you have ever heard. Is this a viable substitute for a good pair of headphones? Of course not. Will this sound FAR better, louder, and more dynamic that any other phone on the market? Hell yes.IR Blaster: Useful. You can use this as a remote with your TV. I have mine set up and it is really useful when I cannot find the remote or when I am using my phone while watching TV.Sense voice: Useful. The noise cancelation is really useful when on the phone.Summary: The HTC one has quite a few competitors: the Nexus 4, iPhone 5, and Galaxy S4. For people looking into an android phone today it will probably come down to the S4 vs the One. Here are MY PERSONAL thoughts on it. The HTC One delivers many useful features with only a few gimmicks. Samsung on the other hand also has many useful features, but they also have many others that are gimmicks. Many of them make for a good sales pitch in a store but are impractical in day-to-day usage. The one area where the Galaxy S4 does win however, is on specs. It has a marginally better processor, slightly more modern ram, some additional sensors, and a larger battery. However, and this is my personal opinion, where the phone does not excel is in design. And this is why I chose the HTC one. Both have more than adequate power to get you through a two-year contract, but the One has the look and premium feel that you will enjoy for that contract. Will you like a Galaxy S4 if you get it? You probably will, but when compared to the superb design of this phone, I just think that it falls short. My honest advice? If you know what the difference between DDR3 Ram and DDR2 Ram, go ahead and get the Galaxy S4. If you have no idea what that it and enjoy a beautiful, clean device that is packed with features but not gimmicky, spring for the HTC One. I'm sure glad that I did.Averaged score: 9/10 (rounds up to 5 stars)Update 7/27/13: After 3 months of ownership, I have found my major quibbles with this phone. The one thing that I REALLY dislike about this phone is how loud the vibration is. Vibration is supposed to be a subtle thing, not something that is as loud as your ringtone (slightly exaggerated, but not by much). My other quibble is that the chamfered edge of this phone is incredibly prone to scratching. I have my phone in hand a lot, so often I will accidentally hit it on something. Those hits have translated into scratches. They aren't major scratches, but I am obsessive about the appearance of my device, so it really bothers me. Just figured I would let you guys know. I still feel the same about everything else about this phone and would highly recommend it!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "The ONE to Rule Them All", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "RAENRHNFLM0IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7\" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic. For better or for worse, if you are used to the old Sense UI's, you will need some readjusting. Personally, I like this new one better. If you're a casual news reader, then you'll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources - some of its own partners, some for your Facebook and Twitter, etc. - to form a Flipboard style of news reader. Personally, I'm a huge Pulse news reader fan, so I only use that.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC One - Back with a Bang!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1X9Z2Q8657TO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is HTC on the verge a splashing comeback? HTC reminds me of Apple in mid 90s when they were struggling. People had ruled out HTC but they have come back with a bang! I upgraded one of my family phones to HTC One. I have a Galaxy Note 2, and recently used S4 for an extensive period. So at places I may compare with what I have experienced.HTC One build is excellent, smartphone design absolutely amazing, and a delight to hold. Aluminum is used for the backplate and sides, making it an all-aluminum body. It certainly feels better than Samsung phones in some areas. The ergonomics and looks of HTC One are stunning. The screen size is certainly smaller than Note 2 and even S4.4.7 in screen with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels. Full HD 469 ppi (Corning Gorilla Glass 2, Gorilla Glass is the alkali-aluminosilicate sheet toughened glass manufactured by glassmaker Corning.  Version 2 of Glass was introduced in 2012). The phone is thin and light. I highly recommend you to try it at a nearby store. Reading reviews do no justice to the phone; once you experience it, you will drool. I am happy there is a stiff competition between phone vendors. I don't have attachment to any one vendor. I am open to trying all vendors.HTC One runs Jellybean Android 4.1.2, using HTC's Sense user interface, not sure if it will be upgradeable to version 5.0 \"Key Lime Pie\". We may see 4.2.2, or 4.3 version of JellyBean rumored for Google I/O in May 15-17 2013, just a week away as I write this review.Key Notes:* Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor running at 1.7GHz with 2GB of RAM* 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac support future proof for now. Note the support of \"ac\"* GPS, NFC, gyro, accelerometer, proximity, ambient lightAWESOME speakers. Per HTC, stereo speakers come with amplifiers, and Beats Audio technology for deeper bass. HTC one also has 2 microphones for reducing noise.* Camera is awesome; don't let the 4 MP fool you. It is the old photographer's adage. It is the not the megapixel, it's the sensor that matters! This camera is very light sensitive, and I was able to get great photos in low light situations.* micro-USB port for battery charging supports MHL, so if you buy an adapter you can use HDMI. Lot of people are not aware of MHL and not widely popularized. Basically you can make your smartphone into a giant computer. Connect smartphones to HDMI monitors or HDTVs, use Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and control smartphone. Per Wikipedia \"Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an industry standard for a mobile audio/video interface that allows consumers to connect mobile phones, tablets and other portable consumer electronics (CE) devices to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and audio receivers. The MHL standard supports up to 1080p/60 high-definition (HD) video and 7.1 surround sound audio while simultaneously charging the connected device.\"  DLNA Support is also included. These are awesome features indeed, and not noted much.* Just like the Samsung Galaxy feature, HTC One also works as an infrared sensor for controlling the consumer devicesSome cons:* 32 GB/64 GB models , but Lack of microSD card support may come as an issue for some* Battery cannot be removed (Li-Po 2300 mAh battery)* microSIM card is released by punching a paper clip. Just like iphones. As battery is not removable, this design is adopted by HTC* To Note: unlike international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, featuring a Micro SD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Dual SIMs are very popular in Asia not in US.* Crapware/Bloatware. Why do the phone manufacturers think they are adding value by adding software like Blinkfeed which cannot be removed. HTC advertises as a feature, I view it as a nuisance. There are no alternatives except vanilla Google Nexus phones. ASUS adds its own extra software, Samsung has its own. I feel they at least make provisions to remove these crapware. Remember windows PC in late 90s loaded with all kinds of stuffs which no one ever usedI have tried following apps from my Play library and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAmazon Kindle (very sharp for quick reading, I use black background white text)AndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), was AWESOME!Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle Music (I have over 10,000 songs/podcasts) and it is free!Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of Widgets - BatteryPro, SwitchProPlease ask questions.

The WiFi on the new phone works perfectly.  If you have a WiFi issue, and have all of the updates, exchange your phone asap.Last thoughts: I definitely would not have purchased this device had I paid attention to the irreplaceable battery; I'm dreading the low life expectancy of this device that is going to cause.  The battery gets crazy hot, which is not good for battery longevity either.  Otherwise, this is and OK tablet/phone.Original:I chose this phone over the Samsung Galaxy S4, and here is what I've discovered:The Bad:No MicroSD.  What you get is all you get.  With all major smart phones coming with MicroSD , I didn't even think to check.  While this phone comes with a whopping 32G onboard, that's all you will ever have.  And since my plan is through Sprint--there is bloatware already trimming the limited space. I had plans for my 32G mSD to make this a powerhouse media trinket--but it's simply not going to happen. With the 16GB on-board and 32 GB card, the original EVO 4g has significantly more memory than the One.Cannot replace battery.  Another item I took for granted--lesson learned.  When this battery stops holding a full charge, this phone will be a brick.  This is simply not an intelligent option, nor is it environmentally sound.  Battery goes--purchase a new phone.  This is one of the reasons I refuse to purchase Apple products--and now HTC is playing this game. Edit: Sprint sales informed me everyone except Samsung has claimed this is how all the new phones will be delivered (Not that Samsung won't, they just haven't announced they will).Junk WiFi antenna.  This machine simply cannot maintain connection to any WiFi source.  This causes issues with downloading apps, watching Netflix, and time-outs on websites.  Imagine someone randomly unplugging your computer when you are in the middle of something . . . all day long.  Fun times. EDIT: No, the WiFi issues are not from the Power Saver function.  They happen regardless of if Power Saver is on, and Power Saver has an option to not shut down data.OS is not friendly for one handed use.  There are several options that you have to use the top of the screen, away from the natural holding position of the phone.  You will need to use the entirety of this large display to use the OS.  Can be aggravating, and is definitely slow.Microphone is placed in an idiotic area.  If the phone isn't held just right your voice doesn't get picked up well.  Also, I prefer to hold my phone on three sides, thus reducing the risk of dropping an expensive piece of equipment.  The microphone is offset so if I hold it in my left hand, my finger covers it and no one can hear anything I say.  Why doesn't it have the microphone built into the front alongside the bottom speakers?  Even if it was in the center it wouldn't have the cover-up issue.  Basically it was designed to be difficult to hold onto. (Edit, I use my left hand most of the time to hold the phone--not same issue with right hand)Massive battery draining widget-home-screen that is mandatory.  The home screen may be changed, but the widget cannot be removed.  One slice of real-estate tab is useless thanks to HTC, and only 4 more tabs total may be added.  Even if you don't select any feeds, the PoS widget keeps connecting to update.  Terrible.Buttons too flush with device.  This does make the device look sweet, but it is unresponsive to button presses and the user needs to really pay attention to them. Especially the power button. Edit: these loosen up with use.No manual.  In the flyer it claims they put it online to be more \"green\" (cheap), but with poor signal and no house internet--useless.The Good:The screen is beautiful.  Large real-estate with high dpi display makes viewing everything a pleasure.Amazing camera.  This simply has the best phone camera I have ever used.  Video is astounding and the still images pop.  The image capture is exceedingly fast, and the low-light functionality is unmatched in a phone.  This alone is the best feature this device has to offer, and is the one thing I will miss terribly when I take this phone back. Edit: even with calibration, it is not as responsive or accurate as the EVO 4G.Processor speed.  This device is fast, fast, fast.  It reboots quicker than anything else and flies through app startup and menu navigation. Heavily tabbed browsing doesn't even cause it to skip, slow, or jitter.  Simply great power.The power/USB outlet is back on the bottom of the phone! This thrills me and I hope it is a trend that device manufacturers re-embrace.  This allows much easier use of the phone while it is plugged in, both when attached to media centers or use in hand.The OK:Light weight.  This phone is comfortable and light weight even though it has a metal case.  However, this is in part due to an irreplaceable battery.Thin. This phone is wonderfully thin and fits nicely in all pockets--though see comment on battery.Sound. The sound is good, and has decent max volume.  Not quite enough for a road trip, more than enough for games.  Sound is quite nice with headphones, but so was my original EVO. Beats is unimpressive overall--not a particular selling point, but nothing wrong with it either.There are OS issues with the device I could go into, but if someone wants to alter their interface those issues would go away so I felt they ultimately weren't worth detailing.  They are also likely to be on any comparable device.The HTC One is a better device than the EVO LTE, but sadly doesn't compare to the sheer usability and friendliness of the original EVO.This phone has most likely ended my love affair with HTC products.  I purchased the original EVO when it was released, and after four years had to stop using it due to the screen going bad.  I had purchased the EVO LTE when it was released just to have a newer, more awesome, smartphone--but had to return it to Sprint, due to the wireless antenna in the LTE was garbage and couldn't stay connected to Sprint's towers.  Over a year later, I'm finding that HTC just doesn't want to recreate the pure success it had with the original EVO and it is time for me to move on to another manufacturer.  I am going to replace my EVO screen and go from there.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top-Notch Performance & Value", "Author": "wjohnson357", "ReviewID": "R2QFTZG4K9ZM2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I did not purchase this phone through Amazon.com but rather through an in-store retailer... Still, I purchased this exact phone as an upgrade to my existing Sprint line of service, have thus far been extremely impressed, and want to share my experience with a broad audience. There are lots of great things about this phone and a few potential downfalls which I will list below.PROS:Build quality - I'll keep this short, the build quality is excellent, extremely high quality. On par or exceeds any other phone on the market. In fairness though, if I had to do it all over again I'd probably choose the silver over the black model, just bc the black is somewhat more prone to finger prints, smudging, and scuffing.Screen - I came from an iPhone 4S, and the screen on this bad boy is top-notch. The bright, LCD screen measures 4.7 inches across and has a full HD/1080p resolution display. That translates to an absurdly sharp 400+ ppi. The size is virtually perfect as well, I have fairly small hands but can still navigate this phone with ease, which is something I can't say about lots of new Android phones on the market.Audio - I listen to a lot of music, and the front-facing speakers & audio software on this phone, i.e. what HTC calls \"Boomsound,\" provide hands-down the best audio I have ever heard from a mobile device. Heck, the audio is better than some laptops I've heard. It's surprisingly loud, clear, and sharp.Performance & UI - I was concerned before making my purchase as the One has been on the market for most of this year, and as we know, in the smartphone world a month can be an eternity for performance. Even so, the quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor & 2 gbs of RAM provide good performance. HTC's Sense 5, although admittedly not perfect, is light for an Android skin. It doesn't bog down performance in my experience, and I'll admit to loving the graphical presentation of the UI.Data Speeds - 4G LTE ... need I say more? Coming from a 3G only phone, the performance boost on Sprint's network here in New Orleans is remarkable. I'm consistently getting between 5-10 mbps download / 3-5 mbps upload. Compared to 4G speeds on other carriers, I know that may not sound impressive, but it's plenty fast. In fact, it's faster than my home wifi. Still, Sprint's LTE network coverage is spotty and this may vary in your location.Value - I paid $49 for the phone with a 2 year contract extension, which IMO is a great price (and the same as what Amazon is currently asking). You get a lot of bang for your buck, the phone always seems to have a trick up it's sleeve, (for example, the phone comes out the box with a super functional IR blaster to control your TV) and comes standard with 32 gigs of storage on board.CONSBloatware - I know this is more of an Android issue and isn't specific to the HTC One, but the amount of bloatware on the phone was borderline obscene, I wish I could easily delete the bloatware I neither need nor want. <-- Carriers and manufacturers, I'm talking to you here!Camera - while not per se bad, it's not spectacular either. Even though low light performance is pretty good, color noise can be a problem, and the camera struggles with accurate color reproduction.Battery - it's just OK, with moderate to heavy use and battery saver mode enabled, I still can't get a full day's worth of juice out the phone. I'd say battery life isn't even on par with my old iPhone 4S, and considering the 4S had a far smaller battery, this has been one area of disappointment.Conclusion: I cannot fairly give this phone anything but the highest review.

It feels good, it looks great and it's performance is phenomenal.  I was probably most impressed with it's battery life.  With moderate use I go about a day and a half without charging.  Even with heavy use I get a full day without charging.My one complaint is that everything is LOUD.  Even at it's lowest volume levels, ring tones and notifications are louder than I'm used to.  My Bluetooth headset was so loud that it could be used as a speaker phone.  Fortunately, a  quick fix was a small piece of tape over the headset's speaker deadened the volume enough to make it bearable.  In searching the Internet it appears that this is a common complaint about the One.  Hopefully a future software update will fix the problem.If I could change anything in the One's design it would be the inclusion of an SD slot.  I have a lot of music files that I like to keep on the phone and unfortunately 32GB just isn't enough.  I suppose that I can live with fewer tunes if I have to.Even with the  problems outlined above, I would strongly recommend this phone.

My previous mobile experience is with an iPad II - which I've had for a couple years and did not choose an iPhone as my first smartphone - that should say something. I love the HTC One and do NOT regret my decision at all. I should also state that I'm not a POWER smart-phone user, but I did my research on this and other phones for months before making up my mind. This phone has a large, bright screen, is powerful and has lots of customizations that I can setup to my liking. I love the powerful, dual stereo speakers that are FRONT facing - they sound great when watching videos or listening to music. I REALLY love that I don't have to have iTunes on my laptop to move pictures and music around between various devices. What a pain that is with the iPad!! I rarely use the BlinkFeed screen so have set my home screen to another tab - but it seems to be easy to use. But I text several hundred a month and the virtual keyboard is very intelligent - more so than the iPad. The apps that I have downloaded work fine. I read a few emails, and other online publications just fine. The battery life for me is better than expected. It connects to my home wifi quickly whenever in range and stays connected. As far as battery life, I sometimes 4 days when I just use the phone for a phone and text and a few other apps. Most of the time I get 3 days tho. I also charge it when the battery drops to about 20%. Charging time is relatively quick.This phone will definitely do more than I need, but for $0.01 with a 2-yr subscription with Sprint, I am happy. I have had no usability issues - no call drops - no unplanned reboots. And the apps available on the Google store are more than enough. I would say the Apple App Store is easier to use by a little bit, than the Google store, but no big deal.

That has been done by some very excellent reviewers here already.I've been wanting to get this since the summer of 2013 when I checked out the excellent reviews on the HTC One. Couldn't wait to get rid of my Samsung Galaxy SII. What a piece of absolute junk that phone was. It scores a whopping 2.9 star rating from Amazon reviewers... that is a 58% approval rating. Pretty sad. Enough said about that POS!My first smartphone back in 2010 was the HTC Droid Incredible, which I really liked... albeit the small 3.7\" screen at the time. It would get a little buggy once in a while... but it was a very good phone. So I thought I would go back and try another HTC product and I'm glad I did.Pros:Excellent build, sturdy and thin. Doesn't feel like a cheap plastic toy like the Samsung's.Crystal clear LCD 1920X1080p screen. The Amoled screens like on the Samsung's look more colorful... but the colors are saturated compared to an LCD screen. LCD screens are more life-like and easier to see outside in the daylight.Excellent front-facing stereo built-in amplified speakers. Good volume, clear sound with no distortion at max. It gives you that nice stereo effect that finally matches the external audio experience with the excellent 1080p video quality. These have to be the best smartphone stereo speakers on the market. Is there even another company that puts out dual stereo speakers on a smartphone? I believe they're all mono... could be wrong.This phone is fast with a Snapdragon 600 Quad-Core 1.7 Ghz processor. I believe Samsung has the faster processor... but can you really tell the difference in speed between the two with the naked eye? I don't think so.HTC Sense 5.5: Wow... this OS is so smooth... exactly like Apple... as smooth as butter.Cons:Sprint's 4G LTE. I live in Orange county, CA. The map shows that Sprint's 4G LTE coverage is absolutely saturated with it. But at home in Anaheim it defaults to 3G. That's pretty sad. I was picking up full bars with 4G Max with the Samsung. Not good. I realize Sprint is the last carrier to get their LTE towers up, so maybe this will improve over time. Not too sure about that with Sprint. If not... I will be forced to switch over to AT&T; or rip-off price gouging Verizon in the future.I don't care for the placement of the power button on the top left of the phone. Should be on the side top right for easier access with one hand. Minor quibble though.That's it for the cons so far. If things change, I will update this review.P.S. This HTC One has been out for almost a year now, and still is one of the top of the line smartphones out there today. That's pretty impressive in itself to say the least.I don't think any smartphone is perfect. I would rate it exactly what the current rating is right now which is a 4.5 (90%).... But I give it a 5 star rating so not to bring it lower than it's 4.5 rating. If you feel the same as I do, I would encourage you to rate it the same.BB", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Juanita Calvo", "ReviewID": "RHAJVVYVDA741", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it overall.

My first smartphone was the EVO, then I upgraded to the EVO 4G LTE, and now to the One. That's not to say that it is a given that I will go with HTC, they just keep winning my business when it's upgrade time and I'm comparing phones leading the market at the time. I've had my eye on the One since it came out a year ago and finally got my hands on it :)PROS:1) The design is sweet and feels rock solid compared to the plastic bodied models I've used, including my wife's S4. The only other phone that has the same feeling of solidity is an iPhone. The screen is sharp, colors and contrast are great. I have always preferred the LCD's to the AMOLED's, I just think the AMOLED screens (like the one on the S4) are too color-saturated.2) The dual front speakers really do sound amazing. I listen to a lot of music through my phone and the clarity is phenomenal. People have said they thought it wasn't as loud as they'd like, but I don't feel that way. Also, if you turn off the Beats audio the speakers are louder.3) Sense UI is still hands-down the best Android flavor IMHO. Stock Android feels too sparse for me, Samsung's offering is cluttered and unintuitive, but Sense is always stylish, clean, and easy to use.4) I love Blinkfeed. I use it all the time, and as of the Sense 5.5 update it got even more customizable and it can now be removed if you don't want it on your home screen.5) Processor is snappy, no surprise there. Battery life easily gets me through the day unless I spend hours playing games (which has been known to happen).6) Camera is sharp, and handles low-light better than any phone I've used. I know people can quibble about which phone has the best camera, but while I was frustrated with the quality of the cameras on my EVOs, I'm finally happy with the image quality I'm getting with the One. I would put it on similar footing with the S4. Video is sharp too, and filming my dog and baby in slo-mo is entertaining :)7) I got the 32 GB version so plenty of HD space. Personally I don't like to leave app clutter on my phone, I uninstall apps once I'm done with them, so 16 GB wasn't bad previously but it's nice to have some extra breathing room.CONS:1) Not really a con, but I prefer to turn off the Beats audio when I'm not listening to music. I think the extra clarity makes calls sound odd, almost metallic.2) The placement and height of the power and volume buttons took me a couple of weeks to get used to. The buttons being flush with the body made it sort of aggravating to try to use the phone one-handed, but now that I'm used to it I don't even think about it.CONCLUSION:This is a phenomenal phone! I love it and after a year of anticipation and researching other phones I am very happy that I bought it (and you can't beat the $0.01 deal they have on here). The One is solid, has great software, more hardware than my last laptop, and emphasizes the things that are important to me (reasonable camera quality, sound quality, processing speed, battery life, ease-of-use). My temporary frustration with the button placement is not nearly enough to make me knock a star off of what I consider to be a near-perfect offering from HTC.

Fortunately you can set another screen to be your home screen.I miss not having a memory card slot, but the HTC transfer app made up for most of it. My custom ring tones did not transfer and I have to re-download and install all of them myself. Are you reading this HTC? This is not just HTC, just about all phone makers are getting rid of the card slots so they can charge us $100 for $15 worth of memory...I do have a second complaint, the camera works great but making prints bigger than 4x6 shows the lack of resolution.

This is the one feature the reviews have latched on to and probably the only thing keeping this from beating the S4.On top of the feel and build quality of this phone, the screen is top notch.

After talking to S4 owners and beginning to read about this phone, (HTC One), on my favorite tech sites I began to waiver towards the new HTC One. My son and his wife were former owners of the EVO 3D with the 3D camera at the same time I bought my S2. When they started having so many problems with their EVO 3D's I was convinced that the S2 was the best phone for me. For the next two years I reveled on how great my S2 was and vowed to repeat my success with another Samsung phone. I even purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 7 and have been thrilled for about a year now. But I kept hearing about this new HTC One and how attractive it was, both inside and out. After months of research and taking my favorite tech sites and several mobile phone sales reps advice, I decided to take the plunge. I have had the phone for about a week and all I can say is, this phone is absolutely ridiculous!!!! It is smooth, fast, and intuitive. I love that it is not loaded with all the ridiculous bloatware and features that quite frankly, I might use once or twice and then forget about them eventually. I can't imagine a better designed phone for not just my job but for every day life. From the high definition camera and screen and the amazing Beats Audio sound to the incredible dual front firing speakers and the all aluminum one piece body with Gorilla Glass 2 screen. It's physical design and fit and finish are unparalleled in todays market of cookie cutter phone designs. HTC actually took a step back and designed a phone for people that care as much about form and function as they do about performance and quality.

There are only a couple of annoying design flaws that prevents it from being the perfect Android device:1) No SD card slot.2) No menu button.The first flaw can't be helped. Somebody at the HTC development department clearly has brain damamge. Cloud storage is not an excuse. No HTC, it really is not. We don't always have WiFi access. Nevertheless, 32 GB goes a surprisingly long way.The second flaw can be somewhat fixed. Go to \"Settings\" -> \"Display, Gestures and buttons\" -> \"Start button\" and select the second option. Now a long-click on the home button works as a menu button. Good enough for me, but an actual menu button would have been nicer than an unclickable HTC logo.Despite those two problems, HTC One is an extremely pleasant user experience.

The best part of ZOE, is that you get pictures of unexpected moments from someone sneezing to dumb faces people make when they think you are waiting for others. The ultra pixel is also great for late night photos, and since I work nights, I don't have to worry about the lightening.Screen - Coming from a IPhone 4 user, the screen size is a major plus. I can easily read any news articles and watch videos with much more enjoyment than the 4 inch screen.Senses 5 - Although many users do not like this feature, I really love it. I like the fact that I don't have to scavenge different news sites for all my news articles, I just have to set my Blinkfeed to what I would like and I have all the articles delivered to me. As for scrolling through the apps, it feels much more natural with up and down scrolling.Design - The design of the HTC One is solid. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy 3 and 4, the HTC One feels like a premium product rather than a cheaply made one. The front facing speakers allow for much better sound during videos or just listening to music from the phone. The curve of the back of the phone makes for easy handling.

I've been a big fan of HTC phones and I even planned on getting a Galaxy S3 or S4 recently but couldn't pass up on the deal Amazon gave for this phone at the time.As a gamer I enjoy reading articles about what's going on in the industry and this phone helps out quite a bit by allowing me to set the home screen to display gaming news articles from some of my favorite sites.  At first I thought I wouldn't care for the home screen and after making a few modifications (not allowing FaceBook posts to appear...primarily) it turned out great!The phone is fast and after a month and loading all my favorite apps and games it's still as fast as it was when I unboxed it.  It has 32G of onboard storage and no way to increase that via SD card.  If you use some cloud storage apps (DropBox) for photo and video storage it certainly helps keep your storage space wide open.  I've put about 10 albums of music on here and with my 20-30 apps I've only used between 2 to 3 gigs of space.One of the best features this phone has is the dual front speakers.  This thing gets loud and it's amazing!  I listen to music on my phone when I run on my treadmill and I have almost no problems hearing it unless I crank it up past 7mph...and that's impressive.  I recently jacked this thing into some external speakers when I run and the sound output is crazy loud at max volume...so loud that I have it under half volume and it's nearly loud enough to drowned out the treadmill.  The other feature in the music app on the phone is the visualize part which scrolls the lyrics to most new albums as they're sung.  So if you can run and sing at the same time this is great!  Exhausting...but great.The only thing that I've been slightly weary about is the 4MP camera.  Yes it is no ordinary camera technology because it uses enhanced low light tech, and you can use the Zoe feature, but sometimes a simple camera shot doesn't seem as great as it could be.  I may just be used to the 8MP on the 4G LTE, but most pics turn out great and you have the Zoe feature to help ensure you get at least one good picture every time you take a shot.Gaming apps run really well on this phone and I haven't had any problems with them yet.  I know the S3-S4 is probably the better option for mobile gamers...I'm not a huge mobile gamer (at least not on phones).  But if you don't want a giant 5\" screen phone, this is a good choice for you.  The size is perfect for people with average to smaller hand sizes and the phone feels amazing.  The casing is smooth and overall just wonderful feeling.  I can't explain it very well; you'd be better off picking one up and trying it for yourself!

I used my Evo for 4 years before switching to this.  The battery in this is about 5 times better than the Evo (which really sucked and I always carried 3 batteries with me) albeit not removable.  I have gone 12 hours on heavy use and 24 hours on light use.  We shall see in two years how much it has diminished and whether HTC will have a way of replacing it.  Even though I am not a techie, I like tinkering with stuff.  The first thing I did was to unlock the phone through the HTC site...what a pain in the neck as you have about 10 or so steps to follow. I then rooted it, which allows me to take advantage of some special programs.  I suppose since I am rooted, I can remove BlinkFeed that many folks complain about by loading a custom Rom, but I have seen no harm in it.  In fact, I think the phone will be boring without it.  I have only used the camera to take a couple of pics and I have nothing good or bad to say about it as that is not a reason why I bought the phone.  I must say that the ability to do instant edits with Zoe is a plus.  The phone is extremely fast and the 32 GB is more than I will ever need. My other selling point is that the sim card can replaced for overseas use; after 90 days, you can ask Sprint to remove their restriction.  I travel a lot and that is exactly what I need.  Nonetheless, even without it, I was able to use my Evo overseas with Wifi and Google Voice.  That is the beauty of having an integrated Android system.  I had been avoiding a contract for years, but I sucked it up on this because the price I paid was too good to pass up...$50!  $100-50 for trading in old phone).Forgot to add, the speakers are the best thing you've ever heard from a phone!

Prior to getting the HTC One, I was using an iPhone 4s. I should clarify that I was very happy with that phone, in particular 20 months ago when I first got it. However, I was eligible for an upgrade and impatient, and didn't think the iPhone 5 was enough of an upgrade. I was willing to wait for the next apple phone if I was convinced it was going to be better. But after seeing and using ios 7, i am not convinced. Perhaps I am wrong and the next Apple phone will be dramatically different, but that small chance wasn't worth the wait. Not to mention it seems to me that almost every 'new' feature that Apple is advertising is something that other phones already do. As I said before, I wasn't unhappy with Apple, I would still recommend them, but I felt like they have gotten pretty stale these days and aren't really on the leading edge anymore. After doing some research, I decided on the HTC One. I was deciding between the HTC One or the Galaxy S4. For me, I think it came down to the feel of the phone. I was a little concerned the screen would be too big, but I haven't found that to be the case.I have had the phone for about a month now and i am really enjoying it. I think the feature that I enjoy most is the Zoe highlight thing. I frequently use it to capture 3 second videos rather than just pictures, and am amazed how it creates 30 second professional looking highlight videos of my events.Anyways, I could get into more detail about all features and other specs, but you can find them elsewhere.

Love the FULL rich stereo sound ( it does NOT have the sound like a home theater system would but is very nice sounding)The manufacture (HTC) allows anyone who buys it to UNLOCK it from there site for FREE .The video is really beautiful even in day light . I ordered the BLACK version and I am glad I did because it is so much more good looking than the silver version.But the only drawback that I notice from this model and the Samsung S4 is this HTC ONE does NOT have the option to add additional storage. But I think that is ok because I have a HP Tablet 32gig and I have never come close to using all the space on it .PS:::::: NOW for the BAD NEWS I dont kknow if I got a DUD or not because mine did this weird thing  meaning I would sync it to my computer and load all my contact on it and then after disconnecting it was good to go but in about 30 minutes or so I would get this notification pop on the screen saying Load Sprint default configuration you have to choose OK button on middle of screen. IT would NOT allow you to say NO or BY pass this screen with out agreeing to it.. When you do agree to it I found out that it completely WIPES the phones CONTACTS off and anything else you have stored or downloaded or uploaded to it. So I sync it again and low and behold 30 minutes later while I was still playing and learning the phone there it is again the ( LOAD SPRINT DEFAULT CONFIGURATION  ( OK ) so I agreeded to it again think i might had done something wrong the first time and Low and Behold it WIPED the CONTACTS and a Couple videos I had uploaded to it. This was strange so after about 8 times of this i came to the conclusion that there is a major software problem with this phone because I even contacted HTC and they never heard of this problem.. I also check the rom version from the one that is on Sprint site because this is where the download was coming from an OTA update and the one on SPRINT site is the same file and rom version that is already on this phone so i dont have an answer why and also HTC doesn't have a reason why its doing this ( BY the way SPRINT  does NOT know either )  most people know if you call sprint TECH that goes with out saying its just a WASTE of time calling them.I am waiting an answer from HTC to see if they can duplicate this issue to see what the cause was.SPRINT DISPLAY MODEL DID NOT DO WHAT THIS ONE DIDThe unfortunate part now is that I had to send it back after only 3 days of activation.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC One, still # 1", "Author": "Imanaby", "ReviewID": "RUI3Z9YCP4S20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast & furious.

Sense is actually nice to use, though it could still use some tweaks here and there (and what couldn't). Blinkfeed, once set up with the feeds you are interested in is enjoyable as well. I do like how you can have all the feeds mixed or you can just show feeds from certain areas at a time (like just Facebook, or just Twitter). One part about it i really like is how once you click on a section (other than Facebook) it gives you a longer summary or even the whole article without loading it up in a browser.
