Nobody has this phone/color combo.- Killer looks. The glass front is mind-blowing. Photo doesn't do it justice.- Killer size.

Very solid; lightyears ahead of the RAZR.- Sound quality is top-notch. Excellent reception.- Camera is actually very, very good. I was very, very surprised.- Works with all my old RAZR accessories.Cons: (barely justifiable to even call them that)- A couple of the included games/java apps were in Chinese.- The phone language. \"Centre\" instead of \"Center\", Personalise instead of \"Personalize\" - Not really a big deal.

The phone has great reception, the sound quality & volumn are very good, the menus are very easy to get around,it fits your face well (not too short as many phones now are) and operating the phone is simple. This phone is clearly evident of Motorola's evolution in the cell-phone industry.  By the way, you can customize the \"soft-keys\" to be whatever you want them to be. Likewise, you can customize the menus to appear as you would like.  They have really thought of the user and have made this phone very User Friendly as well.  It seems that the majority of the people I talk to aren't as interested in \"whistles & bells\" as much as they just want a plain old GOOD phone.  This is it!  However, if you want more, you can load your MP3 music on to it, you can use the calendar, you can take a picture, and if you are really adventurous, you can access the internet, and also retreive your email! By the way, this phone is capable of taking advantage of the Cingular/AT&T; EDGE network which gives you 'faster than usual' internet.  I highly recommend this Good Looking, Well Working phone.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pretty good phone with standard Motorola issues", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2Q1HNTFY2WEAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hung on to my old v60i in the hope that Motorola would fix their user interface, this one is substantially different, but the bad features of the v60i remain. The side buttons.As of 5/22/08 I'm about ready to hurl this from the roof. The UI is just too inconvenient. I've also had to replace the battery once.6/13/08 Enough already! I replaced it with a Nokia E51. On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive, they require deliberate use, and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway. The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&T; could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&T; to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good: The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version, whatever that was called. I guess I'll eventually get used to iTap, but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say \"say a command\". Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Really Impressive phone", "Author": "Alexander M. Cavazos \"Kryptonkid\"", "ReviewID": "R3EWFB3W35UBX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone.  What impressed me most about it was several things.  One was its sleek design and feel.  If you liked the RAZR, this phone will really knock your socks off.  It's not quite as wide as the RAZR, which makes it easier on the hands, and it's solid construction makes you feel like you're holding a quality product.  I love how it snaps shut after you finish a call.  It's satisfying.  Two, it has better reception than the RAZR, or at least it seems that way to me.  I don't have any data to support this claim, but I have fewer dropped calls on this phone, and the volume is much better.  I don't find myself pressing the phone against my ear like I used to do with the RAZR, which is really nice.  Three, I dig the MP3 and multimedia features.  I popped a 2GB card in the phone and loaded about 50 of my favorite songs and about 75 family photos in it.  It's great because now I can set the phone alarm to wake up to my favorite songs, or set ring tones to whatever tune I  have loaded on it.  Also, I setup a playlist and listed to it while jogging the other day.  I was most impressed.  I also created a family album on the phone and showed it to friends in a slideshow format.  It was funny.  Rather than complimenting me on my beautiful family, they focused their comments on the photo quality of my phone.  I was like, dude.  Anyway, if you like cool phones, I totally recommend this one.  Yeah it's pricey, but from my perspective, it's worth it.  One last comment.  I'm a Cingular customer and they, if you haven't noticed, haven't offered the KRZR K1 phone to their customers yet.  Well, that's okay.  You can still use this phone on thier network.  All you have to do is take the phone out of the box, pop in your old SIM card from your previous phone, then call Cingular and ask them to activate it.  They will ask you for the IMEI number located on the box and within minutes, you will be connected.  It was a snap.

My initial impression was this phone was very tiny. It is smaller than the RAZR V3 in overall dimensions. I use this unlocked phone with Cingular in the Los Angeles area.The good:1)Small and cool looking. Most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor. It is definitely an eye catcher.2)Call quality is great. The volume can be turned on VERY loud. So if you are hard of hearing or just like to hear loud voices over the phone, then this phone will probably fit the bill.3)Speaker phone. Motorola managed to incorporate a great pair of speaker phones. It is loud and clear enough to have a conference call in a small room full of people.4)Comes with more than basic ring tones. It comes with several (around 12) musical ring tones. Better yet, the ring tones comes out in a full stereo mode (or at least sounds like it).5)Camera is good (2MP). Although it will not replace your digicam, it will be more than adequate for emergency uses.6)Battery life. My informal test on this is that it can handle upto 4-5 hours of talk time.The Bad (mostly due to it is unlocked):1)You need to configure EVERYTHING on the phone. Nothing comes preconfigured. This includes the default language, time, date, voicemail, email, IM etc. This can get rather tedious since Cingular does not support unlocked phones.2)You may lose some functionalities. For example, I have noticed my web browser functionalities do not work with my cingular SIM card.

First off, I received a KRZR K1 that was Cosmic Blue... and yes it was fully unlocked.  Awesome for those times you want to pick up a SIM trip while travelling and make low cost local calls.In the 24 hours that I have had this phone:- Literally all you do is drop in your SIM chip and it works- It has NO chinese characters on the keypad- It comes with a larger 220/110 volt charger (its no big deal!)- Texting works without issues (though I hate texting!)- The voice dial works amazingly well! (Love the STATUS command!)- The Motorola tools support the KRZR K1, drivers and all (syncs nicely!)- My 3rd party 1GB memory chip is visible and functional in all respects- The speakerphone is clear and loud enough for most needs- The phone ear speaker is clear, loud and more than adequate- The buttons on the sides \"autolock\", so no errors possible there- Bluetooth connectivity works great with either headsets or computers- Built-in camera is acceptable and it sends pics and saves them to my card, but don't expect Nikon dSLR quality pics from this thing... its a PHONE!So for me, it all works... perfectly!!The only thing that I have not tested out is internet access on my cell, but honestly I do not need it... my last phone had access and I used it once in 3 years.  Bleh, what a waste of time.  I surf the net from a 5+MB connection at home with a 100GB monthly limit.  I doubt a 9600 baud cell phone modem will quench my surfing desires and it just wastes minutes for nothing.The phone does have a shiney front end that reflects fingerprints a lot, and it still looks great, but works even better than it looks (fantastic reception... 1-2 bars more than my father's cell on the same provider side by side in the same location) and I am looking forward to years of good service from this cell.I am very happy with the seller, the service was excellent and their product exceeded my expectations, as did their service.

Depending upon your wireless service provider, you may also need to update the firmware from Motorola's website.

The interesting bit that we found with this unlocked phone is that it is an exportable phone, meaning the voice commands are in British English, not American English, so many of the phonetics are different.

Mine was an unlocked European one purchsed from tigerdirect.ca since I am canadian.What can I say about this phone? I didn't really take much time to mess around with the native firmware. I researched everything I could find out about this phone ahead of time before I made my final decision on purchasing it. I have owned a lot of motorola phones, and all have been great,...the K1 never disappoints, if you are keen on doing some tweaking. Back to where I said I never messed around with the native firmware: while researching I found that there are a few motorola mod websites out there...and people who are just as gadget savvy as I am, have released updated monsterpacks (newer and more customized, unbranded firmware) for this phone. I flashed the phone with the brand new monsterpack I downloaded and the phone is now EXCELLENT. Any issues with the os being slow or buggy are completely erased. I have skins installed that make my phone similar to the iphone interface which is pretty neat....plus with any other installed skins, I can change the look of the phone's os on the fly. My audio player has been updated, nicer font, more installed programs...just everything is all around better...making MY KRZR K1 the most envied phone in my area. The picture taking quality is really great compared to other phones.....I also have a 1 gig mini sd card with a ton of songs on it (that can also be used as ringtones). With a set of headphones, the sound is phenomenal. I have music videos and even a whole movie on my storage card and they all play great! The great thing about having an unlocked phone is that you can use the data cable and install free programs off of websites like getjar.com. Better web browsers, instant messengers, and even applications to make this phone as close to a pda that you can get. Add the syncing with outlook and setting your reminders, the K1 can be a wonderful phone. You just have to be willing to put in the time to learn about the phone, and willing to have no fear and mess around with p2k editors, java apps and the like. The phone is a great phone even with the native properties, but it is a bit simplistic with the native firmware. If you are willing to pimp it up with mods and the like, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you have an unlocked K1, make sure you get the gprs settings from your cell service provider in order to get internet/gprs functionalities to work. A great place to go to is howardforums.com.

I traded my razor in for the kzr and I have been disappointed ever since.  The first thing I noticed was the battery life was horrible.  It got to the point where I could only talk on the phone for 20 mins at a time.  Then I found out the only way I could talk on it was to have it plugged into the wall charger.  I went in to my provider, Verizon, and told them the problem.  They asked me to leave the phone with them and they would change out the battery.  Well come to find out they lied to me and never changed out the battery because Motorola isn't letting Verizon change out the batteries anymore.  So I had to call Motorola and let them know that my battery wasn't working.  I told them I work in the medical field and i'm on call all the time and that I had to walk away from Verizon with a phone that works.  They were no help at all.  They basically told me that they could send me a new battery in a weeks time.  I can't work without my phone so I told them there is no way that would work.  After going over and over it with them I got nothing acomplished. I'm now waiting on my battery with a phone that doesn't work. It's the worst experience i've ever had with a cell phone.  Not only am I disappointed in Motorola i'm disappointed in Verizon for not telling me the truth about the battery.  So my suggestion to you is not to buy the Kzr phone.

If you want to include the MP3 player functionality it would be 2 stars and internet access (at least through AT&T;) it would be 0.First off, as others have written, this phone looks and feels very nice.  I care less about the looks, but it just feels good in the hand.  Nice smooth curves and especially a nice solid feel.It seems to pull in signals well.  My house is a good place to test GSM phones:  the 1900MHz signal from T-Mobile and the 850MHz from Cingular/ATT are both marginal, but this phone pulls in AT&T; very nicely.  Even at one bar, it does not seem to suffer dropouts.  I also get an Edge data indicator (more about that later).The bluetooth works just fine with the built-in handsfree system in my car.  I had a problem with that on the CECT phone I tried earlier, so it is not a given.  You can also disconnect from the bluetooth while a call is in progress, for example if you reach your destination and want to get out of the car!The speakerphone capability is pretty decent.  Voice quality seems ok.  A plug-in earbud with mike also comes with it, and seems ok (did not really try it much).This phone has Ringer-ID (i.e. a personlized ring tone for different callers) but see below.  I never buy ringtones...I rip MP3 files from various places, or find MIDI files on line for free.  That works just fine.  But you need to have the SD card (as nearly as I can tell).  It does not appear that you can easily get an file on your computer to the built-in flash memory on the phone.  (There is some 3rd party software around, but that is scary...it lets you access the basic control files of the phone, and I'd rather not brick my new purchase quite so soon :-)The text messaging works fine ootb with AT&T; just as you expect (but see below about notifications).The reasons I downrate it as a phone are as follows:1) The voice pickup on the phone itself is less than ideal.  Contrary to other reviewers, I did not think that it was as clear as some phones.  I did an experiment:  I connected to my car hands-free and called my home answering machine and started talking.  Then I disconnected the call in progress and started talking on the phone itself.  Finally I went back and listened.  The voice on the hands-free was nice and clear.  The voice on the handset mike was somewhat muffled.  Not bad; just not crisp.2) This appears to be just a Motorola thing, but it drives be CRAZY!  I love Ringer-ID, that is setting up a personlized ring-tone for different callers, and this phone has it.  But guess what?  If you set it up for a caller the SAME MP3 or MIDI plays when you get text from them!  I've done a lot of internet searching; that appears to be just the way it is.  Grrrr.3) I don't really like the Moto menu system.  Wouldn't you think that the settings would be under \"Settings\"?  Oh, no, if you want to set up for messaging, that's under messages.  If you want to set up for web access, that's under web.  Settings has only the stuff that fit in no other category.  But that's just me.I said 2 stars as an MP3 player.  That's because while it seems to work ok, there is no obvious way to connect your own headphone.  There is no phone jack; only a mini-USB. The earbuds that come with it work ok, but darnit, I want to use my Bose noise-cancelling phones when I'm on a plane. You can buy USB-to-phone-jack adapters, but the ones I found either did not include or explicitly excluded Motorola.  Oh, but this has the Bluetooth profile for high-quality sound.  Fine, but you can't use that on an airplane.I said 0 stars as an internet device on AT&T.;  I spent literally hours attempting to get data access.  I combed the internet.  I even used the AT&T; Chat tech assistence (and they were actually really great!) but I had not luck at all.  I got all the settings as they ask (as nearly as possible; the profile you are supposed to edit is locked, so I created a new one...maybe that is the problem?) but I continually get a message saying that GPRS is unavailable despite the indicator on the phone that it IS available.  The AT&T; guy said there should be no difference between Edge and GPRS in terms of the settings, and my old phone could use GPRS with the same SIM card.  So my account is ok; I just can't get the right settings on the MOTO.  Ah well...I wanted it as a phone, mainly.Ah, the camera.  All I can say is that it is better than camera on my previous phone.  There is no flash, and I have not tried it in dim light, but the outdoor picture I took was passable.  Better to have this than nothing when need to snap off a quick shot, but don't replace your Nikon with it.As others have mentioned, the charger is for some other plug standard than US, but it comes with an an adapter.  No big deal.  Plus if you really hate it you can get an iGO charger from Radio Shack or Amazon.  I think the tip is A38.To summarize:  It's a pretty nice phone, especially if you will be using it with a hands-free.  Even just using the handset, it's pretty ok.  It's stylish, feels good in the hands, pulls in signals well, does text messages well with a possibly slighly poor outgoing voice quality.  Don't buy it because you want an internet device, and don't expect it to replace your iPod.===============================================14-Nov:  Someone else mentioned that the case cracked.  Mine did too.  The flip has a crack on the outside.  No, I did not drop it or otherwise abuse it.  It must be a poorly designed with stress points somewhere.  Too bad...it is nice looking.But worst, it seems today that the charger is refuseing to charge it, and the charge meter is inconsistent.  This is a all a sign of bad things to come, I'm afraid.  I don't recommend buying this phone (although it is still working ok as a phone.)================================================August 2011:  Indeed, the charger did die, but the iGo charger I had for it continues to work fine.  I have replaced this with an iPhone (on my second generation now), but I keep this phone for foreign travel.  Since it is unlocked, I can plug in a SIM card from a foreign telco and it works fine.

Nothing in the add posted @ Amazon indicates that this phone, while legal to buy in Hong Kong and resell in the USA, is actually violating the terms of support (or warranty) with the manufacturer.  The phone is OK, altho there are bizarre characters on the keys in addition to the western numbers and letters. Also, the charger is not for US plugs, but does include an adapter (a big and clunky one).  Plan on purchasing another charger if you ontend to travel with it.  My suggestion is to avoid dealing with J&R; for their practice of selling gray-ware.

I've never had a mis-pressed key. But I've seen the \"small keys\" comments and that was my biggest fear in purchasing the phone. If you can use a cell phone - you'll be OK.The speaker is surprisingly clear. However, when I slide the phone into my back jeans pocket with the speaker slot facing me - I cannot hear it at all.  BUT - in any other position the speaker is quite loud and clear.The form factor is, in my opinion, GREAT. It's small, till you flip it open, then it feels more like a 'real' phone with a mouthpiece near your mouth.I bought an unlocked version it wound up coming from Italy. I had to change the language before first use and that was slightly confusing.I read comments about fingerprints on the faceplate, and thought it was a little odd, \"who cares about fingerprints\", I thought to myself.  But, they are annoying. The surface is so shiny and perfect that the smudges and prints make it look dirty.The camera takes nice pictures.  It's 2 mega-pixel so it's not a digital camera - but it's not really bad either.I am in the process of trying to get different software for the system from a motox forum.  They seem to have modified and unsupported versions that might be better than the default version which seems limited.Finding drivers to attach this thing to your PC can be challenging.  I run win2k and haven't been able to access the phone from my home PC.  Fortunately, I run XP on my laptop and was able to use their proprietary software & drivers to access the phone.I got my phone with the $10 extra bluetooth headset (kit).  It was well worth it. The bluetooth works very well and the ear piece is nice.Someone mentioned that the menu response is slow.  It is, but it isn't so slow that it's a bother.  I dislike the current programming (which may be different with different carriers) because I can't make the MP3 player software available from the main menu.I am disappointed so far in the fact that it DOES NOT serve as a USB mass storage device.  You seem to need the driver for _phone_ in order to access files on the phone.  I've also purchased the 2gig microSD flash card for additional storage.  If you plan to use any extra feature (mp3s, photos, video) - I would recommend getting it. They can be found for less than $30.It also appears that you can get developers software to write your own java applets from developer motorola com.  So if you're techie - that might be fun.I can't give it a sincere durability rating yet, but its sat in my back pocket of my jeans without damage so far (200lb guy sitting on it).  I haven't dropped it to the ground, or dropped it in water yet, but that will happen.  I hope it survives.I've no complaints about battery life yet - though I haven't pushed it to see how long I could go without re-charging it. So far, it's been getting semi-nightly charges - I don't tend to talk on it 'all day' though.Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase, but not 100% - so I give it 4 stars.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Small Phone For Basic Calls/Texts/Pics/Videos/Web", "Author": "KeeKee", "ReviewID": "R316V3C3V38TPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't believe I was compelled to come in and write this long retro review, but I've a unique perspective because I've lived with it, gone beyond it, and come back to it out of necessity -- which is rapidly changing to choice.  And though Motorola has discontinued this phone, you can still buy them as the stock gets cleared out, and people should know what they're buying.  There are plenty of sensible and/or budget-conscious consumers who've resisted the smartphone craze (or won't go there until they absolutely have to because there's nothing else to buy), and just want a phone and texting device that can take a decent picture.  For the record, I'm an electronics/gadget freak with a large dose of common sense:  if it isn't broken, I don't fix it.  I also like my devices to remain separate; a camera, an MP3 player, a PDA... don't like them all housed in one place, because if one breaks they ALL break.  And as it comes to phones, so long as the network can support them and I can buy batteries for them, I keep them until they die if they do a proper job.  I'd assume anybody who's looking at buying this phone at such a late date would have to have similar habits, and this review is for them.I got this phone when I changed carriers in '07 and could get the KRZR at a great price, not quite a year after it was released.  At the time it had advanced features, but thrown into today's smartphone storm it's rendered fairly basic.  (It's truly amazing how quickly cell phones become dinosaurs.)  But not so fast.  Going back in time -- a little over three years -- I loved this phone from the get-go.  Compared to its predecessor the RAZR, which I never owned but was familiar with via friends, the KRZR had a bit more girth but felt far more appropriate in the hand.  (The RAZR was thin, sure, but it still felt odd to hold to your ear, like talking into a shoe -- just like modern smartphones!)  The size of the KRZR is nothing short of perfect in the hand, at the ear, and in the pocket.  It sports a strong, sturdy, quiet hinge and offers smooth, solid flip action.  Also excellent: battery life, call quality, signal strength -- pretty much all I look for in a phone.  Though I never buy phones for their photo and music-playing capabilities, the pictures are surprisingly good so long as you don't employ max zoom.  Can't vouch for the music player as I never used it.  Loved the web access.  Ditto: the vivid screen / the voice dialing (not an add-on, billable feature, but a feature of the phone itself) / the simple USB interface for charging and connecting to the computer (easy download of pictures/video) / the MicroSD card slot / the velvety, rubberized back / the bluetooth (never a problem).  The menus took some time to learn (not always intuitive), but it came with a full user's manual.  There was slight lag in character entry when texting, but who texts in an emergency?  Use the phone!  Overall the KRZR was a real winner for me.That said, there was a con as regards design.  The thin glass front panel, though sleek and attractive, was a fingerprint magnet (though nothing compared to today's smartphones) and cracked six months after I got the phone.  I believe this was due to having banged it against something.  Ordered a three-pack of new ones for next to nothing online and replaced it myself.  I then dropped the phone some months later and the glass panel cracked again, but this time I got wise and covered the new panel with crystals (see image).  The glue and added \"glass\" strengthened the front and that was that, it never cracked again.  And believe me, it was dropped!  (Others, particularly you guys who might not appreciate an embellished phone, replaced the panel with rubber or hard plastic -- surprisingly easy to do.)Batteries do get tired, and I felt the need to replace the battery a year and a half later (bought a very affordable one here on Amazon).  And that's that.  Used the heck out of the phone, dropped it, got it wet (yes, it sports the dreaded red water damage dot inside), but it performed like a champ.  And then last year I was due for an upgrade.  I was intrigued by the new smartphones, and for the first time went for something new when I didn't need it (yet).  Never swayed by the fruit craze, I was looking for a non-Apple device, and AT&T; gave me a deal on the Samsung Impression.  Loved the larger AMOLED display, some touch capabilities and full slide-out QWERTY keyboard.  Missed the voice dialing (they wanted to charge me for that).  Missed the rubberized back.  But quite honestly I didn't upgrade for any other reason than curiosity.  Since this isn't a review for the Samsung Impression, I'll skip to the chase and say that for almost a year it was a stand-up, useful device until the screen went black any time I opened it (following a drop) -- so much for using the keyboard!  I dealt with that until the screen went completely black last week.  Since I'm not due for an upgrade for some months, and don't want to purchase a replacement or consider another newer phone until then, I decided to kick back to the KRZR and wait it out with old faithful.Guess what?  I prefer the KRZR.  My busy \"digital life\" hasn't changed a bit in comparison; still taking/sending pictures and video, still tweeting, still accessing the web.  The KRZR goes places huge smartphones can't.  It feels more natural in my hand and at my ear.  (Though I do miss the keyboard for longer entries, it's almost easier to text because this phone's easier to hold.)  All the things I gave it excellent marks for three years ago are even more noticeable now.  Such loud, clear calls... and oh how I missed the fabulous battery life!  Though the Droid looks appealing, who knows what will be out there months from now when I'm due for an upgrade?  But I'm half tempted to stay right where I am with the KRZR until it's dead for good, which at this rate could be more years!  I still say buy one while you can get one if you don't need a smartphone.  I may even buy another myself.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love This Phone", "Author": "Angelsong", "ReviewID": "R3SJ84CFG9FQQO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my KRZR K1 yesterday and I love it.

The KRZR - [I have heard two different pronounciations of it: \"Krayzer\" and \"Cruiser\" - I lean towards the latter] - is taller, but narrower and fits like a tailored glove.

I got this some time ago and the price has almost doubled since; why I don't know.  Maybe because it's good?  Anyway, I really like the size and feel of the phone.  And, don't take this the wrong way, but it feels good in my pants (pocket).  Because it's not bulky and has a rectangular shape and the finish is glass, it kind of just slides into your pocket.  There isn't any resistence from rubberized backing, bulging buttons etc.  I'm relatively old school when it comes to phones and I just use it to make calls and take some pics/videos once in a blue moon. But I have to say upgrading from the old V550 was quite a jump.  This one holds a charge very well IF you use the charger that is supplied.  If you use the USB charging from your computer, it seems to fill it up quickly, but the charge doesn't last as long.  Still, it's awesome to be able to just plug it into a USB port and not have to hunt for the wall plug.The thing I still don't like about Motos is that you have to buy software to sync. Why can't it seemlessly integrate with Outlook somehow, or some other PC based email client? I shouldn't have to buy a smartphone for this feature.  I really don't need this functionality. But honestly, they should supply it for free.  In non-USB versions they'd even get you for the sync cable too; what a rip-off.  Anyway, there are other sync alternatives beside the Moto software if that is important to you and I'm sure because it's USB based there's at least a way to backup your contacts.  That's important.As of this writing I've had the phone almost two years and have no complaints really.  Oh, I've tried the media player on this thing with bluetooth and it works great.

Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later, on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours, still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services, then sync the phonebook that way.  We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age, you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.  Not with Motorola.  I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola, so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver....", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "L.

If I had to do it again, I'd probably have just gotten something cheaper and less shiny looking. This phone appears to STILL be quite expensive despite the fact it isn't really good at anything except plain, no frills phone calls. I found signal strength generally good, call quality ok but not exceptional. I liked the handsfree function (speakerphone, etc) and also the bluetooth. I didn't like the way the battery started to become EXTREMELY depleted after about one year of use. I started to talk to people for about two minutes (seriously, not an exaggeration) before I would need to charge the phone. While the solution is pretty simple - just get a new battery - batteries can be rather expensive and it is just a frustrating experience.Once the battery was replaced at 1.5 years, however (when I really should have just done it much earlier at 1 year), battery life returned to normal. That is, you could expect to have quite a bit of standby power without chatting, and you could have at least 1 hour of talk time easily with no fear.Internet is basically nonexistent and only in emergencies for Verizon's ridiculously slow and old proprietary browswer. I did use it a few times to view email in a pinch, but wouldn't recommend anyone taking its internet capability seriously.Texting is ok if you are relatively speedy on the standard non-QWERTY keypad. I was able to manage as I am not a power texter (a busy texting day for me would be 20 msgs). If you are crazy about texting you might prefer QWERTY.I didn't use the music player so I cannot comment on that.Very durable phone, dropped a few times onto pavement (ouch!).

My phone arrived fairly quickly but when I opened the box it was immediately obvious that the phone manufacturer's box that's inside the Amazon.com box had been opened. When I opened the manufacurer's box all of the packing material was missing and the box contained only loose phone parts (phone body, back cover, battery, AC adapter) that had apparently been bouncing around alot. The phone was badly damaged, the front of the phone was a spider web of cracks and it appeared that the camera lens may have been cracked as well. I sent it back the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt credit for my return in about a week.After receiving my credit from Amazon I went to ebay and bought this phone for about $30 more and it arrived brand new and in perfect condition. It also came with many accessories, including software CD, data cable, stereo headset, holster, car charger and 1GB memory chip. I installed my SIM card and the memory chip and the phone works like a champ.I loaded the phone tools software on my HP laptop and it immediately updated to the latest version. I just use the synchronization for my Outlook contacts and calender and it has worked well with only one minor issue. For some reason the software was synchronizing with the calendar information in my archive folder. Once I changed the synchronization setting to go to my current calendar folder there have been no issues.So far I've only downloaded a few ringtones from the internet and they have downloaded quickly and flawlessly.This is my first Motorola phone (I'm a former Nokia owner) and I have found this phone easy to use.

Key features that I find a 'must have' in any phone is multi number contacts and speakerphone.  This does both and then some.  I was debating between the blue and the silver - and went with the blue, and I'm glad I did.  However, it is very very susceptible to fingerprints, so I highly recommend the BodyGlove Cellsuit to keep it nice and free of smears.  This is an unlocked phone, so the keypad and some of the programming is not US only - the dictionary for example is in Chinese I believe.  It comes with a wide array of ring tones and the sound quality exceeded expectations.  The camera also exceeds expectations and has a picture editor on board - cheesey frames, b&w;, brightness, sharpness and sepia - but these functions do eat up battery life quickly.I am very much a Nokia man, and have been hesitant to buy Motorola, but Nokia currently has nothing that interests me, style wise and the 2 gig micro sd ability intrigued me... by the way, have I told you how much I love this phone?

The phone is alright but not at all what i was looking for.First of all people should know that the reason the phone is availible so cheap is that it isn't the US edition. Though it doesn't really matter, it is kind of annoying. The charger comes with a universal adapter and wont work without it, making the charger weird shaped and bulky. The other thing is that some of the menus on the phone are spelled wrong.The Good~Battery life is very impressive~2mp camera is not bad~Decently customizable~Comes with Platinum SudokuThe Bad~The user interface was my main problem with the phone. Defult analog clock and wrong date format. the menus just dont make sense, things that should take one button to do take 3 or 4. Menus are grouped strangely and things like bluetooth are a pain to find.~mutimedia is disapointing on almost every level, videos take a while to load aren't great resolution (176X144) max length is 30 seconds~audio player is ugly and slow, with a just plain bad interface~doesnt work with MircoSD card, or at least not a full size one, maybe I misreadOverall not that bad of a phone, just not made for mutimedia by any standards, I for one will be returning it for the Sony Ericson.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "NOT metropcs/NOT cdma.", "Author": "kafkette \"the last slum goddess\"", "ReviewID": "R3PA7D4WT4WPKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i REALLY wanted this cellphone. i wanted it SOOOO much that i bought it w/o sticking to my own caveats & while ignoring my apprehension--an apprehension that turned out to be TOO TOO valid. amazon has this product tagged completely wrong. i bought it, ya. i had to return it, ya. it is NOT cdma. it will NOT work w/ metropcs. it IS the most fabulous cellphone i have ever owned--but i left it unused & owned it in any proper way for the life of a mayfly before i needed to return it. i informed amazon of its miscategorization when i returned it; they uncategorically refunded me. i wish amazon had then looked into my sorry charges a bit & removed it from the list of cdma/metropcs compatibles. they didnt. so now i am informing YOU, dear emptor, so you wont have to go thru the same as did i.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful phone, if only it would have worked.", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1CLRCLJLG9ALK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the phone two days ago and remarked on the beauty of it and its overall good design.

The KRAZR won't even recognize that there is a card when you check the Storage option in the phone settings menu.  It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.

Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me.  Also why is there a measly 66mhz processor in this when the V3xx/Maxx have a 247mhz(Arm9)?  The screen is a smaller resolution QCIF compared to the QVGA of the V3xx too.  I mean the only upside I could see it the 2MP camera on this phone.  It also only supports EDGE which the V3xx supports the much faster 3G HDSPA/UMTS.  If you are big on fashion and not specs then this is the phone for you.  A much better phone would be the V3xx 3G phone or wait for the Krazr K3.  One last not why is this thing still called a razr?

Then press the right button and say the name, and it automatically dials that person.The KRZR has no such feature (at least I haven't found it yet) and does not seem to recognize names, and if it does, you have to press several buttons before it will dial the correct person.  Not exactly what you need if you are trying for hands-free dialing.The other negative feature when compared to the RAZR is that is actually feels heavier and the controls are smaller and harder to use with my big fingers.Other than that, probably a great phone.
