I got it refurbished and I was a little concerned about that, as I have heard horror stories warning against it. But I went ahead anyway, as it was for my sons birthday and I was on a budget. The seller shipped it super quick, and in excellent condition.It's like brand new! I set it up according to directions, put my old phones chip in it, fixed the settings to my liking and VIOLA! It has been running like a charm! It has been about a month and my son absolutely loves it. He has not had a single problem with it freezing. The camera takes surprisingly clear photos and the video quality is also decent. He loves the WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, especially.I was so pleased with this phone from this seller, that I immediately bought another for my daughter who had a birthday 2 weeks from my sons. I definitely recommend !!!", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "blackberry 8320", "Author": "Bella Smith", "ReviewID": "RBTD4CENRTCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got it for my mom and she love it!

There are three carriers in that country and since it is unlocked it can be used with either one of them.
