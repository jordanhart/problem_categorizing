{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfectly good gophone", "Author": "Brittany D", "ReviewID": "R2QYL5AZUNREPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This cell phone is perfectly good. It works and that's what matters. It is GPRS and not 3G, 4G or even Edge. But since it's not a smart phone you really don't need anything more complicated and \"faster\". The screen is very good considering the inexpensiveness of this phone. And I like that the home screen has the date and time appropriately placed in a nice manner and not hard to read or huge covering the screen.I can't for the life of me figure out how to change the default button actions for the left/right/top/bottom. I did it once when I first got the phone (years ago) and can't figure it out now. I'll have to check the user manual.The phone is quick and not laggy like a lot of very cheap phones. And to turn it off or on isn't slow either. It boots up very fast and is ready to use within a few seconds.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Rain Dog", "ReviewID": "R22ECQ1VD23M14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice little phone for the price. It's small, lightweight, and sturdy. Dropping it isn't going to do much damage to it. Very reliable product. It is what it is, though. Doesn't come with any frills like a camera. Get it if you want a nice phone and nothing else.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for calls only", "Author": "Sivan \"Susan\"", "ReviewID": "R34U6YQT0XU0PA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The email won't load. After numerous attempts and also with the help of an AT&T; rep, we realized that this phone is not working as well as it should. I can't check my email, but I can get a call and make a call. It's a little pricey, but I'm keeping it as a back-up in case the cheaper phone I have dies.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is terrible!", "Author": "Leopard726", "ReviewID": "R14GV932FXPVOI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I absolutely HATE this phone!  I got it used from my dad for Christmas 2012 since I wanted to change from T-Mobile To-Go to AT&T; GoPhone.  I put the new SIM card in and, although it worked, I noticed some problems with the phone right away.  For one, there is NO volume control.  Even the manual doesn't include a way to turn it up or down.  In order to hear people louder, you have to use the hands-free setting in-call, which is a major pain in the butt when you are out in public, unless you don't mind others hearing your business.  I also have many issues with the phone not dialing out.  It will have a high signal but will not dial the number and gives a \"no signal\" warning.  This phone has been incredibly frustrating from the get-go.  I finally broke down and bought a replacement (a Samsung clamshell) that I am getting next week.  I can't wait!", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice simple phone", "Author": "G.
