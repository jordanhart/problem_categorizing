{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone Purchase!", "Author": "Erica Reid", "ReviewID": "RWKXHDKU0CAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Behold is not a smartphone, just to get that out the way early. It is an exceptional device but smart device it is not. So anyhow, I purchased this phone to replace a recent purchase of a Sidekick LX that as we all know has ceased the use of data. I have a primary phone, the Blackberry 9700, however I like having two lines because when the Blackberry inevitably dies before I get home at the end of each day I will still have a fully charged phone waiting. I will break my analysis of the phone down into sections.PackagingI opted for the overnight shipping, which was only $3.99 on Amazon Prime Student Edition. This phone arrived super fast and the packaging was amazing. When I opened the package I found that the phone was in the original Samsung packaging. When I opened the packaging I found the phone in immaculate shape. The plastic cover was still on the screen, the battery was enclosed in a plastic packaging, and everything looked as if it was brand new. No scratches non-whatsoever. Overall, very professional packaging, which is always much appreciated.Phone Touch ScreenThe screen on this phone is amazingly bright and vibrant. To make a selection on the screen you have to press firmly, which I like but if you are looking for a touch screen that is as fluid as the G1 then you will be disappointed. I have medium fingers and when I first started playing this phone I was annoyed and was kind of glad that it is a secondary phone because otherwise the texting would drive me insane. What I have found is that this is a very sexist phone. If you are a woman and have medium fingernails then this is your biggest ally when typing on the screen. If you are a guy, who typically have short fingernails, I recommend a stylus. Once I started using my fingernails to text and not my fingers I found the process to be quick and efficient with no mistaken letter pushes.Phone Front ScreenThe main screen allows you to modify the icons and move them to the home screen. This is a decent feature that I have found useful. I do wish that we had the opportunity to download other widgets that are more tailored to what you use but the default one's are the only options.Phone Call QualityThe quality of the phone calls are very clear and crisp. No choppy voices or static.BluetoothI was able to connect my Bluetooth to this device in two minutes flat. The Bluetooth call quality was clear and crisp, no issues there.BrowserNow comes the downside to this phone. This browser is a very crude type of browser. With a phone that has so many features you would think that there would be a great browser, or at least efficient. The speed of the browser is decent if you are in 3G. I have not had any issues looking at video's on YouTube or going on Facebook's mobile site however you will not be getting onto any non-mobile sites very easy. That being said, there is a rumor that Opera Mini is a great browser to download however I cannot confirm nor deny this rumor because I was unable to find an Opera Mini browser that was compatible with the Behold.AppsI cannot find any apps to download, period. They do not have a Facebook or Twitter app to download so that's something to consider if that's important to you. I have these apps on my Blackberry 9700 so it's not that big of a deal, although it would be nice to have these apps on both devices. I do not use games on my cell phone devices so I cannot attest to how they handle or where to actually download them from, for that matter.EmailThere is an email wizard to set up email accounts from AOL to Yahoo! to Comcast and Verizon. There is a nice list of carriers, but as this is not a smartphone, school and work email is not supported on this device. I have not set up any email accounts because my emails are all going through the Blackberry.Overall I recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a nice alternative to a smartphone and want most of the benefits and not the daunting and intimidating features. I give this phone a 5 out of 5 because it does everything I am looking for and a little more. If you want to have a more in-depth analysis of the features and see how it handles with other users, go to YouTube and look up Samsung Behold Reviews. This is also useful if you are trying to decide between a few other devices.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone", "Author": "T-MILLZ", "ReviewID": "R15CQMTKA4WUUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When this phone arrived, I was a bit unsure about it because of the generic box. Also, the packaging was somewhat mediocre. But overall, this is a great phone. The delivery was FASTER then I expected. It may have taken 2-3 days time. The device is touchscreen and it supports a micro-sd card. It can play music, store photos, videos... etc. If your with T-Mobile, all you have to do is a quick SIM CARD switch and your set. If not, you'll may have to pay an boot up fee of some sort since your not currently on a T-Mobile contract. If your just trying to upgrade to a newer phone, I highly suggest this one.

It was my first touchscreen phone. I bought a case protector on day one, have dropped it several times on concrete and hard surfaces, but the phone keeps working! I'm not much of an internet user via phone, but I've used it for that on occasion and it works fine. The touchscreen has some scratches, but after two and a half years, thats expected. All of the functions, software, camera still are in great working condition. Samsung makes durable products that are meant to last. I know that doesn't amount to much in today's world because of ever changing smart phones, trends, etc., but when you're paying $300 a pop for a new phone, you like to think it'll last over a year. This phone has outlasted any other phone I've ever had. I had to finally purchase a new battery after two years. It had worked fine up until then but towards the end I had to charge it once a day.

Honestly, I ordered it because of the price, but I love it. It's important to note that it is NOT a smartphone, but it functions perfectly, works with my provider and is super easy to use. The only thing I can think of that I don't like about it is the lack of apps and games. Other than that, the OS that is factory installed for T-Mobile is pretty great.

I have to say that I really love this phone. It does what I want in that I now have web on my cell plan and I can get into everything on the net so far with this unit. You can listen to music and play games you can even watch videos.. I like the size, it fits into my pocket very nicely. It's a great little phone! The only thing I will complain about is the sound quality. I think its a a little tinny.. I think it could be louder when on speaker phone. But I can live with it.. If anything else I would like to see the battery last longer. So to give you a example, if I surf the web and use 1 mg a day and leave the unit on all day with texting about 10 times and making 5 calls a day the battery will last 1 day. I have to charge it up that night for the next day. If I shut it off for 6 hours a day I can get 2-3 days out of it.. I suppose the screen takes a lot of power.. But all in all I love the phone..

Their service is great and order arrived 5 days ahead of promised date. I actually had ordered my 1st phone a few weeks before from OEM shop but it never arrived. Then OEM tells me it was already delivered to me. I checked with shipper(Which OEM should have and the phone was returned to them undeliverable???). So I have to say seller1on1 is a better seller than OEM.Now for the phone: I got it to upgrade from Samsung Blast. I am very excited about it despite of negative reviews. It has all the features that I need and much more.My basic needs were speaker phone, caller picture ID and custom ring tone, Bigger internal memory, Alarms which I have 4 now and can create more, World time clock, Quirky key board and regular phone key board, speed dial, voice dial, calendar with scheduler and sync function so I did not have to re-enter 300 phone numbers. The phone went and downloaded my phone-book from the T-Mo web site where I had previously uploaded.Camera is nice. 5 meg pixel but remember this is not a pro camera it is a facility. For all the functions it has it is really nice. It has a built in flash but don't expect to get a pro picture in dim light.The touch screen takes a little getting use to, but it works fine. Sometimes I use the plastic/rubber tips on the back of my cross pen/pencil set.It is a great pre-smart phone but not really smart phone. Internet connectivity and GPS are very basic but I don't need those functions. When I do I'll upgrade again in a few years. For now I am a road warrior and a computer geek and nothing will do to replace the computer.Screen lock keeps you from accidental dialing and the widgets (Icon) bar easily gets out of the way.Another surprise feature is the wrist strap hook up. Does not come with the strap but I ordered mine from Amazon. Various types are available-- Digital Camera Neck and Wrist Strap Combo by Quantaray, -- 6 Black Wrist Strap Lanyard for Camera Mp3 PSP Cell Phone Wii and other Electronic Devices by The Camera HunterI also ordered screen protector -- Amzer Privacy Screen Protector for Samsung Behold T919  by Amzer.Strap is a great idea cause I usually keep the phone in my hand and often drop it.I also like the fact that I can also buy from Amazon color skin protectors and screen protectors. Those were non-existent for the Blast.The phone screen does hang up sometimes but then so do the computers. On the whole I am very happy, I checked full specifications on Cnet, Samsung and some other review sites. So if I did not list the missing features here or are not on Amazon you can find them there.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the Latest Technology", "Author": "Y.

Samsel", "ReviewID": "R1SHRWRV2P6LKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After using it for 2 years (too long only because T-Mobile does not offer anything to my CALLING needs) I can tell it is a piece of garbage.1. Design is example how not to design mobile phone - lesson of ergonomics needed for Samsung engineers.You hit any button and it \"thinks\" sometimes up to 2 seconds so you hit again, because you are not sure it accepted your action... so it does two things for you one after another (or voids your initial action while flashing screen where you wanted to be). Other times you select main button to \"go back\"... and it re-dials last number you dialed (a convenience garbage?! whose logic was that?)2. Flash in camera is useless - it simply makes pictures washed out. Never use this camera in low light (and especially with any case on it as flash bounces on any case edges).3. Photography is not about number of megapixels anymore - it is about quality of picture processing (assuming that lens did not distort it already).4. Interface is... someone on Samsung forum asked correctly: \"why do they call it smartphone?\". Yes it is sort of \"dumbphone\". Agreed. You do not want to navigate with slow reaction and then to find yourself in random place, because it rendered control on screen after you lost your patience re-trying.5. Touchscreen is acting like cat - you want this and it picks whatever it wanted or understood. Scrolling phones in your phonebook with swipe gesture is mediocre. It frequently picks phone randomly while you were still swiping. Scroll button on side... whose idea was that? Designer from '80 or '90? It is too slow and i do not have time to scroll for a minute or two to phone close to the bottom of my phone book. Then it has this idiotic behavior after scrolling with swipe of realigning contact to the top of screen like some monkey jumped and you do not know where you have to touch screen for a moment (a toy for a kid might do that - not phone for adults).6. You cannot turn off T9 corrections permanently (in setup) even though you are typing in foreign language that is not on the interface list (Samsung: what interface language has to do with language used for messaging? Should I also speak only in graphic interface languages in order to be able to use it?). So I end up with corrections... to words that phone does not have clue what they mean. Every time I have to hit that button T9 OFF and remember about that when I continue SMS conversation.Similarily use of uppercase letters and auto punctuation. Damn! English is not the only language and it has different rules than the others... and we also send SMS' to foreign friends.Other than that it is a phone like any other voice calling device.Honestly I have to contain myself from throwing this phone against wall, but eventually it might happen. This is one of the worst mobile phones I had.I will buy another Samsung phone only under conditions:1. It is quality designed with interface adequate to human behavior and reactions (which mods by Samsung for Android platform does not guarantee).2. Interface does not fail randomly knowing better from user what to do.3. Samsung supports its product with upgrades (software) for at least 2 years (particular model not \"version 2\" or \"version 3\" bragging that they support while one does not have anything to do with other).4. Samsung has clear vision on line of product with platform support (not cheap garabage product random release every month for phones).... which means that likely it will never happen.Time to pick some HTC or iPhone.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "genericpenname", "ReviewID": "R1TLOPUXACREET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone used.

The keyboard does work quite well, but certain buttons/controls/widgets on the far left do not react to input coordinates correctly and often result in the wrong letter being hit on.The overall user-interface (UI) is very slow and many the important customizations like putting shortcuts (which they call \"widgets\") on the home screen just are not available.This is a prepaid phone that works on T-Mobile, the cheapest pay-as-you-go plan around I have come across, and it does feature GPS with a program called Telenav (which is not entirely free). The Telenav GPS Navigator is basically a road map system that is NOT suitable for real-time driving situations. It features address lookup, favorites storage, and 2D/3D maps which can follow you as you walk (not drive or even if you are a passenger/navigator, because it is just too slow). It also requires a paid contract subscription to work, the free version only has map and GPS no route plotting.There are customizable ring tones for calls and text messages, with 5 different \"sound profiles\"; normal, silent, vibration, vehicle, and outdoor. You can customize both calls and text message ring tones separately from sounds files (mp3's) from your computer/memory card.E-Mail support is nearly non-existent, none of the carriers work and dosen't even support basic POP3 or any of the more useful carriers. Prepaid plans on T-Mobile also do not support data so e-mail is even more out of reach.The 5MP camera took terribly noisy and blurry shots, this is one of the worst cameras I have come across. It also did not have manual white-balance setting, and color temperature matching seemed to be one of its biggest weaknesses.It does have a (rather long 1 second sustaining) flash to help in dark situations (which is virtually all indoor situations) an even then it produces a radial gradient highlight in the center of the picture and does not look like a true flash/strobe on the picture..It also uses a proprietary USB cable to connect to your computer, and you have to buy that separately. The phone also has no on-board memory, you must buy a separate Micro SD memory card. The memory card also can not be unmounted/ejected without turning the phone off, removing the cover, removing the battery first.You can play audio MPEG layer 3 mp3's, h264 or MPEG-4 videos in mp4 containers and swf flash videos, but not flash games. All videos must be 320x240 resolution or smaller and the accompanying audio stream must be in AAC encoding (not MPEG layer 3 or anything else).Physical-wise, the body of the camera looked very cheap, almost like a disposable sardine can, it does come in a few metallic colors in addition to black. I got the rose pink one. The edges are kind of slippery, which makes the whole \"Beholding\" process kind of tricky, you may want to get a rubber/tacky case grip.There is an embedded latch in the body for a leash/lanyard, which I like, but I didn't like the latch being in the corner.The USB input is also proprietary, which means you have to buy a Samsung T919 USB cable if you want to connect it to a computer or any device with USB input.

The week of anticipation build up during shipping made expectations high as well. Even upon arrival, the slick little body seemed nearly perfect considering it was just a Samsung and not a Smartphone.BUT -- disappointment rushed in when I began playing with the features.1. The touch screen? FAIL. It was lacking to say the least. The screen is very insensitive and requires multiple taps on the same key to even text.2. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to turn off the vibration touch recognition without turning off sounds to the entire phone. When the ringer volume is on, the screen makes a (very) annoying beep each time it's touched. When it's on vibration mode, it vibrates. The only way I could find to get it off is to turn off all phone sounds. Maybe there is some secret way, but by this time I wasn't particularly interested in trying to find out.3. My SIM card didn't even work in it! It said it was compatible with T-Mobile, but apparently that means every T-Mobile customer sans me. The SIM card slot is very weird -- I felt like I was sliding my card into a forbidden crevice and had some struggle even getting it back out again.I put the device back in it's little bubble wrap bag and boxed it up, leaving it for UPS store to deal with.

Unfortunately this buying experience turns out to be disaster. In the following paragraphs I will expalin why you need to think more carefully before making your decision to buy this cell phone.First of all, although the website lists the product condition as \"new\". In reality, it's NOT. It is evident when I opened the mailing bag, the package is dented and has ssigns of being forcefully opened before. And small plastic bags containing important parts such as ear phone, charger all have big scratches. If these hints do not suggest the product is used, I don't what will do.Also, the biggest concern of all (I can ignore all the minor problems such as slow shipping), is when I followed all the appropriate steps on the manual to set up the phone and charge it for 4-5 hours (exactly as the manual says), the phone just won't turn on. I even charged it for 10 hours, the screen still won't activaate. Until then I realize the phone itself has serious defeacts that can't be ignored.Before your purchase, please think carefully first about this phone's risks", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "cool phone", "Author": "bic", "ReviewID": "R2UL5CCUCUYKMY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i think its nice phone and i like the price i paid for it i have it for a couple weeks now and i am liking it everyday", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "the phone is used and not working at all", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2HH7V4WDK5X5F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it's work for just 8 hour and then the phome restart all the time and t's not working hehehehe this is the last time i buy from amazon", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
