{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply amazing.  Wow.", "Author": "D. Miyao", "ReviewID": "R3HIG0II1OFS0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have you ever gotten a new phone and thought, \"wow this phone makes my other phones seem so dated\"?  I can say that this is that phone, the LG G2 is AMAZING...funny thing is, my last two phones were the HTC One (AT&T;) and the iPhone 5 (AT&T;).  I am that guy who buys the latest and greatest when I think it will make a difference in my life and I justify my phone purchases with the excuse that my phone is always on me(and I used to be an Apple fanboy and I have owned every iPhone).  I use it for work, games, news, remote for my tv, sports, email, camera...Oh yeah, I use it to make phone calls too.  Anyways, I haven't been in love with a phone like this since I went to the original iPhone.  I hope you find my review helpful and beneficial to your purchase regardless if you buy one or not.The Bad - Let's just get this out of the way.The case is a glossy plastic.  The phone is a finger print magnet.  I am slightly self conscious when I let people see the G2- I feel like I have very dirty hands and I'm a chemist which means I am washing my hands regularly.  The phone is a dirt and oil magnet.The other downside is no expandable memory but I have a hard time using 32gb of memory anyways so Im not complaining but some of you out there might want more memory.The GOOD - Get ready for a long list.  I will do my best to put what is important first just in case I bore you and you want to move on.Battery - The G2 has the longest battery life of any phone I've used.  I regularly use my phone for a multitude of tasks.  With my iPhone 5 and HTC One I usually could make it through the day without a recharge, but without a doubt I would give those phones a full charge when I slept.  It has been 4 days since I have owned the G2 and have only charged it over night twice.  All I can say is \"WOW\".  Finally a smart phone with a battery that makes sense.Software - The LG software is really well thought out and not gimmicky like the Galaxy S4.  My favorite feature is the double tap of the screen when the phone is in sleep mode which turns it on, and this feature also works to turn the phone off.  No more need to find some long and flat power button on the top of the phone which at times isn't easy to find on the phones because at night you don't know whether your phone is upside down or not.  I know it isn't a huge deal to find the power button, but double tapping anywhere on the screen to turn it off/on is a very useful feature.  And no it doesn't accidentally turn on in my pocket.  The software can detect random touches from the double tap. Other features of the software are a long press of the volume button brings up the camera and it loads within seconds or the notepad for quick notes.  I am finding more useful software features as I move along, for example today for my meeting reminder which popped up 15 minutes before the start, a \"silent mode\" option popped up along and I clicked it and my phone went silent for the scheduled time of the meeting.  No more forgetting to turn my phone to silent during meetings.  Also when I am in an app and I receive a text, a little box pops up with the text and it has a reply box so I can actually reply to texts without exiting the app I'm currently using.  If I don't reply the box disappears within a few seconds just like a notification on the other phones and the app in use just runs like nothing happened.  With the large screen the pop up box is non obtrusive.  If this was an iPhone the box would take up a significant part of the screen but on the G2 it's just like a notification popping up on any other phone.  Again it's a simple feature but it makes sense and I love it.  Other than that the phone is running Android 4.2.2 which is really smooth and pleasant.  In comparison to iOS6 this makes Apple's software seem dated and unimaginative and compared to the HTC One software it is refined and the One is also running Android 4.1.2.Screen - Holy cow this screen is the best screen I have ever laid eyes on.  The screen is huge and the bezel around the screen is tiny.  Whites are white, blacks are black, colors aren't overly saturated and the resolution is on par with the best of the best.  Simply put, this is the best screen of the top phones, iPhone, Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.  When I show it off to my stubborn iPhone friends all they say is wow it's so clear and big.  It's almost as if I'm holding a mini HD TV in my hand.Sound - For those audiophiles out there, this phone does allow for 24 bit music and it really does sound fantastic.  With headphones in this phone blows the competition out of the water and for the record I am an audiophile too.  With the speaker the phone is loud, definitely louder than the iPhone 5 but not as loud and clear as the HTC One.  In this comparison, the HTC One wins for the speakers but the G2 is no slouch and I find myself listening to my music on the speaker frequently.Camera - Again, best camera of the bunch.  I've read about the Nokia having a 41 megapixel sensor which Im sure rocks, but the G2 compared to the HTC One and the iPhone 5 wins hands down.  I have a black dog and cat and whenever I took pictures with the iPhone 5 they came out looking like black shadows with eyes.  It was disappointing to have such cute animals misrepresented.  The HTC One definitely gets the colors right on pictures but the zoom lacked because it only has a 4 megapixel camera.  With displays as clear as they are now, 4 megapixel pictures are easily pixelated when you zoom in.  The G2 has a camera to replace all point and shoot cameras.  My dog and cat are visible!  The camera is fast even in low light and takes fantastic pictures.Performance - The G2 has a quad core snapdragon 800 2.3 ghz processor which is the fastest available in all smartphones.  In normal people language...it's blazing fast and buttery smooth.  I hate to say this but the iPhone and HTC one seem laggy.  And I hate to say that because in real world use those phones are more than adequate, but once I go back and play with the HTC One and iPhone5 I think,\" man these phones are slow.\"  Using the app manager I frequently see 5-10 programs open and running but none of that affects the performance.Build - The phone is plastic but not cheap feeling like the Galaxy S4.  The G2's phone back is not removable so it doesn't feel flimsy like the Galaxy S4.  It also has a rounded back which has a very nice feel in your hand similar to the HTC One but better.  The HTC One has straight edges vs the G2's rounded edges and it is more comfortable to hold the G2.  I loved the aluminum on the HTC One and the iPhone 5 but the edges used to scratch and dent from normal usage which got annoying quickly.  I truly appreciate the G2's build quality and attention to detail even though it doesn't use aluminum it definitely has a premium feel in a comfortable package.Verdict - I honestly thought we have reached a point with hardware where there really won't be much innovation anymore because everything has become so fast, high resolution, etc. that the next innovation wave would be in software.  Boy was I wrong and pleasantly so.  Moving the volume buttons to the back makes perfect sense.  With phones getting larger it doesnt really make sense to have the volume buttons on the side.  You need to reach for the buttons vs on the G2 the buttons are where your fingers are naturally which makes turning the volume up and down rather easy.  No more accidentally bumping the volume buttons on the side too.  And the screen with minimal borders is gorgeous.  I have used the Galaxy Note II and the a few of the other phablets and they are just too big.  LG fit a huge screen into a minimal package I can truly say it is phenomenal.  And the best part of this phone...I can see my dog and cat!  Yes I adore them and love them and am always taking pictures of them to send to friends and family.  There has not been one person that I have showed the phone off to who wasn't amazed by it and getting an iPhone user to be amazed by a Droid phone is pretty freaking rare.For once in a long time, I can say that this phone will last me at least a year without me getting the urge to upgrade and that's saying a lot.  I was the guy who waited in line for 12 hours to get the 3g and 3gs.  I can without a doubt recommend this phone to all smartphone users and if you do get it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.Update 9/22/2013 - I love this phone more and more each day.  It charges really quickly.  When I get actual numbers on speed to charge to 100% I will post them.Update 9/26/2013 - Yesterday I woke up to LG's native email app crashing continuously even after a restart.  I deleted my email accounts and it still was happening so I did a factory reset which eliminated the problem.  I then emailed LG's customer service to see if they know about this and I got a good understanding of how their customer service works and quite frankly it is terrible compared to the competition.  The phone itself still commands 5 stars but customer service is no better than 1 star and here is why: 1. They asked for proof of purchase to validate that I bought the phone within the last year (the phone hasn't even been out more than two weeks...really?) 2.  They didn't answer my question, the reply was I may need to send the phone in 3. Sending the phone in was my responsibility, they don't send a prepaid package like the competitors 3. 5-7 days until I would get my device back.  So if you account for shipping I could be without a phone for two weeks (LG should know better most people can't go more than a day without their smartphones .If you compare Apple's customer service, they have stores that you can walk into (with an appointment) and get your phone swapped out with in minutes.  Their reps also can help solve problems like frequent app crashing and it's all included with their 12 month warranty.  If you don't live close to a store Apple will mail you a box and it will have priority shipping.  You can get your phone replaced within a couple days.  Sony doesn't have in store replacements like Apple, but they do ship boxes to send your device in also with priority speed.If you are accustomed to Apple's customer service or another company's that you like, factor it into your decision when making the switch.  I can tell you with absolute certainty that LG's service is awful.9/27/2013 - Luckily I was within AT&T;'s 14 day exchange policy.  The camera would not focus and continually shook...the replacement works perfect.  Apparently I was the second person with this issue so keep a lookout for this if you pick up a G2.  Charging from 50% to 100% only takes an hour using a nexus 7 charger.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "A State of the Art effort.", "Author": "Ncruze", "ReviewID": "R3L25T4143GWCG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I dont write phone reviews. I'm a harsh critic when it comes to electronics and most of the time every device is good until you use it for some time so longevity wise the verdict is still out on this one but i'll have to say I'm utterly shocked that LG has put out such a well rounded device. I wont write a long review because people don't like to spend all day reading so i'll get to the point.Features:Features is what creates a better user experience.- The number one thing that stands out to me about this device is the Knock Knock. This allows you to turn your phone on and off by just simply tapping the screen twice. I dont have to worry about fiddling with the power button to wake the device up. You'll be amazed how much easier this feature makes your life become.- Answer a phone call by placing the device close to your ear.- Pause videos by looking away from the screen, resume once again by looking at the screen. I know the Samsung GS series first started using this but i find it useless.- QSlide - Allows you to multitask by creating a mini version of certain useful apps on the desktop while simoltaneously accessing other apps in the background. LOVE IT!!- Clip Tray - Cut and paste has changed for ever. This feature allows you to copy anything to the clip tray including text, documents and images and stores them for later use. You then can paste anything from you clip tray anywhere, anytime. LOVE IT!!Camera:- Dual Mode - Allows you to take a picture of two images at one, camera utilizes the front facing and back facing lenses for a shot.- Video Snap shot - Allows you to take pictures while recording a video. Actually this feature allows you to take a snap shot pic of ANY video weather created by the LG camera or one you found on your SD Card. LOVE IT!!- Say It - Allows you to speak certain keywords to take a picture. LOVE IT!!Now some of these features you may or may not have already heard in other devices but i think it's the execution of the LG that makes these features worth while. For instance the Say it keyword for the camera to take a pic is on the Samsung Galaxy S series but I've seen my sister bark several commands using keywords and it worked 1 out of 10 tries. Terrible!!Battery and Snapdragon processor i wont discuss because these are covered in great detail everywhere you look about this phone. These two are hands down the best two features of this, simply amazing!Cons:- This device is a huge finger print collector because of the material it's constructed from. Shouldn't be a big deal.- Speaker phone is average,- Audio hasn't been the greatest. For some reason users voices on a phone call sometimes sounds scrambled or digitized..that could be a sim card issue not sure but i've experienced this quite often.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "CAAmazoner", "ReviewID": "R12AICA04IZ6SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this phone two days ago for AT&T.;It is absolutely amazing. Coming from an iPhone 4S, it is at least as fast if not faster in all things. This includes the interface, which is buttery smooth, something I had not experienced on older Androids when I had demoed them.The LG software is unobtrusive, but adds some powerful features, including the ability to launch some common apps (such as the dial pad, the calendar, and the calculator) in a *resizeable* *floating* window. This allows for multi-tasking almost like a Windows desktop, and it easily beats any other smartphone multi-tasking I have seen.This phone has already been \"rooted\" just a few days after release, so those who wish to customize it heavily will have that option. Personally, I use it in an Enterprise work environment, so I will likely keep it \"stock\" but the customizations even without root are mind-blowing.I use the phone with a Pebble watch, which is also an extraordinary thing -- all of my notifications pop right up on my wrist. This is the future!Details---Battery life: This phone comes with a HUGE 3000mah battery. After turning off Skype (it was using a lot of standby battery), I finish most days with normal/moderate usage with over 60% battery (7:30 pm). VERY impressive. It also charges very fast with the supplied 1.8A charger.Screen: This is an IPS screen and it is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I think it is MUCH better looking with much more realistic colors than a Samsung S4, and it gets at least as bright if not brighter. The Autobrightness feature does not work very well however.Back buttons: I personally don't really like the buttons being on the back of the phone, but it isn't too bad, especially with a special feature that allows me to tap the black screen of sleeping phone and turn it back on.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powerhouse of a phone, but I wouldn't call it perfect", "Author": "Russ", "ReviewID": "R8M7PIXF366RV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is power everything?  For some it's all they look for in a new device, for others they just want something that does what they need it to do and is easy to use.  No one can deny that the LG G2 is not a beast of a phone with it's (currently) top of the line 800 Snapdragon processor, so I'll be reviewing this phone based on the latter (ease of use).THE BAD - LG's default Android wrapper (software, whatever you call it). While they don't prevent you from changing the settings and removing/turn off anything that you don't want to use in the device; it's certainly not a phone that I would give to my parents (or any other non tech savvy person) straight from the box.  Also, I think the notification pull down is hampered by the QSlide feature, but it's just another \"feature\" (button in the notification pull down) that needs to be turned off.THE GOOD - Battery life.  For right now (I've only had this device for about a week now), the battery life is pretty fantastic.  I've made it through 2 whole days without charging and that was with moderate YouTube viewing (5-10 videos), some web browsing, about 30-40 text messages, and checking social networks about 3-6 times a day.  At the end I think I had about 10-14% left. (FYI, I'm also using the Greenify app so that may have increased the battery life a little bit).But be warned, I drained the battery recently from 75% to less than 15% in about 1-2 hours while playing Plants vs. Zombies 2 (also the processor got fairly hot during this time).THE (possibly) FRUSTRATING - Double knock to open. I've seen many reviewers stating that the knock to open feature is spotty (works 1 out of 3 tries) and at first I would have agreed with them.  But I discovered that you have to really knock with authority (no light tapping) to open the device on the first try (works about 95% of the time for me now).SUMMARY - Look, if you enjoy technology and you're not afraid to change phone settings to your liking then this phone is fine for you.  But would I recommend it for someone like my in-laws who can barely take a picture on their phone?  No.  To me it has less to do with this phone and more to do with the software (Android).  Let's just say, I've had to be tech support for far more Android owners than iOS owners (even Windows phone confuses people, surprisingly).*** A quick background of myself - I'm using this device on T-Mobile (LTE) in a large metropolitan area.  My service has been great so far, but your experience may vary from mine.  Also, I'm going back to Android from a Windows Phone (HTC Radar with Windows Phone 7.5), and I have an iPod Touch with iOS 6.something so I think that I have a fairly decent understanding of each mobile operating system's strengths and weaknesses. So which operating system is better?  Depends on who you are but I'll give you a breakdown below if you feel like reading. ***Windows Phone (my personal favorite user interface) (Microsoft) - Good for people who just want a phone to be a phone.  Big buttons, solid operating system (rarely crashed for me), easy navigation, great battery life, amazing cameras (Nokia line), and great for social media (if you don't follow a million people, though Groups does ease that a bit).  It would be a perfect smartphone if it had A.) Better access to YouTube, B.) Better access to Google Calender, and C.) Less confusing initial setup / clearer instructions for functions (it took me almost 3 months to understand how to copy and paste a website URL for instance, LOL).  As far as the whole apps argument; expect to be excluded from the latest apps, but most of the major apps are available.Android (Google) - Good for tech savvy.  Look, if you need help operating an ordinary computer than just avoid Android.  Sure, the latest operating system looks, feels, and acts a lot like an iPhone. And yes, the fastest, biggest, and cheapest phones are all using Android, but tell that to my dad when he somehow accidentally erased his entire address book (and didn't even know that he could back up that data).  Also bloatware/crapware is a problem with some brands (looking at you Samsung).iOS/iPhone (Apple) - Good for the latest apps, and good for mom.  I don't think I have to explain this operating system, do I?  It's like the vanilla of smart phones. Also, if you are using Apple devices/services then you're probably better off sticking with an iPhone.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Donny Cooke", "ReviewID": "R16X9XA5Y5Q87U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is everything that is reported to be.

And I had many phones in the last 7 years (not including using my wife's, cousin's, etc..). And now the price is dropping even further down. With phones like this one and the next gen in 2014, iphones will have a tough time selling soon although they have a niche market and people are seemingly Apple-lifers. If you use an iphone 5S for a week and then put your hands on the LG G2, you would realize what most already know- Android rules & LG is providing superior tech without all the high price of Samsung and Sony. Don't get me wrong, I was a big supporter and user of the iphone and Galaxy lines, and maybe I'll change to something different in the future- however, Google with their open-source method and rapid adoption by developers and outrageous number of choices and ''free'' apps, it would be near impossible to think of an alternative.

The SCREEN - oh my word. It makes my beautiful HTC One's screen look small and dim. This is the best screen I've seen on any smartphone. The thin bezels are...thin.  The resolution is impossibly sharp.  I love, love, LOVE the screen. It's difficult to overstate how awesome it is.  OH MY GOSH IT'S SO AWESOME!2. It's difficult to imagine a much better camera, hardware-wise. The images are perhaps slightly on the cool side for my personal taste (I edit most images anyway), but the resolution is high without graininess, the shutter is fast, and you get very usable images overall.  The camera software is...not my favorite.  See my notes on software later on.3. Snappy. Fast. No lag at all. The processor/RAM combination on this phone will please anyone.  Overall, though, I think that hardware specs are overrated as a way to judge high-end smartphones.  You won't be able to tell a difference between a Snapdragon 600 and a Snapdragon 800, 99.8% of the time.  Don't buy a phone just because of a 0.5 GHz difference in processor speed.4. You will notice the larger battery on this phone.  It outlasts my HTC One by an hour or so overall.  It doesn't charge very fast though.5. Fairly thin profile, on par with other flagship smartphones.6. Good price for a high-end phone.What could go either way:1. Buttons on the back of the phone.  You get used to them quickly, and some people even really like them. Some might hate them.  For me, it wasn't actually a huge deal either way. I think overall, I prefer them on the side, but don't make this a sticking-point.2. I don't know how I managed to scratch this screen in just two weeks of ownership, but I did. In several places. With a case on the phone. Now, this may be me and not the case, but usually I expect a bit more durability. Still, it's Gorilla Glass...so there's that...What I don't like:1. The SOFTWARE skin.  Why, oh why did you butcher Android, LG? Okay, it's not terrible. Just...dinky.  Cheesy.  Overdone. There are a lot of features, but all of them are just a little...too much. Overall, the feel is just cartoony.  Coming from the modern, sleek, understated, and beautiful HTC Sense - and iOS before that - it was just not for me. I'm pretty sure I would have been wholly taken in by this phone if it had stock Android. But the software experience is so much more important than specs and even the screen.  Design is somewhat a subjective thing, but it was more than design. Even ignoring the AT&T; add-ons, there just way too much bloat. Some people may not care as much about software.  But for me, it really was a deal breaker, and I had to trade it in after two weeks.2. Slick, plastic shell materials. It's not that it doesn't feel \"premium\". It's solid enough.  Just not as premium as my HTC One or iPhone. The hardware appearance is just obviously not something they emphasized.Overall:Go try this phone.  Play with it for a long time. Play with the settings, the dialer, the contacts, the email.  Do it all, and if you like the software then get this phone. If you it bothers you even a little, beware - it may drive you mad.  But it's subjective, and you might like it. The screen, battery, and specs are perhaps the best in the market - even 8 months after its launch.  If you find you like the software, you can't go wrong with the LG G2.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "risbo", "ReviewID": "R1CVCX7QGN8QW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The smartphone good as i expected.

Android software/apps \u2013 don\u2019t need to tell you. So far my favorite features on this phone are:  Double Gorilla Corning glass, dual camera that can focus on sound and can take pictures from front and back simultaneously. This camera rivals Cannon Pro-shot. And how about \u201ctap the glass\u201d feature to turn it on/off? How about wireless charging? You can also set an alarm with starting your app automatically right after the alarm. So when I wake up I know the weather outside before I open my eyes. How about colored LEDs on top \u2013now you can set no sound, no vibrate, but LED colors to ID the calling person. I think there like 10 different colors.How about Voice Mate built in? This is the coolest \u2013 you can tell your phone \u201cHello Genie\u201d and the phone will wake up and start answering your questions intelligently. You can say \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d, \u201cWhat playing in the movies tonight?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s on TV?\u201d, \u201cHow the Bruins did last night?\u201d \u2013 You\u2019ll get accurate and meaningful voice responses every time.  This makes it true ANDROID. I even said once \u201cI love you Genie\u201d and I got again intelligent and funny answer.I also love that seems all my favorite apps are working much better.

I'm coming from the HTC One Maxx and the Note 2.  I thought the Maxx was about the best, but I had to return it because I couldn't \"handle\" it.  I kept dropping it or losing it because it was too big to fit in my pocket COMFORTABLY, (and I never like anything in my pockets anyway), and too bulky for a belt holster.  So I carried it in my hand - and broke two screens and lost it the third time.  I switched to the LG G2 and love it!PROS:* It's a good size and feels good in the hand.  I preferred the bigger HTC One Maxx screen for it's size, the front speakers, and Blinkfeed, but the LG G2 for everything else.* The power and volume buttons on the back.  This is AWESOME.  It's just the right place for them.  I wish all manufacturers would do this.  Brilliant!!* Since it doesn't have HTC Blinkfeed, I was able to use my go-to launcher - ADW Launcher EX.  The main thing there is it lets me make the icons bigger and remove the text under the icons, for a much bigger and cleaner look.  All with a button click.* Interface is great.  I love the fact that I can SEE the Back, Home, and Settings soft buttons at the bottom of the screen.  With the HTC, and a lot of phones, you can't see them.  And lots of other features that others have mentioned, really make a big difference in usability.* It allows for INDUCTIVE CHARGING!  No plugging anything in; just sit the phone on the charging \"plate\".  Very convenient.  The HTC One MAxx didn't allow for this.CONS:*  I'd prefer the speakers facing front, but that would mean a smaller screen or a bigger phone, so I'm actually OK with it.  It's loud enough, for sure.
