This model is no different. It's a great phone with nice features, easy to use and pretty too. I bought a 'very good' condition phone from Teczilla. It's in gorgeous condition, cost a lot less than a brand new one,  and arrived 2 days early. I'm veryyy happy with my purchase, and my phone!! Giving the BlackBerry Curve 8310 5 stars.Revised Review- I've had to change my review as the phone will rarely send a picture, either one I've taken, or one I've received, without causing its appearance to be completely impossible to view or only partially viewable. Newer phones work fine. I think it's only because its such an older version phone. But disappointing because my previous phone didn't have a camera, and that's why I purchased this one. This has no reflection on Amazon. Just an FYI for future purchasers of older model phones.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Alright phone for the money.", "Author": "Carlos Rosales \"carlos rosales\"", "ReviewID": "R1VI5OZQ7EOMXN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't have this model anymore. Besides in my collection. Since I am into BlackBerry OS and iOS. I can tell you that this phone isn't bad. It does everything that it was made to do. Gives great Wireless LAN connectivity and the 3g is a plus for this Model which if I remember correctly is running 4.5 But it is somewhat outdated now. But still user friendly just add some eye candy (THEME) and you wont be able to tell the difference from let's say a 9630 or 85xx where the 85XX is simply an updated version of the 83XX with 5.0 OS. as of now I use the Blackberry 8350i for work. and My BlackBerry 9780 for Personal. I enjoy this for I have 5.0 on my 8350i Unlike the previous 8310 ,8320, 8330 which will more than likely stay at 4.5.0, 4.5.1.
