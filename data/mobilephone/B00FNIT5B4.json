My suspicion is that the power cable was switched for a US plug.Works well, and easy to set up.  The operation is a bit sluggish compared to the GS4, however still manageable.  There are a few features missing that could be inconvenient for some people.  My suggestion would be to do a YouTube search on 'Galaxy Trend Duos' before purchasing.  The YouTube review by Tech2buzz.com sums up all the pros and cons.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!!", "Author": "Edith Jerez", "ReviewID": "R12119P9EW6VGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Samsung for my niece and she loves it!! it's fast, light, and beautiful!!
