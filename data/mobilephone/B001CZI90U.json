There were many things about the ID that frustrated me, such as a lack of camera and poor screen quality. The LX has a crystal clear sceen and a pretty good camera, considering it is still a phone. Of course the LX is pricey, but you will get what you pay for. I'm a sidekick girl at heart, and this was a great buy.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not a bad phone, but not great either.", "Author": "S. D. Greer", "ReviewID": "R2OZNB1M8L9X3U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EDIT: I would like to note that I've actually gone through TWO Sidekick LXs so far, with a third on the way in the mail. This is due to my bluetooth malfunctioning to such a degree that it can't be a fluke or occasional connection problem. I do not have high hopes for this third phone and I anticipate that I will also have to return the third one to swap for an equivalent but different brand phone just to have bluetooth functionality. If you don't use bluetooth, or don't mind a wired headset, this problem is irrelevant, but one of the main reasons I purchased an LX was because it did have bluetooth. I've not read online of anyone else having the same problem I have, so it is either a rare problem or I'm just absurdly unlucky. (and no, sadly, it isn't user error for me--I've troubleshooted this issue with TMobile quite a bit with no less than three bluetooth headsets from two different manufacturers)Aside from that problem, the LX is a fine phone, and you can read my original review below.My first Sidekick was the Sidekick II. I loved it! I skipped the Sidekick 3 because I heard a number of awful things about it. And now I own the Sidekick LX.I actually purchased the Motorola Sidekick Slide first, because I liked the colors better and didn't see a real need for the upgraded Aquos screen. Big mistake. I was lucky and didn't get one of the ones with the notorious power-off problem, but it still had problems of its own. The MicroSD card, for instance? The Slide read it once, and then for some reason, it decided it couldn't read it anymore! Typing was uncomfortable compared to the SK2. I decided to go to the T-Mobile store and return it for a Sidekick LX.Popped that same MicroSD card into the LX and it read it just fine!I like my LX, I really, really do. But the lack of features really hurts:-No Wifi support (Curve has this)-No 3g support (Curve doesn't have this either)-No A2DP Bluetooth support (you can't use bluetooth headphones to listen to your mp3s)-The speaker on the phone sucks--when I'm using my phone directly (instead of my bluetooth headset) I have to turn the volume to the max to be able to hear who I'm talking to, and I have no hearing problems whatsoever!-The camera REALLY sucks, I've not gone to compare yet but I remember my SK2 camera being better than this one!-Very, very limited in what third party applications are availableThere are some bonuses to the Sidekick LX:-Cheapest data plan of all the T-Mobile data plans, and it gives you unlimited texting (the other plans do not), which is key if you're the type of person who sends lots of text messages.-Terminal program (big selling point for me--don't worry if you don't know what it is, you probably won't need it)-Big, clear screen-Easy to use keyboard (it is larger than most smartphone keyboards and may be the best smartphone keyboard around)Considering the price I paid for my Sidekick LX, I'm quite happy with the phone in spite of its flaws. There are a number of times I wish I had purchased the Helio Ocean or the Blackberry Curve instead. Unless the next Sidekick sports some of the more important features (3g, WiFi, A2DP Bluetooth) this will be my last Sidekick.For text happy teens, however, this is the best phone on the market due to the data plan alone--unlimited text messages!", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "What the SK3 should have BEEN & MORE!!!!!", "Author": "Always Samsung \"ravereviews\"", "ReviewID": "R150SW5DN4PS5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What the SK3 should have BEEN & MORE!!!!!This is a great DEVICE and really throws you in the social scene of TRENDY teens and early folks in there 20's. This device SCREAMS mainstream. The SK LX is everything the SK3 should have been and more. The SK3 had a washed out screen and ironically the SK2s screen and colors just POPPED while the SK3 was total dullsville. The SK3 couldn't even send picture messages and at one point i think mine started to not even accept picture messages. You get everything that was on the previous SKs accept this time the screen has been improved by 100% and its also a larger screen. You also get to send picture message but no camcorder or video message on this device. Which was a bit shocking, considering every standard cell phone has this feature i was a bit shocked that this one didn't have that. Perhaps maybe the SK4 will have it. You also get to record voice message that only last 20 seconds but you can send em to a friend for laughs. There is still no 3G service so your surfing the web at EDGE speeds and i live in NY and i haven't seen a slower browser then this one. There are certain times where its actually quite fast but i couldn't imagine trying to surf the web if i lived in Texas by the horses. Anyways this is a great buy and I love keyboard and as much I try to stay away from the SK I always find myself coming back to the device. Hopefully the next installment will fix all the flaws as the SK LX is just a cosmetic upgrade over the SK3. Real great device but for the price I would of liked to see a bit more new features added in.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "IT'S MEDIOCRE", "Author": "Latrice S.

I see that the Sidekick Slide is not listed on Amazon probably because it is such a piece of junk.I bought two Sidekicks at Christmas for my daughters.  I was not told that unless i bough the additional $20 a month Sidekick package, the phones would not have the basic functionality available on other phones such as retaining contacts.  THey also lose messages constantly.When I talked to T-Mobile about this, the answer I received was basically, too bad.  They didn't communicate that I would need the additional package but that's not their problem. So basically I paid them $440 for phones that are a piece of junk unless you are willing to increase your monthly bill by $20 a month per phone AND I am stuck in their two year contract.I am seriously considering legal action.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The LX is also Bluetooth capable, and has signature swivel screen, amazing keyboard, plus the killer MySpace experience, you can't miss.", "Name": "T-Mobile Sidekick LX - Cellular phone - GSM - swivel - T-Mobile", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61l%2BxLb3-pL.gif", "ProductID": "B001CZI90U"}}
