{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Timothy Lawless", "ReviewID": "R1L49PNC311Y02", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is not a bad device at all. Especially for children that you don't want breaking your $300 phone. Here is the need to know about the device.- Resistive screen but still allows multi-touch to some degree. No problems playing multi touch games.- Decent Battery Life. Between 4 and 5 hours.- The screen is not as crisp as you would see on high end phones.- There is a headphone jack but I don't see a microphone anywhere.- There is no camera- A bit bulkier then a 4.3 inch Android phone. Plastic feels a bit cheap.- The built-in in volume and suspend buttons are a bit wobbly so I would suggest you handle the hard buttons with care.- All apps and games ran very smoothly. No problems in it's functionality.- You can install apps from Google Play and Amazon Appstore- Plays audio and video files with no problem.- Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent- The device comes pre-rooted for some reason so be careful configuring.- NO HOME button at all. In order to get back to the home screen you have to hold down the standby button and the option to return to home will appear in those options. A way around this flaw is to download a piece of software called BK SOFTHOME which will add a home button to your notification bar.The bottom line is that you get what you pay for. The device feels cheaply made and has a few minor flaws but for under $50 it makes a great gift for kids under 10 and if it does get broke your not out a whole lot of money.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun little device", "Author": "Holyghostgrl", "ReviewID": "R2LW8IUHD6I3VN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Battery life is pretty good. It pretty much functions like the regular size android tablets. I played games and read a book while waiting in long lines at the grocery stores. You have to use a stylus for the touch to function well. I didnt give it a 5 star because there is no one button to take you to the home screen and no wall charger..it is like a little ipod touch. It downloads from the google play store with ease. And putting my music from my computer on it was no problem", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A fantastic little device!!!", "Author": "Dean Hannotte", "ReviewID": "R1GPBDY0EB2R0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have three Androids, a $100 9\", a $250 7\" Nexus, and a JXD S18 -- and this little guy is my favorite. However, I have a specific use for it that you may not have. I like to listen to music or comedy when I go to sleep, so I have used MP3 players for a decade. My last one offered 8Gb's and cost $28. This one cost $50 and gives me 12Tb! How? Because of a great new app called Tonido which allows my Androids to live-connect via WIFI to my desktop computer which has 4Tb of internal and 8Tb of external hard disk storage. So I can now play ANY media file I own on this little JXD. Using the TuneIn app I also have a ridiculously flexible Internet Radio as well. NOTE: I wouldn't expect full tablet functionality from a $50 device and neither should you. 1) Keep the device plugged into a USB wall charger since the battery is not great (especially if it's playing all night), 2) Remember that the screen is \"resistive\" rather than \"capacitive\", so use a fingernail or stylus to touch things, 3) There is no 'home' icon so get used to pressing the 'standby' button for a few seconds after which you will be offered two options, 'HOME' and 'REBOOT'. If you can live with these caveats, BUY THIS TODAY.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my l\"il tablet !!", "Author": "m.k", "ReviewID": "R2T5AEUHIYQ29L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a good tablet. firstly, shipping time was good, as well customer service came to questions prior to delivery. ok, charged it up, runs 4..5 hours on a charge. slow bootup, but fairly quick there after. no camera, but has a mic in lower left corner for voice search. no camera nor hd, or bluetooth. no 3g. eak volume, but ok holding distance or better. note..important...for best screen touch result being resistance...a stylus works like a charm. also, important..long press off button that will have a drop window for option to power off OR HOME CHOICE. no onscreen touch home button less u download bk software on amazon apps a home on screen button. video quality good. large buttons, but tailerable. wifi excellent. there is flex in the in the top buttons, noted reviews making it like buttons going to break or worse, there is 3 buttons on a bar with flex..nothing to worry.there solid. what i like, pop a 16 gb card in, download tubemate app from amazon and i can download 2 movies at a time unto a the sd card less than 40 minuttes !! this little unit seems to do good. would recommend, even for kids. remember...use a stylus for best results, otherwise, it can be difficult. I bought 2 they that good. why 4 stars ? no camera/recorder. oh, you can use this even while charger plugged in. I have a 4.3\" elsse, and the jxd s18 mini puts it to shame. enjoy.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "AMouse", "ReviewID": "R36MVC3FPIF5ND", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The tablet works well.  The top part of the screen where the controls are are very hard to use, can not seem to get it to register when tapped, it is as if it it too close to the top and even with a stylus pen, it does not seem to work (the back button).

I don't like a lot of bells and whistles when it comes to my tech, I'm one of those minimalist types who grudgingly uses the available technology,but doesn't go ga-ga over the latest IPhone.You have to get used to it, and play with it to get the feel of navigating all the Mini Pad's nooks and crannies. This was my first ever low-end tablet, and noted it's not as slick as an iPod.Unfortunately it doesn't support the latest version of the I Heart Radio app, which is one of the main reasons why I purchased it. However I'm sure I can find a way around this. I deleted most of the 'fluff' that came with it, games, photos, even the animated short that was thrown in. Don't need it!Overall: it's decent, it works and it comes wi-fi ready.
