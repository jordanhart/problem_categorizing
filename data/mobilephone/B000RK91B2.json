Ordered the phone with my wife saying to myself. \"What's the use for having a smartphone in your face or having computer in your pocket to notify you every single time there's some drama going on with other ppl you havent seen in so many years. Well life gets all of us. So open yours eyes and pick your head up. Value the life that shines around you, and remember what you have around you.\" So I was stoked to get this phone. And thinking I had to wait 7 days was to long. Lol but thankfully came in 3. So I would definitely recommend to order from here. Phone came in superb condition. So hats off. And to who all have read through. Love life, and enjoy the beauty in this new day. :)", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "2 Thumbs up", "Author": "Patrick Mcglynn", "ReviewID": "R32WBPO50BRSYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd razr I've ordered off of amazon and by far the best.
