{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a great phone for the price range.", "Author": "Xiong Mao", "ReviewID": "R2B4B2B6RB03J7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this exact model (but with a green back cover) in China in October 2011. I needed something cheap, and I needed it fast. I didn't want to spend too much money, because I wouldn't be there for more than a few months. My only reason for purchasing it was to call people, send texts, use Google Translate, and use Baidu maps to get around. Fortunately, I was also able to tether right out of the box as well -- and connect my laptop when I was in rural China.If you're a frequent traveler, global roaming is a giant money scam. I suggest buying yourself an unlocked phone, and just switching in SIM cards in the country of your choice... if they support them. Many places will let you pay month-to-month. For example, in China, I'll pay about $10.50 per month for a pretty decent package. Compared to the global roaming packages, this is a steal.You need to ask yourself: what do you want, and how much are you willing to pay for it? If you want an awesome smartphone, go buy something else. But if you need a smartphone which allows you to do the basic things such as texting, calling, tethering, and web surfing, then this is actually pretty good... if you can deal with the small resolution.The Camera is actually pretty decent as well. It was much better than I anticipated.Make sure you get a MicroSD card (up to 16GB) if one doesn't come with this. Use that to install applications on, rather than the paltry 160MB of built-in storage.Cons:- Terrible screen resolution (240x320)- Low built-in storage space- Low amount of ram- Terrible battery, but I kept it plugged in most of the time.- Performance isn't perfect.Pros:- It actually works very well, and it's extremely stable.- Upgrades to Gingerbread easily. Google the instructions. This requires root.- After upgrading to Gingerbread, you can install Cyanogen Mod, etc...- Most of the time, it runs pretty good.- The camera is actually pretty decent.You may also need to download and install the Google apps package if it doesn't come with the phone (mine didn't). Again, Google this for more information.Remember, you get what you pay for. For this price range, the phone is actually pretty good. However -- as of this post -- there may be much better phones for the same price, or a few dollars more. It might be worth it to skip this phone entirely and find something else. If you can afford it, try to go for something with a bigger screen, and better everything else. Otherwise, this phone is solid, but probably isn't for people with bad eyesight.I'll be using this phone often on my international travels, at least until I break down and buy the Note. It satisfies all of my basic requirements, and then some. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small, compact and great for a starter Smartphone", "Author": "catchnoball", "ReviewID": "R2TV5VV89FW527", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A friend owns the same phone and I was able to test it out before purchasing one. As other reviewers have brought out, the battery life is quite bad. Be prepared to charge your phone every night if you run a lot of apps. I'll be looking into getting a new battery with higher capacity. The Qwerty keyboard while texting can be a tad small, easily fixed by turning the phone on the vertical, buttons are slightly larger then.  The other 'complaint' about this was that it came without an ear-piece, easily rectified by getting one cheap online. As for it being truly unlocked, I haven't been able to test that function out yet. We travel frequently to Asia and I hope it works there. All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase, esp for the price paid.Update 10/14/11: Wanted to note too, the adapter that is provided for N. America customers is totally worthless as the charger comes with the 3 rectangular prongs. The adapter provided will not fit, so be prepared to buy your own adapter. Apart from that, the phone works just fine.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone but some issues to be aware of", "Author": "Jeffrey Pittman \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1T2YJHH9UNZ4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Due to some discussion about very different flavors of this phone being shipped by different sellers, this review is for a phone sent to me by UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC via Amazon.  Delivery was prompt and the item was in brand new condition (if it wasn't they sure did a great job making it look that way).  Mine came with a very brief manual (if you want to call it that) in English, with the phone set to UK English.  This is my first even semi-smart phone, but I have some experience as an Android tablet user so it wasn't all new to me.I have several USB cables with male USB mini connectors.  This phone uses a USB micro connector for charging and data transfer so I bought some mini-to-micro adapters so I could use the stuff I have, but the adapters turned out to be useless.  The female USB micro port on the phone is recessed in the housing such that the male USB micro fits only if it will fit inside this very, very small housing.  The adapters I bought, though small, were too big to allow the male plug to be inserted deep enough into the female to make a connection (or even stay in place - they fall right out).  I'm thinking I'm going to have to get genuine Samsung cables from somewhere but haven't finished looking around yet.The power adapter, which has the proper size USB micro male on it, is a European plug design and it comes with a plug adapter, presumably so it can be used in the US.  While you can indeed plug it into a 110/120V outlet in the US with the adapter, it has absolutely no effect on the phone.  It doesn't charge at all.  I'm guessing it expects more voltage, but whatever.  The cable is built into the transformer and so is useless as a spare data or charging cable.  Also, apparently not all charging cables will transfer data as well as charge.  Be careful when looking at charging cables or kits to make sure you get one that can both charge the device *and* transfer data between the phone and your computer.  If it just says it's for charging, it is probably not for both purposes.That means that this package contains one and only one usable cable for charging and data sync, via a standard USB connection on the PC side of things and a micro USB male on the phone side.  You will probably want to plan to buy a spare or two but I don't have a recommendation on that yet because the USB micro female port on the phone won't accept just any USB micro male.  It has to be in a really, really small housing.I couldn't use the camera app or install the Amazon App Store (or several other items) until I put a 32GB micro SD card in the phone (all 32GB were recognized).  Get an SD card installed before you start trying to install much of anything; it solves a number of problems.The Android Market and the Amazon App store initially reported that several apps were not compatible with my device.  I downloaded and installed Samsung Kies on my Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit machine with no problems.  Then closed it down and started it again and it asked if I wanted to update it and I said yes.  So it updated, and then asked if I wanted to upgrade the firmware in my phone.  I said yes.  After I did this (by this point I had already installed the SD card), app installations have been smooth as silk, even the often aggravating Words With Friends which seems to decide that any device you have is incompatible about every other week.I recommend you look for \"App2SD\" or a similar application that allows you to move (or which automatically moves) applications to your SD card instead of letting them hog space in the limited onboard phone memory.  Some apps must live in the phone but others can live on the SD card.I had trouble with the Bluetooth phone application in my car (a late model Hyundai) and found that others have too.  I paired the phone with the car successfully and could make and receive hands-free calls through the system with no trouble.  I could not get my phonebook/contact list to download from the phone into my car, though.  After much aggravation and searching, I found a post on a board that suggested a free Android app called Bluetooth File Transfer.  Download and install that app; start it; hit Menu; hit More; hit Send Contacts; Select All (or whatever you want); hit Send As Single.  The app blasted my contact/phonebook list out into the ether where the car saw them floating around (the car was configured to auto-download) and sucked them all in.  Et voila!  Yes, I do have to remember to refresh the car's copy from time to time but I can live with that.The screen scratches pretty easily; you may want to consider a protector.And oh yes, I bought a 1500mAh battery because of so many people saying the battery life was lousy.  At least for now, my battery life with the originally supplied battery is excellent IMHO with Bluetooth and WiFi on 24/7.  But you always need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere.This sounds almost like a list of complaints but I don't mean it to be.  I like this phone and would recommend it highly.  All I need now are a few cheap cables and a few accessories, which I always seem to need when I get something like this.  It has taken about a week of on-again, off-again diddling to get it largely where I want it, but that's not unreasonable for a new tech toy.  If you are new to Android expect it to take a bit longer, but that's not the phone's fault - it's just how it is.  I hope some of these comments are useful if you are considering or have bought this phone.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "What I expected", "Author": "Justo Mayora", "ReviewID": "R2NL02W6KZ9AY8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I choose this Samsung phone based on another model I bought about a year ago and because this one has the Android OS. I found the phone to be what I expected. It is easy to use, works fine with my carrier and I can download apps from Google Android Market. Samsung rates this model as an entry level smartphone.I want to develop some simple Android apps and use them in my phone. I already did some tests and it works.The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the phone came with six apps from a developer in Portugal that I don't want but can't remove from the phone.I would recommend this phone to those who want a small device with a little intelligence and not so difficult to understand and use.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Manual is not in English", "Author": "Lynne Wang", "ReviewID": "R26S1Y79KANFLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the phone on time, but the phone has a manual in French without any English. And the phone's default set up is in French too. It took me two hours to figure out how to set it up to English. After everything is all set up as English, there are still 2 French apps left on the phone. I guess one is a French emergency service(like ours 911) and another one is the manual on the phone, which are pretty annoying. I tried to update the system, the two Frenc apps are still there.Another problem is that it does not work unless you know how to set up the mobile network service. It pop up 2 networks, one is ATT PHONE, another one is Wap/cingular. If you use ATT, you need to chose wap/cingular. The ATT Phone one is not working. And after I chose the wrong one, it does not let me choose another one. I have to hand type in the Wap/cingular setting in the ATT phone setting to make it work.But in the end it works. And it works fine. I enjoy it so far. If the manual and language are all good and correct, I would give this a better rating. I am not sure if these are general problem or it is the problem from the specific seller's product.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "mat0000", "ReviewID": "R9U6P94AY24PX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone, good size and weight.

It's small, but very powerful. Nothing to envy to other smart phones.The box comes with:- A battery- A charger (with an American A/C power adaptator)- USB data cable- 2GB MicroSD memory- A manual (in Italian, but you can easily download the english version fron sansumg page. Google it!)Although the phone's description states that the installed android OS is the \"Froyo\" version, in my case the one installed is \"Gingerbread\", which improves the phone performance. Great!The touch screen is fantastic. Even if this is your first touch screen phone, surely you will feel comfortable with it in less than an hour of use.The comments about the battery life, I'm afraid, they are all true. It sucks! (For that reason, I give 4 stars to this item). With heavy use (i.e. Playing music, WIFI on, surfing the web, installing apps, etc), you have to plug the phone in 12 hours. However, with non-heavy use, and turning off the WIFI when you aren't using it, the battery life can reach between 24 and 36 hours of continuous use.Finally, the phone is truly unlocked. You can use it outside USA without problems.I hope this helps.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Czech Republic SmartPhone is NOT 'International SmartPhone', beware!!", "Author": "Hernan", "ReviewID": "R22VS702YYTHAV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone was in Czech language. It had installed an 'O2 Czech Republic' carrier ROM, instead of a carrier-free \"International\" ROM.

I went with another Android through image icons, to the language menu, in order to change it. Next step: flashing the ROM to a standard Samsung one in order to use it in the US. Also, manual IS ONLY IN Czech language! Finally, when contacted the seller about it, they never reply on locked ROM issue and they only answer: 'download manual'.

Unlike other models like the Samsung totoro 5360, this piece of equipment has great speaker volume, you can be heard loud and clear on the other end and has a good ringer volume too. Those are details not many people write about if they are happy with the phone.Having said that, I must say I'm very surprised about it's processor. Although running only at 600Mhz it can handle Skype voice calls quite well over WiFi and 3G. No interruption or glitches experienced by using VoIP. Being a former user of an HTC Wildfire bearing up to 524Mhz I must say it felt good to have those extra Mhz's ..If you compare screen resolution with newer, retina-display-like models you'll be dissapointed. Text and graphics look clear, but not as vivid as next-gen phones like the iPhone or higher-end devices like Samsung Galaxy S2/S3, if that's the case, you'll be probably looking into a different price range.WiFi tethering: Good!, thanks to Android 2.3.6 you can connect up to 5 devices, but your battery will drain to zero before you know it. You can't ask to behave as a WiFi hotspot with this small battery.GPS is accurate and fast. I don't use the phone to read or answer email, for that I own a blackberry.It's a great phone either as your primary device, or if you are buying it just to travel overseas. Super easy to pop a foreign SIM card and start calling at local rates. Double-check compatibility for 3G first, as this is a DUAL-BAND handset on 3G band, meaning that you have to choose either the 850/1900 or 900/2100Mhz version.Calling is not a problem, as it's QUAD-BAND on GSM/EDGE. You'll get slower speeds but it will work worldwide.Con:No chance to upgrade OS. 2.3.6 is your last update.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, WORKS GREAT", "Author": "Pablo Aguirre", "ReviewID": "R2TQUMQOYPC663", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the product by Wireless Everything, and I was concerned about a couple of reviews which stated that the cellphone is a German reburbished non working phone.Well, in my case, the cellphone came brand new. Still, it came set up un German, but I changed the language and everything works good.About the phone, its a very good non-expensive smartphone. I have installed a whole bunch of apps from the google market, and all of them work good. There are some apps that can't be downloaded, but I think it is because the processor or ram capacity aren't enough to run them, specially the ones that have  a HD in their names.Cons.Sometimes, about every 7 days, the Wifi can't turn on, but I reboot the phone and it works good, mostly I think it is an Android bug more than a phone issue.The battery juice is enough only for a day. I mean, after I connect to a wifi spot for a complete hour, the battery indicator starts to reduce. So it means that if I connect to a wifi spot for three complete hours, the battery will drain completely. I hope it gives you an idea about how much battery juice the phone has. If you are a person who makes calls in an average way through the day and use the wifi for 15 minutes or so, then the phone will last a day and a half or maybe two days.ProsEverything. Its a very good phone. The screen has a good resolution, touch expereience is great and the overall performance of the phone is good. The processor and ram are good enough to work with various apps at the same time. Don't spect it to be a super computer, I mean, it slows down when there are heavy apps loaded, but still manage to work through.It came with android 2.2 installed, and after downloading the Kies software from Samsung, it self upgraded to android 2.3.5, which is great. No need to root or flash or do any trick on it.So far, my best choice over a couple of cellphone brands I was about to purchase, like LG, HTC or Motorola.

I do, however, spend a couple of months a year in France, and while there have a GSM Simcard from the French cell provider SFR, which I have had for several years and which I got from callineurope.com.  In addition, I have a T-Mobile prepaid SimCard, which I've used in an old candybar style \"stupidphone,\" which costs me around $90 with online discounts to recharge with 1000 prepaid USA minutes, usable within a year.  I have not decided long term what I will do with this T-Mobile service, however inertia is a huge force and for the moment I'm keeping it, and will decide in a few months if I want to \"invest\" another ~$90 to keep the line active for another year.  One plus about the annual $100 ($90 with online coupons available sporadically) T-Mobile prepaid recharge, is that as long as you recharge before the expiration period of the last year, you get to keep your unused minutes/cash balance and roll it into the new year along with the new $100/1000 minutes you just recharged with.  For an occasional cellphone voice user, this does offer a lot of bang for the buck, especially for emergency or other occasional type usage.  You can change your T-Mobile plan over the internet in 1 minute by logging into mytmobile.com which allows you to change from $0.10/minute to a daily rate of $2 (only on days you actually use it) with unlimited talk and unlimited \"2G/2.5G\" Edge level data service.  So, if you were going to use this phone for T-Mobile voice and data on a sporadic basis, say 50 days per year while on the road, leaving it turned off the rest of the time, that would be a hard deal to beat, e.g. yearly unlimited voice and data for <$100/year if you don't need the service all the time.  And you can change back to the $0.10/minute voice and text only plan when you want to on the T-mobile website.Having become somewhat addicted to the functionality of my Verizon Samsung Droid Charge cell, I decided to replace the old GSM stupidphone I've been using with this small inexpensive Samsung GSM S5570 smartphone.  I figured that at the least I could use web browsing and other features that require a network on WiFi networks as I encounter them, which would at least give me an updated Google contact list plus my appointments calendar.  As far as using this phone on data networks, there are a couple of caveats I have discovered and which I detail below.I am not going to comment on the limitations of this phone that have already been discussed ad nauseum in online reviews, such as the small, low-resolution touch screen, battery life, etc.  At $140 unlocked as I type this, you are not going to get the features of a high end cellphone for this price.  For the record, my phone came from the Amazon seller \"Global Mobiles,\" apparently a German company whose orders are fulfilled by Amazon.  It came with all advertised accessories including the charger (European plug but with USA adapter), a fresh and recently manufactured battery, manuals in German, and a near useless 2gb micro SD card.  The phone was set up to function in English when I got it, and showed zero evidence of ever having been opened or touched by human hands after it was manufactured.Limitations on data network usage that I have discovered so far include:(1) Only up to \"3G speeds,\" not \"4G\" -- There is considerable confusion as regards what is 3G, what is 4G, and how they compare.  The executive summary is that although there are going to be differences in speed within an individual carrier's offerings of 3G vs. 4G, you cannot compare among the various carriers because the carriers define \"4G\" and \"3G\" differently and they also use different transmission bands and technologies.  There are going to be carriers who have faster \"4G\" offerings that cannot be effectively utilized with this phone that claims \"3G\" service but not \"4G\" service.  Research your own carrier and what level of service you expect to get from it, before buying this phone.  That could probably be said of most any cellphone out there.(2) US T-Mobile has what they call \"4G\" service and \"3G\" service, which use bands that this phone DOES NOT HAVE.  You will be able to use this phone with T-Mobile \"EDGE\" service, which is variously labeled as \"2G\" by some and elevated to \"2.5G\" by some others, which is to say it has the potential to be faster than your typical, dial-up slow 2G service, however it will still seem very slow compared to a good home broadband connection or to any decent 3G or 4G service.  From some web research that I did after buying this phone, it is obvious that there are only a limited number of GSM cellphones out there that can utilize T-Mobile's fastest data network(s); most of these phones are going to be sold directly by T-Mobile, and few will be available as unlocked phones sold on Amazon or that well known online auction site.  Your best option if you want fast, T-Mobile USA data service would be to get your phone directly from T-Mobile and then perhaps find a way to unlock it if you want to then use it on another network as well.For use in Europe, this phone should provide reasonably fast, \"3G\" level data services, however the cost of such data service is very high if you don't have the sort of year round data plan that most travelers will not have.  As such, if you have a pay as you go or prepaid plan from a European carrier or reseller from a carrier, you will probably elect to use available WiFi networks for most of your data use on this phone, with perhaps email usage through the carrier's data service.  For that purpose, the phone should work well and offer a lot more functionality than an old style \"stupidphone.\"For my own uses, basically as a travel voice cellphone with some smartphone features, most of which I will access through hotel and other free hotspot WiFi networks, with occasional cell carrier data usage for email, this phone is a good choice at an attractive price.  I would not want to use this phone as my everyday smartphone, but for periodic or vacation use outside of my usual carrier's network, it is certainly a more enjoyable phone to use than an old style stupidphone.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice phone", "Author": "amazon fan", "ReviewID": "ROM64O1MUF3G6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the phone because of international travels.

However, Facebook tends to take most of your internal memory, even if you install the application in the external SD card, so you won't have much space left for other applications.The Internal Memory is just too small, you won't have enough memory for more than 5 to 10 Applications installed at once.

Everything came packaged in the original box with usb cable, charger (220V w/ adaptor for US), ear phones, and micro SD card and adaptor, plus the phone itself. Instructions were in Italian I believe, but the first prompt on the phone was to select you preferred language.I was doubtful the setup was going to be as easy as slipping my existing SIM from T-mobile into the new phone, and thankfully it was. Setup up my Wi-Fi, used the Bluetooth feature to transfer all my previous contacts and pics, setup my yahoo email and it was even yahoo.co.jp (Yahoo Japan), plus played with the settings all within an hour or two.The resolution is what you would expect for $140, but I can't complain.
