I had high expectations for it since I've been a Blackberry user for years and the new os7 phones were touted as a major improvement over previous devices.  Not only were our expectations met, they were exceeded.  The phone is very fast, and the touch responsiveness is smooth and precise.  It's a great looking phone and well worth the price.

Once I was out of pocket for 3 of these NEW phones, they refused to accept the faulty ones back saying \"it's impossible that both are faulty.\" Luckily Amazon agreed to accept the faulty phone back and refund my money.

My payment was not going through so it was delayed. Then USPS claimed to have delivered my package but I did not receive it. I called them and complained but the next day the box was in my mail box. So after a long wait I finally got the phone. For starters the phone is amazing. It looks fantastic. The battery pack is small compared to the blackberry bold 9800. So I recommend buying a spare battery. NExt, when you try to set up your email it only allows the enterprise account to be activated no internet mail. Also the phone says AT&T; on it.

When I receveid the package, the box from UPS was sealed, but inside the blackberry box was not sealed 100%. It\u2019s look like the blackberry box already open and somebody tried to re-sealed. And the cell phone is not 100% brand new. Because the front surface (slider) was broken. After I charge the battery for 8 hour (full battery power), standby time is only 24 hour then the cell phone shutdown. At that time I didn\u2019t operate any software or using for phone call event for sms.
