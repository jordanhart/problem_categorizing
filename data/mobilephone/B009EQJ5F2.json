As a phone, this one works also well, but it's only working as a basic phone. When I first received it, there's no data cable in the box that I couldn't connect the phone with my computer to transfer the data. Thanks for Amazon to replace another one but still, no cable inside. I have to buy one to transfer the vedio and pictures I took with this phone. Then I found I can't access internet. Even the Wi-Fi connection showed the phone was connected with my home WI-FI, when I clicked the browser, the web said connection error. The next thing is Bluetooth. I connected this phone to my car and the bluetooth signal showed full. Again, that's not true. I can't make or receive any phone call through my car's bluetooth which works on my Nokia N8 and motorola phone. Recently this phone couldn't display some of the messages and gave me a multimedia error.If you only need a phone to talk with, this one is good. If you want to use other functions, it's useless. It's not worth the money.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlocked GSM bought unlocked", "Author": "Michael B.

RMAed it with  the seller(mobile city online) and they destroyed the phone and send it back to me stating it was physical damaged by my end. My recommendation stay away from this model and seller mobile city online otherwise you will waste the 120$ on a completely useless piece of crap phone.
