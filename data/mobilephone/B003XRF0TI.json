When I go to Contacts to call, I often get the next caller above or below in the list.  Speakerphone is not loud and the touch screen button is unclear if you are turning it on or off.  The teeny browser is unuseable and very slow to load. Way too many steps to change the sound profile.  Lock button is right next to Camera button and the icons on the buttons do not adequatley signify that one is camera and the other is lock. You definitly don't want this phone if you plan to make calls while driving.  So clumsy that it is necessary to pull off road to dial which is always a good idea anyway!I like t-mobile for the anytime, year long, 1000 minutes for $100 which lasts me about 5-6 months.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone sucks!", "Author": "Dee", "ReviewID": "R1A9MPSKOMUQ05", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone only worked properly for 5 months. The \"left side\" of the screen no longer works. If I want to dial the 1 I have to press the 4. If I want to dial the 4 I have to press the 7. If I want to dial the 7 I have to press the * button. I cannot erase any text mess. because the option button is located on the bottom \"left side\" of the phone. So I can no longer send or receive text. I cannot add any contacts to my phone because the save button is located on the bottom \"left side\". The phone is under warranty....T-mobile wants me to pay for the shipping to replace the phone.

Once I got it and started using it, the more and more I hated it over time.This thing was SLOW, even typing slowly it would not handle it, I mean you have to type not much more than 10 wpm for the phone to respond. Another problem is the screen responsiveness was horrible, like it was not calibrated sometimes. I always found myself pressing the wrong thing.Another problem I remember (it has been a while since i owned this) when listening to music with the included earbuds, the music would randomly start playing out of the speaker. Other times they would not be detected at all.I have owned over 12 phones over the years and this is the WORST phone I have ever owned, or used.I would give this zero stars if possible, DO NOT THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS PHONE.

I'm not sure why, but it does. It lags in texting, takes a while to go to the next screen.. etc. The collaboration setting doesn't even work. Even if you used the tiniest point to collaborate  you will still end up getting something else. The picture quality is horrible. Dusts easily goes under the screen.The weird thing was then I tried to charge it one day and it didn't charge correctly... which was a great reason to buy a new phone.

My Daugther loves this phone and lost hers. T-Mobile seems to always discontinue the phones that 'she' loves. So I purchased this T-Mobile Tap in midnight blue for her birthday some months ago! She was ecstatic to receive it; and I was ecstatic to be able to give her the phone that she really wanted! The Seller's price point was phenomenal, especially in view of the fact that the Seller continued to carry this product! The delivery date was equally good.

What a surprise, couldnt tap very well, and had a slow connection to the web.It automatically cut off especially when making a phone call, volume was low and when i brought a 16gig memory card and used it, it didnt read my card right it told me i had a 8gb card!!

It's T-mobile's entry level touch screen phone, so of course it's not going to be the most amazing phone ever...it's greatly priced and it's quite stylish - but don't let its looks fool you! Touching the buttons on the screen can take 5 seconds or more to respond a lot of the times (you'd expect for it to instantly react when you press a button don't you? This is expecially annoying when you're texting) - This phone is not for the texter. Even its T-9 dictionary is horrible. It often doesn't have words in its t-9 dictionary...and when you make up a new word it doesn't save it! Therefore, you have to type it in all over again using ABC! There are more issues...but I'll spare you the details.I've dropped this phone a few times and it still actually works! However...the back cover comes off wayyyy to easily, and it can get annoying if you're storing in your purse or something.I like the big screen...but that's basically it! Overall, it's an okay phone if you just wanna dial in and out...but if you like to text like me - this is def not for you!!", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very hard to use", "Author": "A real reviewer", "ReviewID": "R3Q2Y45Q581354", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I agree that the problems are caused by the poor calibration and poorly designed settings.There are so few settings that you have to figure out and then follow a long series of steps to get to the function you need. And the steps you have to take aren't set up in a natural or intuitive manner.The calibration problem makes it a good bet that you will get the wrong function even if you tap exactly the right spot.For example on the keypad for dialing, the \"call log/options\" button is located directly under the \"star\" symbol on the last row of the keypad. The phone can't distinguish between them very well. So if you try to call someone, you enter a phone number and then must hit \"Options\". And then you have to tap it another time to choose \"Call\". But the phone can mistakenly add a \"star\" symbol to the end of the phone number instead of calling.No one should try to use this phone while driving because it takes so much attention. Plus, it is so frustrating to use, it could cause road rage.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "touchscreen midnight blue T-Mobile phone", "Author": "Panda", "ReviewID": "R3LI1WZH3KJY3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is affordably for every budget and is well worth the money.

Then out of nowhere, the tap function just stopped.  It came back briefly, but only intermittently.  Good thing this phone was still under warranty, so I got a T-mobile Comet as a replacement (still a tap-based phone with more stream-lined features, but I still don't trust it).I refuse to get any touch-tap phones produced by a cellular phone company.  Apple is probably the only company I would buy touchscreen-based products from.  You just can't have a phone that's exclusively touch-based without a physical, numerical keypad built in just in case the touch-tap feature breaks down!!!!  That is an ESSENTIAL point that all cell phone companies must know!
