{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good phone with a few glitchs", "Author": "Brad T. Dobie \"Brad\"", "ReviewID": "RTV2WYICBIEUH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Firstly I would like to address the numerous reviews regarding the phone not switching from 3g to 4g or losing a data connection when it has full service.  I Started out having the very same problems with the phone, but I eventually figured out the 2 sources.  In order to save data Motorola designed this phone to switch automatically to wifi once wifi is available.  The result is that once the phone gets even a sniff of an open wifi hotspot it disconnects from the broadband data.  While this should have been fixed in software patches, you can overcome it by turning off your wifi when your not using it.  Another cause of problems is that this phone doesn't accurately represent the strength of the signal it is receiving causing some people to think the phone is cutting them off when really they are in a dead zone.  I noticed this by comparing my signal to my friends Droid Razar in areas where I frequently lost data.  I do still have occasional issues with connectivity on the order of about once a week.  To get it working again though all I need to do is turn airplane mode on then off by pushing and holding the power button and selecting airplane mode from the pop up menu.  Connectivity issues aside this is a truly great phone.  The battery last me all day as long as I remember to charge it each night and the auto end feature allows you to tell the phone what application precess you want it to stop when not in use to save power.  The side HDMI port is great for streaming movies to  my TV from Netflix in HD since the 4gLTE is faster than my home internet, never pauses to buffer, and never steps down my video quality mid show.  The dual core processor in this phone is very fast.  I can run multiple applications in the back ground while playing games and it won't even break a sweat in fact it has never once locked up on me as other phones have.  Bottom line is if it weren't for the connectivity issues this would probably be the best phone ever made.  I am a big fan of Motorola products and am quite frankly disappointed that they made such a great phone then ruined it by letting such an obvious glitch slip through the cracks. I do not regret my purchase of this phone, but when I have the money I am going for a Razar since they are functionally very similar minus the connectivity issue.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a fantastic phone-ignore the naysayers", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2AKRPHGRSFZAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this phone, I have had mine for over a year now with very, very few issues. Most of what I have seen negative about this phone can be attributed to user error, or being in a fringe 4G area. Certainly there are lemons out there, and people who are upset are most likely to write a review, so I thought I would take a different approach and write a positive review. Now that the ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) update is out for this phone it makes it a no-brainer. The phone runs even better now, even better than my daughter's razor, and I have the option of replacing the battery if I need to without ripping it apart or sending it in. The display is phenomenal outside, as it uses an extra white pixel in its screen, RGBW, whereas the razor series uses just RGB and you can see the difference! The razors have a noticeable green cast to them, whites don't seem as white (since they have to use Red Green Blue to make white) and they are just not as good in bright sunlight. To be fair, my son had some problems dropping data on 4G with his, which I attributed to his driving all over God's creation on his job, but since the ICS update, it's ALL good, no issues at all. If you need a replacement 4G phone to keep unlimited data or replace a lost or broken phone you can't go wrong with the Bionic. Just make sure if you get one and it hasn't been updated to ICS that you make that the first thing to do on your to do list!", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone but overlooked", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R12MMTJMQCTKEE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THis phone came out right before the Razr. I don't know why Motorola did that but this hurt the popularity of the Bionic. The Bionic is a great phone. fast, smooth and does everything I could want it to do. The pone has many nice features like HDMI Mirror mode, which I use a lot. Another great feature it the webtop app which turns your phone into a neat little Netbook or desktop. The battery last about as long as my X did. During heavy daily use I can make it through the work day on a full charge, Charge it up while driving and it's good to go by the time I get home. With average use it last me all day. The screen is nice, It's not AMOLED nice but it does have a great image. 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" Will be added to this phone in the upcoming months and make this phone that much nicer. The only Issue I have is it takes what seams like forever to change from 4G to 3G leaving me network-less. Manualy changing the settings will speed this up but is a annoying none the less, hopefully The upcoming 4.0 update will fix this. After owning this phone and having personal experience with the Razr I can say in my honest opinion - The Bionic is basically the same as the Razr minus the super thin kevlar case. Sure there are better phones out now but if your looking for a decent, fast phone that still has some life in it, the Bionic is a great choice.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surprised by the Negative Reviews", "Author": "Erik H. Reppen", "ReviewID": "R5Z4XIU42WSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On the Popular Themes in other people's Negatives* Perma-Installed Bloatware apps were obnoxious. But I tucked them away into a \"BS Apps\" folder and had completely forgotten about them.* Media issues - I don't watch a ton of videos or listen to mp3s on my smartphones so I can't really comment on that. I'm more of a gamer/reader. That said battery life is just barely adequate by my standards. By which I mean if I forget to charge it one night, odds are good I'll run out of juice the next day (which is why I keep a second charger at the office). Fortunately you can buy an after-market OEM battery that drastically increases life on this phone, which I'm sure would not be adequate if you were spending hours a day watching videos on it and only wanted to plug it in at night.* Connectivity issues - Verizon's 4G network was new when this thing first came out. 4G outages are well-documented by the internet. I frequently see less than 4 bars on this thing but I'm not sure I would expect more of any phone in Chicago and it gets its most frequent use on the El, which is a moving metal box that's probably throwing a lot more EM interference out there than I'd like to think about.* General quirks/bugs - I got this phone a year after it came out. A lot of the stuff that other people are complaining about aren't things that I experienced so either I'm not fussy enough or they were just resolved by the time I got my hands on the phone which I've been using since spring 2012-ish I believe. I think I kind of liked the previous version of android better than ICS but it hasn't impacted the phone's ability in any way and the transition went smoothly for me.My Experience:* 2 Years-ish after its release, it's still a powerful, well-made phone compared to low to mid-tier stuff you'll pay as much for at the subsidized contract-binding prices.* It's not designed with a disposable mentality - It has a removable battery, mini-SD and SIM cards. All 3 fit very snugly in the phone and are easily accessible. Don't pay extra for the larger capacity if it's cheaper to just buy a larger mini-sd card.* It's known for being highly hackable. I'm a programmer but definitely not a mobile hardware/OS guru and it only took me a few minutes to unlock following instructions (and no, it doesn't require writing any code and sadly no whooshing screens of green ones and zeroes). I'm also expecting (with a bit more trial/error effort) to be able to move it to t-mobile's 4G LTE service once they've done their upgrade here in Chicago.* It appears to have been designed to be considerably more global than Verizon would probably like. It has a SIM card. It's quad band so you can move it to a lot of other services if you're not afraid of doing some very simple hacks (but do your research - 4G requires LTE at 1900Mhz)* The hotspot broadcast seems very powerful compared to my old Droid 2 and it beats the pants off of my wife's Samsung Stratosphere (which to be fair, is bordering on useless).* Build quality has been strong for me. I carry it loose, without a protective cover in a pocket that is often full of change/sometimes keys when I forget to put them in the other pocket. No scratches on the screen. The rubberized backing is still firm. Just nicks and chips on the front frame. I've dropped it occasionally. It is lightyears ahead of the old Droid 2 in terms of durability/reliability. I have no idea how you could see this thing as \"bulky\" but I grew up on an Atari 800 so maybe my perspective on the current state of portable electronics is a bit skewed.* I really just like the overall design of this thing. It feels simple and light like an NES controller but the screen doesn't disappoint and I've actually enjoyed the experience of a flawless video skype conversation in a moving car near Seattle where the latency is no doubt, much, much better than it is in Chicago. The hardware has also powered through the one 3D game I've played (Great Little Wargame - which to be fair is hardly Crysis on a cell phone but it is technically 3D) without a hitch. Tethering and hotspot have been very useful.Negatives From My Experience:* You'll probably want to upgrade the battery. Considering the number of times I've let it go completely dry, the battery has held up well but it didn't hold a super-long charge in the first place. As I said, it's just barely good enough for me but I'm not hugely demanding. I just like the power there when I need it.* Verizon. Generally good reception/service but what you pay for is hugely inflated and their profit model seems to depend on overages or they would just offer unlimited with a soft-cap. They claim they had to ditch unlimited because it would be too taxing on their network but that's complete BS or they're exaggerating the state of emergency since the lowest tier of their new data plan wouldn't have cost more than the previous unlimited one, offering no incentive to customers to ditch it. Fortunately this phone wasn't meant to be as caged in as they tried to make it (sadly you'll never be able to ditch the bloatware due the bootloaders being unhackable to date and ICS might be the last OS you'll see on this thing as you'll depend on Motorola for updates). I also deeply resent them for charging me extra to not turn off the hotspot functionality, which is a feature built into the phone, not something they have to have gerbils turning a wheel somewhere to make it happen. Not that that's not easily reversed by rooting the phone so you can at least control basic hardware features (they're also no longer allowed to do this because yes, it's shady but they still do it if you're holding on to the older plan). So I'm at 250/month so I can maintain my grandfathered unlimited plan (but can't change my wife's old plan to the newer more affordable one or I'd lose mine). As far as I'm concerned they are hostile to the consumer and am looking forward to giving somebody else half as much money and also being able to give AT&T; the boot since I won't have to sweat overages. That will save me a couple grand a year so yes, I'll pay the 4-500ish in penalties the second t-mobile gets LTE up in Chicago.Note to Verizon: When you rip off your customer and constantly push them into a corner with overly complicated/convoluted plans designed to hide the details of how you are screwing them, we don't forget that. Every overage, the  nickling and diming for every little feature, many of which were simply switches in the hardware rather than things your company actually expended effort providing, and the generally hostile stance you've taken towards your consumer leave burn marks. !@#$ the coverage. I'll get a temporary phone when travelling if I have to. I don't care if you turn around and offer unlocked phones with zero-contract unlimited-everything at 75% of what t-mobile is asking tomorrow. I'm not coming back until I know there's been a massive change in management because the folks who made these decision are shady SOBs.Who Might Want to Get This Phone:If you're not pissed off enough at Verizon's latest plans such that it doesn't seem worth paying the contract penalty fees and want to upgrade your low to mid-tier phone without extending the contract, I seriously doubt you could do better than what I'm seeing this phone offered for unsubsidized. The prices on these phones are severely inflated and mobile technology advancement has slowed enough that a powerful phone two years ago is still pretty damn good today. Also, the phone provides a decent exit strategy by being other-service friendly if you can  hack it, but if you're going that route you might want to consider a Nexus 4 which is completely and truly unlocked with zero bloatware. Sadly you have to hack Nexus 4 to get the fully armed and operational LTE on the phone (why is the entire mobile-industry so full of BS?).", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great phone however some sellers are sending refurbished as \"new\"", "Author": "D.

Amazon has a category for Refurbished however many are not using it and if your read enough reviews here you'll see many buyers are having this same problem. The Motorola Bionic is a great phone and I have had two of them over more than three years. I love 'em enough that I wanted another one after a dip in the lake messed up the last one. I highly recommend them over any Iphone. I decided to try the refurbished phone anyway and it had issues from the start. Callers or recipients couldn't hear me yet I could hear them. The second day it became a text only device but the internet worked great! The seller I bought from was Barnyard Wireless and FYI they offered $10 additional refund if I would remove their negative feedback. It's your call if you can trust this seller. I also contacted Applewireless by amazon message system and after four messages back and forth, they would not answer if their phone was actually new or refurbished. It was almost as if they where not understanding the language, Go figure. This phone came in a \"sealed box\", listed as \"New\"  however it was a blue box, not the standard Black box shown in the listing picture. New Droid Bionic phones I have bought in the past always came in a black box like shown. Please rate my review so other can read this and proceed  with caution.

I have replaced the screen 3 times because of my carelessness. They are pretty cheap to replace if you are handy with the Youtube tutorial. Shortcoming number one- Battery life. Over the last two years I learned to have chargers everywhere I need to be. The good news here is all the different docks and chargers are high quality and dirt cheap. The real lifesaver is the Lapdock. The battery in that can save your butt when you are away from other power. A full charge when new lasted for about 10 hours without significant use but only half that if you use wifi or background intensive apps. I had to replace the factory battery last year but it was so cheap I didn't even mind.Shortcoming two- The Motorola version of android is kinda limited and there are frequent compatibility issues with apps. It was better with Jellybean because Motorola and Verizon really bloated it on the updates. So much of the bloat is rooted in and you can't uninstall it. Root is your friend. The risk isn't so high because the phone has been around awhile now.  I rooted the phone and rolled it back to the more enjoyable jellybean.Conclusion.

I bought it knowing that the battery was bad and though the phone didn't disappoint on that front it wasn't as bad as it could have been (I charge at least once a day - twice a day if I'm using apps a lot).  My biggest problem with the phone, though, is its speed.  I've spoken with other android owners and they don't have the same kinds of problems that I do, but the phone will often slow down to a crawl - especially when browsing the web.  If you have/use this phone I'd HIGHLY recommend using the Opera Mini browser app as it's a smaller, lightweight web browser.  I prefer Firefox, but Firefox, Chrome (which is now bulkware on the phone, btw), and the default browser (which is not chrome, interestingly) ALL take forever to load pages that my wife on her iPhone (with 3g service - yet with consistently higher reception and faster phone speeds) can do in a fraction of the time.  It shouldn't take a solid 2-3 minutes for an app to load or a webpage to finish loading, yet it does this consistently with this phone.  The only remedy I've found to combat the problem (I already mentioned Opera Mini for web browsing) is to get a reboot program and a cache cleaner (I use FastReboot and both 1touch cache cleaner and AVG cache cleaner).  Running these 2-3 times a day (even without much cache buildup) can really make the difference.  Oh, and also make sure you close apps as soon as you're done using them (press and hold the home button to open up the task manager).  The phone has slowed down enough, at times, that I've missed phone calls.  A phone should be, first and foremost, a PHONE.  At the same time, I do like the large screen size and the android OS is still my preferred phone OS.

EVT sent me a return label to use to return the defective phone. I took this package to the post office and using the EVT return label I mailed the phone. I was told EVT would ship me another phone as soon as they see the return in the system.  Two days later on Friday I checked the USPS tracking and could not find the package.  Then on Saturday the package gets returned to my home because the label I was sent did not have enough postage.On Monday it will be 10 days since I received my defective phone from EVT.  I am not waiting for another return label from EVT.  I am paying to return the defective phone via UPS at my business.  I emailed EVT a copy of the UPS tracking label so they can see the package is shipping on Monday. I Finally reached Mr. Dan Cole on the phone 9 days after my initial filing for a defective exchange or refund. He assured me that tomorrow, Monday he would personally test a Bionic phone and then get it in the mail back to me.  I should receive a replacement phone by Thursday of this coming week.  So it will be about 13 days, just shy of two weeks for me to receive an exchange for my defective phone. Even though Dan Cole is a very nice person this really is an unacceptable time to get a replacment for a defective cellphone.  I sent many emails and even called the phone number I was given for EVT but I could never reach a real live person to talk to until today Sunday, 8 days after I received my defective Droid Bionic phone.  If someone from EVT had called me one or two days after I received the defect I would have happily paid to promptly return the defective phone as long as I got another phone shipped immediately.  As a businessman, I cannot do without my phone but EVT just did not seem to understand this.  It is not the money, it is the lack of real concern and communications that disturbed me about Dan Cole and EVT Company.  Dan is very polite and apologizes all the time but actions speak louder than words.  And right now EVT, as Donald Trump would say, he flunked the customer service test.

It plays all the popular games like Angry Birds, Candy Crush, Farmville, etc. I can't count how many times I've dropped this phone and the back came off/battery popped out but I put it back together and it worked just fine. It even fell out of a moving car and still worked. I've gotten it wet a few times (rain, spilled coffee, etc.) and it pulled through. Very dependable phone with a horrible camera. (Since I mainly got a smartphone so I could use Instagram and Twitter, that killed it for me.)I've perused some other reviews on here and it sounds like people are reviewing an entirely different phone. The battery life is fine for a Smartphone though I usually charge my phone at night (like a sane person.) You get MUCH longer battery life if you lower the screen brightness. I'd say my battery usually lasts about 36 hours, longer if the screen is on low brightness.Volume for earphones is more than acceptable and depending on the earphones/quality of .mp3 it can get very loud.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wrong phone....", "Author": "Perry S.", "ReviewID": "RDQ67UVTVZKFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This advertised phone is actually a Droid Razr. I have had a Bionic and so I ordered this for my teenage daughter. It is a larger phone, fast processor, and looks good.

It takes AMAZING photos, has front and back cameras, great for teenagers or a kid that wants a phone to play games on. It is slightly rugged, but I wouldn't treat it as such. My daughter dropped it a bunch of times (it didn't break) so I got her a case for it. We have upgraded to Samsung Galaxy Notes and my 11 year old now owns this phone. It takes the mini SIM card as well and is STRICTLY a Verizon phone. It can be changed over to a prepaid as well, which is something I highly suggest that you do if you have younger kids that want a cool phone.

The screen is sufficiently large. I love the Android OS and the 4G is fantastic. I did notice a fast battery drain, but I was using it heavily on the 4G Network in the 4 days I used the phone. I think with wifi usage the battery life would be extended. Unfortunately, I had to return the phone, but I'll update when I receive the next (hopefully functioning) and give it a full test drive. Currently, battery life is the only complaint I have about the phone itself.This phone requires a SIM card. If you're upgrading this phone from 3G to 4G, you'll likely need a new SIM card. Additionally, if you have a global SIM card, you'll also need a new SIM as this phone doesn't support it (which kind of defeats the meaning of the word \"global\"). We simply took the phone into Verizon, and they gave us a new one no problem and free of charge.However, be warned. What Amazon is labeling as \"new\" here is actually \"refurbished\" even though they're two separate categories and price ranges at the top of the page. There is NO way that the \"new\" phone I received wasn't a refurb. The box was marked up and it didn't look like the boxes I've received when I purchased directly from Verizon in the past. On top of that, the phone wasn't fully functional. Everything about the phone worked great- except that it couldn't make calls, something that I personally believe to be very important in a phone. I could send texts, use data, respond to email, and do literally everything else, but when placing a call I couldn't get past \"dialing\" and never received a dial tone. Any incoming calls went straight to my voicemail, which I couldn't check since I couldn't make calls. I tried everything to make sure it wasn't a problem on Verizon's end, including taking it to two separate Verizon stores and calling their tech support. In the end it turned out to be a hardware issue. I returned the defunct phone to Amazon and ordered another.

Sure it is a hit and miss just like ANY phone or electronic device you get. Sometimes some have issues.Ive had this phone since release, so about 1 year 5+ months. I have yet to have a single issue with it. Sure battery life isnt the greatest but I still get a good 8-12 hours even when using my phone constantly (Reddit, FB, High graphic Games). I dont care what phone youre using, but the battery life isnt going to be any better unless you purchase some sort of battery extender.About 3 months ago my phone did start getting sluggish but it was because I had OVER 250 apps on my phone. So I did a format and started over, and everything is running great again. Im somewhere around 100-150 apps and it works great.The phone was pulled from the line not because of it not being any good but because they had some setbacks with update issues. They couldnt get the update out in time and everyone(even myself) was complaining about it. They pulled it off the shelf then as they were probably trying to avoid more angry customers. However, now it has gotten updates and continues to do so, so that isnt an issue.I still consider this phone a top of the line Android phone and its definitely better than any iPhone ive played with (except maybe the 5 as that was released a year alter and high much higher processing power).The phone also seems to be pretty sturdy, but like most phones, it all depends on how its treated. Ive dropped it form a good 3-4ft off the ground straight onto concrete. I guess ive got lucky where its landed so far beause no cracked screen yet. Also the glass itself works great as I dont have a screen protector and only have a couple MINOR(cant see unless tilting it in light)scratches on it.Yes this phone is behind newer phones, but that should be expect for a phone that is 1.5yrs old.

Now I learned that was a terrible decision.  I bought a 32 GB SD card (the max this phone allows) and copied music over to it from my Mac computer.  It took awhile but eventually everything copied.  It took a couple hours for the phone's music player to find all the songs but I was fine with that.  Quite a bit of time passed and I wanted to change the songs on the phone.  I downloaded doubleTwist (the Mac version at least is poorly designed and barely functional) in order to sync my iTunes playlist with my phone instead of manually adding songs (since I have more than 32 GB of music).  The songs copied over and I could play the music in the doubleTwist app on the phone, but none of the other music players could see the new songs.  For the next two days, my battery (which normally lasts 3-5 days when I use the phone as a media player only) lasted an average of 4 hours while it did nothing but serve as my clock.  I looked under battery usage and found out that it was trying to sync the media with the other programs and therefore was consuming most the battery.  I searched online for a solution and discovered this is a very common problem.  10 hours ago, I initiated an Android update to see if that would fix it (since time has not).  I've been waiting 10 hours so far with a screen that says \"Upgrading Media database).  Online I read this is also a very common problem and if I were to pull out my SD card or battery, I could cause my phone to be unusable without a complete factory reset.  I'm going to wait it out because fortunately all I am losing is my media player right now.  Maybe it will take a day, maybe two, maybe three, I don't know.  All I have to say is, though, that I wish I would have just got an iPhone because if nothing else, Apple has got media playing and music syncing down to a science.  Android still has a long ways to go.UPDATE:  Finally found a way to make the phone discover the music again (got the solution on Motorola's forum).  I am still pretty wary of ever trying to update the music or videos on my phone and would be worried about swapping SD cards to view different content, but at least the phone is functional again.  Bumped to 2 stars since Motorola provided a fix.  Still missing 3 stars because the music sync is a MAJOR problem with this device.

Personal preference, I don't like iPhones and I'm much more comfortable with Android (I could give the thousands of reasons why, but I won't). I'd been using the HTC Incredible 2 with extended battery since then. I loved the phone but it didn't have 4g (moved to the middle of the city where it's almost necessary b/c 3g is so slow), and it lagged some on things like sending text messages, etc.My first move was to the HTC Thunderbolt with extended battery (with 4g, I was set on getting an extended battery). I liked the phone, but I had the issue others had where it messed with the wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, and occasionally the 4g signal. I returned it and tried the Bionic. It cost more than the Thunderbolt, but I needed something that worked.The bionic is a great phone. The phone works well and lasts a long time with the extended battery. Not really any issues at all, it's fast, it's great. I will say the Motorola interface is pure utility. It doesn't seem to have changed much since the original Droid. It doesn't bother me, but I do miss my HTC interface, which very visually friendly (I would compare HTC Interface to iOS...which has an amazing interface, I just didn't like other things about it).Anywho, overall, great phone, utilitarian Motorola interface, but it works great.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "deceptive advertisement false advertisement this is not a new phone this is a refurbished phone", "Author": "general f. franco", "ReviewID": "R196FEUKYVG0HQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon should shut down this seller for false advertising, it does not say it is used, it gives you a choice of new or used and when you selected new they send you a refurbished phone.The price of one hundred and thirteen dollars is nearly twice that every other refurbished phone.don't waste your time gambling with this company's product.I purchased one of the higher priced models because it said new in the listing and trusted Amazon would protect me.I made a mistake,  my old phone works fine, the battery life was cut in half after the last \"update\".Personal opinion is carrier \"updates\"  the phone they want to faze out so you have to buy a new one.either that or Motorola is a POS and shouldn't be sold in the first place but that's only my opinion.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "hate this phone", "Author": "Niykeal", "ReviewID": "R1B61SV0CIBLMV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "dont like this phone at all phone dies to quick and it freezes it cuts off i will not purchase again", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buying NEW and receiving USED", "Author": "Ming Bob Tan", "ReviewID": "R2G7YHUK2B7O9L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the droid bionic as \"NEW\" not used.

What was disappointing was Android 4.0 (aka Ice Cream Sandwich aka ICS) came out a few months later, so much of my time with the phone was waiting for the update which finally came out in October. The Bionic was pretty good with Gingerbread but just felt more clunky to use over time. However, that has changed with the ICS update. With it, I'm no longer desperately waiting for my upgrade. One thing I really like about it is the size. It's a little thicker compared to most phones but it's narrow and wide enough to hold and use comfortable in one hand.Here are some new features you'll enjoy:Disable some stock software (ie bloatware) which improves battery consumptionTake screenshots (press and hold Power and Volume Down at the same time)Use a custom launcher (I recommend Nova Launcher)New lock screen that allows you to immediately unlock to the home screen, Text messaging app, dialer, or cameraImproved camera (?, I'm not an expert but I think the quality is better now)Able to use Google Chrome browser (not possible on Gingerbread but I prefer Dolphin)Better text editing (bar appears at top to select all, cut, copy, and paste. No more having to long-press multiple times)Improved look/functionality of some apps such as GMail (with Gingerbread, I never received instant notifications with new email but now I do)Before, most of these features required apps and/or rooting. But if you're someone who was intimidated by that, it's not an issue. If you are interested in rooting, it is a simple process.Overall, I think it's a good phone. While every phone becomes more obsolete over time, I think the Bionic has really improved with the ICS update and is up to par with most newer phones today. It is supposedly getting the next Android update (Jelly Bean) in the future. While it may be another long wait, I can see myself using this for another year or so thanks to ICS.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "love this phone have had 2, and never had any problems", "Author": "snutter", "ReviewID": "R1NARKA2DWTLHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone its very fast, easy to use.

I had the gen 1 droid at release and upgraded it to bionic when it came out. The droid 1 outperforms bionic as far as connectivity goes. Yes it may have been much slower than the bionic, but if I wanted a fast device that is only useful on wifi connections, I would have purchased something like a galaxy tab. While this phone is VERY powerful, it became completely useless after a few days. I agree with the other 1-star reviewers, so there is no point in reiterating all of the example shortcomings. Do NOT purchase this phone. Get something else until they decide to fix it. Follow the online discussions about ice cream sandwich and the data connectivity issue.As a side note, there are no extended battery friendly cases with rubber corners and this phone absolutely requires an extended battery if you are always out and about. In fact, there is only one case that you can get from the cellular stores that carry this phone. It is a hard case, which is better than nothing. Without a good case, you will drop the phone and destroy the screen if it lands on the corner, which they always do.I am a very patient consumer and I've waited a long time for moto to fix this phone, but I am in a pager rotation now and this phone will get me in trouble.

The phone takes FOREVER to transfer from 3G to 4G and sometimes I have to take the battery out and reset it just so it will get a data signal. My home area upgraded the signal to 4G recently and the phone rarely keeps the data signal. As soon as I select the browser or Facebook the phone IMMEDIATELY loses its data signal. It constantly freezes when running applications even though it is supposed to have a high power processor.

Good luck with that sometimes there is no volume and you have to restart your phone for that.7) O and did I mention the 100 more apps that came with the ICS update? well it did you have an app called google play (fancy word for app store) well verizon felt left out and gave you their own app store o and by the way you cant uninstall any of em.8) O yea almost forgot when you switch screens around, (now this is happening a lot to me) your screen would freeze in the function as if you are switching it back and forth and it will go automatically back and forth but not all the way (idk how else to explain this) so if you hit the power button to close the screen out you have a 40-60% chance of fixing it.9) O yes almost forgot it is a Motorola so your updates will be delayed like 3 to 4 extra months just because you went with a Motorola.BOTTOM LINE......THIS PHONE IS A MAJOR PIECE OF S*** not gonna sugar coat it I paid 300 solid dollars of my own hard earned cash on this trash and frankly I am very very very DISAPPOINTED!!!! if you are going to buy a smart phone go with something else other than a Motorola s***.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Random question", "Author": "DarianYelton", "ReviewID": "R1BJ2UOCQAMXGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey guys, im planning to buy this phone and have it flashed to cricket does anyone know if that is possible?", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "It works", "Author": "ks12345", "ReviewID": "R759DXNOG55BL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the first time I decided to switch a plan to a new smart phone.

I have had this phone on Verizon for about 4 months and I have nothing positive to say about it.  It's worse than any phone I've ever had, including the old razr phones if you can believe it!For starters, battery life...  The battery lasts about 24 hours if I don't use it AT ALL.  I really don't use this phone much anyway (because the touch-screen is unresponsive half the time and the phone crashes every day), but when I do use it (very) lightly, the battery lasts about 10 hours.Second, applications - phone calls - alarms -calendars -gps: NONE work.  I have had applications crash at least twice a day (when I use the phone).  I learned quickly to not rely on the Bionic as a wake-up call because the alarm doesn't usually work and to use an external gps for navigation since the maps take about 20 minutes to even load onto the phone.  Also, as far as I have been able to tell, there is no way to turn off other noises on the phone when you need an alarm.  There may be a way to do this, but there are SO MANY settings that I can't tell what in the heck is going on.

This phone has the most random notification sounds.  I will hear four loud unique noises and look at my phone and nothing is showing on the screen that needs my attention.  Then I'll get a text message and not know about it until I happen to be looking at my messages.  It's the most annoying aspect of the phone in my opinion.  If I get an email it will blippity blee blop for an hour until I check it.  Then I'll get a call and will just decide not to make a peep.  What in the world?!  \"Put it on vibrate then!\" I can hear you thinking now... no.  DO NOT put this phone on vibrate.  The vibrating is one of the worst noises I've ever heard in my life.  It's louder than the highest volume you can put the phone sounds on.  BUUUUUUUZZZZZZ BUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ over and over and over...  most of the time for no apparent reason.  I have resorted to keeping the Bionic on silent.Number 4: Touch-screen.  Not much to say about it.  It just doesn't work most of the time.  I'll have to slide and slide and slide the lock icon to get into my phone for about 5 minutes.  I can't play any games on it obviously, so thanks Bionic for keeping me from getting hooked too badly on my handheld device I guess.And that's about all I can say about the Bionic for now.  It's just a bad phone!  Best phones I've had have been the Palm Pre, Palm Centro, and iPhone 4.  I will not be buying any other Android phones personally.I hate the Bionic!  1 star is way too high of a rating for me.  I don't see how people could rate this phone highly, unless maybe I just got a fudged one.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "it's ok.

I was in love with my photon. My contact expired, now I'm with Verizon and having Droid bionic I'm not impressed. I do like certain features, keeping up with my bill, mins I've used.But that is the cell phone provider part. I do miss my photon allot, but I don't miss Sprint. Bionic doesn't have the camera click on the side either. Picture taking sucks. I hope to up grade asap.
