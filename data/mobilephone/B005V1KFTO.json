It does everything and more that my 4th gen Ipod does (except has Android).  Its super fast on the web and switching between applications. The camera seems good.  The flash is blinding at night! Haven't played with the video yet.  I love how you can speak almost every command instead of typing.  You can write a whole text message with your voice! The GPS is great too.  And with Boost, everything is included in your plan so you don't have to worry about data charges.  The best thing for me though is being able to stream Pandor in my car! It's a great phone! Buy it :)", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android I've EVER Owned! (And LOVE the 'Shrinkage'!)", "Author": "justinglen", "ReviewID": "RIAJDTPFDYO9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm new to the prepaid world, but not new to smartphones. For years now I've been buying & selling Android & Apple phones on eBay to avoid renewing my contract with other carriers, all so I could have the latest and greatest gadget in my pocket. Preparing to pull that stunt once more, I decided instead this time to give Boost Mobile a try, and chose the new Samsung Transform Ultra. My expectations for a cheap phone on a prepaid carrier were low.To my absolute surprise, the Transform Ultra has so far proven to be the BEST Android handset I've ever owned (and just to be clear, in my case that means it beats out the MyTouch 4G Slide, G2, Droid 2, Droid 2 Global and LG Revolution).I think the biggest difference must be the Gingerbread operating system, as the one thing this phone does not do (and ALL of the others did) is crash constantly. But aside from that, the Transform Ultra is also surprisingly smooth & snappy, not laggy and frustrating like all the other Android's I've owned. I was expecting less for such a cheap little phone. The keyboard is also awesome, especially for those (like me) that really, really prefer buttons: good layout and nice button feel (though I must say the space bar button is a little weird as you have to press down either side of it, not the center of it).There are some less than awesome aspects: Battery life, for instance, isn't great, but I've yet to own a smartphone that didn't require me to tote an extra battery around. The phone also feels just a little cheap overall, but then again: it was cheap. Finally, tapping and dragging (to rearrange icons on the home screen, for instance) doesn't work well on mine. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that Sprint's 3G service isn't exactly blazing fast.So there's that. For me, an Android phone that doesn't crash & force close, has a great keyboard and comes on a carrier that will drop my monthly bill by $5 every 6-months is a no brainer. I feel like such a sucker for having paid almost $100/month to those other carriers for much worse hardware.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "best phone i've ever had", "Author": "killercurls \"woo\"", "ReviewID": "R3GOZLYO3WMEQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "user friendly. fast. great camera. all the features work great. i only had a slight problem with the touch screen while the phone was plugged in and charging.i am in love with this phone! have not put it down since i bought it.my only complaint is the ring tones and alerts are not loud enough. and the vibration is not strong enough. if the phone's in my pocket I don't feel it or hear it.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes, it has touchscreen issues...", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "RORLB5VWHXJ0X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As others have stated, the Transform Ultra does indeed have touchscreen issues. It may be luck of the draw, but I had the Prevail prior and there were no issues like this. I have tried sensitivity apps to try and correct the issue, but it did not help. As IMFM stated in another forum, he thinks it is a capacitive issue regarding the ability of the device to recognize when the finger is lifted, or more aptly, the device thinks you lifted your finger. I think this is correct.Also, my phone's screen is lifted a bit on the left side of the device near the bottom and running up to the top. The screen is flush with the edging here, whereas on the right side of the device the screen is just below the edging equally the whole way. Tapping the left bottom of the device produced a sound other than the finger hitting the screen. Doing this on the right side does not produce this sound at all. This might be a reason for the touchscreen issues and makes me think a software fix may not be possible.If you are dying to have a new Android phone on Boost you can use this phone, BUT it will cause you headaches. I am going to wait a week or so before I decide if I am going to return it as it is clearly a defective device at this point. Samsung needs to address this issue immediately and quit playing dumb. Keep the customers informed of what is going on as to a potential fix. I loved my Prevail and was really impressed with Samsung, it just lacked adequate system resources to run the amount of apps I wanted on my phone.The sad part about the Transform Ultra is this is a really nice phone aside from the glaring issue. It is speedy and has the 1GB of internal memory so you will be able to load a lot more apps than the Prevail.Cons:- Major touchscreen sensitivity issue- Case is very slippery in hands, needs a skin or some form of grip added for as a preventative measureSub-Par:- Physical keyboard is par, maybe slightly sub par. It's awkward to type on it with the keys really needing pressed, plus space bar pressing is horriblePros:- Large memory, 1GB internal- Speed, 1GHz processor- Responsiveness", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Transform Ultra", "Author": "ELea", "ReviewID": "R2RN2MN34G4NYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Phone is awesome! I love it.It is my first smart phone, So I am not experienced with them, so from a beginners point of view. It takes no time to get used to at all....The problems with the screen being fidgety that I read about before purchasing, I do not really have.This is the first time I have actually used a touch screen keypad that is effortless. I do not have problems with it (I have used other friends phones and messed up EVERYWHERE) I like it.It has a slide out qwerty keyboard... for the night when you are too drunk to use the touch screen one, or if you just prefer to use it. Internet is quick, Many apps to choose from from the market, Free games... Free battery saver app (I am not sure that it works though... my battery seems to die QUICKLY) I still suggest you buy a back up battery or... I dunno, maybe two or 3... I will be buying a bigger memory chip, it is great to start off with.RINGTONES.... lets talk about that. You have to download a ringtone app (I got myxer.com for android being as I have been using Myxer for yrs for my ringtones) Then you manage your ringtones from there to give your contacts a unique ringtone. Have not figured out how to give my notification notices ringtones from the app... factory ones super cheesy. Ok whatelse... Oh you can send someone straight to voicemail... (Through the contact info... when ever someone calls that person will go straight to voicemail.)Great Camera on the backside, not so wonderful from the front. Flash on the back is BLINDING!I suggest you take this phone to a kiosk to get connected, that way you keep your milestones.GREAT PHONE With exception of the battery issue I recommend it!", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Kristen Smith", "ReviewID": "R2QOWTHQTVFBKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone as an upgrade from my Boost Mobile Sanyo Incognito.  I'm not a technical person, but from a user perspective, this is a great phone.  My husband has another Android phone through Sprint and the Transform Ultra does everything that his does (plus the Boost Mobile phone has better pricing plan for unlimited service).The call quality is clear and I love how it interfaces with Google products.  I use gmail, so it's convenient to have that as the main email program on the phone.  It also pulls my Google contacts, so I don't have to worry about losing my contacts if something happens to my phone.  I have downloaded numerous applications and the Transform Ultra has been able to handle everything without slowing down.The messenging interface is easy to use.  The QWERTY keyboard is also great.  It is a little flatter than what I was used to, but I adjusted to it within a few days.The quality of the camera is satisfactory.  It's not the greatest, but is sufficient if I forget to bring my camera somewhere.  It does have a flash which is a plus compared to my old Sanyo Incognito.  The forward facing camera is a great feature as we can easily Skype with family and friends around the country.As far as the battery life goes, it seems to last about a day depending on what I've been doing on the phone.  I'm not really impressed by that, but it seems consistent with my husband's Android battery, so it is what it is.Overall, I absolutely love the phone.  So much more customizable than the Sanyo Incognito and so many useful functions and applications.

Shrinkage will eventually bring it down to $40 per month.Boost / Sprint service is good.  Web access is fast and easy.  Call quality is good.  Touch screen works really slick.  There are better cameras on the market, but this one is certainly adequate for my needs.  This is my first experience with a \"smart phone\", so I'm probably easily impressed, but it's just amazing what this phone can do and how easy it is to use it.There have been some complaints that the battery runs down quickly.  The battery does go down more quickly than I would like, but if you want to conserve battery charge, just turn off the 3G when you're not using it.  You can also leave 3G on and turn off Background Data to conserve battery charge.Totally worthwhile purchase.

I ordered it through the Boost Mobile website because it was 30% off. It has and does just about everything my boyfriend's expensive at&t; android does and fairly quickly. I like the size, not too big and not too small. I've had no issues with glitches so far and I really love having a physical keyboard again. I'm also impressed with Boost Mobile's service and the ease of setting up my account and activating my phone. The phone and service are pretty good quality for the price.

fixed.For some reason, probably due to poorly coded software, the screen doesn't properly detect when you've taken your finger off the phone. This means that any application which requires dragging, such as browsers, will not work correctly. It makes playing games with touchscreen controls effectively impossible.I've also had a lot of problems with Bluetooth syncing that I did not have on the prevail.I'm also not too impressed with the slide out keyboard. If you have larger fingers, you are better off using the touch keyboard.If you are on Boost and desperate for a mid-range smart phone, you can get the ZTE warp.

Ive spent countless hours on it surfing the web, playing angry birds, texting, taking pictures and videos, so on and so forth... never had a single issue.The only limiting factor with the phone and boost mobile is the battery life of the phone, which you can drain with a few hours of heavy gaming or video playing... but thats the reality of most smart phones and heavy use, it is not a flaw of this phone per say.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking to go with boost mobile, and the monthly payment makes the cost of the phone well worth it.

Since I was sticking with Boost, that meant I had only a few options and picked the Samsung Transform Ultra, the fanciest model available.PROSI don't like touch screen typing and had to have a full size slide-out QWERTY keyboard. The Ultra has a fantastic one, sturdy and responsive. In fact, it's the primary reason I picked it. No regrets there. Texting is fast, easy and fun.The phone has a great built-in camera (with flash) that takes excellent quality pictures.Battery life seems good. On a full or near-full charge, I can talk for around two and a half, maybe three hours straight and still not use it all up. It recharges completely in about an hour.It has great audio quality, including the speakerphone.Video playback from YouTube and other sites have good image and audio quality, though of course that depends on the quality of the source material. But I compared video playback between this phone and my friend's stupid Blackberry, and YouTube videos I knew were perfectly good quality on my phone were pretty much unwatchable on his.CONSI haven't bought any apps or played any games on the phone yet, so I can't speak to the touch screen issue some other reviewers are complaining about.Maybe this is a coverage issue with Boost more than the phone, but internet performance is often frustratingly slow except at home which is when I don't really need it because then I use my iMac. At home I can get 3-5 bars usually, but I have a hard time getting more than 1-3 bars when I'm out and about (often more like a single bar to none). And all these locations are in a major city/coverage area within my state! Apparently, every store I go into is magically in a bad coverage area. This sucks, because I mainly use my phone's internet for comparison price shopping and looking up reviews of stuff I'm considering buying in retail stores. Or when I'm totally bored waiting for someone. Still, it's better than not having internet on the go.Now for a major pain in the butt problem: I've had the phone since November 2011, and six months later, the power button has stopped working properly! Now, I have to press it repeatedly (but not too fast) and it eventually powers on. Sometimes a dozen times, sometimes half a dozen, sometimes it works on the first or second try. The button isn't noticeably sticking or anything weird like that--it's like it's randomly deciding when to work. However, It never has a problem going to standby mode with just one press, so go figure!And sometimes, even though I'll hear the phone ringing or giving me other alerts, the screen remains black so I have no idea who is calling or texting until I press the power button. In this case, the power button always works with a single press. If only it would turn on so easily!One last annoyance is that in order to access a lot of the phone's built-in apps, you need a Google account. If you don't want one of those, you can't use them.I give the phone 3.5 stars. I like it but it has some problems that drag my rating down from a 4.UPDATE (December 7, 2012): After one year (and six months of problems with the power button), now the touch screen is not responding every so often (as in it freezes up) and I have to turn the phone off and back on to make it work again. It's not doing it every day (at least, not yet), but don't know what the deal is. It's not like I've ever dropped it or anything. Not cool for a gadget I spent a lot of money on. It no longer recognizes the SD card is installed and all my gallery photos are inaccessible. Am downgrading my rating to 2.5 stars as a result.IMPORTANT UPDATE (February 9, 2013): My touchscreen froze up completely today and no amount of turning it off or on again solved it. After researching the issue online, I removed the battery, waited 15 minutes, then put it back in. All the problems my phone was having appear to be solved now. It powers up correctly with a single touch, doesn't freeze anymore (at least not yet), my SD card is being recognized, my missing photos are back in the gallery, and everything seems to be functioning as good as it was when I first bought it.Will update my review if any more problems crop up, but will try removing and reinstalling the battery before posting more complaints. I've gone ahead and restored my original 3.5 star rating.UPDATE (July 11, 2013): The stupid battery keeps crapping out, going dead until I plug it into the charger, than lying about the power levels, and going dead again in mid-call if I don't keep it plugged into the charger. I've had to order a replacement battery. Downgrading my rating again to 2.5.ANOTHER IMPORTANT UPDATE (January 2, 2014): Just a quick warning that although you can find replacement batteries online for a third of the retail price, and they claim to be compatible, they aren't! These are crappy Chinese knock-offs that give your phone a \"battery type not supported\" error and won't let you get past the \"charging\" screen. I bought one from an online discounter and had to use my credit card company to force them to give me a refund, then had to pay full retail for an official Samsung battery locally. And of course, it didn't take more than a few weeks for the new Samsung battery to begin giving me the same problems as the old one: the \"SD card removed\" error is showing up while the card is installed (as I have never removed it even once), the screen sometimes freezes or turns off, and the phone is not turning on consistently turning on when I press the power button. The phone works OK most of the time, but gives me screen or power up problems at least once a day, and I have to remove and put back the battery to \"fix\" the SD card error and other issues at least twice a week. Also, every once in awhile, the phone doesn't ring when people call. I only know they called when the new voicemail sound beeps, but my ringer was on full blast, I was awake, and the phone was within ten feet of me at the time. This phone cost a lot of money and it should not be having these problems! Downgrading my rating to 2 stars as a result.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "aband \"Alisa\"", "ReviewID": "R2O8HZ8EJ1G0O3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone on Black Friday and love it!

The Qwerty keyboard works just fine for me, I don't ever fat finger any extra keys. In short I am in love with this phone and in this phone has caused me to love android.From a modders perspective this phone has an active community. There are at the time of this writing 4 custom roms, an over clock kernel, a recovery tool based on clockwork mods and a one click root tool. Cyanogenmod 7 is in the works and Cyanogenmod 9 is being talked about and worked on by one enterprising individual.

This is well documented and seems to affect all phones of this model. The modding community is currently working on a fix for this.Phone battery length is short, however I feel this is a con across all smart phones. The drain comes primarily from radio usage, I can turn off wifi and 3g while I am using it for a game or an ebook and it will last much longer. A battery extender app is a MUST. I use juice defender ultimate and get 2x battery life through location based wifi activation and turning off network connectivity (wifi and 3g) while screen is off, it checks in every 30 minutes for facebook updates etc. Heavy users should expect to charge this phone twice a day, giving it an afternoon nap charging and once again while you sleep.

Everything I read talked about the Ultra's \"Hotspot\" capability. It's actually built-in to Android 2.3, which the Ultra uses. No one seemed to state whether or not Boost had disabled that capability in the phone. Maybe I should have asked for a demo at the store... Alas, the option is not there in settings and if you use a third-party settings manager, the phone says \"Hotspot is not supported.\"I was able to root the phone and installed Barnacle which gives me wifi-tethering in ad-hoc mode. But I paid extra money to get the full hotspot capability. I may have to play with replacing the Boost-crippled Android OS...Touchy touch-screen:Other than the mobile hotspot, the touch screen is way, way too sensitive. The phone tries to make calls when I slip it in my pocket unless I disable the \"Emergency Call\" button. The phone tries to change modes when my ear brushes the top bar when I'm taking a call.Battery life:The battery life is abysmal. For instance, I took it off the charger about 90 minutes ago. I checked to see if it was my turn to play in Scrabble (it wasn't) and watched about 10 minutes of video on Netflix. This was on Wifi in my house. Other than that usage, the phone has been idle. The battery is now at 65%.When I'm out and about, I am constantly turning on and off wifi, GPS and bluetooth depending on what I need to do at the moment. If I am sitting still for any amount of time, I seek out a wall outlet. You have to use a car charger if you expect to use this as a GPS in the car.Now for some good points:Boost rocks if you are in an area with good coverage. It's cheap and you never have to worry about using too much data. I love it!Android smart phones do so much... Look at my complaints: I was watching video on Netflix, playing Scrabble, using it as a GPS... This is a very functional device.

Two days ago the Back button and the Refresh button only worked when the slider was pulled out. Next came the Home button. Today the touch screen stopped responding and the phone shuts down immediately after being turned on. The phone has a limited one year warranty but since there is damage to the outside of the phone (and I know they'd never believe me that they sent it to me with a crack) I'm positive they wouldn't send me a new phone. Also, if you send them a phone that doesn't meet their limited warranty requirements, Samsung will charge you for the repair, labor, and shipping.

I have been a loyal Boost customer for five years. Their traditional cell phones were great, like the Sanyo Juno. They were good, durable, long lasting phones for talking and texting. The Transform Ultra was my first Android Smart phone. The battery life died after about 4 hours of streaming, playing music, and surfing the internet. It turns itself on and off, freezes, and takes grainy pictures. The sound quality is terrible. My friends can barely hear me and I can barely hear them. It doesn't alert me when I have a voice mail and it doesn't ring most of the time. But the biggest mistake I made was buying handset insurance. Boost Mobile told me that I would only have to pay a $25.00 fee to replace this phone if it was damaged. Then when I called their insurance company to file a claim to get another phone, the insurance company told me I would have to pay a $65.00 fee. The insurance company said that Boost always told their customers that the fee was $25.00 but that it had never been true. I was livid. I still have the crappy phone but I will be changing to another wireless carrier very soon. I hope that the $40.00 that Boost saved was worth losing a five year customer over. They also don't want to talk to you over the phone. They make their customers jump through all kinds of hoops just to have an agent call you back. Boost needs to get a clue.

I take a deep breath, and try again, a little less agitated, and finally it will slide.many times, the screen will go black, while i'm on a call. i'm in the middle of a important call where i have to respond by pressing a number on the keyboard, and the whole screen/keyboard has gone away, so my call gets ended, sometimes after being on hold with a company for a long time.

I 5 star recommend it.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best keyboard option on Boost but nagging issues", "Author": "Lucas B", "ReviewID": "RDV173DHJKQNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for four months, since it first went onsale directly from Boostmobile.com.  So maybe I'm an early adopter and the first batch is buggy.  One reviewer mentioned that getting a good one could also just be luck of the draw, so if you buy this phone then test it quickly and send it back right away if yours has problems.I love the speed, the memory size, and pull-out keyboard and the BOOST plans.  The unlimited everything (including data) plans are by far the best reason to switch to Boost, especially if you don't need a phone that is a 5 inch quad core beast that won't fit in your pocket.That being said, I have the touchscreen sensitivity problem and the Bluetooth sync problems as well.  I owned the Prevail before, an Iphone 4 and blackberries before that so I know how a touchscreen should work.The touchscreen is most problematic for me when trying to move icons around the desktop.  The phone thinks I took my finger off the screen before I actually did, and it dumps the icons in random places, sometimes the trash.  It's also hyper sensitive to holding the phone on the sides.  I've gotten used to it mostly, but holding the phone on the sides will often register a finger touch on the that side of the screen.  It's also sensitive to bouncing around in my pocket - I seem to butt dial or garbage text about 4-5 times a month.  Not a big deal except when it's a customer I accidentally call.  There are owners that swear their phone's touchscreens are perfect, so if you get a bad one, exchange it.The Bluetooth sync was better and gotten worse.  I have a nice Jawbone Icon that works perfect with other phones, tablet, and computer. But to use it with this phone I now have to unpair and the re-pair every morning, or whenever I recharge the bluetooth.  The phone also has issues pairing with my tablet - won't stay synced there either.I'm too late to return mine, so I'll live with it for awhile.Overall, if you have good Sprint coverage in your area, this is an excellent choice.  You may want to pick it up somewhere you can return it though after testing for a couple days.  That's probably true with all phones though.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but could be a lot better.", "Author": "TM", "ReviewID": "RJN3OAESI4280", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is nice, but definitely not top of the line for Android. As far as prepaid goes, its one of the best out there. If you want better, you should be using a prepay plan from a company that lets you use its regular plan phones for its prepaid plans (i.e. AT&T; - you can use any of their phones, except iPhone, on the prepaid plan). The phone operates on Gingerbread, not the newest version of Android, but then Ice Cream sandwich was just released and will likely be pushed out to the phone eventually, just as Gingerbread was to the Prevail.The phone has front and back facing cameras - good for Skyping. Gingerbread is an awesome OS - as a former Blackberry user, switching to Android has been great in general, but what makes it great is the Android system, not the phone itself. I'm addicted to the Swype feature - though it took some practice, its made texting and typing MUCH easier. The phone is pretty sleek, nice looking. The screen is sensitive - I dropped mine a few weeks after purchase and cracked the screen (thank goodness for insurance). The touchscreen issue that others mention is real. It seems to have issues with sensing when one has actually lifted their finger off of the screen. This makes dragging things fairly difficult and makes it frustrating to play games requiring dragging. Its even more frustrating to try to move icons to the different home screens as they always \"drop\" before making it to their destination. The keyboard, while convenient, is extremely cheap looking, with huge buttons. I got this phone especially for the keyboard, but never use it. It just seems big and clumsy, and not half as easy as using Swype. I read the mentions of the \"weird\" space bar in other reviews and didn't quite understand until I got the phone - it seems like there is no support in the middle of the space bar, and one must push on the sides specifically to make it space. Also, enter and delete buttons are in weird spots and I constantly hit one when meaning to hit the other.Boost Mobile - I've been with them for about a year and a half now, and there are definite good and bad points. The best thing is the price - $55 unlimited monthly is a great deal, and hard to find even with contract plans. The Shrinkage plan is cool too - a reduction of $5 to your bill for every 6 on time payments - especially easy if you are on auto-pay. They are part of Sprint, and all of their Android and Blackberry phones run on the Sprint CDMA network - good but could be much much faster. Although the network is supposed to be 3G, I regularly have issues streaming music and videos on this phone (and any Boost smartphone for that matter) - lots of buffering. Since Sprint isn't the head of the pack in the phone industry, their coverage isn't as complete as AT&T; or Verizon. I get dropped calls occasionally but not nearly as much as my boyfriend, who is on MetroPCS. The customer service is my least favorite thing with Boost. Its virtually impossible to get through to somebody on their automated system, and doesn't even give an option to transfer until you've been through at least 4 menus, and even then only once it has difficulty figuring out what you are looking for based on your response. Things like activating insurance, which should be an option on the main menu, take navigating 3 or more menus for upwards of 10 minutes, to get to the correct person. They always make \"mistakes\" that take forever to fix and cost the customer - example: I started with Boost before Shrinkage. I switched my account to Shrinkage, and was told, both by text and email, that the change would take effect on my next billing date, the 15th of every month. Instead, I received a text message on the 13th of the month stating my billing date had been moved up to the 13th because of the plan change. It took 2 hours over 4 calls with customer service, to get my billing date switched back to the 15th, and was very inconvenient for me. To resolve the issue, they switched me from a monthly plan to a daily plan for two days and credited my account for the 2 days - they told me it would automatically switch back to monthly on the 15th, and everything would be fixed. It didn't and I ended up spending another hour on the phone to get it resolved. These are the kind of issues that would never happen with contract phones.Bottom line - if you have bad credit or just want to avoid a contract, and want an Android, this is your best option. Decent phone, decent network. Could be better, but then, the No Contract cell phone industry doesn't offer much no matter who you go with.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "IT is all in the details", "Author": "Fishgriller \"Kurt Ploetz\"", "ReviewID": "R7U84XXPTYJJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DOES Boost mobile has the lowest prices and basically does the same thing as all of the other phone plans?

By the time I was just starting to get a break on Boost monthly charge, I was about to order a third M930.  I called and insisted they consider a different phone to replace a phone model that must have some manufacturing problems, but they said no. Rather than get a third junk phone I quit Boost and went with ATT and an iPhone.

LONG READ! But full review!)I have had this phone for over two years and recently retired it as it has outlived it's limitations. In the first month that I had it (keep in mind that I work as a Chef), it was exposed to heavy humidity, high heat, blunt force trauma, being dropped, thrown across a room (don't ask) and otherwise poked, prodded and manhandled...yet it STILL worked like the day it came out of the box. (To this day, the screen doesn't have so much as a scratch on it.)Initially, the phones battery life was phenomenal but I made the poor choice of using a poor quality 5V 1Amp (Which is the standard for this phone) charger on a long wedding road trip and it did permanent damage to it's internal circuitry which caused it to start degrading it's batteries and any replacement batteries. After well over two years, I was unable to get it to last even two hours on battery before it would run out of charge due to the internal charging circuits frying the batteries. (My fault. NOT Samsung's) :-( Still, determined to keep it because of it's loyalty to me, I held onto it and made sure to have a charger and an outlet handy at all times.The processing power of this titanic beast is amazing! It can run games and high quality video without even so much as a single flicker. The internal memory needs to be managed properly (INSTALL TO THE SD CARD) so long as you stick in a really good quality and large microSD card. Picture taking quality with the rear camera is amazing and with the right light can actually look like professional photos. The front one on the other hand...ugh...ladies, don't waste your makeup. The image quality is too pixelated to even matter.Data connectivity with this mammoth can be spotty as times, as can your voice signal, but the good outweighs the bad. In the center of most major cities it will provide decent data speeds but will be sluggish trying to stream anything. (Use your WiFi as often as possible. It's liquid smooth when it's on.) This is likely due to Boost's Fisher-Price \"my first 3G network\" style data system. Otherwise, when you have at least one bar of signal, voice calls as clear as a bell and the earphone speaker can get loud enough to give you a headache. Even the external speaker output is crisp and clear and won't distort at high volumes.Now for the input part of the review. The slide out keyboard takes some getting used to, but has wonderful haptic feedback and provides a satisfying/soft click-like response upon every button press. The touchscreen is nice and responsive and feels smooth as glass even after years of use. All the buttons are perfectly placed and are easily accessible with one hand. The overall size and shape fits great in the palm of your hand as well. The addition of a conveniently placed 3.5mm headphone/mic combo jack on the top of the phone is the icing on the cake and worked with every multifunction headset (stereo ear-buds with built in mic and remote buttons) that I used with it.Moving on to the Bluetooth, internal WiFi and GPS. The Bluetooth capabilities of this phone worked smoothly with any device I could throw at it. (Even an external Logitech Bluetooth keyboard.) The wifi was great as well and had a fairly impressive range compared to other handheld devices I've owned in the past. As for the GPS? Rock solid. The built in Navigation software on this phone has taken me to all corners of the states and I am going to miss the monotone droning of the GPS's voice as I thunder about the city.Wrapping this all up, I highly suggest this phone to anyone needing a budget smartphone. It has all the perks you could ask for; WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, microSD card slot, touchscreen AND slide out physical keyboard...and I almost forgot to add, A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR which crushed anything I threw at it. Sure, it's not an iPhone or Galaxy phone, but if you are on a budget then you will never regret buying this sultan of surfing.Just don't use any other charger than the one it came with.......K? ;-)", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "still working", "Author": "Magic Harley \"Knubz\"", "ReviewID": "R1LVN57ZCRU2JZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say, that this must be one of boost mobile most reliable phone I've owned.Work's a advertised and more.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "It' Gud!", "Author": "tray turner", "ReviewID": "R2QIBFYVXXXTGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had one before..It's a great phone..

Since it was out of warranty from Samsung i decided to buy another one.  Big MIstake!  I've had this new phone, same model, for less than 2 months, and it's starting to give me the same problem as the other phone.  Flashing screen, thinks it's being charged.  It's like if i was connecting and disconnecting from the charger every half a second.  It's going crazy.  So, I will be calling Samsung to get it fixed.  The good thing is that as long as the phone hasn't gotten wet or dropped, Samsung is good about fixing these phones for free.  The Samsung warranty is free for a year.

Last, the phone seems extremely fragile... lacking any beefiness in regards to quality. When you first slide the keyboard out you'll understand the need to baby it.There are now some other flaws with it. About 4 months ago (after boost pushed through a major update) my transform-ultra sometimes hesitates when trying to wake up and can take 5 seconds or more to get to the splash screen. About every 2 or 3 days I get a message saying the SD card was unexpectedly removed when the phone hasn't been used for hours. Now, when using the camera, the phone crashes and I get a camera error after taking just one picture. A hard boot usually fixes these issues for a day. Is this the phones fault or boost's? Well, both. This isn't a review about boost but I'm happy w/them for the price.Over all I do like this phone... when it works.

It takes some getting used to and there are features that are not available through Droid (like screen shot) that I really miss, but once I got used to it, I really do like this phone.  Its thicker than I would prefer, but not bad.  The touchscreen has never failed me and this phone has had very few glitches, all of which were resolved with a power cycle (restart).  I actually already had this phone for about 8 months and it fell from my pocket into some water when I bent over to pick something up.  Water and electronics don't mix, needless to say, so I tried using my husband's ZTE Warp.

Fourth, the touch-screen is ridiculous to use-  too sensitive as the phone jumps to different screens as your finger just passes over the screen, which is a pain to just keep going back or starting over to get back to where you wanted to be. Fifth, the calendar does not save any of my events. Sixth, my time zone is EST and the phone wants to keep switching to MST- another pain to reset. Seventh, the keyboard is too big and keys have to be depressed with more pressure which makes typing harder. Eighth, the battery takes a very long time/seems like forever to charge and does not last throughout the day with not too much use either, so take a charger with you. Ninth, the slider keyboard is difficult for me to use as the phone is hard to hold with bigger size, slippery back design, and top heavy when open.

Brogan", "ReviewID": "R3PZE45Q0ZDWM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok, I don't do reviews very often but I HAD to warn people about this device. Ok, so I purchased the Transform Ultra a few days ago. I plan on returning it as soon as I can find a place that sells the Warp. Unless I can't, then I'll have to return the phone and be out the 55.00 I paid for the plan. The Transform Ultra has two major (to me) flaws that make this thing terrible, almost completely useless and certainly not worth the 230.00 I paid for it. The first being the touch screen. It's awful. You try to drag a widget from one screen to the next it'll take you 5 minutes because the screen doesn't recognize what you're doing. The widget drops constantly when you're trying to drag it around and of course your finger is still on it when it drops so it opens up the program sometimes two or three screens deep, which you then have to back out of. You can't scroll in the browser either. Well you can but it's ridiculously frustrating. If you're scrolling through, say a list of items at Amazon, when you're brushing your finger down the screen to scroll, it will constantly click on items in the list, forcing you to have to back out all the time. Not to mention the zoom in and zoom out features have a tendency to work at what seems like random. You swipe to scroll down and the screen zooms out.Now, let's talk about the sliding qwerty. It's terrible as well. The buttons are barely raised up so it's incredibly difficult to feel which buttons you are actually pushing which wouldn't be so bad if not for the space bar. Good grief! I don't know who thought it was a good idea to make the space bar longer than necessary and then put two buttons at each end of the bar. Now you've got this sloping gap between the two buttons which is the perfect place for your thump to keep landing in (like a pot hole), which of course makes it impossible to tell if you've actually hit the space bar to begin with. What's worse is that space between the two buttons is flush with the buttons above it! That's right, so you might end up hitting the space bar but then again you also might be hitting the keys in the row above it and sometimes you're not even activating the space bar when you thought you did! Nope. Instead you're just hitting the buttons in the row above the space bar. This happened to me on numerous occasions. In fact I found myself using the touch screen qwerty instead of the sliding one which completely defeats the purpose of having one at all. I mean these issues are mentioned everywhere by actual users yet it's still getting fantastic reviews from phone critics, most of them not even mentioning these two big problems, which to me is almost like lying about the product but then apparently many of them do get paid to sing praises about some of the items they are reviewing. Honestly how can such a quick phone internally and such an attractive looking phone, on the outside, have such shoddy qwerty design and screen hardware? Or maybe it's a screen software issue. Either way it's a huge issue.This phone certainly looks awesome to me, and it would be almost perfect if not for those two, rather major problems. Oh by the way one other small problem I had with this phone was the back cover. It looks nice and feels nice to me in my hands but when I would try to slide open the qwerty board to do a text, my fingers kept slipping over the phone instead of gripping the surface so even sliding the phone open was frustrating at times. I think that had they rubberized the back it would of solved this issue completely. Yeah it annoys me when people mention these little problems and I thought they were just being nit picky but I had never experienced the issue until I got this phone. Now I see what people were talking about and honestly if this were the only problem this phone would be awesome.All I can say is for those who are happy with the phone, who don't mind these flaws, and apparently these flaws are universal and not just random. I mean I've seen user reviews from people who have mentioned these flaws but are ok with them being there and then turn around and say the phone is near perfect (giving it 4 and 5 stars). Anyway for those who are happy with this phone, I'm happy for you but anyone interested in purchasing it, really do your research. This phone isn't nearly as great as the ratings seem to suggest. Check out sites that post reviews from actual users of this phone. People who actually paid for this device out of pocket. Check out videos of people using the phone. There are videos of people pointing out on the actual device the issues that I am mentioning here. See them for yourself, then make an informed decision. As a person who has paid for this phone out of pocket and has had a chance to use it, I can not recommend it.The biggest reason I bought this phone was because I wanted a phone with a sliding qwerty. This one has one, but it's horrible thus making it pointless to have gone with this phone. The other reason I bought this phone was because it's fast and it looks nice. What's the point of a fast phone when the screen makes it near impossible to navigate in the browser or even use an app that requires you to click and drag? I mean you can forget about any kind of decent gaming on this phone, although I will admit, Angry Birds ran perfectly, graphics wise, and I barely had any screen touch issues although I did have some. Sometimes the birds would get released prematurely because the screen couldn't recognize the dragging motion. What good is a good looking phone if it's component parts make it a pain to use? My two biggest reasons for choosing this phone over something else, just flew right out the window (like an Angry Bird;-). The reason I gave this phone 2 stars instead of one is because, the over all build quality is nice and it does load pages quickly. It's just a pain trying to navigate those pages because the screen is so bad. So is the phone complete crap? No, but for me, the bads significantly outweighed the goods. For those considering getting this phone, all I can say is, don't do it.

Circulation of the ZTE Android is limited so I couldn't locate one through a retailer. However, I ordered it direct through Boost Mobile and it arrive in three days. Boost Mobile customer service activated the new phone and kept my original phone number without charge.Pros:The phone is impressive with a 5.1\" height.It has a reasonably large touchscreen (for videos & touchscreen apps)It weights only 4.93 ouncesFeatures a 5MP CameraCons:Despite a reasonable variety of accessories available through the Boost Mobile store and elsewhere (ebay; amazon; android central) it remains difficult to find high quality cases such as the Otter Case (retails for approx. $50), which was recommended to protect the phone. Did find some flimsy rubber cases.Accessories available through Boost Mobile: - Universal Screen Protectors - In Stock  SanDisk\u00ae 8GB Mobile Ultra(tm) microSDHC Memory Card w/ Reader - In Stock  Micro-USB vehicle power charger PLUS - In Stock  Plantronics M100 Bluetooth Headset - In Stock  LG Stereo Bluetooth Headset HBS-700Over the month I've had the phone there has been only one service interruption, which never reoccurred. Further, I prefer prepaid to contracts service because it makes good financial sense although I can certainly afford the either. I have had a long standing relationship with several contract phone carriers although Boost Mobile remains the best prepaid phone service. Perhaps, a wider variety of cases will become available over the upcoming months.
