It really had a built in mirror and it shines all over. Very nice color. You can hook it to the computer to get connected and get your contacts, or use your sim card copy. U can bluetooth music, pictures and email. The speaker is clear when you get calls and listen to your music. Well built phone. I really like the roll action on the keys to select your opt. Now this does not have the 850 band.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Phone with many features", "Author": "Brittany Henderson", "ReviewID": "R1VNEY9JHSFJSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really great phone, no complaints the texting is AMAZINGhowever mine did break, the screen cracked so I would advise you to BUY A CASE! as I will be doing as soon as I get a new one.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not that great of a phone", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R24OBQB6MIV8Y6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone unlocked for my girlfriend so she could use it with any service provider.You have to constantly wipe off the front of it because your makeup & everything else makes it look nasty.It was a great phone for the first 7 months untill she dropped it on accident.The upper corner of the mirror cracked when she dropped it,And now sometimes when she slides it shut it will just completely shut off.I highly advise you to buy a case for it or keep it in something because once you drop it, its all downhill from there.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "too pink, why not?", "Author": "MackieBu", "ReviewID": "R1H2RYKLQRAJ4H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it so much. It's not boring for one. But the real reason why i like it is because it's unlocked, I use a prepaid card, it has a nice camera and I can upload a few songs in it (I use it as my ring tone). I'm a nokia person but since I live in a place where I don't really need a phone (I use this for emergencies only), this is working well for me.;)", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.89", "Features": "BRAND NEW", "Name": "Unlocked LG KE970 Shine Pink", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Nn8y3n-zL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000VY2SRS"}}
