I like this phone very much. Very easy to use and is a great alternative for those who want a touch screen phone, but not a smartphone. Now it's been about 10 months that I have this phone and it is working perfectly, just like when I first used it. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a small, touch screen, LG quality phone. ATT signal is great! I live in a small town and was worried about signal, but I am always on four or five bars.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Bother - Even Warranty Replacement Phone Died", "Author": "Joe in NC", "ReviewID": "R2R0ZVP2KQKWW6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not typically a bad review writer, but this phone is the worst electronic device I have ever owned.  I bought it through Amazon for $80 with a $50 prepaid credit, so I guess I really got $30 worth of phone.Let's see - the positives: The device is attractive and easy to use, nice and small so it fits well in the pocket (watch out for key scratches on the screen!).  The menu that drops down from the top of the main screen is very useful, it has a decent amount of ring tones, and surfs the web pretty well (though the fonts are typically too small).The negatives:  The first phone I bought had issues from the get go.  It would drop calls and go into a \"dead\" state after a while where incoming calls got my voice mail and outgoing calls would look like they were going through, but then the 5 network bars would drop to zero and the call would just sit there and not connect.  Very frustrating, especially for my family trying to reach me.  It seemed that this state was reached after one successful call, then while looking like it was still functional (looked on, 4-5 bars network, etc) it was just dead and I would finally find out it wasn't working when I tried to use it.  Anyway, this is consistent with other reviews I have read since.  So - I sent it to warranty (after dealing with very rude customer no-service personnel) and a replacement was sent. It has been working fine for around 10 months  (and my opinion about the phone was changing) until early this week when the touch screen stopped working.  Buttons still work but touch screen is dead, and it's been over a year since the original purchase, so I'm out of warranty.  Fortunately for me, I'm out only $30, but the frustrations definitely weren't worth it.I would not recommend this phone for anyone, at all.I am putting this at the end of the review b/c I don't know if this is due to AT&T; or the phone, but there are entirely too many dead spots in the network and it just seems the network signal strength should have been better at certain times.  Could be an insufficient antenna in the phone, or just bad AT&T; coverage.And, to try to balance that out for AT&T;, their 10 cents/minute prepaid plan is awesome, so I am staying with them.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone!", "Author": "Danusia", "ReviewID": "R30MOM6B1XRZQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been having trouble with my old phone so I bought this one.
