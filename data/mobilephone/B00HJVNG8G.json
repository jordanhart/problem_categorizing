But this phone is fun for a basic phone.  I love the fm radio on it.  Even if I never am able to activate it, I am having fun playing with it.You can make your own ringtones with the melody maker.Tracfone customer service is really slow and there is problems with language, cuz they are all overseas. So I feel doubtful this will ever work as a handset. But for $7.99 I don't care really because it's cute and I can use it as a radio and a toy. I have smartphones too, and two other tracfones, but this one is the best basic non smartphone I have seen at this price.Basically I don't use actual cell minutes that much. I just like to buy these cheapo tracfones every 2 months for the free 20 minutes.  This one I might keep though, cuz it's very cute and I don't feel like it comes from 1994.The pictre doesn't really show the cuteness of the phone.  The handset actually looks and feels much more polished than the picture shows.And the phone arrived right on time, with prime shipping.  So I am happy even though I have to wait for a sim card that may or may not show up.It takes pictures and video too.  It has a world clock, a calendar, alarm, calculator, task list, currency converter, etc. It has two full version games on it, and they are both basic but challenging. Copter and Chicken. I am not sure if it accepts an sd card, but it does have a menu item for sd card.I was able to take a picture on it and push it too my android phone, so it does accept object transfer via bluetooth.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for a month", "Author": "mrdprince", "ReviewID": "R2BPQG7KU9L9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is excellent and has met all my needs.  Then after one month the phone has started deducting 0.03 or more minutes from my total without my using it.  Customer service by phone has cost me more than if I left it alone.

Seems reliable and sturdy. The rubbery-surface keys are small but convex, so you can press just the key you intend easily enough.  Its nice that it has 3G, but its not a good phone for internet - the curser pointer is just not precise enough - you often can't click exactly where you want to on the screen (like an input box).  Tracfone seems to charge a lot of minutes for web use.  Of course I wish it had WiFi, but good luck finding that feature in this price range.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Sherri jarembo", "ReviewID": "R14RPGNIJBUJ2E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Can't find accessories and a case for it so I guess its outdated a bit.

I dont need anything special, and this delivers exactly that. w/ triple minutes for life? i am now a phone god.with that aside, works well, cam w video and pics is great. internet access if you want it. only thing i dont like is the location of the volume button, on the right side as you face it. every time i pick it up to answer a call i inadvertently press it, so i never know if its a bad connection or probably my pushing the button.one thing about tracfone: be careful, they recycle the numbers they use. i got one number from them as soon as i bought this. when it went live i instantly started getting spam texts, and their customer service in the pakistan/afghan desert is nearly non-existent. and if you want to x-fer your info from one fone to another, you will need a 3rd fone to do that. its an unbelieveable mess, and you will not be refunded minutes you use in speaking to their customer service.need a cheap great phone? dont pass this up.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Comes with setup minutes and setup service days", "Author": "Dale L. Splitstone", "ReviewID": "R1HLST6I406Z6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The package states that the phone comes with 10 setup minutes, but does not mention setup service days. When I activated I received 20 setup minutes and 60 setup service days.I purchased this phone to activate and test an LG Optimus Dynamic II (LG39C). Tracfone Android phones do not come with any setup minutes or setup service days. It is also not possible to port your service, other than phone number, to a non-Android phone if the Android phone proves unsuitable for the intended purpose. My solution was to purchase a package including this phone and a 200 minute card at a package cost of $19.99. This way I can activate the EX431G, transfer its setup minutes and setup service days to the LG39C when I activate it, and hold the 200 minute card in reserve till after I verify the LG39C is suitable. If I have to I can transfer my number back to the EX431G and reactivate it with the 200 minute card. All I would lose is the setup minutes and setup service days.This is pretty much ideal for my needs. I use an average of about 120 minutes/month. Activating the card provides me with 600 minutes and 90 service days on the Android. This is about 5 months of minutes and three months of service days. The phone itself comes with about 5 days of minutes and two months of service days. Thus, if I can use the Android I can get about 5 months worth of minutes and 5 months worth of service days. I figure $19.99 for 5 months worth of service is a great deal.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Won't work", "Author": "Karen Phillips", "ReviewID": "R2R4YPR7K4O2QR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should have known it was too good to be true, These phones won't work in my area.

We decided to upgrade and bought a Samsung T404G, but we couldn't get a signal inside the house.  In fact, we had to go out in our driveway to get a signal. A friend told us that Motorolas have better antennas than Samsungs do, so I did some research on Amazon.  This cell phone was highly rated and at a very reasonable price, so we bought it.  Guess what-we can get a signal inside of our home again.  We are thrilled.  Not only that, the pictures that we take with it are much better quality than the ones taken with the Samsung.
