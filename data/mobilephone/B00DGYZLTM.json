{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overjoyed!", "Author": "TeePlus2", "ReviewID": "R48U9MLVJCF0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's only been a week, but we love our new home phone.  We kept our landline phone number.  It was ported from Verizon in 2 days.  We have not experienced any of the problems mentioned by some reviewers on other websites - no beeping sound, no echo, no humming sound.  We live in an area with the best possible voice coverage, and  I would suggest checking the AT&T; coverage map before purchasing.  We chose to purchase the unit outright so as not to be locked into a 2 year contract.  Amazon's price for the unit is currently $30 less than AT&T;'s brick-and-mortars and website.  We chose a prepaid account so there are no surcharges or extra fees.  $20/month for excellent home phone service.  Period.  It's easy to activate, install and use, and their  customer service is great.  I'm sorry we waited so long and wasted so much money.  This saves us $38/month, and we get more bells & whistles compared to our previous Verizon plan.  **Only supports home security systems which are monitored wirelessly.**  If our experience changes, I'll update my review.  Otherwise, 5 stars.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "is very good item", "Author": "D.

We liked having a landline #, but not the added monthly expense of $35.00.  We ported over our landline # in 4 days, it was a easy process at&t; made it simple and painless.  The setup took 10 minutes and we were making calls.  The call clarity is better than our old home service and for $20.00 per month for unlimited talk, not a bad deal.  Half way through the year we take the WHP on vacation, it is great!", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Replacement to traditional home phone", "Author": "TheTallGreenOgre", "ReviewID": "R2HENEOOIIUKWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this same device, but used through post-pay (on a plan). I am overly happy. Have had it two years with no problems.Be warned, with caller ID, it is ONLY CALLER NUMBER ID, not the name. Plus, you cannot use a fax/home security system/satellite with this.If you just need something to be an effective cost replacement to your home phone, this is the route to go. I couldn't have been happier.And porting your home number is easy. Takes about 4-5 days to complete, but you can make calls immediately from the device once activated.As long as you live in an area with decent phone service, you won't have a problem with this device.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wireless home phone", "Author": "on the road", "ReviewID": "R3DTQWDC3P3JUQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone works great, but Att continues to ask me to add money to keep it active...I signed up for auto charge to credit card twice.

When I opened the unit it had a sim card in it. Unless you buy directly from at&t; the unit should not contain a sim card. It was used. Followed the instructions to set it up and it did not work properly. I talked to at&t; tech support (took 35 minutes to get someone on the phone to help me) and they said to update the software. I updated the software online and it still did not work. AT&T; tech support said it could be a bad sim card. I went to the at&t; store and replaced the sim. It still did not work. They verified it had the latest firmware/software and then said it was a defective unit. I wonder if the unit had already been returned as defective once before. I say this because this is the second time in about 5 purchases I bought surprisingly inexpensive electronics from amazon and received a defective/used unit. I am not happy. If you need this product then take the 2 year contract from at&t; and get a free functioning unit directly from at&t.; The monthly cost is the same and if you use it for 2 years you save money on the unit. Avoid the potential  hassle of this product.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "No problems with ATT", "Author": "T. Boggs", "ReviewID": "R1X1HKHT3OWLL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this version from Amazon because it was about 2/3 the price of the retail version from ATT. Took the sim out of my Nokia Lumia 520 (also purchased from Amazon http://amzn.com/B00E45043A ) and after about 5 minutes it was synced with ATT. Have had no issues with call quality or connectivity.This was purchased for my Dad who stays at home most of the time. It's easier for him to use a traditional handset and they don't get lost. When he travels to other family, we pop out the sim and put it in a cell phone.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love to save money!", "Author": "George O'Brien", "ReviewID": "R255Q58IAXANJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great signal, great price, and we got to keep our land line number when we switched to at&t.;  Best choice we made!", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Could not activate the device", "Author": "James N Roller", "ReviewID": "R1CZM3040VI6DP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I need to state that Amazon.com was used because of their service to the customer and the rating only applies to the product.This device could not be activated on line or at the ATT store or by telephone.
