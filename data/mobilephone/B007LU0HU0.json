{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can't Wait For Another Upgrade", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R2856NLKTZEFUR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am nearly 14 years old, and I got this phone in the blue color for my birthday last year. I was very excited about it, as it was going to be my first smartphone, for which I had been waiting 2 years. When I first got the phone I was thrilled with how it worked. It had smooth graphics and did nearly everything I wanted it to at the time.After the first month or two, the phone started running slower, malfunctioning on certian actions, and deleting my pictures (a problem which I still haven't solved). It isn't NEARLY as bad as my mom's Samsung Transform (DO NOT BUY), but still is hugely annoying.About 6 months ago, I got a Facebook account and downloaded the Facebook app to this phone, which is a fairly large app. After downloading the app, I didn't have enough memory to download even a single app, not even enough to update apps already downloaded on the phone. I have moved every app possible to the SD card, and clear cache every day, but THERE IS HARDLY ANY INTERNAL MEMORY ON THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!! I have uninstalled every single app that I do not use and still have not updated any apps in the past 6 months, which only decreases the quality of service on the phone.Also, because of the small screen size, many apps are not \"listed as compatible\" even though they can actually be run on the phone. I was waiting months for the popular Temple Run game to come out on Android, only to find that I couldn't download it because of this compatibility miscommunication.In short, if you are planning to download more than 5 apps that cannot be moved to SD card, DO NOT buy this phone. It is a piece of crap. I have been begging my mom for 6 months for a new phone, and literally are counting the days until I can get an upgrade on my phone. And that is more than a year from now!!PROS:-Completes most actions well-Hard keyboard-Compact and lightCONS:-Deletes pictures for no reason-Has hardly any internal memory-Cannot download many popular apps-Malfunctions easily", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not enough space", "Author": "Ace of Sevens", "ReviewID": "R1W012RLUBRG9I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very happy with this, my first smartphone, for a few months, but then I started running out of room. I had plenty of room on my SD card and nothing installed on the phone itself except the Amazon apps and Facebook, which won't run on the SD card. Even after a complete reset, I don't have enough room to download most updates. I have to constantly delete and reinstall Facebook. Also, the battery got to the point where it would only hold a charge for about 5 minutes after only about a year of use.

But it makes me irritated on a daily basis. It drops the signal constantly, web pages refuse to load, it overheats, it takes forever to charge, the keyboard is slippery, the screen is poor quality (things look really fuzzy unless you zoom way in), and the battery life is cruddy at best. I like Android but this thing is a total fail-especially for an \"eco phone\".

It's a good phone for about a year, if you can ignore the minimalist internal memory. It was almost exactly a year to the date when mine started severely misbehaving. First the battery stopped holding a charge, and bubbled up. I attempted to buy another battery online (Buyer beware) which didn't work in the phone.I have only had issues with the 20mb internal memory, (To put it into perspective, the google play store takes up 10mb and facebook takes 13.) and the battery.

It was my first smartphone, so I was excited just to have apps and stuff, and was blinded by it's cruel and abusive nature. I am now on my 4th Replenish because it keeps breaking, one way or another. First time the lock/unlock/power button stopped working, then the phone stopped working altogether, then with my replacement the internal antenna broke, and now my 3rd model has the same problem as the first. The battery life is minuscule, data isn't great, it can't do many popular apps because of the screen size; just go for the big guns.
