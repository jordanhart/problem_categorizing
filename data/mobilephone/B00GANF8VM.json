Walked out of the store and handed it to my grandson in the backseat of my car. He logged right into Netflix and was watching Hunger Games in stereo, 1080P in seconds on 4G network. AT&T; Locker App has 50GB offer right now. Nokia has coupon for $20 of Apps. Only drawback is it takes a few hours to set the phone up to the way YOU want it. But, Apple doesn't give you that kind of choice. Once you customize it is is a big surprise what this phone does for you. Almost everything is automatic and very intuitive. But it lets the Geek use the phone the way they prefer. Integrates completely with a Windows 8 PC. Lots of apps are available and more seem to be coming everyday. I enjoy this phone much more than I ever did any Apple product AND I can add memory, AND it has a USB port. SO, I guess I am not considered too stupid to use this product by the manufacturer.

This is my first Windows phone since the HTC Tilt which was top of the line when purchased.  My previous phone was Android.  I chose this over the Samsung Note 3 because I preferred the better camera to the S pen.The goodThe phone is speedy and easy to use:  The screen is beautiful!  I have not really put the camera through its paces, but I took a couple of test shots of my laptop keyboard in dim light and every speck of dust showed!  This bodes very well for the camera.I had no trouble downloading Skype (which works on wifi!), Kindle, Audible , Google, Tune in Radio and Netflix. They work almost as well as on my Kindle Fire HD.  I hope that Amazon will develop a full set of apps for all platforms.It did not take long to set up ( similar to Android in many ways).I added a 32G SDHC card I had lying around the house.  When (and if ) it gets full, I will upgrade to 64G.  It  may seem strange in this day and age, but I appreciate the FM radio which uses a speaker cable or headset cable as an antenna.  My kitchen is a dead zone for Wifi and until I can solve the problem, the radio is a plus.  It also saves data usage on the street at times.The challengesFirst of all when I hold the phone in my left hand, my fourth finger sits right on the on/off/sleep button and I have  put it into sleep mode on several occasions.  As a quick fix for my very small hands I tried to turn it upside down (with the headset port on the bottom), but even with the screen unlocked, I could not make that happen.  I can get landscape mode in either direction, but only portrait mode one way, unlike my android devices.Since I am not a heavy app user, I did not do my app homework very well.  I found that Barnes and Noble had not developed a Nook app for the Windows phone (yet?)  Also Pulse News is missing from the app store, although Fuse is not too bad as a substitute.  Acorntv has not developed an app for any device.  It would be nice if a Windows phone would play Flash.Addendum:21 DecI have now taken off one star because of the Bing \"button.\"  It is both unnecessary and too sensitive.  Too many times while holding the phone, my finger has brushed it by accident and the Bing Search screen appeared and shut off whatever I was doing.  It could be just because my hands are small, but if I could I would disable the button so I could have the real estate at that corner.  I would rather have Bing as an icon/app (or not at all).  I am going to the Att help center tomorrow to see what can be done although I doubt there is a fix.I was promised a free case from Microsoft but they were out when I picked up my phone.  I will also go over the the Microsoft store tomorrow to pick one up.  I have not had cases on my other smartphones, only on tablets. A downside of the 1520 is the limited number of cases available.  No really nice leather options.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "REALLY big phone, lots to love!", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "RQHOGJUKHIOOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is really big. I really love it but I do feel a little self conscious pulling it out of my pocket to answer a call. I can fit it in my pockets of both my dress slacks for work and my jeans. I carry it in the left hip pocket and it fits well and does not bother me when I sit down.Having said that about the size, the other side of it is that the screen is awesome. Reading articles, watching videos and even texting are so cool on the big screen.Other reviews have gone into great detail so I will keep it pretty high level here. I upgraded from the Samsung Focus, a first Generation Windows Phone 7. The operation of WP8 is great. It has all the things I love about WP but has added more features as well. The quad-core processor is really fast and makes taking multiple pictures in a row work rather quickly with very little lag time (I read a review of the Lumia 1020 that said it takes about 6 seconds to load between shots). The updated Nokia Camera app is really cool. It allows for a lot of manual settings if you want to play with your shots and be more creative. Using more than one of the features will slow down your set up time but it does allow you great control over your exposure which I really like. It will likely take just a little practice to get very proficient with these manual settings.The Nokia apps are some of the best apps on this phone and they come standard. Nokia Radio allows you to create a playlist (similar to creating a radio station on Pandora) and then download the playlist so that you can play it offline. I now have playlists that I can listen to at the gym without having to stream music and use all my data. I removed most of the AT&T; apps because the Nokia apps do the same things even better.I am really enjoying this phone. If they offered the same phone in a 5 inch screen I likely would have gotten that one instead, but having such a big screen has a lot of benefits too. I haven't even touched my Kindle Fire since I go this phone because it operates as my tablet now too.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best of Both worlds.", "Author": "Santosh Geddamuri Sr. \"Happysan\"", "ReviewID": "R1N8M0TM6HCNIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying this phone is amazing.This is my 6th windows phone in a span of 1 year. I keep phone maximum for 3 months and sell it with good value. Earlier i had Lumia 1020 which is amazing phone too. I was in market for a mini ipad.Then i came across this phone . So i thought why not buy Lumia 1520 which can be used as a mini tablet and phone.I have no regrets in buying this phone. Below is  my experience with this phone.Form Factor: Yes phone is little big. As this is a phablet category, the size is expected.We cant have a SUV's room in a compact car. So the benefits of large screen is obvious. Also at the same time there will be some inconvinience.Both Hands: Yes most times you need to use both hands. For instance, you cant use back button without using 2nd hand. But i got used to it.After couple weeks ownership , i dont feel this as a inconvinience any more. It matters most in a CAR where you need to handle the phone single handed. So all the time i mount my phone and i can use single hand.Screen: Screen is great and retina. But if you use phone screen without any protector then the screen is very slippery.Camera: Didnt test much but looks as good as lumia 1020 with less zoom.Slim. This phone is very slim when compared to lumia 1020. there is no bulge on the back so it sits flat.I se phone for movies at gym. Lumia 1020's camera bulge was always a chalange at gym. As 1520 sits flat, it is more secure.Speed: I dont think i see much speed improvement over 1020. Though it is quad core ,system still takes time to repsond on certain apps.I believe the speed has to do with particular apps then the phones hardware.When i switched to 1520 ,i thought some lagging in 1020 will be gone in 1520/. but certains apps still lagg.Lanyard: I miss Lanyard of lumia 1020 in this phablet. As this is a big phone, Nokia must have Lanyard option. To remedy this, i added my own . I used incipio air case and added Lanyard to the speaker grill. It works great as the case is strong.Speakers:It is almost same as lumia 1020 speaker with 10-15% improvement in volume. The clarity is same. Both speakers are great. Ear piece could be louder. I dont know but Nokia Lumia series suffers with low ear piece volume.Red Lumia. Red is slippery as every one suggested. Incipio case took care of it.Tiles: Extra column for tiles is a plus. Now one can see more information without moving the screen.Side Keys: Side keys are too flat. It is quite difficult to find volume keys and lock keys .It could be better like lumia 1020.Phone in public: Yes it is eye catching. It doesnt look good if you talk on this phablet in public. But who cares.when Iphone first came, it looked too BIG. but it has become new NORM now. So people will get used to it as phablets become more popular.Also it keep you out of crowd.Pocket: It easily slides into pocket. In my formals and jeans i have no issue in sliding the phone. It fits and doesnt pop out of pocket. As it is slim, the extra length doesnt bother me.Wireless charging. I am really mad on ATT on removing wireless charging from this phone. Hell with the technology and standards. IF they care too much then why did they sell qi wireless chargers. Now that every one got one qi wireless chargers they removed this from phone.ATT ------ in this regard.battery: Awesome. It has very good battery life.It is almost twice that of lumia 1020. I tested battery by turning on everything.Even though the location was turned on, the battery drain was not significant. I believe if location is not used by any app then system turns it  off.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review from an AVID iphone user and former Windows 7 Lumia 920", "Author": "CRiley10", "ReviewID": "R25F3W1GIRBBCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I will say that windows 8 is AMAZING. I had the Nokia Lumia 920 and likes a lot of the personalization features but it lacked my Pandora, pinterest, myfitnesspal, Spotify, and other apps I use daily so I went back to IPhone.NOW, Onto the Lumia 1520. I  had the IPhone 4S. I liked a lot about my iphone but was bored. Seems like since Steve Jobs passing...theres nothing awing about new phones 5, 5c and 5s. Same ol Same ol EXCEPT now...a lot of my apps are always crashing. My wifi isn't that strong in my room, my front camera quit...and it's almost the same as the first iPhone. A lot of good changes but not very many customization features for me. Plus with apple products...EVERYTHING costs.BEFORE PURCHASE:  I decided to get Nokia Lumia 1520 BECAUSE1. Supposedly had many of the apps that I previously could not get on my old Nokia2. More customization with Windows 83. Beautiful Big Screen Like a Tablet4. Amazing Camera by Carl Zeiss5. Mostly...Side by Side comparison that I did with IPhone 5c, 5s and Lumia 1020.(if you can do this side by side comparison which I did on AT&T...I; would do it because it answers a lot of questions and made my decision 100%)6. Ability to Expand storage with the miniSD port7. Ability to get phone in yellow. It was a hard decision between yellow and red because they are both beautifully vibrant but I went with yellow because I love the brighter.UNBOXING:Amazed by color brightness, screen brightness, size and beautiful camera.In the first few days I learned a few more awesome things1. the Lumia now does SnapShot and if you are or have been an iPhone user this is awesome.2. There is a driving mode you can set up with a Bluetooth device to avoid wrecks. No touching phone while driving.3. Some of the apps that were previously said not to be on the windows phones were now there. In face the only thing I do not have that I used a lot was weight watchers...they just have a rinkidink calculator but im sure that will update.4. I can trim videos.5. The live tiles are awesome.Apps that I use a lot that are available that on some reviews were said not to bePinterestSpotifyRdioInstagramAmazonAllrecipesNetflixPandoraMyFitnessPalApp folder (to organize all your apps like IPhone)FREE RINGTONES...NO MORE PAYING FOR THAT CRAPKidsCornerWallet to store credit cardsRun the MapRuntasticVineYouTubeHDI have had this less than a week so I know I will learn more and I will rereview or add to it but my current Conclusion isIf you are looking to upgrade and thinking about trying something new...better camera...more customization with out sacrificing simplicity...live tiles...mostly free apps...free ringtones...driving mode...no sacrificing your current apps, free office, ability to back up on skydrive and at&t; locker....find your phone...ANNNND SOOO MUCH MORE...SWITCH! You wont regret it.Things to know:1. This phone is huge...6 inches. I LOVE IT...some do not. I can see everything beautifully.2. Get a CASE! SERIOUSLY This phone is very slippery on the back. You need some kind of protection and grip to prevent dropping it or if you do to help protect from the fall. *Be carefully applying tight cases...do not press hard on display screen because you can easily distort color on display screen*3. GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR...I recommend armor brand. They have lifetime warranty and less than 10 bucks with amazon free prime shipping.4. If you want smaller phone..you might try Nokia Lumia 1020...better camera and smaller but lacks some of the specs 1520 has.

I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware. My experience of using camera (one of the best cameras in the smartphone and a key differentiator), navigation, reading articles, books, listening to music, watching videos were flawless. I highly recommend to anyone interested in windows platform. This phone is something to definitely checkout!As for a comparative analysis I have laid the specs of other top 2014 phones.

A lot of the apps I do have downloaded, I end up going on the browser to use which defeats the purpose.There is no app or compatiblity for Microsoft Silverlight, a MICROSOFT product, I do not understand! I am going to have to develop one myself, which with my limited coding experience will be time consuming. This phone is definitely for power users only as far as I'm concerned.Basic problems with entering in text on the browser, or the page not loading completely or in a compatible nature are new issues to me after having a samsung for so long. Also I understand that Adobe flash player is being phased out but many websites still use it and you will be unable to view any that have it, aggravating.The main reason I even purchased the phone was for the camera, so I would stop having to carry an extra one around and I must say for that purpose it exceeds expectations. The camera is very easy to use and the colours are true.This is not a phone you can use one handed, it is too large.

I can finally say that, feature wise, it is on par with Android and IOS. That is not to say that it doesn't have shortcomings, it does, but overall it is a feature rich OS with a clean, fresh look. There are very few \"missing\" app on the platform, but any apps that are on WP usually have a superior look and feel to their Android, or IOS counterparts.As far as the phone, Nokia makes the best WP8 phone out there. I have had HTC, and tried Samsungs WP8 phones. I now own a Nokia 920, 1020, and 1520. They are all top notch mobile devices. The 1520 is huge. It has a large 1080p screen that is both bright and clear. Having larger hands, I had no problem holding it and typing with one had, although it is a stretch when typeing long text messages. You will definitely find yourself using two hands.MS has one of the best on screen keyboards out of any of the leading OSes. Add to that kids corner, Onenote (and Office), and you have a winning combination.For someone who is checking email, or on  the internet more than talking on the phone, the large screen size was perfect for me. When I am on the phone, I usually use hands free, so I rarely hold it up to my face. I cant really comment on how comfortable that is.The screen is also easily visible in bright sunlight, a big plus.The device is soft to hold and comes in bright colors, like the red one I purchased. It has scratch resistant glass and I have not had a scratch that you can see on the body yet after multiple months of use without a case.This is the phone to get if you want a true multi-media powerhouse.It may not be great for those looking for a compact device, or have small hands and like \"single handed\" use.I added 32Gs of expandable storage so I can have all of my music in one place.Which brings me to one of the downsides. Xbox music. On W8, it is currently kind of a mess. It works, and at times works really well, but when it doesn't work, it is completely useless. There are times when music playback just stops after every song. Or time when Xbox music refuses to work when you don't have a good cellular/wifi connection. I have been an Xbox music user for a while, and the WP8 app is disappointing. Hopefully, they will improve on it soon.Keep in mind, WP 8.1 is due out in April, which will add amny new features to the OS.

It had a good size, beautiful screen, and was compatible with Windows, both 7 and 8. So I finally decided to accept the ATT offer for a 1520. I might still get the 1020 as a second phone because of its 41 Mpixel camera.Not ever having used a smartphone I am still working on getting acquainted with its possibilities which seem endless. I am impressed with the fact that I can now use the the smartphone on my home WIFI with both my laptop and my desktop. The fact that I can carry all the websites on it just like on my computers is a real plus for me. I am still working on getting a grasp of the potential of facebook.All in all I am very excited about this product and would recommend anyone to look into it.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone until", "Author": "txpressmen", "ReviewID": "R188GSW8OQ9U5P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen cracked cost to fix $400.

Example,  I had to setup web links for thermostat, security, and more.  So far there are no programs that are windows mobile based.  In addition, you do not have separate sound volume controls.  This makes it hard to play Pandora through speakers versus headphones and your notification sounds volume will be the same as your ringer song volume.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone with a few flaws", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1WRBTFKP7TDRU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Out of the box I absolutely fell in love with this phone. The 6\" display is awesome and great for movies or just viewing pleasure in general. I thought it was rather simple to set up out of the box, however the microsoft app store is very limited. A lot of apps that I used on a daily basis were not offered my credit union, adp, candy crush saga, credit karma to name a few. The phone is customizable compared to an iPhone, but not as flexible as an android.The flaws with the phone were that on my first phone: about 3-4 days after my buyers remorse period the phone began to stop charging, then the phone did an update and started charging again. At this point ATT had already sent a replacement phone. Then a few days later it started freezing up and needed manual hard resets, which was getting annoying. So I received the second phone which was a warranty phone that has been hand tested by ATT staff and it is still freezing up.After both of these cases I made the decision to say the heck with Nokia products all together, and get a samsung galaxy S4. I also had problems with charging and connectivity with the nokia lumia 2520 tablet.I rated this product with 3 stars because the phone truly is awesome as far as display, camera, and battery life are concerned. There just seems to be some other issues with the phone. I guess this can happen a lot, as an ATT staff member told me that only 1 in 1,000 phones are actually tested out of the factory.I was leery of the device since it has only been out on the market in the US for about a month, but hopefully other consumers will have better luck with this product, as I continue to have flawless equipment with Samsung, I think I will stick with Samsung.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 1520: Full of Glitches. Impossible to Use", "Author": "Craig Houk", "ReviewID": "R2Y9NUO7Q8CZ7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nokia 1520 back in January of 2014 and the device rarely recognized the charger, so it frequently died. And when it did charge fully, it would die within one or two hours. So I had it replaced. The replacement device was worse. It still had charging issues (not as bad as the first), but the charge did not last as long as the manufacturer and reviewers said it would. The biggest problem with the device is that it would open and close apps without my prompting it to do so. I had minor issues like this with the first one, but the replacement device was so bad that it became nearly unusable. It would vibrate, the screen would \"shake\" and the apps would minimize and then maximize, then open, then close and then move to another app all without my touching the device. Sheer chaos. While this is the sleekest looking large phone on the market with a large screen, it has failed me in so many ways. Hugely disappointed since the specs on the Nokia Lumia 1520 really met my requirements.

Awesome for watching videos and doing anything visually oriented.  The camera is great.  I think I will have to return though because there are too many things I just can't do on this phone (phablet.)  Number one, I cannot access my corporate email (that is due to my employer's restrictions, not WP directly, but nonetheless this is a requirement for my smartphone), and my family is pretty hooked on Google Hangouts, which I cannot access via an app or the web on this device.  Sad!  Less importantly, but annoying nonetheless, the FB interface is just plain strange.I am still giving it 4 stars after all this.  If you are a new smartphone user or are not used to broader functionality, the Shaq size is beyond awesome.  Alas, it won't work for me and even though I would love to keep it as an extra device around the house, I paid the unsubsidized price so cannot justify that... :(", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as expected", "Author": "Harriet Williams \"Harriet K.
