{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Defining the word \"Quality\"", "Author": "E. Byer", "ReviewID": "R3AF2UKGRF5WZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been through hell and back with phones, so forgive me for being pessimistic when I'm standing in the Verizon store wondering what's wrong with each phone they had.  I was ADAMANT that my next phone was going to be the iPhone5 because everyone has jump ship to buy one of these, and quite frankly I love how smooth and responsive my iPod Touch 4g is.  Well to backtrack, I have suffered through the BB 8320, BB 8330, BB Tour....got fed up with how underpowered and outdated they were with TONS of lockups and LONG resets, went to G1, DroidX, Fascinate....got fed up with just soooo many glitches in Android phones I can't believe anybody actually believes they like them...and believe me....as hesitant as I was...I purchased the Blackberry Bold 9930.  Why?  Why not the iPhone5?  For the following reasons:1. IT HAS AN INDICATOR LIGHT!  This technology is so dated that it's CRIMINAL not to include one on every phone manufactured.  If you are like me who is always in quiet environments and can't have ringtones or chimes going off all the time, then this is extremely valuable to you.  With the samsung fascinate I felt I had ADHD constantly checking the damn thing and actually used more battery turning the phone screen on and off.  Also BB has the best notification lights on their products hands down!  DroidX had one but it wasn't very visible.  Love BB for this!2. The BEST...and I mean this....THE BEST BB Keyboard I have every used!  It's soft to the touch, easy to press, extremely responsive, keeps up with you, and is wide enough for my big fat fingers.  BB...if you ever touch this keyboard and change it I will personally come to your headquarters and slap the CEO.  This is the best one ever!  I am so SICK and TIRED of these virtual keyboards I can spit.  I have more errors than I or the device can count, and I spend MORE time correcting one word than typing a new word.3. The screen.  This is where I think people need to wake up and truly assess the screen size.  It's absolutely stunning.  It looks better than a retina display imho, it's 2.8\" but not just that...it's touchscreen....something that I begged and pleaded from BB for as long as I can remember (I think the G1).  Now I can just tap on the icons and simply tap on whatever I choose without a mouse cursor.  Also I thank you BB from the bottom of my heart for keeping the touchpad because you are the ONLY company that I can actually scroll into the middle of a word and delete and replace letters.  I can't stand those stupid touchscreen-only devices when you are typing a text message or web address and you miss a letter and you keep pushing with your index finger trying to get the cursor wedged between two small letters on a small screen.  NEVER AGAIN.  Also people argue \"well you can blow up pictures bigger and view web pages longer.\"  Very true.  But in portrait view, the BB now offers the SAME width as all the other phones...go ahead and compare.  Sure you get some more real estate in Landscape...but to me it's still a 3.5 - 4\" screen and I wouldn't trade a BB keyboard for anything in the world!4. FAST.  I MEAN...FAST.  This thing keeps up with every button I press and every icon I tap.5. Battery life is good.  Honestly I'm not jumping out of my seat saying \"I can't believe how long this lasts.\"  It does last a long time (I'd say about 6-10 hrs depending on real usage) but no better nor worse than the competitors.  Gotta power that gorgeous display somehow right ;).6. 5mp Camera is nice.  The flash is great to have, but the pictures aren't as natural as a real camera flash.  I'm being picky, but I tell it like it is.  I really don't know what the iPhone camera flash is like, but I do know the pictures are crisp and clear on that phone.  These pics seem great to me as well, but I have yet to send one to someone to see how it looks on their phone.7. Design: Quite frankly I don't know what everyone is bickering about on the blogs, but apparently this Bold \"look\" has been replayed for a couple of years now.  What I say to that is: If it ain't broke don't fix it.  It's the most popular selling BB phone RIM sells next to the AT&T; Torch, it looks gorgeous to me (I love the metal all around the sides and the carbon fiber look to the back cover), so they could sell me the same looking phone in 6 yrs and I'd still buy it.  How many times do you watch your favorite movie over and over again knowing it won't change when you watch it?  What about the iPhone?  Black front, shiny back every time...still looks gorgeous (can't fault them for that).8. Speaker, speaker, mic, and vibration: You have to hear it to believe it.  The speaker on this phone is very loud and clear up to 85% volume (I notice more distortion past that).  I dare you right now to go find a speaker that beats this...go ahead...I will wait.  I have had one too many phones in my day and this one is the loudest and \"clearest\" relatively speaking of the bunch.  The way I test a speaker volume is to try it out in the store in a noisy environment.  If I can still hear the music AND it sounds good, then that is a good speaker.  All the devices out there can't match it.  Sorry but it's true.  The next speaker is the earset.  Sounds crisp and clear.  Something my Samsung Fascinate apparently knew nothing about (muffled, crappy, distorted).  The mic picks up my voice very well and people have commented ever since I got the phone that I sound clearer.  The vibrator on this phone is adequate and noticeable on a desk, but I still have trouble with it in my pocket (like every other phone on the market....they were meant to be worn on belts).9. Comes with a leather case...and a high quality one.  I always loved buying a BB for one of these.  It has the swivel clip so you can orient it on your belt as you please.I could go on and on about this but I'll stop here.  I RARELY write reviews unless I am in love with a product and THIS is a product I love.  I highly recommend it and if you have any questions my name is Ed at optomechesst@aim.com.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware...Check 1 Star reviews before you buy!!!", "Author": "E.K.", "ReviewID": "R1BL5G02XFACTY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a new BB 9930 GSM unlocked phone from seller.  When it arrived I bought a temp AT&T; sim card to test it before leaving for Africa.  Glad I did, since the BB had many problems like the keys sticking, international apps did not work, and very poor connections with the GSM.  I emailed the seller for a return and refund.  Seller said OK.  Seller received the phone on a Monday and signed for it at the post office.  Then on Wednesday the seller says I need to send him the tracking number since he had not received it yet.  I filed an insurance claim with the PO and later that day the PO where seller lives called me up to say seller indeed signed for the package on that Monday.Since it was a week now without a refund I filed a complaint claim with Amazon.  Seller was now forced to refund my money...he did minus 15% restocking fee of $54.45.  I said to him and Amazon that is not fair since the phone he sold me was defective.  Apparently Amazon A to Z Garantee Program really works...in the end I got back my $54.45 along with the $45.00 I paid for overnight shipping.Thank you Amazon for helping an old and satisfied customer out. Next time I buy I will first look at all the 1 Star ratings a seller has...1Star reviews hold a wealth of information about the product and the seller.  Forget those glowing 5 Star reviews and concentrate on the 1 Star...you'll be glad you did.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Step in the right direction for RIM....", "Author": "Quentin Gerlach \"IT Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3J2JIF20OGIVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel for you Verizon customers who have been waiting to upgrade your Blackberries - especially if you wanted a touchscreen BB.  Since RIM never released the Torch 9800 for CDMA users, you guys never got to experience that goodness.  Surprising since the Torch is (was now, with the release of the Torch 2 and the new 9850 for Verizon) one of the few decent releases from RIM in the past couple of years.  Anywho - with the 9930 Bold, those who were left out finally have a reason to upgrade their phones.For those of you who are wondering - this is NOT the Monaco phone that RIM plans on releasing soon.  That phone is fully touchscreen - designed to replace the much hated Storm and not too much better Storm 2.Ok, so some list of changes that RIM brought about:- With the release of this Bold, RIM decided to nicely go back to the old style Bold 9000 keyboard.  The keys are a bit bigger, so for those of you whose fingers might have been too big for the Bold 2 that was released for Verizon, I urge you to give this phone's keyboard a try - you'll be pleased.  Some of you may notice the dimensions of the 9930 and the 9700 are very close, so you might wonder how they got the keyboard bigger.  Well, they did it by getting rid of the plastic lining around the sides of the phone.  Yes - both the keyboard and screen are now flush with the edge of the phone.  I'm not sure I'm a fan of this, as it makes it a whole lot easier to crack/break something important, but it seems to be a direction most phone manufacturers are moving in, so we'll see....- This phone is the first to have the new 7 OS - which is nice, but I think I'd rather have the QNX OS, thank you very much...  Haha - but it is a good OS - for those who are interested, it takes up less space than 6.  If my calculations are correct - about 15% less.  This OS also supports NFC (near-field communication), so it'll be interesting to see what kind of apps developers create to take advantage of it. (For those who remember it - NFC is how Google Wallet works) Voice search also works particularly well with this OS, and two new business apps are included, called BlackBerry Protect and Balance. Protect allows your business to remotely monitor, configure and wipe, if necessary, a remote smartphone so when the phone disappears, your whole business life doesn't disappear along with it. And Balance separates business tasks from personal stuff on a BlackBerry, which helps avoid the possibility of confidential data accidentally being sent to all those shady contacts.....- Yes, the screen is touch capable.  It's actually pretty slick - especially considering how small the screen is, comparatively speaking, so it is usable in day to day operations.  It especially works well with the browser - for all those times you need to move the page around, or zoom in on something, or zoom out to get a better view of the entire page.  Are you going to play games with it??  Most likely not.  But it is a start.- \"Liquid Graphics Technology\": there's been alot of talk about this, and what exactly does RIM mean by it.  Here's what I can tell you, from my research and usage of the phone:  RIM basically put a separate graphics processor into the phone, which means that any of the graphics stuff should be a whole lot smoother and cleaner, since there's a distinct chip handling all of it.  From what I've seen, it is pretty fluid, but it still does get hung up at times - especially when it comes to certain web pages.  But overall, definitely an improvement.  I heard it's also designed to support 3D animations and games...Alright - enough of that.  Time for the good stuff - is it worth it??Short answer - absolutely.Pros:1) Battery life rocks.  I feel for all of you iPhone and Android users whose phones die in like a day.  This phone still keeps kicking after 2 days - without plugging it in once.  Add to that the ability to actually change your battery, and that I tend to carry a spare just in case, and I can go practically a week without having to charge my phone.  Incredible....2) Faster processor.  Thank you RIM, for finally adopting a processor that breaks the 1 GHz marker in a phone!  Actually RIM upgraded a bunch of hardware - like the memory, along with the ability to do NFC communications.  Thank you for reaching the 21st century RIM - we're happy to have you!3) Global phone - this phone supports both the GSM and CDMA networks, so it can be used internationally - a big plus for our corporate employees.  If you happen to travel internationally alot - don't worry, this phone's got you covered.4) Hotspot capable - this phone I believe is the first BB to natively support hotspots.  Yes, there are apps you can download for the other phones, but you usually have to pay a decent amount (the cheapest I can remember is around 35 - 40 bucks)  This supports personal hotspot right out the box, and it does support N-type speeds.Cons:1) Apps.  Actually - it's not what you think.  It's not about the amount of apps - it's that quite a few don't work with OS 7 right now.  Though this will be corrected as the OS matures and becomes more available.2) Screen resolution - which still comes in at 640x480 pixels and 287 dpi.  It's not bad - but I was hoping to get a qHD screen on a BB soon....3) No 4G - this does annoy me greatly.  4G, especially on Verizon, is starting to get decent, and to not have that ability on this phone??  I get the fact that it's a battery hog, but with BB battery life's so good as it is, I can't imagine it detracting from it that much.Honestly - what's been holding RIM back is their lack of upgrading the hardware.  They always seem to be a year behind the phones of the present.  They finally do some catching up with the 9930.I'll update this review as I use the phone more - feel free to ask questions or correct me, since I'm sure I forgot something!!", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best PHONE ever", "Author": "Daniel J. Kinem", "ReviewID": "R1RFDD7UEPSAMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was contract renewal time, so visions of new phones for myself and my family danced through my head. I'd been pouring over every detail of the droid phones and the iPhone. My 14 year old son asked...\"Aren't they running out of things for phones to do?\" I laughed, but then I thought about his question.It's a loaded question and I knew what he was getting at. The silliness of the phone 'pissing contest' with all the youtube videos comparing one to another. The giant screens. Useless gimmicks like `Siri'I decided to stop, take a breath, and decide what I truly needed in a PHONE. I had 160 apps on my Droid and I literally used about 10-15 of those. The rest were part of the 'pissing contest' (\"Hey, do you see what my phone can do!? Bro-stache! Voice warping software! 3D games!\")I needed 100% accuracy in texts and emails. Clear phone calls. At least a workdays worth of battery life (10 hours of heavy usage). Contacts and calendar sync with gmail. `To do' list. The ability to handle multiple email accounts, including Exchange. A simple, decent camera. Medical apps like Epocrates. Music apps like Pandora, Shazaam, Slacker radio. Utilities like Evernote, Dropbox. You get the idea. Mostly as a functioning phone, a real phone with organizing tools, but with a few entertainment things.First let me say that it is truly a beautiful phone. Slim, sleek, stunning design. One of the best LOOKING phones ever. The touch screen is vivid, crisp, and clear.Now, about my `needs' from my PHONE.Accuracy. I am a physican at a busy hospital and we communicate with each other EXTENSIVELY via text throughout the day. The main problem I'd had with my Droid Incredible was the virtual keyboard. If I spent an hour a day texting, literally 15 minutes of that time would be erasing incorrect 'auto corrections'. My thumbs will never get smaller, I will always hit the wrong keys on a virtual keyboard. I had several keyboards on the Droid with very sophisticated prediction software, learning the words I used most, etc. It will never be good enough. iPhone keyboard is far worse, with absolutely horrid options for customization. Blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing I've ever typed on. I've never used a BB before but I took to it instantly.Instead of BB's stupid Bold commercial showing bicyclists with glow-in-the-dark wheels driving around, they need to show me at the hospital smashing my virtual keyboard phone against the wall....then cut away to me smiling as I discover what typing on a phone can be like. Stunning. If texting, emailing, and accuracy are important to you, don't underestimate this keyboard as it truly separates this phone from anything else available.Clear, loud phone calls. EXCELLENT noise reduction. People hear me and I hear them. Perfect.Battery is decent. BB users are not thrilled because they are spoiled with 2 days of use in their old, slow, no feature phones. This thing is fast, with a brilliant screen, and it needs juice. I am thrilled with it because I come from the land of Droid where you have to charge the phone multiple times per day. It gets me through long days. I bought the extra battery with dual charger from Amazon, but I have not had to use the second battery yet. There's a HUGE extended battery available, but it makes it look nuts. Some people don't mind, but I love the sleek look, so I will never get that.Syncs with gmail, contacts, calendar. Not as smoothly/thoroughly as Droid devices, of course, but it works very well.Multiple email accounts no problem. POP, IMAP, Exchange.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the camera! It doesn't have `auto focus' it has some sort of way to focus on everything at the same time. Forget what they call it? IT DOES NOT TAKE CLOSE-UP PICTURES WELL! So, if you are buying your phone with a need for close-up photos, this phone will not suit you. The dedicated camera key is soooo convenient. Why is this not on every phone? Fast, clear, fun to take pictures.BB app world has an atrocious set up. It's confusing, some apps are not represented in BB app world, you have to go to the developer web site to get many programs, app world constantly signs you out when you are browsing on the computer, etc. But most of the major apps are available, and they work fine. Everything I need is available. You too will be fine with apps, it will just take a little digging. App world needs some work.OH, one of the things I love the absolute most about this phone is the INSTANT UNIVERSAL SEARCH! Start typing and the phone starts searching your apps, your texts/emails, contacts, etc for matches. You can set it up so it searches just the things you want it to search. It's amazing and it's INSTANT. It's better than iPhone's swipe (that's already an extra step), and type (on the virtual keyboard that sucks), and it includes INSTANT WEB SEARCHES AS YOU TYPE VIA BING!! Amazing. (As an aside, I love google search and I think you can set it to that, but I'm finding Bing's TV commercials are pretty accurate. I'm getting too much irrelevant information on google. Bing is pretty impressive.)I suggest you sit down and write out what you need from your phone. This BB will NEVER beat iPhone and the latest Droids for speed, apps, screen size, gaming. But, it doesn't need to because it's a better PHONE.Love this phone. My wife got the Galaxy Nexus as did one of my sons. My other boy got an iPhone 4S. I feel that my choice is a better actual functioning phone. I LOVE IT. However, I won't win the `pissing contest' as they are downloading the latest 3D Magic 8-ball app.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy if you know how to about it", "Author": "Babatunde T Sobowale", "ReviewID": "R39UBBQ6UDP14W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone is unlocked but not fully, had to pay extra $20 to get it fully unlocked, that is nothing for the price I paid for the phone.

Sellers should not fraudulently decsribed products in order to attract customers and when purchased will be USELESS to the customer. This phone is useless to me and worst of it, I had wasted my money again to set plan with T-MOBILE which had been lost since the fault is NOT theirs, I can't get refund.I am so unhappy and sad by this development. Worst still the return policy of the phone expired on the 1st of September. The loss to me is monumental. Loosing the money used to buy the phone including cost of delivery, the cost to service providers and lack of communciation including the time spent on trouble shooting and leaving my business, just because the product was fraudulently described.

But I am staying with BB for what it is well known for in the business world, security and reliability in an enterprise server environment. Plus I don't care much for a touch screen phone. I love a physical keyboard on a phone and this BB has the best one ever. The new blackberry has an awesome touch screen and a fast processor. No longer you have to wait to switch from app to app. One thing I don't care is the old auto re-start feature when you delete or add certain (or most) of the software apps. I hope they fix this old with the upcoming updates. As of now, app world sucks. Apple beats BB hands down when it comes to iTunes, videos and an App store. None of what iPhone is made for is of use for me. Apple makes great products and I have many apple products at home (i.e. ipod, ipad, macbook etc). But I prefer a BB for a secure and reliable comm device. I am sure iPhone users wont agree with that statement. But hey, thats what review is all about, expressing your personal viewpoint and experience with a certain product. My wife uses a iPhone and she loves it and uses it for what it is made for.

I will not give it 5 starts just for the facts above.However, let me set the record straight here: if I need to do anything that required more processor power, I will use my computer, not my smart phone. It is supposed to be a phone first and foremost.I'm not into the bleeding cutting edge and there is wisdom on building on what had worked. Maybe BB has understood that Apple and HTC will be the game players when it comes to carving up the next big thing. Instead, maybe BB has elected to focus on the two things that a smartphone is suppose to do first.Call quality = 5 stars because this sucker just does not drop calls. The Iphone does and HTP thunderbold gets confused at timesEmail= This guy is above and beyond and sitting with comfort ahead of the pack. Issues have been reported with BBS and Exchange sync but the details of the issues still need to be ironed out.battery life = Again great.Everything else works well and the features that actually made me buy the phones are:1- My old Nokia N95 died after 3 years of faithful service. The bold 9930 kindly accepted the sim card from my old phone and allows me to take my personal call on the Tmobile GSM network.2-My work number is on the cdma network and allows me to communicate with clients and the office between 10AM and 7 PM 5 days well.The phone works everywhere on the planet and I'm a globe trotter by excellence.Therefore, I have 2 numbers on a phone which never drops calls, and never seems to run out of battery.

The blackberry is controlled with volume and track selection of the car stereo. Pandora can be piped to the car stereo via the blackberry bluetooth.9. Facebook works great with the device.

A larger screen for viewing of websites.11. The task list, calender features are phenomenal compared to android/google. The sync features do not drop from outlook to the device. Gmail calender drops.

(also SETUP tips)", "Author": "Craig Marco Polo", "ReviewID": "R360E9IDHPZZDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought three unlocked smartphones (on Amazon) to use and evaluate: Samsung Galaxy 4, Nokia 920, and Blackberry 9930. After six months experience, here are my thoughts.I have relied heavily on my PC and a dumb cell phone for more than 20 years, but I finally decided to get a smartphone.As a user I like the Samsung least in terms of its user interface and focus on advertising stuff. The Nokia 920 has a brilliant screen and the best graphics for games and movies.  But as a communicator, the BB 9930 is the best!To quote a line from the movie Star Wars regarding the Millennium Falcon, \"it's got it where it counts\". If your focus for a phone is (1) phone calls, (2), SMS, and (3) email, then Blackberry 9930 (also 9900) is the best. Virtually no advertising fluff is imposed on the user.As I said, I wanted a phone, first and foremost. However, you might be interested to know that it is also a brilliant MP3 player.Here is some other information which I hope some readers find helpful.P. S. My service provider is Telna, which I have used for years. Their pay-as-you-go, no-subscription-contract (for voice, SMS, and data) is brilliantly cost-effective! Their GSM sim card interfaces perfectly in the Blackberry 9900/9930.P. P. S. I read the reviews of some users who have encountered SETUP PROBLEMS. As I said above, I have an unlocked Blackberry 9930, an unlocked Nokia 920 and an unlocked Samsung Galaxy 4, all purchased from Amazon. Please be aware that all unlocked phones have setup challenges that will be \"learning curve\" for the new buyer. Here is some help for the BB 9930/9900.I believe most of my comments below would apply to 9900, but please be aware that the 9900 does not support CDMA; the 9930 is both GSM and CDMA capable.If you are getting the \"ACTIVATION REQUIRED\" message at the top of a Verizon BB 9930 that is supposed to unlocked, the message is misleading. I eliminated this message as follows.There is a CDMA screen for the 9930. You can access it by dialing ##000000 from your Blackberry 9930, which will take you to the \"CDMA Service Edit Screen\", where you can edit some settings.Edit the \"Mobile Directory Number\" there (it may be blank or the some vestigial Verizon phone number) and enter your phone number that you are using with your SIM card. This eliminates the \"Activation Required\" heading at the top. Be careful not to change anything else on this screen.INTERNET BROWSING is accomplished as follows.First, you must specify your APN for your service provider. My service provider is Telna, and their service is very cost competitive and works very well with the BB 9930.Goto to 'Options' on the Home screen.Goto to 'Device'.Goto to 'Advanced System Settings'.Goto to 'TCP IP'.Enable \"APN Settings\".Specify \"APN: \" with the URL from your service provider.In my case I did not check \"APN Authentication Enabled:\".You probably should leave blank \"Username for APN:\" and \"password for APN:\"Browsing the internet works quite well as follows:(1) Use the native BB browser for web access via wifi; the BB browser will refuse to connect over GSM.(2) Use Opera Mini for web access over GSM; Opera Mini will refuse to connect over wifi. Install app \"Opera Mini\" as a browser using \"Blackberry World\". Note, you must be connected by wifi to use \"Blackberry World\". Search for and install \"Opera Mini\".(3) To minimize data charges, I keep \"Data Services\" turned off. I turn it on only when I want Opera Mini to use GSM, and incur data charges. From the Home screen, goto \"Manage Connections\", \"Network and Connections\", \"Mobile Network\", and adjust the setting for \"Data Services\".BLACKBERRY 9930 MANUALThe online manual is excellent.

Do not get this model!", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R13DFD8GIDPMX6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I thought I was getting a new phone, but it was a used one.  That was fine as it looked to be in very good condition.The phone said it was unlocked, and it was to a degree.  When I put my SIM in it did not work, and I finally found out I had to \"reset the phone number\" which took about an hour of digging around on the internet (eventually leading to the last six steps on this page [...]).If you are on AT&T;, and you have a data plan, do not buy this phone.  That is what I have, and the best this phone will do is connect via 'edge' - 3G does *not* work with this model on the AT&T; network.  Even with edge, I can not browse the internet or get email - that only works when the phone is connected via WiFi.Speaking of which, the default email application doesn't work because it requires some kind of \"Enterprise Activation\" key.  Knowing your IMAP settings doesn't matter, as you can not even access the email application without this mystery key.  There are a number of features of the phone that will not work without doing some kind of setup with your service provider and none of them work on AT&T; (visual voice mail, email, maps, etc).Pros...So, aside from all that, I am actually somewhat happy with the phone.  I've been trying to minimize my life, and using this as just a phone (and SMS device) is very nice.  I found a 3rd party application called \"logic mail\" that allows me to send and receive mail, and the browser works pretty well (again, this only works on WiFi, but for me this is kind of a feature).The battery life on it is *fantastic*.  It's been years since I only had to charge my phone once or twice a week.I am hoping to take some trips overseas soon, and hopefully it will work on overseas networks - one of the main reasons I bought it.The keyboard is nice, and getting around the OS (I was specifically looking for something that wasn't Android) is intuitive enough.All in all, I wouldn't buy it again, but I don't hate it enough to return it.After that, the phone worked as a phone, but none of the other features worked as I needed some sort of blackberry \"Enterprise Application\" email and password", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Thai", "ReviewID": "R25AN63F7X8VXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The blackberry is a very nice phone if you looking for a simple phone to get your business done , this phone I bought bran new but I think it was refurbish and market as new but I like it ..", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Right Buy", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R3PUDPNAH965X6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A perfect blend of the new touch screen technology and balance of the business model.

It strikes a great balance between touch screen capabilities and physical keyboard. The 9930 is absolutely beautiful, I don't know how else to describe it. It looks like it was designed to the ultimate executive. The keyboard is awesome to use. I've had a Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Iphone 5 and Iphone 4S this year. While the 9930 does not have the specs of those phones, the Blackberry OS7  integrates so well with the phone hardware that you won't notice any lags in performance. You're not going to be able to play Infinity Gauntlet or any of the higher-powered games, but chances are you don't really care about that if you're looking at a Blackberry 9930. The 9930 is amazing at what it's supposed to do, which is a communication device. It's not pretentious.If the iPhone is the Lexus of smartphones, and the Galaxy S series is the Mercedes, then I would say Blackberry is the Audi of Smartphones.

You either love them or you hate them.  Those IPhone users that give me a hard time for still having a blackberry would never like ANY blackberry no matter how great it was.  And those of us who have a blackberry know its limitations compared to an IPhone. So I'm assuming that if you are considering the 9930, you already know that you prefer the Blackberry over and IPhone or any other device, and this review is geared toward you.To summarize for those of you who may not have ever had a blackberry and are considering one ~Pros of a Blackberry:BBM - Instant text messaging over the network to other blackberry users that is fast (instant), reliable, and FREE.. even internationally.  I love this because I have a lot of friends overseas that have blackberries and it enables me to communicate with them easily and free. You can create groups, and share photos... it is by far my favorite part of a blackberry.KEYBOARD - I love love love the real keyboard and cannot stand a touch screen keyboard.WORKING - Great for corporate email, stuff comes in fast/instantaneous and you can actually look at work documents on it in a functional way.Cons:WEB BROWSING - Pretty much sucks. It will never compare to an IPhone. But, on the 9930, it is so much immproved over an other blackberry that I've had that you can definitely web browse on it when you need to, I just don't think you sit there and browse the web on it just for fun.TOUCH SCREEN - If you are into that. This blackberry does have a touch screen but it's not great.APPS - Not as many apps as on an IPhone, and they aren't updated for bugs as frequently.Bottom Line - If you are a blackberry person and use it for things like I do, this is the best one out there and the best one that I've ever had. It does come closer than any other Berry to matching the competencies of an IPhone, but it will never be quite there... but having its own competencies that an IPhone lacks.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impecabil", "Author": "horotan liviu", "ReviewID": "R196V76DKZXPNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product it's the best, like the sealer present it. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "not what i ordered", "Author": "ViviCh", "ReviewID": "R1MA4PLCMJBZ51", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone does not work in 3G so don't buy it.

DAY \"Water Buffalo\"", "ReviewID": "R9TDGWWKOGVXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are no bells and whistles - this is (or was in my case) a Verizon branded BB 9930, it came in a plastic case that initially made me think that it was a refurbished unit but it was not. There was a refurbished cleaning cloth in the package but everything else including most importantly the telephone itself was new. So far I couldn't be happier and I am glad that I removed myself from the cycle of iPhones and endless Androids that were neither good phones, nor were they particularly good at doing email, sms, etc.. The phone quality is as I remember on my old BB's and being able to type an email without having to hit backspace a million times per sentence is a god send. If you are a professional or someone that does not need 400 different applications that tell you how to make cocktails, or a few hundred games that you play once if that and you just want a phone that gets the job done you are looking at it. It is just an all around good device, the app store is no iTunes, don't kid yourself but you can get your hands on most of the apps that you need.In any case the seller of this phone delivered as promised, it replaces a series of iPhones, an HTC Thunderbolt, a 4G Samsung (I forgot the model), and even though it is 3G I have not looked back. It is definitely Verizon branded and I would hesitate if you want a truly unlocked phone - I can not speak to that. It did however have a Vodaphone/Verizon sim in it and when I powered it up identified itself as an AT&T; network phone.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sirvio perfectmanete en Venezuela!", "Author": "Carlos Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1VQZ04G8A1RX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lo compro mi hermano y sirvio perfectmanete en digitel de Venezuela.

English is the universal language of the internet.The product is great. It's my first \"smartphone\" ever. I have big fingers, yet no problems with the keypad. I really like the keypad vs. touchscreen. Sending over 3 sentences on a touch screen is a pain in the ass. The Blackberry 9930 is one of the best choices for communicating online via messaging.#1 thing I've noticed: call voice clarity. Wow. It sounds like a land-line. The voice on the other end sounds as if I'm in a radio broadcast station, using high end audio equipment in an acoustically paneled room. This is likely one of the clearest and warm sounding phones on the market.The screen is extremely responsive. No lag whatsoever. Holds a charge very well (even with WiFi \"ON\").Still exploring the many uses this phone offers. It's a great triumph in human civilization to build such great devices.

Unacceptable.Then there's the atrociously designed (search doesn't even really work) and underwhelming Blackberry App-World - clearly developers have forsaken the entire platform, including Google (an ancient version of google maps).I am pretty sure I'm within my rights to expect squared up geometry and non-flimsy, rock solid buttons, but apparently RIM can't compete in the build-quality area anymore, and these things cost too much for anything less than perfect.The camera lacks auto-focus, another critical error, although it still beats Motorola cameras (which ain't sayin' much).THE SELLERS:Try #1:  bought from PhoneEtc. Phone was on Verizon's lost/stolen list and they wouldn't activate it. Hey wait but this was supposed to be NEW. Missing the SIM also.Try #2: bought from BlueTekUSA: generic non-original box, missing THE HOLSTER (they really must think I'm an idiot), missing the SIM, and they actually had the nerve to try and put in a charger that doesn't come with this phone and didn't even have the USB/data cable functionality.Stay away from these scammers.

Combines the best of both worlds into a fast responsive phone. Sharp exterior styling cues utilizing brushed aluminum and carbon fiber accents that feel like a high quality phone. Screen resolution and touch screen response is excellent. Call quality and reception is above average with a Pretty good speaker phone. It will only become slightly distorted at the highest volume setting. However was very pleased to discover the mic will still pick up your voice with the aux plugged into a car stereo and the call playing through the car's speakers. Battery life is measured in days, not hours with moderate to frequent use and the expandable/removable micro-sd card is a great bonus allowing for up to an additional 32 gb of memory. On the downside the camera is just OK, perhaps the only area where the 9650 is superior. Limited app and developer support is a drawback, however core app such as news app, traffic/navigation, banking, music and sports apps are both plentiful and powerful. Worthy for consideration over an iphone or android if you place a premium on a phone with a keyboard and value security. Blackberry protect allows the user to locate the phone on a map using the built in gps, lock or wipe data as well as force the phone to ring aiding in locating the phone regardless if the phone is set to silent. In closing, a great upgrade to previous bolds with the addition of mobile hotshot capabilities, near field communication, expanded blackberry bridge features and a larger screen. I was on the fence for a few months on whether or not to upgrade (and whether to cave and join the iphone ranks) but in the end I am very pleased with the phone and its capabilities And speed compared to my previous 9650. Applications run and open without any lag and the experience for the user is very crisp. Revised coding on the browser has resulted in noticeably quicker load times for web pages.

I, however, am an iphoner. For me it is a no-brainer. I'm not an app addict or a chronic downloader or an obnoxious over texter/sharer narcissistic social media exhibitionist. I just like the intuitive design. Everything on the iphone for me is logical. The buttons are easy to push, typing is easy, thinks are where your brain things they belong.And now I find that in switching jobs I had to turn in my iphone for this, um, thing.

But unless you have an abnormally large hand, you cannot hold the phone and reach all the way across with one hand so you are huddling over it with two thumbs. Truly all thumbs. I hate dialing any numbers, and forget about texting.3) As if tiny buttons were not enough, buttons share numbers and letters. The default is set to letters so you can't just start typing ina number to place a call. You have to pick up the phone button, then start punching things in.4) MAKE UP YOUR MIND BE A TOUCH SCREEN OR BE A QWERTY.I have not found all of the sucky aspects but I am sure there will be more.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "total loss with this product", "Author": "AA", "ReviewID": "ROFDI98XLIMLG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first i would encounter problems hearing the caller.

I am waiting for the day that I can upgrade to the new iPhone or android. If you are young, and you don't have a job, or lifestyle that requires you to be constantly sending and or receiving emails, and that only, this is not the phone for you.  On the other hand, if you do need a phone solely for business, and it is more high tech than the old blackberries, than this is the phone for you!What I hate about this phone is that, compared to the androids and iPhone's, there are not many social media outlets, and when I get bored there are no games that I can play. Yes, I am young, and I would like to play a game or two in the middle of a lecture.Games and social Medias are not the only horrible thing about the apps; all of the apps that are compatible with blackberries do not work very well. I once bought a map app, and it was horrible. The connection was slow, and unreliable, and I got lost in a neighborhood. After getting that app I just got the two social media's that I wanted, Twitter and Facebook, which are still very slow, and never returned to the blackberry app store. I can never trust any app to come out of there.Another Con of the phone would be that when you take video's, you cannot send them in any type of message, such as email and text, only straight onto YouTube, which is a horrible setting because you may not have a YouTube account, or may not want your videos to be on the internet.The keyboard. Yes, sure, there is a touch screen, but there is not a keyboard on that touchscreen, and the keyboard that is built onto the phone is tiny. But when trying to type on this; it took me months to learn how to hold the phone correctly. The buttons were made for babies, they are too small, and the only way to get a message to another person is to use the very tip of your thumb nail. If you want a phone that is easier to type, and not have to twist your mind and body to try and send a simple message out, do not get this phone. Another con of this horrible phone is that the internet connection also is horrible. You may have the best connection in the world, and it still won't upload the page, or information you need from the internet because it takes 5 minutes for everything to load. And once everything is loaded and the phone knows what it is doing, the checkers pop up on the screen, which means that the phone is still trying to upload more information from the website. The Wi-Fi connection is horrible. It may speed up some of the internet searching, but ultimately it still take a few minutes, instead of moments for the website to fully upload.Sure, the phone can be great if you are a business person, who only needs a smart phone to send emails quickly and efficiently, but other than that this phone is a piece of crap, and I do not recommend any person to get this phone.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defect on Blackberry 9930", "Author": "Eleazar", "ReviewID": "RXX4QN1ZN7YZ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good nigth.I am writting to ask for a solution or warranty for my Blackberry 9930 bougth on september, 2011.
