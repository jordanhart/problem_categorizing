{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Storm 2 is a pretty good phone", "Author": "T. Ehlert", "ReviewID": "R30YAINDLX4UZK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After experiencing problems with the original Blackberry Storm, Verizon eventually upgraded me to the Storm 2.  I have to say that, for the most part, I have been satisfied with this phone.  The touchscreen keyboard is only functional for me when it is in the wider landscape mode.  When I try to type in the portrait mode, my fingers cannot hit the correct keys simply from the standpoint of spacing.  The keys are just too close together.  The one issue I experience consistently is when I try to hit the \"a\" button I instead get a \"q\" which I do find frustrating.  From the standpoint of overall ease of use, this phone is pretty simple to operate.  A good number of apps are available including internet based radio from Slacker, Pandora, and i-Heart radio.  You can use an aux cable to connect the phone to your car's radio and play these stations through your sound system.  The calendar function, contacts, and e-mail all work extremely well on this phone.  Occasionally, the phone does freeze which requires a soft reset by removing the battery.  For whatever reason, these issues seem to have been minimized over the past six months or so.  After a somewhat rough start with the Storm line of phones, I would now have to say that I do enjoy the Storm 2.June '11:  As an update, I continue to use the Storm 2 and it has now been better than a year.  Like most Blackberry devices, it does a wonderful job with e-mail.  If you have multiple e-mail accounts, it is simple to add each to your phone.  This in itself has made my life much easier.  From the standpoint of downloading free apps, I have recently experienced difficulty with two new apps.  In short, after downloading each, my phone gets stuck on the agreement screen where you have to check the box.  I solved this problem by deleting the apps.  My guess is that one of the Blackberry updates does not work well with these apps or I have a conflict with an old one.  Like anything Blackberry, I do find that these devices are simply not very intuitive.  Instead, you almost have to think in a Blackberry sort of way and I do find that frustrating.  For example, if you would like to make a simple change to your phone's settings, you really have to spend a few minutes playing around with the Options menu to figure out how to do this.  With all of this said, sometime next year I do plan to switch to a new phone and it probably won't be a Blackberry.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "The phone I bought from Mojos Closet was suppose to new.....it's Not", "Author": "Eliyah Ben Yehudah", "ReviewID": "R25P35XFMGVSJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought what was supposed to be an unlocked blackberry storm 2 from Mojos Closet.

It took me 6 months before I couldn't stand it any more.- I would avoid this phone if you are thinking of buying it. -The \"click\" screen is gimmicky, and tremendously painful to use when it's acting up.When it's working right I can see why it was a design decision - it is an interesting concept, but I can not understand how this product possibly made it through engineering and testing.Issues that you will experience when you own this phone:1) The screen will double and triple click on you2) The screen will fail to register where your finger is touching. Touching the bottom right of the screen will highlight the buttons in the top left3) One or more of the electric click sensors in your screen (one at each corner) will stick down. Failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard you press. If all 4 corners go at once, the screen is unusable, and you need to pull your battery.4) Your click sensors will strangely start clicking themselves when your finger is nowhere near it. I had a condition happen multiple times where the phone, laying on my desk would click and unclick rapidly, like it was vibrating. This continued for a half-hour before it ran out my battery.Before anyone comments that \"your phone was defective\" - I brought it into a Verizon store, and they told me that it was normal behavior for this phone, and RIM recommended that a battery pull be performed every other day to reboot the phone, and clear up issues like this.

But it lasted only until I got the phone. Setting up the phone was not so straight forward. Not because of the UI or anything, but  RIM's much touted implementation of touch screen. While every other touch screen implementation is a \"touch screen\", RIM's implementation is a combination of touch and click. So if you want to click a button, the touch will select the button and pressing again to click will trigger a real press on the button. While in theory this can save the user from unwanted clicks, the main issue with this is that the click doesn't work really well in every part of the screen. Especially when you have a button on top left corner, clicking that will take all the energy you have. I almost felt like I will break the screen. The clicks on the center of the screen as smooth enough so its not a big deal for most buttons. Except when you use keyboard. I really dont know how a company like RIM is allowing such a product to be released to the market when such a big usability issue exists.the next big problem with the phone is with the network service. While it supports data via Wifi and 2g/3g networks, I dont see an option to force the phone to use only the Wifi network for data. ( Or at least this is not so intuitive if such an option exist).Installing and using apps also was not so simple. I downloaded and installed Google Talk, and on trying to login, it keeps giving me a message that The service is not enabled for this phone. I am not sure what this means at all.  For comparison, I have done this on an Andriod phone and that was pretty straight forward.  No issues at all..In short, If you are a techie who wants some adventure ( really?? There are so many better ways to get the thrill than setting up and using a phone). Stay away from this.Or if you need enterprise email etc and have an IT department to help you setup this for you, then you may consider this. Or else never even think of it. Android is way better for the common man.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "below expectations", "Author": "Tony He", "ReviewID": "R3HAMXZEWFMB72", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, for a long time blackberry user coming from a hardware keyboard to a touch screen, I find it miserable dealing with blackberry storm 2 touch screen keyboard.

Verizon version is unlockable so you can take it international or switch to T-Mobile or AT&T; (but they stink, so forget that). SurePress screen is perfect for someone such as myself who has had a hard time adapting to touch-screen technology. 3G signal is typically outstanding in NYC area where I live. Phone is reliable. I have dropped it (in an Otterbox case) dozens of time and it has yet to have any damage.Cons: Old and no 4G. Out of date OS software. SurePress screen slowly grows stiff. Not a lot of aps. No longer manufactured.Other Thoughts: My Storm2 is now 28 months old. It has taken a beating and keep on ticking. The SurePress screen has slowly grown a bit stiffer, but I just play with the adjustments to get it back to the way i want. Sometimes a hard reboot also helps. I have Verizon and did switch to T-Mobile when my contract ended, but they only give you EDGE on this phone so the slow speed and T-Mobile's lack of coverage just pushed me tight back to Verizon. I don't play games on my phone and the only web based stuff I do is checking my auctions if I am bored while waiting for the subway, so I see no reason to upgrade.

I always was fascinated about the blackberries. They were the first smartphones to out there that got the smartphone technology going. I wish Blackberry was able to continue this trend of touch screens since this phone was amazing and probably the biggest phone they made to date. I know RIM can do a better job of making a heck of a nice phone that could beat those android and apple users but RIM don't want to get out of the old school OS systems and their repetitive designs.Overall I sticked with this phone because of how well the email system is. This is very important to me for a computer engineer. This phone also does well for texting and that is all I need for a work phone. I use my Blackberry Bold 9930 for my usual texting and surfing.Overall this phone is probably the only phone you are going to see that has a huge screen and uses a blackberry operating system. I know the phone has its flaws but overall its a great phone if you get use to it. Also there are other ways to improve the phone too.Overall a great phone who needs email sent to their phones. It is the most simplest way to setup email and Blackberry made their phones to have the best email infrastructure before Apple blew them out of the water.I love this phone and will keep it for work until Apple puts RIM to the ground.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "son refabricados no son nuevos...", "Author": "alvaro", "ReviewID": "R3F4EJLG0R8EQE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "saludos estos celulares , de los cuales compre 02 son refacturados y los venden como nuevos , la caja no es original blacberry y vienen con problemas de adecuacion para venezuela , hay que mandarlos a servicio tecnico para poder activarlos , es mas uno de ellos trajo una sim card de verizone , que me imagino que era de alguien ...que verguenza  .....", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A transaction that has left me frustrated.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R11JAKR8ZXI9ZC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I travel outside the country a lot and prefer buying unlocked phones that I can continue using during my travels.

As a result, I can compare the Blackberry Storm 2 from Verizon and the Blackberry Bold 9700 from T-Mobile.  Similar phones in many respects with shared capabilities in the main but one is far more user friendly than the other in my opionion.  The Bold is the friendlier one by far.  As an aside, I am impressed by the level of service and follow-up by Verizon and the Storm 2 over T-Mobile but that's another issue for another time.The Storm 2 is quirky.  Maybe the same can be said of all touch screen devices but it tends to lock up, accept the wrong commands and is tough to navigate with those smallish querty keyboard symbols.  And you have to toggle between screens to add numerical data and certain punctuation marks to your text.  The Bold, in comparison, is not like typing on a regular keyboard either but it does allow for easy fixing of typos and with its chicklet fixed keyboard makes navigating a far easier task.And that's the main difference between the Bold and Storm 2:  Ease of navigation.  It's sort of like going from the original version of Windows (Storm 2) to Windows 7 (Bold 9700) if you follow my drift? The Storm 2 does have an advantage in the user being able to go from portrait to landscape mode which helps a little on typing text but even then, the keyboard is not forgiving.  The Storm 2 now has four sensor modules under the screen to help on the commands which is a step up over the ONE from the original Storm but stability is hardly the order of the day.Sending a text requires an additional menu call-up on the Storm 2 as opposed to the Bold. Also, on the Storm 2, one has to dig into the media icon to access the video camera.  Not so on the Bold.  More examples outlining the differences between the two phones.  In summation, I like both phones but the Bold would be my choice if I could only have one phone.  I think the Storm 2 has another generational change ahead of it before it can lay claim to being a true iphone alternative.You have to think the people at RIM and Blackberry are acutely aware of the Storm 2's issues because the phone is just short of being an all around excellent choice.  Right now the Storm 2 is a GOOD choice and I'll leave it there.UPDATE:  After many dropped calls in spite of good wi-fi or antenna 3G strength indicated, and having the Storm lock up on me after taking it from the charger, I couldn't continue and got out of it and the contract.  I'm beginning to think the folks at Blackberry and RIM have been not only passed but left in the dust by the competition.  To be fair, the Bold 9700 has been and still is a solid unit which I have no desire to replace.

It holds a vast volume of contacts. Games and movies can be played on this particular PDA. Instant access to the internet is convenient and easy to use for someone always on the go. You can set up instant messaging on your phone, which is great for quick communication, and can sometimes be better and faster than texting. You can set up several personal email accounts on your phone and receive your emails through your phone, rather than having to access the internet constantly. The touch screen makes it easy to use, but sometimes difficult, because the touch screen features have a tendency to freeze up and letters and tabs are sometimes close together. RIM (research in motion) is constantly looking for smarter and faster technology. Picture quality is fairly good and takes good pictures; zooming in and out is easy to use. The video quality is fairly good. Internal storage is good, and the external storage can be upgraded to 16 gigabytes, maybe more. You can set up to have your PDA do visual voicemails, which means you no longer have to call in to your server to access them. And you can also set up voice commands.
