I just had trouble with the software malfunctioning in my phone so i returned it. I got a little annoyed with the TV feature popping up all the time but i never had any trouble except with the IM function. It never worked and i couldn't send out messages. If it allowed me to it took 3-4 tries. Other than that i had no problem. Battery held charge for days. The inbox didn't hold too many texts which was kinda annoying too but not a big deal.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "A+++ seller", "Author": "Rodney", "ReviewID": "RQK3599A7CAYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great seller.

Looks like a really basic phone, has a few games but none of them free, all are trial.It has a useful lock button, so the touchscreen and the 3 buttons won't press randomly in the pocket (or wherever else).Take kind of good pictures, a little sensitive to moves, but good overall.I still can't find how to connect the wi-fi, haven't done a research yet; after putting in it a micro sd with a few songs in it, an error message appeared saying there were too big to play (but yet, I haven't done my research.Feels lightweight, good design, works well... but as I said kind of basic.Overall a fine phone, will write more later when I have time to try to resolve the stuff I haven't find how to make it work.____________________I have like, 9 months using it, the phone really don't have wi-fi and only can surf on the internet if you buy a package from your operator... I did but days later (and until today) it cannot connect anymore, i am trying so hard to sell it...Is kind of tricky to get to the mp3 player, has a kind of great camera...Stills functions well, but is not what I want", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good when it works", "Author": "PC Guy", "ReviewID": "RS4RSRBMOHACL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone worked for only three months then stop recognizing my sim card i am so dissapointed when it worked it was good but i should have bought an android instead", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone was like a toy.", "Author": "Francis M.

In addition, any time you make a call and need to use a key pad, you'll find the key pad on this phone difficult, unwieldy and unworkable.  Did I mention that about 30% of the time a call to someone will come about that you can hear them but they can't hear you?  Or that you'll miss calls even though you have service because the phone decided to not ring?  I don't know why I kept it... I guess at the time I was too busy to return it. I only have two more months before I can get a new phone. I can't wait.  To be fair, I have liked using the mp3 option on the phone and the battery has lasted well.
