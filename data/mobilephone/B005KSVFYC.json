Dropped literally thousands of times, immersed, chewed on by babies and dogs, used in heat and cold. This phone does not mind.It's old and slow now, with a mediocre screen, but if you just need a voice and SMS phone, it works great.Also has the best charging dock ever. Indestructible, and it locks into it so you can mount the dock to a vehicle or wall.So good, I just dusted off one used continuously for years, since this was a new phone, and gave it to another teenager. It works fine, after much use and abuse.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "sturdy phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQXQ8J38VHSG5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my husband after he got tired of paying for his smartphone and he loves it.He wanted something without data and that wouldn't break if he accidently dropped it on the floor or in water.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Tammy Curtiss", "ReviewID": "RC6UQWV563V5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My dad had this phone for years it is very durable, his screen  finally was just about on readable so I bought this as a replacement, My dad is not someone who can use a touch screen, it is very hard to find a phone as durable", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Brittany Kinney", "ReviewID": "R3IAJ52IVFBYSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it and I love that I can make phone calls in the shower yay! for water proof. plus I destroy like every phone I day and this one takes the beating and asks for some more haha great phone for the clumsy", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "R3EKF52YW8IUEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is good phone for the price, especially since it is water proof.
