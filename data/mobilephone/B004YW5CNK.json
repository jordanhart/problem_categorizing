It has the T9 text so it can text quite well.The phone is rather slim when folded so it easy fits in a purse or pocket.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "good little basic phone!", "Author": "mayfire", "ReviewID": "R2HQYAM25ETWPF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with previous reviewer. Nice, solid phone if you don't care about frills or texting. However, I recently purchased mine directly from Tracfone's web site for 14.99. It now has double minutes for the life of the phone. Doesn't show fingerprints as much as its newer all-black version with a VGA camera, LG231C.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very long battery life", "Author": "Ski_fast", "ReviewID": "R2BEI6AACMGQAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a basic no frills phone.  Without the camera and MP3 player the battery on this phone is amazing.  My phone was ran over and broken so I went in to WalMart today and bought a Motorolla flip phone.  That phone is terrible and I will be returning it.  Texting is a nightmare on the Motorolla.  Also adding contacts is a real pain.  I will return it when my replacement LG220C arrives.  I highly recommend this phone.  It works great.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely solid first cell phone", "Author": "L. Mendoza", "ReviewID": "R2J0TB9H49MFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item two years ago and have not had one problem with it.  It's a great first phone, takes regular use and abuse.  True it does not have a lot of bells and whistles but the battery is great!  I use it daily and perhaps once or twice a week need to recharge.  I will be upgrading because I need a keyboard for texting, but I will miss this phone.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004YW5CNK"}}
