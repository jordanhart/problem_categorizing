{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BAD then WORSE!", "Author": "Matthew Grace", "ReviewID": "RDOVDCUZZHR6H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have written a review for this Item before and now cannot find it. So, in the interest of keeping folks informed I am re-writing it.  I received the item as advertised before Christmas and was able to activate it just as they said. It seemed to worked great and we moved on. In the coming weeks I noticed that when I was talking to my wife,  she would start sounding very far away and I would have to strain to hear her. I was constantly asking her to \"talk louder\" or \"can you say that again\". BUT, by the time I figured out it was the phone (I bought her for Christmas), and I wasn't the only one to have this problem while talking to her, I had gone past the 30 day limit. So, I didn't call about it. Later a review reminder came to me in an email so I gave a review of three stars because it worked but was a pain and most of the time you have to reboot it to get to work right. ( Its not like there is a volume control for the microphone). Then, Sun 3-4-12, I get a call about my review asking if I will change it or is their anything they can do to make it better. I said \"replacing the phone would help\". He said he WOULD replace it and he WOULD call me back in 1 1/2 hours to let me know what I needed to do. I'm thinking great! I can't believe he said he would do that after 2 months and 20 days. What a great company!  Then, no phone call. So I waited, just to be polite. Then this afternoon I thought I would contact them, to see what I needed to do, and when I looked I couldn't find my review. Wow! How did that happen? So here it is and now I will keep checking and rewriting this review every week till it stays. Bottom line...... It's one thing to get a bad product. I mean it happens, but don't promise a fix then never call back.

First, the charging port was loose. It had to be in a certain position for it to charge at all, and it was a pain to keep it in that position. Then the touch screen would stop working at random intervals, and a lot of the time it would start spazzing out and typing random things and clicking on things when i wasn't even holding the phone. It made doing anything on it difficult. Then the camera stopped working a few weeks after having it. Eventually, the phone turned off and just wouldn't turn back on. This is not a phone I would ever suggest to anyone, as many of the problems I experienced had been a regular thing with this phone. I had it for maybe a month at most before it broke for good.

Over time I've had more and more issues. First, it was small annoyances. The earphone jack stopped working. Every time I plugged it in it would call the last # dialed. I stopped using that feature. The cord it comes with is loose and doesn't always give a good charge. I wouldn't rely on the car charger either because its even more loose.  The camera started taking darker and darker pictures no matter the light sources around it. Again, I just tried to ignore it because after all, the phone itself worked. Finally, I had a problem that I just couldn't ignore. We got an update for the swype feature and the screen stopped working completely. I got a replacement last week and and right out of the package the microphone didn't work. I could hear everyone fine but no one could hear me. They said it sounded like I was on speaker phone and talking from the next room. Sprint fixed it and two days later it went out again. As soon as it was replaced the audio started having feedback. The phone would shut off randomly and wouldn't turn back on (something with the on/off button I guess). The camera and camcorder wouldn't shift out of 3D mode. I wouldn't give such a bad review normally but this is my second phone now and its having more problems than the first and many of the same problems over and over again.

This device barely qualifies as a smartphone, let alone a cell phone.  I'm writing this review as I'm browsing for a replacement to this device.Battery life during usage is so poor, you can expect to browse the web for an hour or two before having to plug it in again.  Since activating the phone I've made sure to keep a phone charger at my desk at work, at my coffee table in my living room, next to my bed, and in my backpack.Although it has a 4G radio (which you must manually activate every time you use it,) the processor is only capable of keeping up with 3G speeds.  People I've called with the phone complain of random beeps from my end.  Sound quality is mediocre at best, even with headphones.The operating system is old, newer apps are generally not available on the play store.  The web browser cannot play gifs.  The launcher and phone applications were modified by HTC to be uglier, less intuitive and less informative than the stock Android operating system.  For example, you do not have favorite contacts; if you want to call someone, you are forced to sift through your entire contact list.The phone is heavy and blocky.  If you were to throw it at someone, it could hurt.  It comes with a clip to hold it up while watching videos, which is nifty.It comes with Blockbuster, NASCAR, football and television apps.  I only tried the TV app and could actually watch ESPN mobile.To summarize: This phone is an archaic piece of technology.

The second one has them intact but a short on the pcb requires me to hold the charging cable at strange angles to get it to charge. Some people will chalk this up to mishandling by the user. All I can say to these critics is \"go google it\" you will see all the other people having the same issue. I remember when RCA TV's were bad for doing the same thing years ago. The issue is most likely poor soldering in the assembly line. I wouldn't risk buying one of these. I'm giving it 3 stars because the phone itself is fairly nice.

The only thing I have a problem with is the phone looked slightly dusty. On first glance, I thought it was a used phone instead of a brand new one. Then, I noticed that it was the plastic on the phone that was dusty and had numerous smudged fingerprints, as well as the plastic on the kickstand. There is also this smudge/mark on the back cover that will not come off! I'm so OCD! It won't come off; I've tried cleaning it. :( So, I'm starting to think it's a refurbished phone. That's why I gave 4 stars. Overall, I am happy with my phone. I would only advice the person handling the phones to have clean hands!Update: I activated my phone without in any problems. My phone was indeed new, it was just extremely dusty and etc. I love my my phone; despite, the mark on the cover that will not come off. The good outweighs the bad so I'll give the company 5 stars.
