I knew going into this purchase that the original S3 cases would not fit, I ordered a TPU case anyway and, you guessed it, it doesn't fit. However, it's very close. Anyway, the phone performs well. I suggest moving any app that can be moved to the SD card instead of sucking up the phones available memory as it will slow it down.Things to know:1. This phone CAN be rooted, search the web, I'm about to root mine. You can gain extra memory by doing this.2. This phone has volume and power buttons on the right (original S3 has them on separate sides).3. The headphone plug is on the opposite side compared to the original S3.4. The speaker on the back (lower corner) is also on the opposite side compared to the original S3.5. The 8MP camera performs well, it's decent enough for me to snap pics of my kids and upload to social media and store.6. The front camera is useless.7. If you plan on using network DATA (3G) and your in the U.S., plan on using this phone with AT&T.; The phone supports 850Mhz for 3G and not 1700Mhz (T-Mobile's frequency). If you do use T-Mobile you'll only get EDGE (2G) data speeds.8. If you have AT&T; SIM in this phone it DOES get HSPA9. I activated mine on Straight Talk, they ported my SUSPENDED number from Verizon in 5 minutes (kudos for that ST!). If you use Straight Talk be sure to order the AT&T; compatible SIM card. If the SIM does not show on their web site get it from WalMart online, like I did.10. If you find a case that fits comment on this review and let me know, I can't live without a case. :)All in all, this phone is a great alternative to paying for a S3 or really any other smart phone out. At the price it's unbeatable and it does just about everything you'd expect a 2013 Android phone to do.

I was easy breezy  setting it up, the only thing is figuring out which slot to put your sim card because its dual sim, its either one or the other lol. Anyways overall this is a great clone of the Sampson galaxy S3. the difference is that the vol and power button is on  the same side (left side) for the i93000, whereas for the galaxy s3 the power button is on the right side and the vol button is on the left so you have to order a specific case for model #GTi93000, base band version MT6577 .Apps are easy to download, battery is great once u are not running a bunch of apps at the same time, turn off apps when not in use, camara is good, volume is also good, netflix works great , skype works great in the US, did not try it out overseas yet, will let u know when i do in a few months.

It took about two weeks to get to me, but was well worth the wait. I have had it about 4 days so far. I had a bit of trouble inserting my SIM card, but once I got it, I had no other problems. I have T Mobile 3G service, and it works fine, once you figure how to connect the service. All apps work great and even my auto correct is in English. The only issue, as others have mentioned, is that the S3 cases do not fit. Both the power button and volume button are on the same side, and the speaker is on the opposite side on the back.

It came with a completely broken flash, it won't even turn on with the flashlight app. From what I've read the flash is pretty much useless, so Oh well I guess... It also came with a charger that would take over 12 hours to charge, but my family had an old samsung charger laying around which works great with the phone (charges in about 4-5 hours). Where the microSD card goes is frustrating, and I ended up just taping it down so it would stay in place. I have yet gotten the GPS to work, but that may be my own fault since I haven't spent a lot of time trying to stand outside with it.Besides that, I really do like the phone. The battery is pretty good considering it is a smartphone. Texting is great, amazing autocorrect. Easy to connect pictures and such onto social media sites. I don't have a data plan (it's one of the reasons I buy unlocked phones), so I've only used wifi and I haven't had any problems with that. I wouldn't say that the camera is anything special, it's comparable to the 3.2 megapixel camera I had on my old phone. I downloaded ES file explorer which allows me to use my music as ringtones and alarms. I can't figure out for the life of me if/how this phone takes screenshots though. If anyone has any advice about this phone, I'd love to hear it! I'm still leaning towards keeping it even with the issues I've had.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Android 4.1, but an excellent phone for the price.", "Author": "Mark Graybill", "ReviewID": "RT29Y6QG6NRYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is listed as Android 4.1, and it shows \"Android 4.1.1\" in  the phone settings menu, but it is actually running Android 4.0. Not only does it lack the new features and look of 4.1, but rapidly tapping on the \"Android 4.1.1\" in the settings menu gets the Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) easter egg.That point aside, the phone runs well and quickly. It functions well as a phone, good sound and good reception. It's better than other clones I've had, and right up with high quality name brand phones I've had. It runs android and its apps very well. It's snappy and responsive. The screen is very sensitive, right up with the best capacitive screens I've used. It's 5 point multi-touch, confirmed by hardware tests.The moldline of the phone isn't compatible with hard cases for the Samsung SIII, but some soft cases fit. I'm still looking for a case that fits and protects the screen with a flap. The placement of controls and camera match, but the shape of the case is a bit  different.Overall, I'm very happy with the phone.Edited to add:GPS has a very hard time getting a fix. I've gotten one good fix off it across all the attempts I've made. It pretty well requires absolute optimum conditions to get a signal, based on my use. It takes 1-3 minutes to get a location, with an open sky (not inside or partial cover) though near a building with a limited sky area works.Also, I confirmed that the Android build version on this phone is 15. That is Ice Cream Sandwich MR1 (4.0.3 or 4.0.4, NOT 4.1.1 which is build number 16.)Adding your own ringtone: by default you can only choose from the built-in ringtones by going into Settings, choosing Audio Profiles, choose the profile you want to edit (for example, General), then selecting Voice Call Ringtone. However, if you install another app that lets you set ringtones (I'm using the free version of ES File Explorer), when you select Voice Call Ringtone it will give you a dialog asking which app you want to use (Android System or any apps you have that set ringtones.) Choose the other app, then use it to navigate to where your MP3s or other sound files are, and you can then choose them as your ring tone. That will also add them to the list of ringtones under Android System.Gravity/Accelerometers: They work fine for me on this phone.SIM Card: It takes standard size SIM cards (it has two slots).Further Edit:I bought two more, they both came with Jelly Bean installed.

Getting it up and running was a challenge.  I ordered an ATT compatible SIM from Straight Talk and ported my Virgin number.  Now, for any Virgin customers thinking of switching, Virgin does not make the process very easy.  You HAVE to call customer support for your actual account number.  It's not available on the site or anywhere else.  When you call, you'll be greeted by an automated recording that doesn't give you an option to speak to a real person.  Just say \"operator\" when it pauses for an answer.  (took me ten minutes and several replays of options to figure that out)  I was transfered to an operator that asked several questions to verify my identity then informed me that she couldn't access my account number and I'd have to \"hold the line\" while she transfered me to someone else.  I was on hold for forty eight minutes..  The next guy went through the exact same process then said it would take a few minutes for my account number to come up.  In the mean time, he tries to tell me I don't need my account number to port to another service.  \"It should work with just your phone number\", he says.  I waited an hour, I was getting the account number.  Finally, he comes back on with an odd series of letters, preceded by a single number.  I don't know if just the phone number would've worked but I'm certain the account number did.  Straight Talk warns you it could take up to two days.  Mine took about ten hours then was good to go.  Be sure to set your APN settings per Straight Talk's instructions.  (more on this in a minute)Back to the device itself..  I am continually impressed with this phone.  Now, I'm not a gadget guy so I won't pretend to know anything about anything but I will give you my opinions.  This thing is lightning fast.  WiFi or data, apps download in a heartbeat.  Web pages load in a blink.  Reception is great with ATT sim in my area.  Call clarity and volume is excellent.  The screen is huge and bright with beautiful colors and great resolution.  Mine came with a flip cover that I really like a lot and seems like it will hold up well.  The screen protector is pretty cheap but serves it's purpose until I can get a quality replacement.  The batteries both seem to hold a charge well.  They easily get me through a day with average text/talk/app use.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a great phone for a great price.Just a couple negatives.. One: I haven't been able to receive picture messages, though this seems to be a service issue, not a hardware issue.  A quick search of Straight Talk's forum returns hundreds of hits for MMS send/receive problems.  I double and triple checked the APN settings and still they won't download.  I'm still waiting on an answer from Straight Talk customer service and I'll update once I get one.  Two: cases are proving difficult to find.  The headphone port, rear speaker and volume buttons are on the opposite side from the Samsung and the sizes are a little different, so SIII cases won't fit without some modifications.  If I happen upon any, I'll update then also.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great knockoff but no perks", "Author": "Julie L. \"Julie L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2SY8ZBDYMD2MC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I switched to this phone from the actual Samsung GS3 mini. While I liked the mini, the screen just wasn't big enough for me. So first, the great things about this phone:1. large screen2. great knockoff of the SG3!3. came with tons of extras - 2 batteries, 2 screen protectors, earphones, usb cable & us charger, flip case4. great user interface, very easy to manuever - unlike the SGS3 mini which has 50 million menues and I could never find what I was originally looking for5. super fast shipping, I ordered on sunday had it by tuesday! (also used 2 day shipping on it)6. I'm using this currently with a tmobile straighttalk sim so no 3G (only with att sim as it has 850mhz frequency not 1700 for tmobile) and was a bit harder to configure for the sim but will be changing to an att st sim when it comes in Friday!7. DUAL SIM - I'm not using both spots right now, but my husband & I get stationed in Europe, I probably will8. very nice screen - colors bright & crisp, has smooth touch and scrollingNow for the not so great parts... :(1. settings for base model comparable - no special fonts like real samsung models, no facebook pre-installed so when you install the app, your contacts won't link (if anyone has found a solution to this, PLEASE let me know!!! I miss my pics!!)2. Bit more work to get it configured for a tmobile straight talk sim3. Cannot get phone data to read mobile webpages - have to have it set on \"Request Desktop Site\" in browser settings other getting an error message for each page4. No custamizable display - you can change what apps are on the homescreens but can't change # of screens or design layouts - I'll be downloading free apps to change this though (hassle though since most other models already come with this feature)5. camera pics not of the best quality, front cam very grainy and discolored; back cam still kind of discolored & bit grainy; not exactly the pic quality I'm used to and I had an HTC Rhyme before so no big model name phoneOverall, a great phone for the price. Needs some extra tweaking by the user but kind of the same as buying a house that needs some tlc; just takes a little bit of extra time, research, and configuration for your tastes. If you don't mind having to do that, buy this phone. I'm much happier with the $180 price and needing to do some extra tweaking than paying $320 for the SGS3 mini ready out of the box (with a smaller screen and I'm not paying the $500-$600 for the actual SGS3!)

I had a 2+ year old Droid 2 Global (on Verizon) before it gave up the ghost. Several email & social networks accounts setup on it ...and ~420 apps installed (which includes the Verizon unused Bloatware) ...granted, a lot of the apps not used regularly. 512 MB RAM, 8 GB of internal storage and 8 GB microSD card. Only complained of low storage after downloaded a movie or two from Google Play.Onto this quadband phone...Purpose for the phone (besides replacement) was to try alternate carriers (besides Verizon) to see if worth switching ...and also wait to see if next wave of new droid phones were worth upgrading to versus keeping this generic (Galaxy S3 clone) older / lower expense one.PROS:-Great bundle of items as listed ...plus came with 2 covers ...one with & another without a flip cover.-Can have 2 (full size) SIM cards installed ...but need to toggle what feature (Voice, Video, Data, Messaging) is used for given SIM-Works with T-Mobile (no contract / unlimited plan) ...but only 2G speeds (expected issue after some additional research) at least in New England area. Note, 3G+ for T-Mobile requires 2 frequency bands ...but the phone has only one of them.-Crisp clear screen (...barring direct sunlight).-Nice battey life for a smart phone (...over a day if minimal data or wifi is used).-Works internationally, used in Europe.--The T-Mobile SIM transitioned to roaming under \"Optimus\"  ...but very expensive ...did not used ...but nice to have as a backup.--Purchased pre-pay \"Vodafone\" SIM (w/ talk & text ...no data option) ...very good reception and call quality.-Quick load \\ start up time.NEUTRAL:-Misleading packaging. Screen film states phone as quad processor ...no, it is dual. Mentions NFC, not that I could find. BUT neither of these 2 items are mentioned in the Amazon listing so they were not expected ...nor deal breakers for me.CONS:-Random shutoffs ...This may be an isolated build (quality) issue. During the 1st week, started noticing that phone was turned off when I would take it out of my (shirt and/or pant) pocket to use. Originally thought something put accidental pressure on the switch which caused it to turn off. Turns out phone is very sensitive any taps / bumps that automatically causes shutoff with no warning. This includes placing (...not dropping) phone on a table ...or even tapping the dial out button too hard ...will turn of the phone. ...NOT good if expecting call(s) ...and your phone is off. Shouldn't need to check every 10 - 15 minutes to confirm that the phone is on.-Whac-a-mole: Phone calibration is very erratic (and I did try calibrating the phone sensors several times). When making calls where dial pad is needed during the call (i.e. checking / navigating voice mail), the screen would go in and out of \"screen saver mode\". Felt like I was playing an unwanted game of \"Whac-a-mole\" where the call would eventually disconnect before I had a chance complete the dial pad navigation.-Phone storage: Amazon listing states \"Internal memory: 4GB(Note: The operate system and Apps take some spaces, so only show 2GB + 502MB)\". Listing is misleading. Yes, internally it showed ~1.8 GB and 450+ MB of available space. BUT, apps that require \"internal\" storage will ONLY use the  \"500\" MB portion. The 'other' 2 GB portion is an \"either / or\" situation in that you either use it as \"external\" 'phone storage' versus \"external\" 'microSD card storage'. Myself, I had installed a 32GB microSD card ...and defaulted to that (not the included available 1.8 GB). Based on Amazon's listed information, I knew that I would not be able to have my previous 400+ apps installed on this phone. Initially only had a little over a hundred installed. As time went on, the cache & data increased (mostly from email and social apps), so I found myself slowly removing other less frequently used apps. Now, this depends on the apps installed as some can be completely installed to the external storage. Not the case for my primary apps.I will keep the phone given the low price but will be looking to buy another phone ...and probably give this one to my son to use the WIFI connection and play his games on it.Given the shortage of app storage and mainly power downs & \"screen offs\", it did not fit my needs ...nor reliable enough for me.Side note, phone was fulfilled by Amazon from ProntoTec.---------------------UPDATE...By November (less than 6 months after purchase), the phone is no longer usable. Had to handle the phone 'delicately'. Any minor bounce or bump would turn off the phone ...causing me to miss calls ...or disconnect in middle of conversation. Also portion of screen lost sensitivity resulting at times not be able to easily enter the PIN to log in ...had to be very precise in specific area to touch just enough of the edge of the PIN number ...and regular navigation on screen was difficult due to usable touch area.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Phone", "Author": "Richard Seltman \"ralpo\"", "ReviewID": "R1A3QOGJGI4VZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey, it works for me, and does more than I know about.No problems with it, and if you take a trip to another country,just add another card for calls.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "horrible!!!", "Author": "carey neal", "ReviewID": "R18OW9G8SWGAN5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "surprised when a off brand of the samsung galaxy 3 is delievered barely two weeks with the phone and it gets reported stolen requested to send back never heard anything from the seller DO NOT BUY!!!... before those two weeks were up the front camera was turned upside down i would take a picture with the front camera and the whole screen was upside down and i had no idea how to fix it while texting it would ask me what service company i had and would show it in the status bar until out of messaging", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chinese Knock Off", "Author": "Kyle Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2ETEA2WH18L8G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was an excellent little phone for the first two or three months.

The bars would go up and down seemingly without reason, not that i really care about that, but the calls even in a well covered area, like 4 bars mostly, calls would drop out or glitch during conversations. It doesn't make sense to keep a phone that can't make decent calls. It is also very frustrating to have people constantly repeat themselves when your phone is so spotty.The battery was a little weird going from 65% to making a quick call and drooping to 15%. Or drooping a lot after a simple reboot. To be fair they did ship out a second battery with unit, that i have not used. The microSD card stopped staying in place,i let someone else try and use the phone and they fixed this with a paper shim to hold in place.

Sometimes for unknown reasons the phone didn't \"see\" the SD card. The phone was overheated, and the battery didn't last for long even when it was idle.

Daniel at lolbuy shipped it very promptly (arrived from China in 2 weeks) and has been quick and polite in e-mailing me about it, but it has too many issues I can't resolve in time for our overseas trip next week.  BTW, I'm an experienced user of iPhone and Android smartphones, so I don't think it's operator error.1.  The tiny user's guide for this Chinese-made Samsung clone is pathetically incomplete, and there are absolutely no online instructions available anywhere even after an ultra-diligent hours-long search.  I spent hours looking at YouTube commentaries on the phone, in several languages, but they all said pretty much the same pros and cons and didn't resolve any of my issues.2.  The unforgivable problem for me is this phone's complete inability to recognize any wi-fi networks, either mine at home or public ones.  It certainly didn't do so automatically, and when I tried a bazillion times to manually enter my home network name, security system (WPA2), and password, the phone either shut down, cleared my entries and re-presented me with unfilled out blanks, or (if I was lucky enough to get any response at all) told me no network was within range.  Since the whole time I tried this I was surrounded by my iPhone, Kindle, and iPad as well as desktop PC which all picked up the network with no problems at all, I concluded that this clone phone is hopeless.  If I have this much trouble getting into a wifi network here at home, I can only imagine my frustration trying to do so with multiple foreign wifi networks on our upcoming trip to Greece and Turkey!3.  As noted by everyone, the front camera is a joke, and there is no case available other than the clunky one it ships with.  These are cons, but in my book not deal-breakers.On the pro side, the screen is large, clear and bright.  The dual-SIM feature is handy, and the phone's very small onboard memory is easily augmented with a mini SD card.  I would have enjoyed using this phone if it had only worked for me!Perhaps it is simply my phone that's the problem, not the whole model, so your mileage may vary.

It is almost a clone of samsung galaxy III. The fetures are great, works great. Screen is responsive. I can recommend this phone.There were some comments about battery being drained. First day after I charged the battery (100%), I had all the processes on for the phone (WiFi, google location, automatic syncing and vibration etc etc), with in 20 min the battery went down to 80% (I lost 20% of battery). I was bit woried but then I went through google how to save battery life on androids (by then my batter was drained to 55%. After checking on google I disabled key press vibrations, general vibrations, automatic syncing, google locations and most importantly I disabled WiFi when I did not need it/did not use it.After that it was magical, the battery was so stable. I turn on the WiFi when I use. Since I did the first full charge, I did not charge the battery till now (which is more than 24 hrs) and still I got 40% battery life left.The key is do not keep the un necessary apps or location trackings and WiFi's on that drains the battery.Back to the phone,It is greatresponsive touch screenresolution is greatback camera is good although it takes great still pictures, the any shake or movement makes the pics really blurry. one has to get used to it.front camera i did not check.apps are running great.call quality/voice quality is good.browsing /surfing is fast as the processor is reasonably faster.I played videos- good resolution quality.By the way the phone is android 4.1.1 - I specifically checked.I did not use ear phones yet.I did not play video games on it and I do not play video games. so the quality for video games doesnot matter for me.Eventhough I ordered the phone with a standard shipping which was suppose to take 18-20 days and I was supposed to receive the phone between March 18th to April 3rd, The seller(Standard-Mart) shipped the product by so fast delivery that by 4th March I have the phone delivered to me. Hats-off to the seller. They had an extra case  and a stylus for the phone.  I recommend this seller to anyone.The bottom line is the phone so far worked as SIII- except the beam.I have ATT sim card so everything is working fine.What else, IT IS GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE. SIII COSTS AROUND 400-599 ( I GUESS) AND IF ONE CAN GET SIMILAR PHONE FOR 172 BUCKS, IT IS GREAT ISNT IT.One thing I would like to know is where to find a case for this phone.
