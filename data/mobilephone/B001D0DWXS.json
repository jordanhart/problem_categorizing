{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressing but faulty", "Author": "Sunny D", "ReviewID": "R2B954N62Z42EC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got this phone last week, and it has some nice features. The one I liked mostly is that you can put specific phone numbers on a black list and have the phone send a busy signal when they call you. One other thing is the calendar and to do list. Very practical. Also you can have an alarm set to wake you up only on weekdays. Cool!!Also, what I liked about this phone is that it's a sturdy phone, it feels good in your hand. It's beautiful, but it will get smedged easily with fingerprints. However, battery life is really bad, not what I'm used of with Nokia. Also, the slide mechanism has a major problem. When you slide open the phone, it just doesn't react by unlocking the phone. You have to unlock it manually. It seems this is some kind of magnetic failure of the phone. More users have reported this same problem. You can see these on the Nokia Discussions website. I took the phone back to the store and exchanged it for the N95. But still I like the E66 best because it has some features the N95 does not have. E.g. when in sleep mode you press the selection key you see the time. And the phone is so slim it slips comfortably in your jeans pocket. Try that with the bulky N95...I hope Nokia fixes this slide problem.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Spectacular Phone", "Author": "Consumer", "ReviewID": "R3STWGC7CIKFL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A smartphone that is not huge like the iPhone and Blackberries, e.g. it has Wi-Fi, GPS, Maps, Browser, RealPlayer, E-Mail, Office, Camera/Video, etc. but it's about the size of a RAZR (slightly taller but thinner).  Same features as E71 but smaller.  Solid construction, quality feel.I have not experienced either problem referenced by the other reviewer.  Battery life is excellent, and the unlocking issue is not present.  Perhaps confirm that you're getting the extended battery.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nokia E66", "Author": "Eric E. Clarke", "ReviewID": "RUBJI33S4B734", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used an N95 previously and having lost it, I bought the E66 as its replacement.  I find the E66 easier to use. The uni-directional slide I found more convenient than the N95's bi-directional arrangement. It feels like a serious device and not a toy as the N95 feels. I wished the E66 had a 5.2 megapixel camera.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "NOT GREAT AND TOO EXPENSIVE", "Author": "Manu Budhrani", "ReviewID": "R2CTWODKYT1MIR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've used this phone for  a few months now and because it is so expensive, I have not changed it.  If it was a cheaper phone, I would have changed it a long time ago.  Symbian does not hold a candle to Windows Mobile (which was the OS in my previous phone).  Strengths are good signal strength and many features which one has to figure out and use.  I have been unable to figure how to set up the email and VOIP calling.  I don't think it works on this phone.  I set up email on my Itouch much more easily.  Weakness is the speed of the processor.  It takes a while for any of the apps to load, including the contacts list.  If I need to find a phone number, it is soo,soo slow.  Battery life is terrible.  Videos are jerky and everything is just slow.  I don't use the phone much (less than five minutes of calling per day) and yet I have to charge the phone every other day.  If I knew all this, I would never have bough this phone.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "sucks the battery as a pet", "Author": "Walter Jose Brandao \"Walterbr\"", "ReviewID": "R25LO97MTGHMQG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I liked:- Size- Resolution of Display- Features- Qualiade signal- System multi-tasking- Construction- GPSI did not like:- 3 weeks with the hood is deformed- The battery is very low- The menus are confusing and outdated- The keyboard is terrible for typing text (recommend the E71)- Live voice with low volume- Poor sound quality in speaker- The international version does not have many options for language, including Portuguese- The image of the camera is designed for blue violet, and low quality (I was very disappointed)", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
