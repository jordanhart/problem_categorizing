I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to \"listening\" for the vibrate feature instead.i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.sound quality is good, on both endsi dig it.  im sure you will too.", "Date": "September 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Kantana Pink", "Author": "Ladybug", "ReviewID": "R3LI1WZXSST4Q5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a sprint customer for over three years and have owned three sanyo phones; Sanyo 8100, Sanyo 8300, and the Kantana. If you're coming from a mulitimedia phone like the Sanyo 8300, the SCP-6600 Katana may be a bit of a disappointment to you. The Katana just doesn't have all of the bells and whistles as a multimedia phone. The Katana has no built in flash which is needed for taking half decent pictures with a camera phone. It also has no camcorder or media player. But then again its not suppose to. It's basically an attempt by sprint and Sanyo to satisfy the consumer cravings for the popular RAZR phones that are available through wireless carriers like Cingular, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Cricket and a few others. It's obvious by looking at the Katana that it was inspire by the Razr, which does not have MM functions either. On a feature note I would have to give the Katana a one besides doing the simple things like making phone calls and downloading ringers and screen savers there's just not much more you can do on it. Aesthetically the Katana is not that much of a beaut. However, it is for the time being a bit different looking so for (except when compared to the RAZR) that I'd give it a four. For the lack of a decent camera and camcorder I have to deduct two more points which brings rating down to three stars. Oh for those of you who are interested in bluetooth the phone is bluetooth capable.", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A SLEEK LOVELY FEMININE PHONE", "Author": "Rosann Russo", "ReviewID": "R7QP6TZEIXPV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I WANTED A PHONE IN PINK TO REPLACE MY OLD CLUNKY OUT OF DATE PHONE.

Let me tell you, this phone has been dropped, been in ice cold water, the toilet(unused), extreme hot and cold climate and everytime I turn it on...it makes me smile. I never had to change the battery, charger...anything. I really don't want to part with, but it's 2012 and time for an upgrade. I'm sad that I can't seem to find anything but used one as it was discontinued :( So, I'm forced to look for an entirely new phone. But, I still have my OG faithful until then. It's simply the best cellphone ever made(IMO).", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "M.

I had an older flip phone from Sprint for years and loved it, then it finally broke! We ended up getting the fancy Samsung M620 Upstage Black Phone. Really neat fancy phone. It has all the bells and whistles and very pretty, but NOT user friendly!! I have an ipod already and just wanted a simple to use phone. This is VERY user friendly. The camera doesn't take high quality pix but it shouldn't because it is a phone.... I have a good camera and an ipod so this is perfect for me. It has voice recognition & I can answer the phone or make phone calls without opening up the phone. You can control the type of rings or how loud you want them for different callers. VERY USER FRIENDLY and sounds great!", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "8 years and still going!", "Author": "anya", "ReviewID": "R5VLTOXVY4OR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 8 years with the original battery!!! All I need is a phone for emergencies when in the car or at home when a cell phone is needed. It is so slim and easy to carry and use. I hate to ever give it up.

If you need a simple phone this is it. if you need the bells and whistles then you would hate this phone.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'd give it zero stars if I could!", "Author": "Nicole Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2V3VDQSODSGZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone!", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "katana", "Author": "Lisa \"Lisa\"", "ReviewID": "R2QLW4SJE5FD3X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift, its too thin for me.

I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too!
