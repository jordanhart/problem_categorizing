{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Straight talk E71 DOES have all the bells and whistles", "Author": "hoobox", "ReviewID": "R2QUYQKB45I0GP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello and thanks for reading.  I recently bought the Nokia E71 for Straight Talk from my local Walmart and so far its a home run!  So far I haven't found anything that att branded one has that this one does not have (Though I haven't messed with the push to talk features).  It has Wifi, including hotspot capabilities and its VERY good wifi to be honest, I switched from the Boost Mobile Blackberry Curve 8530 and this wifi is WAY faster.  It has voice-guided GPS, a front camera for video calls, a 3.2 MP cam with flash and a video recorder.  Very good full html web ability, but I personally would prefer Opera browser (a free download) over the native browser. It does youtube, facebook, full desktop yahoo and just about every site I have gone to.  It does have a media player with mp3 compatibility--DRAWBACK--It only has a 2.5mm headset jack which if you are unfamiliar is smaller than a traditional set of headphones,  so finding headphones can be a bit of a process but you can get them fairly cheap if you go on ebay.  The call quality is very good and the speakerphone is adequate.  It does have push email services, instant messengers, MS office compatible tools for word, excel, etc.  Voice recorder, internet radio, alarm clock, adobe acrobat and flash support. Realplayer, 2 customizable home screens ie. one for work hours, one for home hours, multi-tasking and a host of apps you can get from OVI store, some free some not but most seem to be under $6.  Excellent battery life is also a plus. Also has plenty of customizable shortcut keys. 8gb Micro SD support. You can tether EASILY! SHHHH! Very sexy dark chrome look, decent sized screen and keyboard.  I love the phone! Beats the blackberry 8530 hands down!Quick View: Pros Good camera w/flash, full internet, good call quality, GPS w voice, wifi, mp3 player, very office friendlyCons:  2.5 mm headset jack, only supports 8GB max micro sd, no FREE threaded text messaging but you can buy an app.  Overall I would recommend the phone to most people:  Seems more adult oriented and doesn't have some of the fireworks teens would probably go for. My friend has the Droid 2 and his phone really can't do much my e71 can't with the exception of his massive screen.  If you aren't stuck on having the worlds biggest screen or having a touchscreen you should really check this out.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Go down on price!", "Author": "peter", "ReviewID": "R2CA1N1UEP1OOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a good phone. The price listed on Amazon is too high. If you go to the straight talk website the phone is $244 it includes the $45 unlimited card. At Walmart the phone is $199.99 without tax.

Wrong.Straight Talk's Nokia e71 is a fantastic smart phone for it's price and quite frankly probably the best phone Straight Talk has to offer as of this review, but again you wouldn't know unless you researched which is why you're probably here.It does similar things as other Straight Talk phones such as MP3, Bluetooth, Facebook, Twitter, general internet surfing, supports MicroSD cards, etc. however the things that sets it apart really makes the phone feel more complete than other Straight Talk phones.- 3G (nearly every other phone Straight Talk.com's website is less), yeah 4G is the new hot thing but 3G is more than good enough for very quick webpage loading time when surfing the phone's web browser or loading up Facebook- Youtube watching capable (the Samsung Straight Talk model phones can get on the internet but youtube videos is not supported)- Much more friendly when it comes to apps. With the Samsung Straight Talk model phones I had to go through the tedious process of emailing myself the app via Gmail then downloading and this only works for games. Samsung Straight Talk phones wouldn't fully support other apps.- Better default MP3 player, the Samsung model phones had this weird 50 limit song per playlist, the Nokia e71 is unlimited songs for a playlist.The only flaws I had with the phone is that the keyboard is really tiny but that's more of an personal adjustment coming from a slide out qwerty keyboard of the Samsung T401G (the Nokia 6790 has a similar slide-out keyboard if you're interested in a smart phone with better keyboard functions) and the headphone jack is a 2.5mm jack (not a common headphone jack you would have laying around) but those are minor considering the whole package you get with this along with Straight Talk's inexpensive $45 unlimited everything monthly plan. It's a really a steal.As for the price of the phone, try to find it at Wal-mart instead of you want a lower price. They're usually like $180-199. You may have to ask the clerks for it specifically if you doing a walk-in. The clerk told me they keep them in the back and off the shelves because \"these phones have legs\", haha.Nokia e71 and 6790, two great Straight Talk phones that most of the potential Straight Talk customers wouldn't know about unless they digged around some.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Still can't believe it....", "Author": "J. N. Sanders \"Jnsanders\"", "ReviewID": "R28YCXXCLZJGQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased from Walmart for $190 about two weeks ago. This phone is awesome.Pros:-$45/month UNLIMITED EVERYTHING!!!!-Sturdy well built phone(read it's stainless steel)-Battery lasts two days with regular use.-Free Navigation, that works!! Works very well actually.-Pre-loaded apps, and access to many more. (not as many as android phones tho)-App to make phone wifi hotspot. Works amazingly well.-Internet radio with thousands and thousands of stations.-Wifi access.-Very loud quality speaker.-Great camera.-Ability to use music on phone as ringtones.-Big bright screen.-Front facing camera to video chat with other cell phones via Fring.(hopefully Skype will let Fring use contacts again soon) Right now I can't find a way to vid chat to PCs..-Also looks very nice. Shiny and catches people's eye. Gets mistaken for a Blackberry constantly with case on covering the Nokia label.Cons:-None  There's no cons with the phone, but there are when it comes to the service. Straight Talk that is. If you ever have to call their customer service, you're pretty much screwed. It's somewhere in India or Mexico City or something.. I can't tell, once I thought maybe even Jamaica. Anyways, it takes a long time and can be frustrating. The problem I had was with auto refill on my account. It didn't work and I almost lost my number I had ported in. They got it back, and I've been good since, but the safest way to do it is actually go online and renew it yourself once a month. (small task for $85/month savings)  The phone runs off of the GSM (At&t; network), which I'm not a fan of after being spoiled by VZW.. Hopefully within the next year or so At&t;'s service will get better since they did buy out T-Mobile, but either way.... If you've already got At&t; you're throwing money away by not going with this. Also, most of ST's phones are CDMA network anyways.(verizon network) But of course, it's all their not-smart phones. But descent phones nonetheless.. Someone told me this phone can't actually access the 3g At&t; network, and only their 2g, but I'm pretty sure they were wrong. It has an icon in the corner that actually says 3g and sometimes 3.5g where I'm at. And I've compared it next to smart phones from VZW while both had full bars and this one was way faster.  In conclusion, this phone is a huge step towards Straight Talk becoming an actual competitor in the US's cell phone business. Now that there's only three main competitors, there is a better chance for prices to get even higher yet. For the equivalent cell phone and service plan with VZW it would be $130/month. That's $85/month more than this. And over $1000/year. I can't believe it. Yeah, there's no early upgrade discount. But you can use that $2000 every two years to get a new one huh?!!! I hope this review gives you the info you needed, and hopefully sways some people to leave their current providers and save some money!! Again, Walmart, $190 for phone $45/month for service plan, plus tax, came to $265 for me. That's what?.. Two months of what you're paying now?

Keys doomed but Tiny and not well lite. The numbers to dial from are very small and color is light gray, really hard to see in dim lighting.Have used this phone over two years. Overall this is a good phone.  Just type one letter and a list of names with that letter pops up to call from. Makes calling easy unless you have to dial a number in dim light. I do get dropped calls but unsure from whose phone.  Swift internet access, uploads facebook and other files quickly. Difficult to read internet on such small screen and it gets old quickly.

Easy to email to Facebook or upload to Computer with the cable. BUT, after the first month I couldn't download any apps to the phone. And there isn't an easy delete feature. Maybe I need to go online and find a detailed direction book, as I didn't see it include.The GPS feature doesn't always give the shorted route, but it's free. I would recommend using the earphones (Must be purchased separately)My favorite App is True Caller. It's a Caller ID for Cell Phones. You can link it with Facebook or Twitter and update people's Photos.

That all has do with the location you are at when you make calls. Probably trying to make calls from Egypt.This phone has gave me zero problems, and by far one of the best cell phones I've ever owned. It is quality, and a lot better than most Strait Talk phones that I have had in the past, and it has extra features then the cheaper models. I can't find any complaints -- For having only a $200 price tag, I simply want to make babies with it.Good phone. Good price.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1YTB9FU06MVQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not one single issue with the phone except that it does not come with a data cable. The functions are great and easy to navigate through. However I had the E62 which has the same operationg system as the E71 but the E71 is more advanced and faster with a few more options. I did not have any problem switching my number to Straighttalk from an AT&T; Family plan. It did take a day for the switch to actually complete but I could use my AT&T; phone until the change happened. The only other concern is transferring your contacts. Since the E62 was an AT&T; phone I could put sim card from the phone I was using into the E62 and copy the contacts to the phone and download them into the OVI suite. Then when I got a data cable I hooked up the E71 and copied them over. I am sure ther is a better way but I could not find it without paying some to do it or downloading my entire Outlook contacts list into my phone. Second I have not had any of the freezing that I read on the reviews and the battery last 2 to three days with higher than normal use.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Phone", "Author": "mrod517", "ReviewID": "R3U3XKSVFO01IE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this phone for over a year now and must say, not bad at all.  You're definitely not going to get the type of features you may get from an IPhone; however, this phone is definitely a keeper.  The Nokia E71 has the best video and picture camera I have EVER used.  When recording, unlike most other phones, the e71 gives you one hour of continuous recording time which I have used several times at concerts.  You can see the videos very clear and the sound recorded is amazing.  This phone has been through hell and back with me.  I have dropped it so many times that other phones would have already broken and this one still works just like new so it is very durable.  You can get cool applications on it and endless themes.  By finding the right application, you can even get most of your paid apps for free.  The GPS on this phone is great too.  I have had my Garmin Nuvi and Tom Tom get me either lost or just not find a place at all. The E71 gps has gotten me virtually everywhere without once having to pay for a map upgrade (sweet!!!).  It also has 2d and 3d views. It is so good that I have actually put away my Nuvi and Tom Tom.  The qwerty board looks small but texting is super easy and fast.  Depending on your connection and website, the internet browser is not bad at all either.  In other words, I have had better brand name, more expensive phones that haven't done or lasted half as long as the E71.

I've had the phone about 8 months, the first 2 or 3 I had no problems then suddenly I have these errors.

Constant \"network busy\" errors, and dropped calls.  I am unsuccessful at getting help from Straight Talk.  They told me that all my problems could be solved by taking the battery out and putting it back in.  Nope.  They said to wipe out all my contacts I painstakingly entered in... NOPE.  I wonder if there is anyone with true technical knowledge at Straight Talk and if so, how can I reach them?  One technical support person there said all my problems were due to the fact that I own and use a Motorola bluetooth headset.  She read from a script, and repeated to me 3 times that they \"only recommend using genuine Nokia accessories\".  Rarely, At times I can make a call for a half hour with no issue.  Mostly though, I try to make a call and it hangs up on me in less than 2 minutes.  And it takes 3 or 4 minutes to get the call to go through again, only to hang up on me shortly there after.It takes 17 key presses if you want to set an alarm on this phone.  If the service was good, I still would not recommend this phone because every single thing you commonly do with a phone is buried very deeply in the menu causing you to waste a lot of time and key strokes.  My old motorola took like 5 key strokes to set a quick alarm and this is the standard I have come to expect.  I really wanted to like this phone but the menu system is way too inconvenient.  I can't speak for everyone but I use my phone constantly to set alarms as reminders for various tasks.Another thing that I dislike about this phone is that there are only 8 one touch dials (1 is set to VM).  On my old flip phone I had many speed dials set, and could use double digit ones... Now I have to go through the phone book many times to retrieve numbers because I know many people.I revised this review in order to improve it's accuracy and fix errors that were pointed out by other readers.
