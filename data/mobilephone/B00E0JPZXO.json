A manual would have been nice, it just made learning about the phone \"fun\".  I went from a windows phone to this one, so this is my first Android device.  Definately download the google keyboard app with swype, the keyboard that is preloaded is awful.  Data is a little slow if no wifi, but sufficient.  The camera works ok too.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "GOOD FOR MAKING CALL\u2026.THATS IT", "Author": "quadre", "ReviewID": "RYGD1WWJHT3PY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this phone was ok but browsing online really sucks. its really slow. yeah the phone is an android phone but you can't use all the android features because the data is too slow. i couldn't even download an app with with out using wifi. bottom line buy this phone only if you just need to make and receive calls.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "charm", "ReviewID": "R1N861EL7B85PR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone a few days now.

Or one could say a \"copied\". I'm not sure if I would buy a phone internationally, since you don't know if the product is going to be cheap (the phone life/quality) or a rip off. Also the battery life might be terrible. But the good thing about it, according to various videos, is a smooth process ( as in speed in swiping and going to different pages or apps). There needs to be more people who have this product to review it, so people may know whether to buy it or not.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E0JPZXO"}}
