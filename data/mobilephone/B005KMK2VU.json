It would have been nice to get a little more detail about how the smartphones are more expensive monthly than the other phones for people like me, who didnt know that.

After hours of trying and downloading.  Buying a Driver program for $40.  I was finally able to get it fixed with a download!  Hopefully the phone will not give me any more problems.  It looks good.  I love it for now other than the horrible issues I went through to get it working! :(", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "occasionally works", "Author": "Beth J.

There were screen protectors on the front and back of the phone in order to prevent smudging. The design is absolutely cute and it came in no time from when I ordered it. So far I am pleased with the quality of the product and have not had any troubles with it. Have not experienced the applications woes, but I have a tablet in which I can play apps and such on. Just needed this phone as a replacement and it is working excellent at that! It comes with a wall charger along with a USB adapter for computer usage or can be used as a car charger option.The only cons I have is that this phone did not come with a manual or SD card, but I have learned how to cope without and look up any questions about functions that the Setup Wizard did not address. This really does not affect how I feel about the phone. Just thought you should know that it is not included.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Usar en Argentina", "Author": "Clau", "ReviewID": "R32S2TQKPXSFK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quisiera comprarlo.Pero no se si funciona en argentina para la compa\u00f1ia Movistar.Como hago para averiguarlo??Grcias!!!
