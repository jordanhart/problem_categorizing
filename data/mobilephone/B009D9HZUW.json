I once had a cell phone watch. It was a decent toy, but the battery life was poor. This one looked great. but when it arrived, the battery looked suspicious. It was wrapped in the foil that had crackles and was coming off. When I plugged the phone to the charger, it sent me a message that it cannot charge because the there is an issue with the contact with charger. In asny case the phone is not working and I am looking for a ways no replaced it", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Internet", "Author": "Desruisseaux Andre Gerard Frantz", "ReviewID": "R36JEN6GABIJKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I connect on the internet,  it takes long to upload.
