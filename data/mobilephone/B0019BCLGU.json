I got no sound from the phone. I changed the part and one week later the touch pad stopped working, so...that meant being unable to make calls, answer calls and send text messages. What a disappointment because I need a new phone again and a year has not even gone by.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Alejandro Pacheco V", "ReviewID": "R1HGOZHU302FR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The back scratches a lot. The cancel touch button doesnt respond well after the first 3 months (on mine at least) which makes it a pain sms.Its a bit complicated to browse trough the diferent menus.
