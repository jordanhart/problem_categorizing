I do not recomend this phone at all, it seems nokia phones do much better with the qwerty keyboard and cough its a facebook phone, and its screwbook app- is worthless compared to acessing fb online. it not only frequently crashes, the camera \"send to fb\" function is \"send to a contact\"", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD, NICE AND CHEAP / BUENO, BONITO, BARATO", "Author": "KingMike", "ReviewID": "RAMUIZ1PSQ73F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "VERY GOOD PHONE.
