{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly good mid-range phone, too bad only on AT&T;", "Author": "Rocman", "ReviewID": "R151XWNXAD6D0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a chance to use the HTC One Mini for the past month. As the name suggests, it's the little brother to the HTC One. Compared to its big brother, it's a little bit smaller in dimensions, with a smaller 4.3\" 720P IPS screen, slower dual core CPU, 16GB memory and smaller battery at 1800mah. Honestly, I thought the phone would be a decent, but not great, device when I first picked it up, simply because of all the sacrifices for what appears to be a pretty minimal reduction in physical size. Yeah, it's actually not that smaller compared to the bigger HTC One.But I was pleasantly surprised. The phone is slightly shorter AND narrower than the HTC One. Even though it's still a fairly large device given the screen size, the reduction is just enough to make the phone easily usable with one hand. I can't stress this enough - this is the biggest (and probably only) advantage the Mini has over its big brother. Well, that and the price. It feels great in hand, and I don't have to stretch or reposition my hand and fingers to reach every corner of the screen. Big plus in ergonomics.The other compromises in tech specs are reasonable given the mid-range nature of the device. The slower CPU and smaller screen help to reduce the impact of the smaller battery - they use less juice. The resulting battery life is decent - I got through a day easily with average usage - about 2 to 2.5 hours on screen time, 4G LTE (60%) and wifi (40%). With heavier usage, you probably would need a quick recharge in the afternoon. The camera is largely the same as the Ultrapixel (large 2um pixel sensor) camera on the HTC One, with one exception - the Mini's camera doesn't come with optical image stabilization (OIS). OIS helps smooth out the shakes and vibrations when taking photos and videos. But I guess HTC had to differentiate the Mini a little bit from the more expensive One.The Sense 5 user interface is refined and subdued - classy and minimalist in nature compared to the cartoony Samsung Touchwiz and LG's. The phone feels buttery smooth in everyday use - no lag at all.The solid all-metal construction from the HTC One is here as well with one minor modification - the phone's edges has a plastic bumper. It takes a little bit away from the premium look, but it's otherwise identical to the One and blows every other Android phone out of the water.The dual speakers facing you is a large reason the phone is a bit bigger physically - you need the space for the speaker grills! But it's 100% worth it. This phone sounds every bit as good as the HTC One, and really is the BEST sounding smartphone on the market. Period. There's NOTHING that comes close. If you care about sound quality, this (and the HTC One) is the phone to get.Overall, this is a very well designed phone with good all-around performance. The mid range specs are reasonable since this is not a flagship phone, and is priced accordingly. It's really a shame that the phone isn't available on more carriers!", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best \"mid range\" phone there is bar none", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "RYEKZKB9TTO00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow I have never been so impressed with a so called mid range phone. I'm android loyal to the core and this phone just blows me away. I've had all the kinds my first was the HTC incredible. Which left me with a bad taste for HTC. Then a galaxy s2 skyrocket followed by an s3, nexus 4 and an LG optimus g pro. All of which were progressively better than the last. Is have to say the g pro was by far my favorite save for one thing. It's just to big for me.The HTC one mini is in no way a mini device unless your just talking specs compared to the ONE. But in no way does it feel like it's missing out on anything. Anyone looking to jump into the smartphone world should definitely consider this device. $79 is a steal if ask me. For a device that feels this good in hand and performs this well while being lumped in with the mid range croud. I am impressed and would highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking the flagship phone are to big. But get worried by what the specs are on paper. This really is a great device. I'm glad I gave HTC another go. The have really stepped it up.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is AMAZING!!!", "Author": "NyNy", "ReviewID": "RJ6VZP9SRDYDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this phone yesterday and already I have set up all of my info and connected instantly to my important items. The response to the wifi is even better than my laptop! It connects to the wifi and stays on it. It's so simple to use, it's like using an iphone. Of course there are great apps from the android store you can download. The camera's 4 ultra pixels didn't get it's name for nothing! It's still just as great as the htc one.  The screen is in superb HD and it's the perfect size to use with one hand. I've had no problems typing with one hand.  The graphics on games are definitely a bonus. The beats audio are perfect and the speakers can get load, especially with headphones. Text messages are very flexible, so you can change the color of the texts bubbles and change the background picture to whatever you like. Phone calls are excellent quality. The other end can hear so clearly and strongly. One small problem is the keyboard is a problem if you have big hands/thumbs (I have rather medium to small hands and it's works fine for me but if you have big hands, you will have a problem with the keyboard) And another problem (it's minor) is that htc blink feed is rather limited with choices for display, but at least now you can link your twitter, facebook, and instagram to it with ease. Plus it does keep you rather updated with the biggest news that's happening right now. Other than that, the phone is the best I've ever had! Htc did well with this one! Mini is not the right name for this. It should be called Htc One 2!", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great smaller phone", "Author": "Emily Liman", "ReviewID": "R1SJ9GUQRVAUHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone!  I got an iphone 5S, but returned it when I realized the new operating system made it impossible to see the phone keys and contacts.  The HTC one mini solves this problem and delivers more great features.  Keys are nice and bright (with good contrast) and everything is customizable - a BIG advantaged over the iphone.

Looking on line I see the HTC One mini and knew I wanted it right away.

It fits well in my hand and quickly reacts to my demands.  However, after using it for only 2 days there are 10, yes TEN cracks in the plastic.  No, I do not abuse the phone. It actually sits on my desk at work all day then has a comfortable ride home in a cup holder with a phone cradle and I haven't dropped it.  I am quite surprised that this hasn't been addressed on an other Amazon reviews because the issues seems to be rampant when searching online.  I am getting it replaced, but if the second one is anything close to this, I will have to find another phone.It is a great phone if you aren't bothered by cracks.

The battery is pathetic.  I have to charge it at least once a day.  If I use an app the battery lasts less then 3 hours. So I called HTC customer service and they suggested I should turn off pretty much everything and only turn on when I want to actively use it.  So, I asked what's the point in having a smart phone if I have to turn it all off and they replied that would be the way to make the battery last longer.  Now when I receive a phone call the caller can't hear me speak.  So I call customer service again and they have me go through a bunch of different tests to see if what's wrong.  Can't figure it out so he tells me he will open an inquiry and I should check for software updates daily to see if they send me one.  After 3 days of no updates I call again.  She has no clue what I'm talking about so I have to do the tests again.  Now they want me to send the phone in and within 7-10 days they may have an answer.  So with shipping it could be 2 weeks without any phone.  And they don't supply a loaner phone.  Who goes 2 weeks without having a phone I asked.  No response.  BTW this phone is still under warranty.  Also, I tried to post this review on the HTC site but they emailed me and said they don't allow critical reviews to be posted.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "OMG, WOW...BEST HTC PHONE YET...ITS THE 1...LOL", "Author": "CHEF CROMER", "ReviewID": "R14WRJC0U0ZUCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ONLY PART U MAY NOT LIKE IS THE FACT IT WILL NOT EXCEPT EXTERNAL MICROSD CARD, ONLY COMES WITH 16GIGS OF MEMORY...AN THATS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, UNLESS UR N2 DOWNLOADING MUSIC VIDEO'S(WHICH TAKE UP A LOT OF MEMORY)....BUT FOR MUSIC, ITS REALLY GOOD...CONNECT AND DOWNLOAD & SHARE IS REALLY EASY TOO...AS FAR BLUTOOTH PAIRING, IT A DREAM, BUT HERE'S THE SITUATION, IF U WANT TO TRANSFER UR CONTACTS FROM PREVIOUS PHONE, TO THIS NEW HTC 1 MINI, THEN THATS SO SERIOUSLY EASY TO DO...IT HAS A TRANSFER APP IN THE SETTINGS DEPT.....I WAS UNAWARE @ 1ST, BUT SOON CAUGHT ON...HERES WHATS FUNNY, MY PEOPLES KEPT SAYING\"NO,GET THE SAMSUNG GALX4\", BUT I ONCE AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME REFUSED!
