Get one while you can!  I owned one for 4 years and it worked perfectly. No dropped calls, long battery life, very easy to use and no awkward GUI or menu issues, crapware or pre-programmed button nonsense.PRO: very good call quality, inexpensive, solid construction, survived many many drops and one \"cleaning\" by a 4 year old (with toothpaste), has many features of a smart phone without having to have a smart phone and data plan. auto rotating onscreen keyboard and photo/video viewing works better than on many 'droid phones i've seen. bluetooth file transfer to and from computer and other devices is the easiest i've ever used on any device. if you WANT to use it as a wi-fi hotspot, as I did once for an emergency, you can, and it's really easy to do. of course the whole idea of this phone is that you don't WANT a smart phone with expensive data plan, but just know that you can do it if you need to. Overall, it's the best all-around \"I just need a phone, dammit!\" phone I've ever used.CON: don't get it wet. that's what killed mine, so I got another to replace it. camera quality is just okay, but it does have a night mode that helps. no headphone jack, but of course you can use a bluetooth headset or bluetooth hands-free system with it in the car or whatever.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG SOLSTICE ii NOT WHAT I EXPRECTED", "Author": "Marty Surprise", "ReviewID": "R21JTHUXEONJ28", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not ready for a smart phone. This appeared to be last stop before. I do not text, web or e-mail from phone. When using bluetooth headset, phone still sounds alerts for calls, alarms, messages, etc. It does drop calls as reported in reviews read prior to purchase; sometimes it is uninteligible, Previous phone (Motorola Karma QA1) died of old age after 8 years, and I tried substituting an unlocked one--since it was for another mfg, it did not support all the AT&T; features I needed and was a washout. The Solstice II IS an AT&T; phone and, therefore, should work well (You'd think), but it doesn't. I am attempting to master it, but at the same time, still searching for a phone that will meet my needs and execute the programs successfully. Any suggestions appreciated. I am going to check into the Samsung Eternity II, a sister phone of the Solstice II.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "3.0\" touch screen phone with TouchWiz 2.0\nComplete Multimedia package\nCustomizable home screens with widget shortcuts and applications\nSocial Connected", "Name": "AT&T Samsung Solstice II A817 No Contract 3G GSM Camera Touch Music Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JfPMkZ8sL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B1JTTV0"}}
