I dont think u need to read more. If you want a phone with good battery life, easy to write sms, and good for calling... And with a decent phone camera. I think you wont find a better phone.This phone has survived several stuff and still works fine. I was throw to a pool with the phone in my pocket.. Came back to life, after 2 days in the sun, and bag of rice. Suicide to the toilet by vibrating to much... Came back after 3 days. Several times when i was angry i throw the phone to the wall, breaks in phone, battery, and case.. armed back together and working fine... I even droped when my car was moving... nothing happend...Even after 5 years, my battery works for a whole day, without been charging.. In its first years, it lasted 3 - 4 days... But you know, after 5 years, i dunno how still works.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Long term review: Excellent value for money", "Author": "Tarikh Jumeer \"Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZN0D77GLM37D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the E63 since its launch 3 years ago. This phone was great underrated because there was the infamous overshadowing it. Yet the E63 was not unworthy at all. In many ways it surpassed the E71. The hype about the E71 was due to its thinness and metal parts. But otherwise apart from a few features, the E63 was a much better phone. The keypad is far better on the E63, plus you do have more buttons and the space bar serves also as a button to ligt up the torch, which can be a valuable tool in some cases.As far as connectivity goes, the E63 is pretty much complete. A businessman will be more than satisfied of its features.I will not list all the qualities of this phone, you'd find it elsewhere but as a long term owner, I'd like to point out that the tiny doors that cover the USB and card entry fall off with time.Also the sound is not too great compared to other phones.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warranty Is Not Certain", "Author": "JRICKEY", "ReviewID": "R2YY8MIULCGM93", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had asked a question through Amazon whether the normal Nokia warranty was valid for this new phone.  There was no reply from the seller or any other buyer.  Purchased from Scharter Store via Amazon, there's no indication in the box that there is a warranty.  In fact, the user's guide is very thin and there are indications (e.g., picture of phone within the user's guide did not print) that the user guide is not an original.  In spite of that, this is my second E63, the other of which I've had for three years (bought in the Philippines), a great phone.  The jury is still out on the warranty.  If something goes wrong, we'll see.  So, if it's the warranty you're interested in, I would not buy this phone from Scharter Store.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "calidad total", "Author": "no good", "ReviewID": "R1RD2SVL27K2GS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "celular espectacular que en mi pais es dificil de conseguir cubriendo todas las espectativas estoy sumamente agradado los recomiendo plenamente y con confianza", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Nokia E63 GSM Quadband QWERTY Phone (Unlocked) Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xz6XjirbL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004D2LTTM"}}
