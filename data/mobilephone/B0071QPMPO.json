Wills \"AzNetCowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1S113ZT4DH401", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given this phone a higher rating, but it was listed a NEW and it was not. The box had been previously opened before my receiving it. I liked the dual keyboards and the fact it quickly sync'ed up with the MS SYNC in my Ford. However, the flaws that made me finally return it were:1) The SIM card from my old AT&T; phone didn't work as it should. I had to manually, one at a time, copy my SIM contacts to the phone and edit them. Lots of time wasted here.2) the limitation on the external memory on this newer model phone were restricted to 2GB, but my microSD had 8GB and was not recognized. My older Pantech had no problems with the 8GB card.3) The fact that I had to pay the shipping back to Phones, Etc. I am admittedly unhappy with that, but I did so anyway. It was not a \"Prime\" listed phone, so I bit the bullet.There is a caveat to #3. They had no problems with my returning the phone. I have ordered another phone from them and this time I made sure I order a \"Prime\" listed phone.UPDATE (01/17/2013):After further communications with Phone Etc., I realize my comment about the phone not being new was incorrect. I do not know how a phone is unlocked, but they assured me it was new and it was necessary to open the box to unlock the phone. For this error on my part I owe an apology to Phone Etc.I also updated my review of the Pantech Duo C810 cell phone from 3 stars to four stars. For most people ordering this phone, the things I found annoying and problematic won't be for them", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0071QPMPO"}}
