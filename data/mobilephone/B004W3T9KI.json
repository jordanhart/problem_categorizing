If you want to get on the internet or download apps buy an Iphone, this is a Nokia. This phone is what you want in a basic+ phone. It makes great phone calls, text messages, and has a slot for a micro SD card. It's a top of the line bottom of the line phone, and if thats what you're looking for (because their almost impossible to find anymore) than you've found it.I will warn you that to send and receive picture messages on this phone requires that you google the instructions on how to do that before it will work. It's very simple, but slightly annoying that you have to do it in the first place. I have been told that it is because it is an unlocked phone, so you have to tell the phone what service provider you have before it will send media. Once again you can find this information on google.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE!!!!!", "Author": "Joe Davis", "ReviewID": "R2A8SFTKG8HHPD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone I received is not this phone pictured!!! Yes it is a Nokia C3-01 but it is a Telus prepaid cell phone that is gray. Looks like something you would buy at a convienant store. On the back it says \"This phone can only be activated on the Telus network\".VERY DISAPPOINTING. I will be getting a refund ($199) PLUS filing a complaint with whoever I can.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not USA", "Author": "isha821", "ReviewID": "R22T2SBMKU69PC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these a year ago from Nokia and I loved it...but it recently broke. Nokia no longer sells these and I was sooooooooooooooo happy when I found this one. That happiness was very short lived. I received this phone and to my extreme disappointment/frustration the phone is not for the USA. All of the time zone options are for a different country. I had to return the phone and I wasn't reimbursed the return shipping cost. I was told by the third party company who actually sent the phone that amazon would reimburse me the return shipping cost. That didn't happen! Horrible customer service by amazon! I have been a long time loyal customer of amazon and I am very upset with the whole thing! Why would you advertise this product and not specifically have on there that IT IS NOT A U.S.VERSION?!! It isn't fair to me and the rest of your customers!!! This has definitely detered me from shopping with amazon.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "NOKIA C3-01 SILVER EDITION TOUCH AND TYPE FACTORY UNLOCKED GSM", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gyjg3-T7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004W3T9KI"}}
