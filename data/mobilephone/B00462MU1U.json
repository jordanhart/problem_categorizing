My son had one like this so he has been helpful.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

Actually, I sent message to ask before order it, and got a answer that it is a brand new one. However, when I received it, I found several evidence that it is a used one or refurbished one. For example,  (1) There are tiny two scratches on the flash light and one the frame;  (2) The left up corner of the body has surface fatigue.  (3)  Also, I can found some pictures in the installed 2G micro Memory card. I guess that she must be the previous holder of this cell phone.Since it work well and it is not expensive, it is not deserve to return. But I would like to suggest the prompte the quality of service in the future. About this cell phone, I would like to say this type of Motorola cell phone is good enough with this price. The 8M camera is a competitive point for selling although the speed of taking picture is lower than my previous 955. The screen is large out of my imagination. If it also has touch functional button as 955, it will be very great. Thanks.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "C.

I have since been having issues with various items and have heard they are typical of this particular model. The problems are more annoying than critical, ie occasionally freezing, too unstable to use if plugged in, etc. Patience and resets usually take care of it and the price is awsome.

In the beginning I was happy with it. The problems started later. The battery cover keeps on falling off, the battery life is very short and when typing, the keys just freeze. For whatever reason, the phone decides to reboot once in a while. (could not figure out why) It takes time till the camera reminds itself that you ordered its service and by the time its up-and-running, my baby crawled away.I had contacted the seller and they sent me a new battery cover. When I complained about the short battery life, they offered a replacement phone. They kept on repeating I should not leave bad reviews so I held back. But by now I decided to write one because I don't want people should be fooled into buying this phone.Although this is one of the cheaper smartphones out there, it pays to spend that extra money for a better phone.Good luck!!(I know its very hard to make a decision with so many choices and peoples reviews)", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Pammy", "ReviewID": "R3LWJEIXA01W5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 1st smart phone.
