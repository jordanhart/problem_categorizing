A simple, reliable phone for calling, texting and taking pictures.  Screen is very small, but they still make cameras for important pictures, so I'm very happy with this one.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Spiffy little fliphone", "Author": "Rangergirl", "ReviewID": "R2APSSN4OQAHSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my father. My parents are older and not tech savvy, so these fliphones are perfect for them. I set them up fairly easily and the folks are good to go. It's hard finding cell phones for the older set who might have trouble seeing and handling other kinds of phones.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone for an aging parent who can't handle a smart phone.", "Author": "Rubah Latrans", "ReviewID": "RMGPI3IJWKKV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my mom after her last phone finally died. She loves the flip phone design for some reason as I suggested a candy bar style one instead but she wouldn't have any of it. The large buttons make for easy dialing even without her glasses, the screen still requires her to get her glasses out to see properly. If you're looking for a plain and simple \"dumb phone\" for just calling and SMS texting this thing is perfect. I just hope they keep making phones like this because not everyone can use a smart phone easily.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E9W7SN2"}}
