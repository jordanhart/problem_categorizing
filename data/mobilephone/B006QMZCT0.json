{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Twice As Nice!", "Author": "Tara Duckworth", "ReviewID": "R1HHH7FXXI1MC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone so much!  I had this phone for 2 1/2 years before I started having any difficulties with it.  The problem that it started having was that it would turn off occasionally while in the middle of sending a text message.  And that only began after 2 years of flawless performance.  I had no other issues with this phone and have loved it so much that I purchased the exact same phone again from Amazon.  I couldn't be happier with this product!  I have no use for a smart phone and I really don't care for touch screens.  This phone has an excellent slide out keyboard that's wonderful for frequent texters.  The camera serves its purpose and I've taken some nice outdoor pictures, but it's nothing spectacular.  The volume and call quality have always been top-notch on this phone and I will continue to use this brand/model as long as LG keeps them in stock.  :-)  But if this one lasts as long as my first one, I won't have to worry about replacing it for over 2 years!  I would recommend this phone to everyone who likes talk A LOT and text A LOT.  It's PERFECT!!!", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad phone", "Author": "E.

This is not a good phone though we were specifically looking for a phone which does not require a data plan and this one fits the bill.

Because the ph isn't working properly,it doesn't personalize the menu or ringtones or the IM Messenger doesn't  function n I look into that info before I consider buying the ph,because that was my choice of  functions i wanted the phone to have,n the multimedia messaging didn't work either until my provider help me set it in the correct setting,and to top it off this is the second item I received because i sent the first one back,hoping to get an exchange for a working phone,which didn't happen,this is very disappointing,n I happen to order covers for this phone which I paid over 40.00 for, and I have used this brand of phone before 3 times n never had these issue. This is all I can say about this product n I'm being totally honest about the product. So u decide if you want this type of product before you purchase it.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "These phones broke within a week of purchasing.", "Author": "Penelope", "ReviewID": "R3O03MH8SMY94", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these phones for my kids.

I would call my voicemail, and the message would be partially over before I could hear anything - this became a consistent problem.  Then, a text messages sent to me didn't show up for days.  Finally, I had a voice message, but the phone didn't ring, and I didn't show the missed call.

Enjoyed a great time texting!-Pretty neat looking phone, not cheap looking-Easy to work with-A really good choice, IF you are ONLY using it for TEMPORARY-Sound is pretty good for a pre-paid phoneCON:-Wouldn't last PERFECTLY for a year (I GUARANTEE)At first I loved this phone because it was everything I expected, except the vibrate sound scares me, because it sound like this phone could break anytime!Until about half a year, it started to have some minor glitches. Til about a year, this phone started to turn off or freeze randomly, and when you slide the keyboard, the screen wouldn't turn. That's when I started to regret not listening to these reviews... It's BAD for a reason-Can't use ring tones unless they are less than 17 seconds-Only holds up to 500 Messages, can't use memory card to solve the problemI am a big texter, so it's a pretty big disadvantage-Slowwwwwwww-Locked to ATTYou get signals in other countries, but you can't use SIM cards other that ATTAfter using it for more than a year... In conclusion... In most cases... DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG GT365 Review", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R1DYBLM3JX5E7G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone arrived promptly. I had to erase all of the numbers that had been in the phone previously which was interesting because the seller didn't seem to be concerned about data security. The phone is in pretty decent condition with normal scuff marks on it. A negative is that the phone randomly turns off during the day. Sometimes the phone freezes up and the only way to get it to work again is to remove the battery completely and then turn it on. It drops calls frequently and after much persuasion from family and friends, who are tired of calling back 3-4 times to deal with phone issues on my end, I am going to look into getting another phone. This phone was not in good enough condition to be sold for re-use.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it", "Author": "Shakima Plunkett", "ReviewID": "R2THHJQA7ZAU52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only used this phone for a short period of time before I got another one so I'm bummed about that.

The call quality is terrible, both trying to hear people clearly and being heard clearly and no, its not a coverage problem. The phone shuts itself off constantly if you slide it open, or close it too quickly. If someone texts you and you don't have them as a contact, you cant just automatically add them. You have to memorize or write the number down, then go into contacts and manually add them.This is the worst phone I have EVER owned.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "kaykay", "ReviewID": "RC3M06GJPMW1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone unlocked for my mom who was spending time in Jamaica. it was a easy start up the local chip was place in the phone and it was ready in seconds. definitely worth the cost.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, horrible camera", "Author": "S. Roberts", "ReviewID": "R1H9O9IVF26AND", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "See update at bottom...Over the past few months I have tried over a half dozen phones and finally found a good one. It's not a smartphone, doesn't have a touch screen, but it is very nice.This phone is pretty small, but comfortable to hold. One thing I liked was that I put in my sim card, the battery, turned it on and it worked. I have no problem with setting up a phone, but I have tried so many that didn't work the way they were supposed to, I liked that this worked immediately.The keyboard slides out as shown, and I was impressed that the entire keyboard is backlit and all keys are easy to see. It is comfortable to input text, each key is slightly raised and rounded so I feel the key as i press it. Also, the keys are spread out enough so I don't hit more than one at a time.This is an AT&T; phone and I have TMobile, and my sim card works fine.It has a micro SD slot on the outside of the phone so I don't have to take the phone apart to remove the card.It has more alarms than I need. I set three and there are more available.I haven't tried the camera yet but there are adjustments to the resolution. One button on the side brings up the camera. I did notice that I can send at least two pictures in each message. There is no flash but it seems to adjust to the light.I am finding more features, like shortcut keys that are programmable.There is only one problem. Picture messages are set up for AT&T;, not for T-Mobile. I have googled this and have not been able to make this change. Hopefully I will because this is how I transfer photos I take.This is my second LG phone and I loved the other one too, except that the other one didn't have a keyboard. Next time I need a new phone, I will search for another LG. They obviously put thought into their phones. It is easy to use, has all features I need, good quality, stylish, and a great price.March 11- I downgraded my review and am replacing this phone. If you care at all about the camera, read on...Last night we ran into someone very important to my grandson, a celebrity writer, who he has named after. We heard he was very nice so we waited by his car for over two hours to say hi. He was extremely nice and said we could take a picture of him with my grandson. It was around 9pm and dark out. The first photo i took with this phone came out black. He suggested we go into a lighted doorway. The picture taken with this phone is so dark, I can hardly tell who it is. The celebrity was so nice he said he will see us when he comes back to town, but this could have been a once in a lifetime experience. And my camera had no auto focus, no flash, no other settings. As far as I am concerned, this phone is now trash.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
