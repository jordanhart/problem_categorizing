Internet is pretty fast. my phone is unlocked & it was able to operate flawlessly when I inserted two different SIMS (one at a time). I noticed that sometimes there can be a lag on the phone because of the apps running but when the cache is cleared it usually solves the problem. Google play was preloaded onto the phone so that I could download the apps like FB, netflix that everyone needs. It has a front facing camera (priceless) & takes decent pictures. The flash can be turned on & off when needed. The touchscreen is very responsive & battery life is ok. I can't go into a lot of technical details like the gurus but this phone does the job if you are looking for a phone that has great features but is budget friendly.

The phones arrived in two days (1/15/14), but the box and the phones themselves look a bit different from the phone that I ordered less than two weeks ago.  Instead of from Huawei, the logo is 'telecom' on both the box and the phone.  These two phones look very similar to the original Huawei as well.  I am pretty sure these are counterfeit ones, they are fake.  So be careful and before you add this item to the shopping cart, choose the seller 'Wireless Experts, Inc.' instead.

This is my first smartphone, although I've briefly used other peoples higher end phones (IPhone, Samsung Galaxy S3).I am not a heavy user, so it is a perfect fit, but so far am very pleased with what I can do.  I mainly use the GMail app, feedly RSS reader, Chrome browser, Sipdroid, and of course the phone and messaging as well.  Occasionally use the camera, and while not super high quality photos, decent for a point and click.I haven't tried any games and probably won't, but for all of these activities the phone is responsive, and works well.  Sometimes if too many apps are open at once, it does get a little \"laggy\" because of the low memory, but simply holding down the home key will show you the apps running and memory used and I can close ones I don't need.All in all, I'm very pleased.

No problems connecting the phone and using the internet.  With Orange due to the active bands on this phone, you will only get 2G. I believe with Claro 3G might be possible, but the phone works well in D.R. Just in case anyone is wondering.  Your best bet is to check what frequency bands work with the company you wish to use your phone with and that will tell you wether you will have 2G or 3G.  The wifi on the phone Also works great!
