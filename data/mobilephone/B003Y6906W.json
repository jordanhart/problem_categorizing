Though poorly packaged, the item is new [I think...], except for the battery and a tiny piece of rubber that's supposed to be covering a screw for vanity reason. The battery was in the box with the rest of the stuff unprotected/unwrapped with minor stains/dents. The original packaging from sony ericsson is very generic. There is no model number/serial with photos on box as you would expect if purchased from a sony store. The owner's manual is a generic one, not printed for any particular models. Inside, the phone/accessories [ie; battery, charger, lid] were tossed together like a salad, nothing was securely in their proper slot. I am not sure if that's how it came in from the manufacturer [sony ericsson] to the wholesaler, but this purchase could easily be mistaken for being used or refurbished. Fact, I check my purchase details several times upon receiving the package just to make sure I purchased a 'NEW' item vs used or refurbished. Nothing personal, but I'd think twice about this company before purchasing from them again. As for now, I am content with the item 'cause it works. Im keeping my fingers crossed hoping that it will hold up like a sony ericsson and not breakdown on me because it was mishandled by a third party, or it was used/refurbished and listed as new. For what it's worth, thank you UnlockedCellPhoneKings.

Dowson \"not a product of her environment\"", "ReviewID": "RDKYPEO7H30RF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First phone I've ever had break, at it's hinge. After... maybe 2 years. It has a great camera, which takes much better pics (in all kinds of light) than any iphones I've used, but with the unreinforced plastic at a place that gets the most use? Like much of Sony's design, it looks good, but doesn't cut it. I can still take pics of course, and make calls, but the phone flips like a broken cat tail. So. Not terribly useful. The plastic just gave way one day & was half off the next, and there's nothing to it. Since this is the only part of the phone that moves, it's a real bad call on Sony's part. Boo.Also it is as slow as everyone says it is, and you have to go through at least 3 steps to delete things. It's tedious. But I loved having a phone that really does travel and takes great pics. It's great for that.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "juan carlos granadillo", "ReviewID": "R3F53E6Q8MMNFW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "well almost all good sizes as some of you forgot to inform buyers Deveria be sincere because the battery was good for nothing, and other details but good thanks", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003Y6906W"}}
