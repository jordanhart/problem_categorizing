Lamanna", "ReviewID": "R2K7N6YM8TKN6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works.  Its pretty.  Its fast.It isn't android, but not everyone gets in to customizing a phone.  I personally like the ability to pick up and use.  Some phones require lessons before you feel comfortable. Not the iphone.  My favorite feature is the facetime front facing camera.  Its easy to use.  Navigation pre installed. Plenty of free apps.The screen is a truly beautiful thing.  You have to see it to believe it.  If you are into gaming on your Iphone then you will appreciate the power behind this device.  Without getting technical I will say RageHD is the best looking game on any phone... period.  It rivals the graphics of some console games.  Overall the Iphone 4 is fun to use and I think you will enjoy it.  I'm not sure what the other reviewer has against the phones personally but this is my review.  Take it from a person that started with windows mobile and used android for years.  If you like apple you will love this.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVVVVEEEEEEEE My Iphone", "Author": "Jo Ann", "ReviewID": "R2IGYBW6NQB25H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my iphone 4 the day i was told it would come.

Apple continues to be the leading manufacturer in consumer electronics, especially the phone industry. This phone shipped with iOS 4.0, and Apple's still taking it with them to iOS 7, and that's awesome. With a 5 MegaPixel camera sensor, and an autofocus lens with flash, and 720p Video @ 24 fps, Photo quality is beautiful. Yes, it does lag a little bit when I have a lot of background apps running, and when they're gone, the Phone feels as good as new even with all the extraneous apps I've packed into it. Every time I turn it on I smile to myself at how beautiful this thing is, and how nice it feels in your hand. Yes, from the outside it might look like it might be uncomfortable to hold seeing it has not smooth or curved edges, but actually the stainless steel antenna/band provides both a tapered design element, and a grip for both large and small hands. The glass on this phone surpasses the entire device except for the little strip of steel running all the way around, and that adds a sort of ambience to it when you look at it. Also, the battery life is amazing. I easily use this for up to 24 hours while just calling, texting, checking my feeds, and watching the occasional YouTube video.

Apple continues to be the leading manufacturer in consumer electronics, especially the phone industry. This phone shipped with iOS 4.0, and Apple's still taking it with them to iOS 7, and that's awesome. With a 5 MegaPixel camera sensor, and an autofocus lens with flash, and 720p Video @ 24 fps, Photo quality is beautiful. Yes, it does lag a little bit when I have a lot of background apps running, and when they're gone, the Phone feels as good as new even with all the extraneous apps I've packed into it. Every time I turn it on I smile to myself at how beautiful this thing is, and how nice it feels in your hand. Yes, from the outside it might look like it might be uncomfortable to hold seeing it has not smooth or curved edges, but actually the stainless steel antenna/band provides both a tapered design element, and a grip for both large and small hands. The glass on this phone surpasses the entire device except for the little strip of steel running all the way around, and that adds a sort of ambience to it when you look at it. Also, the battery life is amazing. I easily use this for up to 24 hours while just calling, texting, checking my feeds, and watching the occasional YouTube video. This phone is a great buy, and is just another Apple miracle.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great customer service", "Author": "Naya", "ReviewID": "R2VVJ5E8L83502", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did buy a phone from them, it was broken and I paid for the repair.

The 4S is not worth getting for one new minor feature voice control.  I have 8 Gb (6.2 gb) small but it is good enough.  The 3G is easy to burn through your data plan but that's with all 2010 up smart phones.  Battery runs out every two days if you use it regularly.  1/2 a day if your a text-addict ( like every body if the world).  But again every smart phone 2010 up runs through batteries.  Buy a case I suggest outer box not big for designs but most protective.  It has different colors thought.  Most apps work with 3G.  And Verizon Wireless has 5 to 4 bars in New England. Oh two differences 4s has better pictures not much different but if your into tacking a million pictures you want the 4s.
