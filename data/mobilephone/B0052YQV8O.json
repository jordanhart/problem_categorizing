{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Totally what I expected...", "Author": "xtremesv", "ReviewID": "R28KCDMKC3FZU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I was undecided, my options were the Motorola Atrix, Inspire 4G and the Infuse 4G. I owned a Samsung Captivate and loved it, save for the GPS, everything was nice so you may think my comment is a little biased. The Atrix has a dual core, more RAM and it was cheaper, but I read bad things about a heating problem, bad battery life and the burdensome of MotoBlur, I suppose most of those cons were fixed with the recent Gingerbread update, so what I'm saying may or may not be valid anymore. The Inspire 4G was attractive, I'd always read good things about the handcrafted quality put on HTC's devices, hardware and software wise. The big letdown was the small battery (only 1230 mAh) and less storage capacity. At the end, I was used to a Samsung smartphone which was reliable and there I had the Infuse that was the middle brother between the Captivate and the Galaxy S II and even I considered the former I concluded I wasn't going to pay $180 more for a smartphone that was going to be a second faster than a single-core one, besides most of my utility for this kind of device is browsing and music. Before buying the Infuse I was afraid of its size, I thought it wasn't going to be that portable or comfortable to handle. That fear disappeared once I held the device for the first time, most of the reviews praise the slim factor but for me it wasn't too noticeable compared to the Captivate which is a very slim phone also. The main reason it felt so good in the hand is the design, specifically the edges which are squarer and plainer than the Captivate, besides the up bezel is narrower. The tight jeans were the final test, it slid without problem and I couldn't tell the difference between the Infuse and the Captivate. The Infuse offers a splendid 4.5\" Super AMOLED Plus display, same tech than GSII but 0.2\" larger. The camera is 8 MP and it delivers very good quality (I'm not sure but I read it uses the same optics than GSII). The battery is not great but it is above average among smartphones, with my Captivate, considering same usage pattern, batt lasted 10 hours compared to 12 hours with the Infuse. I use my phone as my primary music player, so sound quality is pretty important for me. The Infuse relies on the Wolfson audio chip (the same on the Captivate), which can be greatly optimized using the Voodoo Sound app on the market; I read this audio chip is superior to the one on the GSII (Yamaha branded). Even though the Infuse is still single core, with the same central and graphics processors than the Captivate, the CPU has been overclocked 20%, I believe this increment plus some software optimizations give a better user experience than the Captivate, the interface is butter smooth, I've noticed little to none sluggishness. I'm not a hardcore mobile gamer so I can't guarantee the Infuse will play the most demanding games out there, but for the casual gamer, the Infuse is powerful enough. The browser is the typical Android webkit based, in my opinion it lacks functionality though it's snappy, I recommend Dolphin HD browser, free on the market. Flash HD video playback on the browser is not good enough due to constant framerate drop, however Flash banners play well (but who wants to see Flash ads). I haven't been lucky with GPS, the Infuse has a hard time trying to get a satellite lock, maybe it's just my case because some people are reporting good GPS performance on forums. Some people regret that the Infuse comes with Froyo and no Gingerbread, personally having installed several Gingerbread custom ROMs on my Captivate, I haven't missed GB a bit, the Infuse Froyo build is so stable and the improvements between the two versions aren't apparent to the final user anyway. Bottom line, if you are into browsing and music, I do recommend the Infuse hands down due to its responsive user interface, large beautiful screen, rich audio output, excellent casual camera and good battery life. On the other hand, if you are a heavy multitasker and hardcore gamer or you just simply must have la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, you should buy a Galaxy S II.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone!!!", "Author": "TREK \"Anyone can follow, only one can lead\"", "ReviewID": "R1UTU0SVTP6KWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a former Nokia user, i must say that this is a wonderful new experience for me. This phone is really great and the Android OS is amazing.PROS:- The screen get nothing less than 5 stars. The definition is awesome, the touch interface works great, and the AMOLED protects it from everything.- The processor is awesome. 1.2GHz lets me run many apps at the same time without problems.- The on screen widgets are very useful, but if you place too many of them your battery won't last half a day.- Thousands of apps!!! Really!!!- Angry birds is still free!!!- The weight is unnoticeable.CONS:- It comes with OS 2.2, and the AT&T; crew has not yet released an update.- The AT&T; personalization of the OS is nothing but problems. I had to root the device to be able to use tethering, and also it comes with many completely useless AT&T; apps.- Tha battery life is not as expected, on forums i read that OS 2.3 fixes this but AT&T; still hasn't released this.- The GPS is a problem, it's accuracy is not that good and it takes too long to get a fix.- The structure is made completely of plastic, that gives it the light weight, but it also makes it fragile. A case is recommended. I own two, a slim one for daily use, and a Ballistic hard case for outdoors activities.I hope you find this review of help.Regards:AM", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"NOT\" As advertised........", "Author": "ITLITE", "ReviewID": "R3M795M8F4AHX6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item received was a used, open box, old model{UCKE3}, AT&T; cellphone that had been re-taped with clear tape to look new.

Once the plug was removed the phone would either power up on its own or I would have to turn the unit back on.  The purchase date was May 28, 2012 through Amazon.com.On January 3, 2013, I contacted Samsung customer service and sent the phone in for repair under repair ticket number 4117532029.Samsung denied my warranty claim.  Samsung claimed the phone suffered corrosion damage due to exposure to moisture.  This claim was untrue since the phone has not been subjected to any moisture other than the humidity of the atmosphere.The phone operates fine other than the charging problem.  I just change batteries to continue use.  I purchased a spare battery and a stand alone battery charger.If the phone had true water damage then it would not operate at all.I'm disappointed to find there is no appeal process to contest this decision by Samsung.  It seems Samsung pays a guy in Texas to say all the phones have moisture problems to same millions of dollars in repairs.Any moisture problem is actually caused by a design flaw from the manufacturer.If this connection bay/port is subject to moisture damage from only exposure to the atmosphere then Samsung should have protected  the bay/port in the design of the phone by having a rubber cover or door like many other phones.The phone cost $300.00.  That money is now wasted on a worthless phone since Samsung has refused to honor their warranty and has designed a defective phone from the start.Samsung has made a false claim about moisture issues to avoid their responsibility.

For instance, I've tried to run GTA3, Mass Effect, NOVA 3 - these games are too cool for the infuse - if you prefer mobile gaming, you've better to look to the Samsung Nexus side. :)I prefer small arcade games - cut the rope, angry birds, NFS hot pursuit, real racing... These ones work great without any lags!Recently, I've updated the firmware to the gingerbread - I can't say that I find any big difference, except one - wallpaper became not scrollable((( And it was the main reason of switching to the LauncherPro :)Hope, Samsung will issue Ice Cream Sandwich for the Infuse, but, anyway, unofficial roms are already available...I wanted to get a big display - and I've got it - it's really clear and sharp - the picture is amazing. Working with text docs, web-browsing, watching movies are the fortes of this device. 4.5 inches screen is quite enough for movies - I don't believe, you need bigger - if so - Samsung Note :)Sound is really loud - you will not miss your incoming call. GPS works fine. The phone is big - consider it, if you're not able to check it alive, nevertheless it's very light. Build quality is very nice - plastic is very strong, phone looks very reliable.My is unlocked, so I'm using it with T-Mobile without any problems.Summarizing, I can say that this device costs every dollar, you'll pay for it -  I love it for my everyday use. But this is not top Samsung's cell, so you will not be able to play extreme 3d games - it's the only con as for me.

It has often required rebooting numerous times in order to make a call and sometimes it has taken me as much as 10 minutes to place a call. If I needed this phone in an emergency, I'd be in deep trouble. Additionally, it has the worst phone interface I have ever used. It takes forever to look up your contacts and it's often actually easier to memorize numbers and dial them directly - if the phone doesn't hang or die while you're doing it. Also, it's wifi reception is next to non-existent. I nearly have to place the phone directly next to the router to get any kind of a signal at all. Also, it is actually slower than my Nokia symbian phone was at many things. You need special and expensive software to sync this phone with a computer. This software usually doesn't work, though it has gotten a little better over the last year. The GPS is completely unusable. On the rare occasion you can get a fix at all, it is not accurate to better than a one mile radius without using network assistance. On the upside, it works remarkably well for playing solitaire - the downside is that it doesn't really do anything else useful. I got this phone thinking it would be useful when backpacking or hunting, but I honestly think I'd be better off with a 1950's Bell desk phone. At least it would have the heft and durability to do some real damage to small game if thrown accurately.No amount of money would ever persuade me to own a Samsung product again or, for that matter, another Android phone as these problems are partially the fault of terrible hardware design and partially the fault of another half-developed Google product.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "mrogers67", "ReviewID": "R2UMJZL27A2AO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure why there are so many flamers on here calling this phone crap.

But the phone, in and of itself, is exceptionally terrible. I got my first Samsung Infuse for Christmas 2011. By Christmas 2012 I had been through 6 Infuses. Seriously, 6 of the same cell phone within a year. And technically, by Christmas, I was using a Motorola Axis instead--a much more stable device. Now, the reason I got the same crap phone 6 consecutive times was because it was the only thing my warranty covered for free through AT&T;, and I hadn't the money to get anything else. Addmitedly, I am probably more rough on my phones than the average person. I get that. But I have owned phones for years--including the prehistoric \"bricks,\" and I have never had more problems with an electronic device than I have had with this one.So, I assume it's time to tell you WHAT exactly is wrong with this phone. The issue in its entirety is regarding durability. The phone's capabilities, the camera, the accessibility and customization--it's all great! But it doesn't even nearly compensate for the utterly pathetic durability. After only a month or so of owning them, two of the phones would recycle the \"Samsung\" logo everytime I attempted to turn them on, the other four would just die anytime I tried to do something as simple as opening an app or swiping the screen a few times.I do not frquent or visit any high risk websites or sketchy apps.

I needed a phone that would work on Net10's AT&T; network and had an active support community for answers, advice and upgrades. I had been an iPhone user but have experience upgrading other Android devices (without a single brick), so I set about to \"de-Apple\" my life. The Infuse is a good (not great) phone by today's standards, with a sharp, bright screen and built-in GPS. With its single core processor and 0.5 GB of RAM it's on the low end of the performance spectrum, but it's fast enough for basic smartphone functions, and can play live streaming sports video when there's a good wifi or 3G/4G signal available. I've also occasionally used it for tethering but I think Net10 and AT&T; frown on that so I try to limit that use and stay under the radar.Battery life is OK. I can usually get a full day's use out of the phone if I take a few precautions, like turning off wifi and 3g when not in use, and dimming the screen.You can speed up the performance a bit and improve the battery life by not using wallpaper, multiple scrolling pages or fancy animation effects (I have a single black home screen with date, weather, news RSS widgets and just my most-used icons). The Infuse has problems with super bloated webpages that a faster phone might deal with better, and the browser will occasionally crash. For me, that's a minor annoyance, but not enough for me to return to the $600 phone, 2-year contract merry-go-round.The best thing about the Infuse is that is still has an active support community on the XDA Developers site. I've been able to upgrade the phone from Gingerbread (2.3) to 4.4.2, KitKat, using ROMs downloaded from the XDA forum. I wouldn't recommend doing that if you're not technically inclined, but it's not as difficult as it seems if you follow the instructions to the letter. Apparently a lot of people still use and like the Infuse, and that's helping keep the support momentum going when other XDA phone forums have gone dormant.I may be upgrading to a dual-core Android phone at some point (an older model of course), but I'm happy with the Infuse. It's no longer state of the art, but for the price it's a good choice, especially if you're able to do the ROM upgrades.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Delivered as promised!", "Author": "Rene Norton", "ReviewID": "R1V98347ODEEDR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My phone was delivered on the first day it was expected.

(Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures.- Wonderful music player app (the stock one was just right and makes great playlists,etc). Sound quality excellent.- Got 4g on the Internet Data.- WiFi came in clear and fast.- Overall a easy to use and perfect size phone and comfortable to hold with big enough screen.Cons:- NO FM Radio. However, I installed Tune In Radio so if I had WiFi on, I could listen to all kinds of radio stations.- Could use more memory, yet it still ran fast for me.Good phone, after owning it for about a year, I upgraded to Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 with 5.3 screen. However, that one was too large and heavy to hold and I upgraded again. However, at times, I kind of miss my old Infuse as it was big enough at 4.5\" and not a heavy phone to hold. And at the price offered, it is a good deal for a nice phone.Also, I am a techie and know a lot about Android devices that is smartphones and tablets, so if you have any questions, please ask me in the comment section.Hope that this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading it.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good,,,,But disappointed with shipper (cell lounge inc)", "Author": "ramlalsingh david", "ReviewID": "RUE5Q773ACJ1Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an outstanding phone i will recommend it to everyone!!....especially because of its gorgeous, vibrant screen...i was very impressed....But very disappointed at cell lounge inc, the shipper....they shipped the product without original charger...no microSD card...no headphones.....no usb cord...and no hdmi dongle.....very disappointed, and all those accessories come included according to samsung and at&t;", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "scottx.nb @ gmail", "ReviewID": "R17GCRL1FD5AD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned this phone for six months as an AT&T; customer.

I don't know if it's me or if I always have bad luck with phones.I have had a Blackberry Torch 9810 and before that I had an iPhone 3G and my last phone was another iPhone 3G and I have to admit that they were all jokes.  When I had my iPhone 3G I dropped it 2 feet above the ground and it completely broke and would cost me alot to fix it.  I just recieved my Samsung Infuse 4G on January 7, 2013.  I know it's probably to early to make a review about it because I only have had it for a day and I admit I was very worried that I would recieve a lemon or something would be wrong with it.  I was wrong! I was so excited when I got it!  It was in immaculate condition! There wasn't a scratch on it anywhere!  There was a brand new black Casemate and screen protector on it.  I was shocked how amazing it looked and to top it off I bought it used-like new for only $130.00!  It was so light that I thought it didn't have a battery in it.  It's screen is 1/2 of an inch bigger than the iPhone 5!  The Samsung Infuse 4G has a massive 4.5 inch touchscreen and the iPhone 5 has only a 4 inch screen.  The iPhone 3G, 4 and 4S only has a 3.5 inch screen.  I know your probably thinking that a half of an inch is nothing but when you do the comparison it's a big deal!  The camera is an amazing 8MP with a front facing camera of 1.3MP and the iPhone 4 and 4s is only a 5MP with a 1MP front camera and the iPhone 3G is only a 2MP with no front camera.  The camera on the Samsung Infuse is touch to focus and takes stunning pictures.  The screen is HD and stunning color and amazing sound also super fast!  I could brag about this phone all day.  I couldn't find one thing wrong with this phone and that's rare for me because I'm very judgemental when it comes to cell phones.  The iPhone is nothing compared to the Samsung Infuse.  If the iPhone battery stops holding a charge it costs an arm and a leg to have a new one put in and alot of time but if the Samsung Infuses' battery won't hold a charge I can buy one for $14.00 and do it myself in 5 seconds.  Although I am going to buy a new case for it because I love the Otterbox Defender Series Case because it's a 3 in 1 protection; first is the hard plastic layer, 2nd is rubber layer over the plastic than the 3rd is a built in screen protector wich is better than a regular screen protector than to top it off it comes with a holster clip.  I give the Samsung Infuse 4G a 5 out of 5 stars-2 thumbs up and HGHLY RECOMMEND!  Don't make another mistake like I did by buying an iPhone just because of the name.

I've used Blackberries and Palm's before and have found the Android interface the be one of the easiest to adapt to so far.This is a well functioning phone for the most part. About once every two or three days the phone will restart itself, but I'm to understand that this is a fairly common problem with Android smartphones. The external speaker quality leaves something to be desired, but more often than not I'm listening to music on my phone through headphones or hooked up to my car speakers.The screen quality is fantastic and is one of the main reasons I decided to purchased this phone. The clarity is excellent and the screen size makes for ease of use. The screen is also very responsive and I've had little to no issues with lag. The 8mg camera takes wonderful photos. Other friends with different Android devices have often had issues with blurry, washed out photos and this just isn't a problem with my phone and I've even stopped carrying around my digital camera in favor of my phone's camera.Call quality is crisp and clear, though sometimes if the phone is pressed too tightly to the side of my face I'll accidentally push the speaker or hold buttons.Battery life is decent if you're not using the phone all day. I can normally get through the entire day on one charge. Though I still carry a car and wall charger with me just in case it's a heavy use day.The phone body is very slim and lightweight. When I first took it out of the box I was shocked and how little it weighed and how fragile it felt! After buying a hybrid case I feel that the phone is a lot sturdier.This phone won't be the same quality as the higher-prices Galaxy line but holds it's own fairly well.

I don't know if it was just that particular phone that had an issue or all the infuse phones use that much power, but it seemed to me that particular phone was running out of power much more quickly than it should have, especially for the limited talk time and apps used. I realize a smart phone, especially with a 4 1/2\" screen uses much more power than a regular cell phone and expected that it would consume more power even if I wasn't using app's., but felt it should not have used that much!  So I returned it to the vendor and got a Samsung Galaxy II and it has about the same screen size and the vendor, Levana's Cellular, was very accommodating and helpful to work with.So far, approximately one week now, the Galaxy has held power extremely well, however, I only have 1 app running so far, and have not had any power issues with it! I do charge it overnight, but go to bed late and have noticed it is almost always on full power till the end of the night around 2am? Very happy, so far!

This is the first time I ever bought something over 300$+. I gotta say it was reckless of me to do so, knowing the fact I didn't know much anything about the seller (abe-123).

And I gotta say, I freak out at first when I hold the package with my hands, because it wasn't that heavy than I though!! So I opened as fast as I could... surprise for me, there was the phone box (which btw, was really well sealed). The reviews aiming to the weights are really true, it feels really light on your hands! So, don't freak out like I did when you get a light package!Anyways, I can't really tell much about this beautiful phone right now cause I just unpacked it. Like, literally right now.
