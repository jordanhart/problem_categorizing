CHECK CAREFULLY.Description for the bands the phone works on are WRONG! It DOES NOT work on 1700/2100 which is necessary for WIND Mobile in Canada.A beautiful phone for someone else but this seller did not check carefully enough what bands this dual sim phone worked on. There are several versions of the Moto G. One sim phones, two sim phones and even different networks thatthey work on. The third-party reseller claims he cannot change the description which seems silly to me. He should have asked Amazon to change it then.Reseller finally refunded my money and shipping although it was like pulling teeth to get it done.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "budget king", "Author": "pumpal", "ReviewID": "R38IGR3NOVLSM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not much left to say about Moto G and this is the dual-sim version.

It's perfect size for my hands, not like one of those huge Samsung Note or similar phones that are waay big for a gal's hands. Fairly simply operation - I have most crucial operations figured out. A few down sides it - it doesn't come with a USB cable so I have to go buy one. The need for this is there is no way to set up your own music as ringtone unless you manage to put the sound clip in the ringtone folder, and unless i am missing something here (and I have googled to see if I am) you can't simply just move or copy/paste anything to the ringtones. I think you have to connect the phone to the computer using USB to do that.The reason I gave only 4 starts is not because of that, though. The phone came with an charger that has a \"Type G\" plug (the type British use), so you need an adapter to charge it whether you are using it in USA or many parts of Asia. I wish this was mentioned in the product details so I could have ordered an adapter also at the same time from Amazon and saved myself the hassle of having to go get one.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PERFORMANCE AT AFFORDABLE PRICE", "Author": "Sampson", "ReviewID": "RHVQPEE3AXRUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All that I will say is that this amazing performance, design, battery life, great HD display, etc, at unbelievably affordable price.It is just great.
