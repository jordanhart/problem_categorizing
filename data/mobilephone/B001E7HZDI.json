And why did it die? Because Sony insists on using their crappy 12-copper pin input/output/power port. After 2 years of being in a pocket, this port gets tarnished and requires daily cleaning. Or in my case the copper pin fell off and I could no longer charge my phone! But at least Sony made these copper pins much Larger in the W980. Cleaning these suckers should be a breeze! The W980 is great for those like me who need both a phone and a mp3 player. I don't need it for extensive texting or web browsing. And the fixed 8GB memory (no SD card here) is plenty since I don't watch videos on a 2-inch screen or need to store my entire collection of mp3s. It sounds/looks great and is a bit expensive for what you get. No new ground being broken here (looks like they saved that for the xperion).", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall good phone", "Author": "J. Hartmann", "ReviewID": "R1NOQTI6SXGJNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone on a whim.  I normally like to go and look at a phone before I buy.  But this time I relied entirely on other peoples comments and online research.  I'm NOT disappointed!  Overall the phone looks good.  It has very simple clean lines and appearance.  If you text...the buttons are small...but spread apart, so they're still seemingly user friendly if you have big thumbs like me.  There's nothing in the way of a \"normal\" ringtone so you'll have to buy one or something.  Navigating through the menus can be tricky.  Items aren't always where you might expect to find them, but the book was helpful for me in that regard.  The software can be slow at times.  it could use the cellphone equivalent to \"more RAM.\" The battery seems great.  I've sent hundreds of texts, listened to hours of music, and spent a couple hours talking all on one charge.  with moderate use i average a charging every 3 days or so.  I had some compatibility issues with the ATT network, I \"Googled\" the problem and was directed to the Sony Ericsson site where they fixed the phone via text message in less than 30 seconds!  amazing if you ask me. It comes with everything you need to put your favorite music into it.  Which sounds excellent with the headphones sony provides.  I like being able to play all my music without opening the phone.  everything can be done on outer display(you can lock the outer display so music doesn't start playing randomly from your pocket) The screen, and photo's you take and look at on it, is crystal clear and sharp.  the camera takes very good photos for a cell phone.  better than my digital camera(which i admit is a little outdated) bottom line...Is it worth the money??  to ME...YES! It's up to you how much value you place on a music playing camera that you can call your friends on.  It's not the BEST at any one of those...but it does them all VERY well in a single devise.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great music cell phone", "Author": "Matias Guastavino", "ReviewID": "R7JBPIXCUMZXR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just what i was looking for.Great sound, 8Gb internal memory!, 3.2 camera, built-in FM transmitter, lots of accesories.I think this cell phone is only for music lovers.Fast Delivery.Overall, ****", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "good phone - awful software", "Author": "Otto Ruthenberg", "ReviewID": "R931ZURFKYCFL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the W980 is well made and sounds excellent - BUT:while listening better dont move, since interference may spoil your listening significantly, so for use on a train or in car skip it for a non-mobile phone mp3 player.you will be become screaming mad trying to organize your music/audiobooks on it. the media manager pro software is absurdly slow (no alternative here) and documentation of common issues (ie how to make a playlist for the w980 on the pc, or how treat audiobooks) is nonexistent.so it is a mixed bag this top walkman phone.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson W980 Walkman Cellphone Review", "Author": "Vivek Sivam \"vwake\"", "ReviewID": "R2PIG0CGGP1GZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall gud product from Sony. Audio quality is superb, easy to use interface. Gud buy considering the 8gb flash memory. The only glitch is you might not like the look when flipopen for the first time.....for the fone that boasts of so much features, and a clean crisper outside,when you flip open the phone it somehow doesnt compliments the look.Still wud recommend it as a gud buy for the value n the features.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "i wanna  buy", "Author": "Tiffany L.
