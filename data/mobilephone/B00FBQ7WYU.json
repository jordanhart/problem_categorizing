I would add, though, that the speakers are unusually good--music sounds surprisingly great, for phone speakers (if you try the phone be sure to enable \"Dolby Digital Plus\"--under \"Sound\"). It would be interesting if the reviewer compared the Nubia speakers to the HTC One speakers (which I have not heard, but hear are also very good).I was considering turning the Nubia back, and getting the Nexus 5. That might make sense for some people--faster processor, LTE. But I don't think I will. Smaller thing: the Nubia is a lovely looking phone, I think. More important (to me): I expect the Nubia camera is significantly better than the Nexus 5 camera, and I expect that the speaker quality of the Nubia is much better as well.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cell phone!", "Author": "Wangmin Yue", "ReviewID": "R3O6BG0CUUGTFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a very beautiful a 5 inch screen with friendly user interface and good function.

Pretty comfortable, slim, top photo, duration greater than many battery.What I regret is not having enough equipment for protection.That made the screen breaks, and unveil that has parts, I have no way to fix the broken screen.I had to buy a new one, and I switched to another brand, which does have support, parts, and accessories.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value and great phone", "Author": "Libero Yang", "ReviewID": "R3MCVGETH1FXG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it deserves my five star ratings! I was suspisicous when heard this is a ZTE phone and doubt the brand and its looks, but now I have to say, great Job, ZTE, you rockit!The experience to open the Amazon box, unpack the Nubia giftbox was great! It is packed neatly. Esp. the accessary box, it is reusable and easy to carry whereever I go!The screen, 5 inch, is fantastic vivid and bright. It is thin and elegent. The camera is also cool, great pics with quick shutter!The software is neat too, typical android experiences. The signal is good( I am with T-Mobile).I thinks this is a more than I pay for the value I get. I used to carry a GS III, and compare these two, spec wise it is almost the same. With the price I payed, it is better value!My friend says the small pity is  it does not support so called 4G LTE. But with the HSPA+, it seems to me there is not a difference when I use Youtube or sending emails.Love this phone!", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "trash phone", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R3PY70HOMHQ61Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "who's going to buy it even if he knows very little of handsets? this price for such a poor spec? Google Nexus 5 has much better spec but only $349.Even Huawei Ascend Mate is much better than it. super battery will matter. the material and quality is much betterdon't waste your money on it", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FBQ7WYU"}}
