Google's moto \"used\" to be don't be evil. That is certainly NOT the case any more. Don't like NSA? Thank Google.Owned one before getting the 1020 with crazy camera. AMAZING phone. Great Photos.Windows 8 is rock solid reliable. And I have used IPhone and Android native email apps and touchdown on both Apple/Android and Windows 8 default email is FAR superior.I still own the Galaxy S4, used to have S2. S2 is superior to S4 imo. Seemed much easier to use. Still W8 phone beats both S2 and S4. S4 is just stupid with feature creep overkill.So in conclusion:W8 Lumia 920, EZ to useW8 Lumia 920, Screen is amazing, Gorilla Glass sooo durable, viewable in full sunlight(try that S4..not happening) I DO NOT use screen protectors and lay this phone screen down with a PECK Candy Shell case all the time, will not slide off my dash with the PECK case.W8 Lumia 920, Pictures are stunning.W8 Lumia 920, Ultra reliable operating system, will not crash(again S4....crashed all the time)W8 Lumia 920, Corporate business email soooooo much better on this phone. Regular email like yahoo, gmail, etc. works fine on this phone. Unlike androids hodge podge of email apps and each one works different.W8 Lumia 920, ONLY phone to buy is a W8 phone, ultra reliable highest quality handset.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 920", "Author": "Nina Johnson", "ReviewID": "R39P6TMH2FP7V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my phone for a few weeks now and I love it.

Laurent \"DDA_TX\"", "ReviewID": "R29GSYSP5A4EX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had a big scare with this phone, which is why I am taking 1 star off. When I turned it on all I could see was a red screen with a white Nokia logo at the top. Being new to WP8 I waited, and waited, did some research online, to no avail, did a soft reset, a hard reset. Nothing but a red screen. Had to go the Nokia website to download the Recovery Program, which for some reason was hard to install, run and make it work on my Windows 8 laptop (at first would not let me install it because W8 thought it was suspicious... doesn't Microsoft own Nokia now??, then the program wouldn't find the phone, then the download would stop after a few seconds or minutes but eventually finished - WAY TOO HARD!), but eventually I was able to re-install the OS and it started. Been working fine since then.Coming from years as an iPhone owner, there are some good and some less good. And WP 8.1 is coming so that should make things better. I am missing some apps but found some decent new ones.Battery is better than on my iPhone 5. Battery saver is useful, so is the ability to block some apps from running in the background.Screen is gorgeous, but that phone is a brick. Geesh, it's heavy. No case on that one!Dedicated phone button works well to wake up the phone and take a pic, but that process is far from quick, takes a few seconds.I have AT&T; by the way.Was able to sync music from iTunes on my Mac (only non-DRM songs).Some odd things. Be prepared to enter your microsoft password a gazillion times - annoying. Phone numbers have to be entered with a +1 to be recognized by sms app, and the mail app doesn't like large inboxes.Coming from an iPhone 5 this is fast enough. Charging takes longer.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Totally Bummed", "Author": "James Anderson", "ReviewID": "R15AWTQLY099W9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Received phone in great shape.

The Windows ecosystem is a huge factor in what makes the device great, being able to sync to your computer with SkyDrive and OneNote.  Bing apps such as Bing Sports is a great all-in-one sports app, much like Bing News is for world and local news.  All the Nokia apps in the HERE family (navigation, etc) are outstanding and their Nokia Music app let's you download hours of offline 'radio.'  The once-upon-a-time lackluster app store is more and more flush all the time, although to be honest I never really saw a shortage of quality apps.As to the shipper and the actual device shipped, it is exactly as offered, brand-new in the box and on schedule.  The software has been updated since the phone was released so it does take a bit to bring it up to speed, but that is really a non-issue.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good LTE Phone with Solid Windows Features", "Author": "JLo", "ReviewID": "R331QVFPX75HP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice true 4G/LTE phone.

Easy to hit but don't snap when you pocket it.Overall size is perfect. I'm 6 Ft and wear a large glove. My wife actually has the bigger 928 and she loves the size.
