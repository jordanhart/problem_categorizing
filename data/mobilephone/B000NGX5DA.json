Seller reviews should be totally separate from the item review.Now on to the Nokia 8800Like I said I have two of these phones. I got them from T-Mobile brand new in very fancy packaging.I thought it odd they sent both a 'desk' charger and 2 batteries for each phone.I quickly figured out why there was two batteries, the phone does not do well (last long) on a charge. I did make it through the day, but not much beyond that. We only used the two phones for about a year (my wife and I) and after about 2 years the phones would not work at all. Of the 4 batteries 3 went totally bad (bulging and no charge at all). I went to 'fire them up' later and was dismayed they would not work beyond a few minutes. I tried replacement batteries but got several garbage (junk) batteries from ebay 9worse than what I had) and it was not till I finally tried \"PowerGen\" brand batteries that I got good (legit) batteries. I only got two batteries but they worked better than the original batteries IMO.So on the phone. VERY nice phone, very nice craftsman's ship. Attention to detail was noticeable. I forget the exact story but these phones were originally only sold in Nieman Markus stores for crazy $$$ ($700?). The phones 'theme' was designed by a world renowned musician so, the sound and image themes are top notch.In 2007 (ish) this was a super high end 'prestige' phone.The phone itself: it is quite small, when closed and has a buttery smooth sliding motion to slide up the screen and expose the buttons underneath. The screen itself I believe is some kind of very hard crystal (it does not scratch like plastic). I think it might be sapphire (I'm sure a quick Google search will answer these details). So why did I stop using the phone? Mostly my eyesite. I got the HUGE HTC HD2 phone(s) after this, and the screen is huge in comparison. This phone's screen is tiny and I cannot imagine reading email on it (not that I did email at that point). For one who simply wants a Non \"smartphone\" this would be perfect.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000NGX5DA"}}
