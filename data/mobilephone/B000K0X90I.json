Longwell", "ReviewID": "RT5NUMK68SLAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect companion.", "Author": "Maciek Niedorezo \"MNGRAPHIX\"", "ReviewID": "R2PWFIRV5LU8TU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier so far", "Author": "paulg_dc \"Paul\"", "ReviewID": "R2JCXTXD9ZW6XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted an unlocked GSM/GPRS phone to replace my Cingular-branded palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t;/Cingular), which from the start I'd been wholly unimpressed with.  I began longing for a mobile phone that was just a GOOD MOBILE PHONE, that didn't crash all the time (yes I mean you, Treo), and that didn't have aspirations to be something else, a hybrid phone/can opener/whatever. I was drawn to the entire new Nokia line, but their prices kept me away. I was slightly skeptical about the Sony Ericsson line's focus on music (I already have an iPod, thank you very much), but I liked the price point and the positive reviews made the choice much easier. Although I've only had the phone a couple of days, and it's technically not supported by Cingular, my service provider, I seem to be continually wowed by this phone: it's design, call quality, features, abundance of free \"themes\", games and add-ons (especially in comparison to the paltry offering for the Treo) all make me think I definitely made the right decision with the Sony Ericsson Z710i. I'm even getting use out of the FM radio.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Tony Jagodka", "ReviewID": "R55T3GMJ17P8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey this is a great phone. I have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly. I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy. The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception.

Lorenzo \"That Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RXBWQDF4G6LB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone with cool multimedia features.  It has a built in FM Radio but you have to use the supplied head set that has a unique adpater, meaning you cant use anything else.  I was hoping that I could use this phone to replace my HP PDA but whe the reminders come up they dont repeat themselves so if you dont hear the reminder you will not be notified again.  The vibration is not very hard meaning sometimes you cant feel it if it was in your pocket.  The coolest thing I found about it was you can record phone call conversation with ease.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "a good phone, but there are some flaws...", "Author": "David Guzman", "ReviewID": "R1VTH4GAD6BR84", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "hello readers, in this product review, i'm gonna talk about the sony ericsson z710i. so i'll try my best to break it down and such. here i go...first and foremost, this phone operates under the GSM networks, such as tmobile and at & t (cingular). so those who want to bring this to sprint or verizon will have no such luck.secondly, if you look at the official product review, it would likely mention that it comes with a 512mb memory card. unfortunately, it's just not true. as i comes with a 64mb card. if you read other reviews, you would likely know of this. if not, well now you know.for some odd reason, the outer screen of the phone isn't colored, but maybe sony has a method for it's madness, perhaps?now, i can't always bash this phone for it's shortcomings, as it does have some redeeming qualities:appearance- i admit, one major reason i got this puppy was cause it's a pretty looking phone. the black/grey like color with the silver trim is quite a sight to behold. when you open it up, the buttons light up in a nice blue color, andaesthetics- (did i spell it right?) as for how the phone feels on your hands? well it is a bit thick, even by today's slim as a slice of paper standards. but for users who have dealt with sony ericsson phones, it feels quite alright. but one major flaw is to access your memory card, you have to remove the battery case. and since it's not exactly a very popular phone, it's not very easy to find accessories for it.battery life- pretty good actually, i've gone for hours vibing to the music i jammed into it. (i forgot to mention, but i bought a 1gb memory card for about 20 bucks, giving me a lot more room for video clips and music.) and the call time? i don't really notice, but i can assume it's somewhat reasonable.call quality- i can't really give it that much of a good score. maybe it's just my luck, (or my network) but some calls come out garbled. but if you hang up and call again, you'd get better resultscamera- not very good actually. sure it takes 2 megapixel photos, but the quality is not the best sony can offer. (my sister's sony w810i has a much better camera) but at least it comes prepped with some decent photo editing software in it. it can also shoot video. again, not good, but something is always better than nothing. oh yeah, before i forget, it has no flash.software- i actually like the software for this one. the navigation buttons are customizable to a point that you can for example: press up to activate your bluetooth signal, press left to open your calendar, or press down to start playing video games. the music application is okay, but like i said before, sony has done better in this field before.internet- unfortunately, i can't rate this because i don't use it.overall- not a bad phone at all, but i'm sure you can find something better from sony. (like the w810i for example)hope i helped...", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Flaky Bluetooth", "Author": "JohnDoe155", "ReviewID": "R2WDV3JZ4APZX9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For all good about this phone read the other reviews. The BT is really flaky for me - I have 3 other BT devices that exchange contacts between each other flawlessly, not so for this phone. Very often it just says \"Can't add contact\". I almost decided to return it and try another copy but the price really went up since I bought it, so I'll probably just keep it.UPDATE: I just got back from UK where I used this phone with prepaid T-Mo UK SIM card.

The Sony is not nearly as pocketable. It also does not get as good of reception as the RAZR but is generally acceptable.  What I really don't like is that it doesn't have a dedicated hang up or call buttons.  The controls on this phone are very difficult to use and you will need to read the manual even if your a teckie.  By the way, the manual is so so; it didn't even mention how to use it with speaker phone!  The music feature is stupid; you need proprietary headphones and the sound quality is awful!  Still, it does seem to have good battery life and the screen is far superior to Motorola's especially in bright sunlight.
