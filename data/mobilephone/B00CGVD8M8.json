It is a well built phone, typical for the quality you expect from Lenovo. It runs apps very smoothly. The GPS works well; I used the Navigator software while in Europe and it worked great. The screen is crisp and clear. The phone does have some included apps which are in Chinese only but most pre-installed apps are in English, including Google play. Downloaded apps installed without any issues. I bought this phone because I needed a new dual sim phone. I had some concerns because this phone does not cover the 850mHz frequency but so far I have not run into issues because of this. So if you are looking for a quality dual sim phone, unlocked, with GPS and at a good price, the Lenovo A820 is a good option from my point of view.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good budget Smartphone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R29QOHN0SEJND3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this after I broke the screen on my previous phone & didn't want to spend a fortune knowing the abuse it would get on a daily basis.First thing to say is this isn't a Galaxy S or iPhone ..... but as long as you know that before you buy then you will be fine.Everything on the phone does what you expect & the stock Lenovo Android 2.1 while cluttered does work well & smoothly.  Build quality is excellent compared to many Chinese built mobile phones & it feels solid in the hand, with the matt finish also making grip better than the shiny plastic phones you find elsewhere.The Dual sim is also good as it means I can have different numbers for home & work ....also different networks can be useful where coverage varies.  Both sim cards are on standby at all times.The display is crisp & bright & the capacitive screen sharp & responsive.Using AnTuTu Benchmarking it delivers a reasonable 13k scorePro's+ Cheap+ Quad Core Processor+ Dual Sim Dual Standby+ Excellent IPS screen+ Comes rooted as standard+ Unlocked to all networksCons- Standard Lenovo Bloatware in AndroidConclusion, a good sturdy Android Smartphone.....does everything you need (not sure about gaming as I don't play games)  A healthy 8/10", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent item.", "Author": "Adan", "ReviewID": "R2M3UM1JNZCY8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is ok, the device works excellent, I felt in love with it.But I think that the seller should to put any sign explaining to the buyer that the phone doesn't have Google Play, but that they are able to install it before send it.Excellent Deal !!", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "could not remove the chinese applications", "Author": "arkigor", "ReviewID": "R1BHLD2GY58VHE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone arrived on time and it is cool, unfortunately i was not able, even is came rooted, to get rid of many chinese applications,The contractor installed Greeks per my request but the address book does not has search with greek fonts function", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Sotiris", "ReviewID": "R3A0OGQ6DIVBGM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it.

Worth buying.", "Author": "Taraprasad Bhowmick", "ReviewID": "R3ACP40KEQISQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's probably the cheapest one I could get with good configurations and a reliable brand name. Though LENOVO isn't famous for smartphones, but this one was worth buying. And as a beginner to use a smartphone it's a pretty good choice for me.Advantages:1. Very fast. Process everything very quickly.2. Very recent android version, so more user friendly.3. It's is 23rd day since I bought it and fortunately it didn't show any misbehaves.4. It may meet your all expectations of a smartphone barring the following drawbacks.Disadvantages:1. Battery backup doesn't meet the expectation. In network fluctuation it dies very quickly.2. You got to see few amounts of Chinese characters, while making call or powering it on or off; even how much you try to remove them. It may bring smiles also sometimes. So enjoy.3. Doesn't have front camera. Wish it had this one at least!4. Though in good network works better for browsing and buffering, but only supports EDGE type. No HSPA+ or HSUPA.5. ROM 2.2 GB not 4 GB.So if you are ready to make a try with a cheap smartphone, this one is a pretty good choice. Till now I am satisfied.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality product", "Author": "robert wayne kennedy", "ReviewID": "R2YAB7FGLDWQ57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased from iOkeler. This is a quality product, it has heft in the hand that does not come from the battery alone. The phone came with english dominant, Google Play, youtube, facebook and most other programs you would desire. The screen moves fluidly, really nice. The screen quality is very good but not the best, at this price point you could not ask for better. Wifi was no problem, sound quality was average but the volume is loud. Radio works without headset, novel. The camera has no flash but does take fairly good pictures being 8mp. Charging micro usb plug was a tight fit, I used my samsung charger which slid in easily. Call quality is good from both ends. The phone did come rooted and with superuser. Now for the but part. The web browser is Chinese, there is probably a way around this that I have not found yet and would probably be solved by flashing a new ROM but you should know that the issue exists. The english is overlaid on the Chinese. The Chinese language and apps is still there taking up system space, probably not a problem unless you download alot of apps. You can probably do something about the Chinese apps since it is rooted. It does not work with my carrier, T-Mobile for 3G. It is my fault for not checking the frequencies. The phone will work fine for when I travel abroad. If this phone had the necessary paired frequencies needed to pick up 3G from T-Mobile, I would buy 3 more. This is not a cheaply made phone. Probably overstock for it's home market and repurposed. If you need plug and play, this may not be the phone for you, but if you are willing to work with it, I think the end result will justify the time as long as the phone has the 3G frequencies that the phone works on.Edit, I worked with the phone a few minutes more and found a Chinese search engine that let me find an American site suitable for my home page with a search engine. I'm liking this product better all the time, just make sure that it works with your services frequencies.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lenovo hardware for low cost + Android open source = Victory", "Author": "justin", "ReviewID": "RVVITSIOY5E5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best deal I have ran across in a while. The mt65xxx chipset performs gracefully and apps run like a dream.

I bought one and paid extra but it didn't arrive within the stipulated time. Coming back to the features itself, most of the apps are chinese, the app search is in chinese and I have tried in vain to get google play store installed on it. It installs but doesn't work. The key pads feel awkward when typing though it's a touchscreen. It takes more than 5 touches to get an inverted comma!!! And that's because it is not on the main qwerty keypad! The camera takes good pictures during the day but it doesn't have a flash so capturing events at night becomes very difficult. The keypad locks anytime despite the time set for it to lock automatically. If you've ever used a Chinese phone like HTC then you'll see how this phone makes life difficult than simplified.Don't throw your money away! Don't buy this phone. This dealer buys the phone on the China Unicom network which may explain probably why the phone may have been made purposely for the Chinese market.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's great", "Author": "Marian Alexandru Dinu", "ReviewID": "R336ZU2YF33CTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's absolutely gorgeous for its price.
