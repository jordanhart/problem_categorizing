I first tried the Samsung Galaxy Showcase.  I really liked the Showcase.  It had a big screen with a lot of memory.  The display was great.  When the iPhone went to $75, I wanted to give it a shot so I traded the Showcase for the iPhone.  I was used to the Mac OS since I had been using one for more than 10 years.  It was definitely more simplified for me than the Showcase. The interface is really slick.  I rarely get on my computer at all these days since I got this phone.  My email stays immaculate.  I can bank, pay bills, shop, browse music, skype, listen to podcast, youtube and much more. The GPS was better on the Galaxy in my opinion.  I downloaded the Mapquest app for iPhone and have no complaints now! The swype feature on the android I thought was much better at first.  When I got used to the super smart keyboard on the iPhone, I am typing and texting just as fast, so I will call it a draw.  The camera is really good as well. It takes great pictures to add to my photo albums.  The only problem I have with iPhone is not being able to expand your memory offline. I use Netflix all the time so I can be in the room with my 3 year old so his cartoons don't make me a zombie.  I am really loving the Amazon Cloud Player app for Apple!  It helps, but you don't have to be really smart to use this phone!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "el telefono bien", "Author": "neonitro", "ReviewID": "RJ6DD7PQF5T82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "excelente telefono todo bien solo que ofertan un telefono desbloqueado y no es cierto deben ser sinceros y no enga\u00f1ar a la gente", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Over Priced", "Author": "Vox Tarri", "ReviewID": "R1BJ6D8VSEH9YV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is great but why is it $130 more expensive on Amazon than it is directly through Apple?
