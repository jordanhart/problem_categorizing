This phone is fantastic all around. I can't tell you how many android and apple users have stopped me to comment on my phone, picked it up to play with, and sighed with regrets that they just renewed their contracts picking up a new Galaxy or iPhone.A brief breakdown by area:Hardware: Nice size and weight, not bulky or heavy despite some biased reviews out there, and is certainly lighter than the iPhone once its been \"Otterboxed.\" Smooth and curved on the back for ease of holding, squared off on front. Easy to reach the whole screen with my thumb despite having small hands for a man. Wireless charging with the basic charging pad is quick and simple. Very satisfied to not have to struggle with micro-usbs anymore. Can't comment on durability because I haven't dropped it yet.Interace: Sleek, smooth, feels very high end and hi-tech, making the iPhone and Galaxy feel dated.Screen quality: Beautiful.  Slightly dimmer than the iPhone at top brightness. Good visibility outside in sun.Battery Life: Pretty good, with heavy use you will likely need to recharge at least once daily.Apps: This is the big gripe point with WindowsPhones in general. There are fewer of thost \"must-have\" Apps, most notably instagram, dropbox, and personally for me HBOGO, however, these are the only Apps I find myself missing. There are decent 3rd party apps that can do the same. Lomogram for instagram, SkyDrive for dropbox. No 3rd party HBOGO app, but Netflix and Hulu are available. Pandora and Nokia music should keep you happy on the music end. Built in email interface is far more robust and streamlined than the android version...as a Gmail user I was very surprised by how much better Microsoft was able to manage Gmail than google based android. Facebook App is more than adequate. The App situation should improve substantially, particularly in light of the 928 now available on Verizon, and T-mobile getting their own flagship 925.Camera: Best available in the market. I have not picked up my Nikon DSLR because the shots I get off my 928 are comparable if not superior, particularly in low light. I took a photo this AM with family in pitch-black closet, and the quality is phenomenal with the xenon flash. Low light shots without flash are quite good as well. Very cool photo apps like SmartShot(takes rapid burst of pics and you pick the best one), panorama, and an animated-GIF app.Video: 1080P, better than real life quality. Can't do much better than this.Sound: On full volume(30/30), the sound can fill the room, although can be tinny at highest volumes).I can confidently say that if you take a chance and pick up this phone you will not regret it.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the Price", "Author": "Geebox", "ReviewID": "RBBALT8D0KPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A User Review on the Nokia Lumia 928.Got my Nokia 928 a few days ago. First, overall the phone isGREAT and I would recommend it to anyone. IMO it is the Best Windows Phone to date. I will also say that in comparison to the other Operating System's; Android and iOS, Windows Phone 8 OS is better and faster in my opinion. Of course that is Subjective. Everyone has his or her preference as to the features, apps, size, style, color and specs of a phone that work for them and that's just fine. My sister likes the iphone 5 and it works just fine for here. My youngerbrother likes Android ICS and it works fine for him. The point is, I nor anyoneelse has to convince each person that they should buy a particular Phone. Having said that this is just a review for anyone not sure of Windows Phone 8.The Pros and the Cons.Pros:1. The Operating System: The Windows Phone 8 OS issmooth fast and responsive. It runs faster on a lower processor than a newer Android's faster quad processor. The point is, it doesn't have to have 4 or moreprocessors to run smoother and faster. Though I have not had it longer the 8days as of this review I nor the persons I know who have a WP8, have notexperienced the lags, bugs and many reboots I have had with Android Phones and Tablets. I didn't like the Windows Tiles when I first heard or seen them in pictures, but expect for the plain colors (you eventually get use to them) they work great. The Live Tiles update you on all the info you need on one screen without having to click on a bunch of different apps Mail, Facebook, Weather, Agenda, Calender, Messaging are all updated right on the front screen. You can customize the look, size, color of your Tiles and change them with ease.2. The Camera: This has to be one of the best cameras on a Phone. You will not be disappoint on the pictures it takes in daylight or low light. Nokia is hyping up this Camera and I have to agree. The Camera alone is a good reason to get this phone.3.  Call Quality is good: Both calling and receiving. The speaker on it is loud and clear.4. The Display is great with the AMOLED Display. It makes the screen sharp and clear and great even it sunlight. The Size at 4.5 inches is also a nice size, not too big and not too small.5. Xenon Flash: Brighter and better Flash as found on some standalone cameras.6. HD 1080p recording with great noise canceling mics. Also has front Facing 1.2MP camera.7. 32 GB internal storage8. 4G Network: I haven't had the chance to fully test it yet, but my pages load super-fast and my downloads are fast as well.9. Battery: Battery usage for a smartphone is Good. It also has wireless charging.10.  APPS: There is a lot of criticism with this OSand lack of apps. This area is where people have to put things in the rightprospective. Yes iOS and Android has more Apps than WP8. I have to laugh alittle when this argument is brought up. First who downloads that many apps?Second putting thing in the right prospective, iOS and Android is 5years old. Developers have had plenty of time to make apps. Windows Phone is going on 3years old with Window Phone 8 being only 6 months old with over 145,000 to date. Most of the top apps or equivalent is available right now on the WP store, with more being added as the months go buy. The point is, it took both Android and Apple years to get to the app count they have now. Besides most of the apps on those system or useless apps that don't say on a phone for long yet alone even make it to ones phone. Again my point is most of the main or equivalent apps that people use are either on the store or in development. If Windows Phone 8 sells great(and I think it will) more apps will come faster. Anyway Nokia has a set of apps that make this phone stand out itself, Nokia Music, Nokia City Lens: Nokia Maps, Nokia Drive. There are plenty of other apps that make this a great pick.Cons:1. No External Storage. I think Nokia made a mistake here. Even though it has an internal 32 gig storage( 23G usable) they should have made room for external storage. I like having my music, videos and some data on a storage card so I am not tied to a computer or downloading data on a cell or wifi. I almost didn't get the phone because if this.2. No removable battery. I am a heavy user, both personal and work. I like having a couple of charged batteries to throw in when I just can't charge.3. Lack of Apps? I put this here because in comparison to the other two OS's, WP8 does have less apps, however I think I make a good point above as to why this is not a good reason to not buy this Phone.4. No FM Radio: other Nokia Phones have the radio turned on. Though I heard that it can be turned on in a firmware update.5. No Etiquette: My own personal preference; a feature that mutes the phone when you face it down.6. Wish it had a stylus for notes: My own personal preference7. No Swype Keyboard: My own personal preference8. Unless I am wrong, No Video output to TV.Ok so for what it is worth, this is just an opinion for a user and not a article writer,and Yes I have had both Android and Iphone.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thinking about buying Lumia 928? Let's see if I can convince you", "Author": "Soner Bicici", "ReviewID": "R25GWFP60I0MA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you.First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps!As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S.My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S.Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review.Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier.Here are the pros:- Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808.- Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time.- Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can.- Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy!- Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free.- Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home.- Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers.- Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen.- Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most.- Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus.- Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too.Now time for the Cons:- As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness.- No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card slot so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage.- Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it.- Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no \"x\" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps.- Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not.Conclusion:I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try. If you have any questions, feel free to leave comments and I will try my best to answer your questions.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone.", "Author": "Adam B. Claar \"blubol\"", "ReviewID": "R1JIK2AAGKOPKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just the background...I got this phone as an upgrade on Verizon Wireless.  I was previously using an Android based Thunderbolt (first LTE android phone for VZW).  I had watched a buddy use her Lumia 920 so I had a decent idea of how Windows Phone 8 works.  I have never previously owned a Windows based phone.1.  Speed.  Initially I was worried that this phone would be slower than it's 4 core Android counter parts.  This phone only has 2.  I was honestly surprised.  It is as fast as any of my buddies Note 2s and even their new S4s.  Speed to use this phone is really fast.2.  Camera.  This is best thing about this phone.  I would suggest going to Youtube and watching some HD test videos (user videos...not Nokia commercials).  The camera is truly amazing.  The Xenon flash is great at night but just the day to day video and camera work is awesome.  I love that I can just touch the screen where I want the camera to focus.  Nokia has given you some really great applications like the panorama application which basically guides you through taking 3 photos that it stitches together to make a panorama shot.  Applying a filter like Instagram is quick and easy.  I also like that you can upload to SkyDrive automagically.  You don't have to but you can.  The 100GB storage is $50 or $6 a month if you need the maximum.  It is the least expensive of the large capacity cloud storage solutions.  *NOTE:  There is a dedicated camera button on the Lumia 928 that takes you directly into the camera.3.  Battery life.  I finally have a phone that I can go through the whole day on one charge.  I can charge it at night and that is all I need for the whole day...whether I am surfing the net or my daughter is watching Netflix. YES!!!!4.  Nokia Here/Navigation.  This took a little getting used to.  At first I was frustrated with the maps because they weren't up to date.  I then realized that you could download the maps directly to the phone in case there wasn't a data connection (nice to save on bandwidth).  After downloading the new map for the US everything worked beautifully.  *NOTE:  If you leave Here turned on Nokia is smart enough to know what the speed limit is and will \"ding\" at you if you are going over the speed limit.  This sounds trivial but I have to drive through several school zones on the way to work and occasionally find myself 2-3 miles an hour over the posted 25mph speed limit.  Instead of having to watch for kids and also my speedometer...I just get a handy \"ding\" from the phone that lets me know that I need to slow down a little.Limitations...1.  Apps.  If you are an app geek you will be disappointed in the selection of apps.  On the plus side you can load up your apps and still get the same speed out of the phone vs. an Android phone.  My daughter likes the way games look on the Lumia 928 better than on my old Android.  I would say that is just the hardware upgrade.  For a limited time if you buy a Lumia 928 you get $25 from Microsoft and Nokia to use towards apps in the Microsoft app store....overall...I am extremely happy with this phone.  It is the first phone I have owned and really liked in about 4 years.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"jtouchst\"", "ReviewID": "R2J5D68EZSPOMR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to try the W8 phones out because honestly, I just wanted to try something new. I was a little bored with my Android phone(though otherwise very happy) and not ready to jump to the Iphone since it was the same thing I had been doing with my ipod touch for years. I first tried the HTC 8x as I was a very satisfied HTC android user. The phone was beautiful but I didnt really like the feel of it in my hands, it dropped calls terribly, and some of the software that I was use to having for free on my Android device, such as the turn by turn voice navigation, just wasn't there, and the camera was just serviceable.  I had a few other qualms with it that were really making me consider jumping back to Android.I looked at the BBz10 (nice phone but a little complicated) and the Samsung S4 ( wasn't available yet on Verizon), and the HTC One ( would have gotten this but it is not a Verizon phone). I also though of waiting to see what the next Iphone would  look like but as it was like just to be a 5s, I couldn't imagine it being exciting enough to make me jump to that platform.  Then this phone came out to good reviews.  So I decided to try it out. I have to admit that I am surprisingly happy with this phone.  Everything that I didn't like in the HTC 8x is improved with this phone. Nokia just has more software, and that sofware makes the user experience. Also I think call quality is superior and I have only had 1 dropped call since I have had this phone.  The camera is very good as well.So far, the only thing I would change would be to round the edges slightly and to take the weight down a little more.  Other then that, I am a pretty happy Nokia W8 phone user.  Happy enough to want to see what the next operating system update will add to the phone.  Happy enough to stick with w8 platform until I can see what is the next great thing Android and Apple comes out with.  I don't know about os loyalty at this point but I'm more than satisfied with this phone.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Solid Phone", "Author": "F.

No issues like what i had with my 2010 AT&T; HTC Desire phone and I dont get bored with it, like I do with my wife's old Iphone 4 - wife has left Iphone for a Galaxy S4 because she was bored with IPhone also, almost got the Lumia 928, but didnt want to be the same as me, but she is still a little jealous that my phone take better pics than her new Galaxy, but I think they both do a great job.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This should be your next smartphone", "Author": "Rentme \"Rince, recycle & reuse\"", "ReviewID": "R1B0FD7JGU1X4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This really should be your next Smartphone!I have lived with Android and the defragmentation of the software releases with different versions on different phones.  I have experienced the high cost of the Apple products and have seen so many friends that encased their iphone with a big ugly case.  I have also experienced the \"great at first...than behind the times\" Blackberry Smartphones.  Now I am experiencing the Windows 8 Phone from Nokia and I can tell you I am not going back to any of the other options.  The excellent hardware quality of this phone and the additional Nokia Apps make this a super easy to use and that integrates with my desktop.  Other reasons to own this phone:- The offline GPS is fantastic as I never have to worry about having a data connection to get a route  (I found out that the Nokia mapping data base powers the majority of the car systems in the world and I can see why)- Nokia music is not something I would buy, but similar to mapping where you can download to your phone and then use without a data connection, this is fantastic to have a HIGH QUALITY sound mix on your phone that doesn't require a data connection to listen to.- Yup.....the camera can't be beat, especially with the Zenon flash and the Nokia Apps for the camera.- Battery charging is another goody that you have love.  First, it has a feature that charges the battery up to 40% faster.  Although most other new smartphones have this feature now, you really do notice it.  Second, you can find the Nokia wireless charging plates for $25 and once you use wireless charging you won't want to fiddle with the plug in cable again.  (I bought 2 plates and it is worth it)There are many other items I could list, but most reviewers have already listed them when reviewing Windows Phone 8.

Here's the stuff about Droid that drove me to Windows Phone 8...**Battery life - crazy bad to the point where I had to install the extended battery and cover (also true of my friend's Samsung phones).**Connection issues - 4G showing up in the display and the phone telling me during a navigation session \"Data Connection Lost\".  Really? I'm navigating somewhere... now what?**Random reboots - Oh yeah, never during a call but I'd be in the middle of web browsing session only to have the phone reboot itself.**Browser crashes - happened all the time.**4G to WiFi to 4G transition - a nightmare.  I'd have to turn off WiFi, wait a couple of seconds, and then turn it back on.**Bloatware and the inability to delete Verizon apps.  There were a LOT of unused apps, taking up space, that I would have loved to delete if I could.**Cost - $299 w/2-year contract renewal.Comparison to the Nokia 928**Battery life - you can't change the battery but you really don't have to.  It lasts all day with power to spare**Connection issues - there are none.**Random reboots - never happens.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had to manually reboot this phone for any reason whatsoever.**Browser crashes - none**4G to WiFi to 4G transitions - smooth as anything - there's no interruption in the data flow.**Bloatware - I actually LIKE the apps that came with this phone especially Nokia Drive, HERE Maps, HERE City Lens, and all the Nokia photo apps.  The one \"already installed\" app I wouldn't use, ESPN, was easily erased.**Cost - $99 w/2-year contract renewal.Notable features of the 928 & Windows Phone 8...Beautiful displayEasy OS - One screen for shortcuts (tiles) and one screen that lists ALL the programs.Great camera - pretty good low light photos, beautiful daytime photos, and a bunch of creative photo apps from Nokia that are fun and impressiveCall quality - very good; no complaintsProcessor speed - very smooth; no lagLive tiles - not the \"nightmare\" that I've heard of... some are kind of cool, some are functional.  All in all a nice feature to have.Navigation - works without an active data connection (map file is pre-installed).Apps - This seems to be a huge issue for some people.  Are there less apps available for WP8?, yes.  Do I care?, not really.  Why?, there really hasn't been an app that I wanted I couldn't find, or find an acceptable substitute.  I have Facebook, Skype, Open Table, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc.  More apps are being made available daily.  I found a decent tip calculator, a Drop-Box & You-Mail interface that's fully functional, and a bunch of games.  I know there's a zillion apps for Android and Apple IOS, but most of them are crappy or repetitive (how many flashlight apps do you need anyway?).  Oh by the way, all the apps I downloaded and installed were freebies.Thing I don't like about the phone...**Volume control... there's seems to be one control that affects everything (ringer, notifications, alarm, media, etc.)  A minor annoyance, but I would like to have more controls.**No FoxFi (I didn't use free WiFi tethering THAT often, but now I'll have to deal with its absence).Conclusion...I don't miss the Android OS at all.  There were too many issues with it for me to continue using it.  I was waiting for this phone to come out on Verizon and I'm glad I did.  It's not perfect, but it works really well.  Even though there are less apps than Android, they seem to be better written (more polished, more functionality, etc.) and there hasn't been anything I needed or wanted that I couldn't find.

From an android user", "Author": "paul riggs", "ReviewID": "RTZETS8G8WT9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background:I owned the Iphone 2g, which was a spectacular phone for its time.  I stuck with iphone until around 2011 when I started to think it was boring and I bought a Droid razr, which was also a good phone but not spectacular, I eventually broke it and upgraded to a galaxy nexus.  I became very accustomed to android and its ecosystem.  I used TONS of different apps, launchers and eventually ROMS for my Gnex.  I loved the phone and I loved androids customization.  However by 2013 the phone had lost its luster, I was sick of the poor battery life, instability and LAG.  So I thought about getting the Galaxy S4 or Note2 or even waiting (I'm on Verizon) for the HTC one.  The problem was I was worried about the battery life of all of those except the note 2.  I knew I didn't want to go back to Iphone because even though it is super stable, with tons of apps, its just so boring to me.  So I thought I might try the lumina 928, that was a week ago.Lumia Review:  -Build quality-The phone is really extremely well built.  Especially coming from a samsung phone it seems very durable and study.  -Setup--No Sweat.  The phone added all my verizon backup agent info and then nearly seemlessly merged it with my contacts from my google account.  -Call Quality--wow, no really wow.  Loud and clear.  You can tell the phone has 3 mic's and advanced background noise cancellation.  -Keyboard--Since this isn't android the keyboard better be good and luckily it is very good, and very accurate.  I was worried coming from swipe that this might be a deal breaker but it's so smooth and it autocorrects very well.  -Screen--The screen is beautiful, Just go look at one at the store, its great.  I read before I bought it that the white has a greenish tint if you look at it at a sharp angle and that is true.  However since I am the one using the phone I don't really have to worry about that.  -Windows 8--I am actually really impressed with the OS.  I always think of microsoft as old-school but the interface is very clean and minimalist.  The apps are lacking like you read in every other review but I don't have anything that I miss that much other than my bank app (USAA)  I can use pageonce  instead or just go to the mobile site but I really do miss that app.  Otherwise all the apps I really use are there and more are coming all the time.While windows 8 is not in the same realm of customization as android it is much more fun and customizable than IOS, while maintaining the same stability as IOS.  I like that live tiles of different sizes, they don't replace widgets from android but they do hold some information and flip from front to back or scroll through photos...etc.I also really like the Theme aspect of WP8.  I used to customize my nexus from top to bottom and make it a black and white theme or a super-hero theme or a family theme....etc.  WP8 can't do everything that android can but you can quickly change tile colors or from a black or white background.  This may not seem like much but its cool and it takes only seconds and everything remains stable, smooth and fast.  -Camera--The camera is very good, I am not a huge camera buff.  I use it to take pictures of vacations or kids or events and so on.  I have used it quite a bit and the Nokia photo suite is really useful and intuitive.  The Xenon flash works like a charm and works for flashlight apps too.  The talk about it being a great camera is true, however it does sometimes seem to change its white balance very quickly.  Like I said I am not a camera buff and that might be fixed in the settings but out of the box, its one of the things I noticed.  -Battery--This was and is one of the deciding factors for this phone, I hated charging my nexus all the time.  So far for me the battery life has been great.  I did get it down into the 30% range in like 6 hours on the first day but that was with near constant use.  With normal use it makes it though the day no problem.  That being said I was trying to get all the info I could on the battery before I made this purchase so I will tell you all I know.With the GPS on (Nokia Drive+ is great BTW) I think the phone will last a little over 3 hours with no charging.  That is much longer than my android phone but still a huge battery drain as most GPS's are.The phone is SUPER efficient in standby, I mean I think it uses .5-2% per hour if you just leave it.  My nexus would easily go down 7-10% per hour and this is much better than that.The lumia 928 comes with a \"battery saver\" in the settings.  You can set it to turn on manually, when low, or always (not recommended).  I am not sure why always is not recommended but I have it activating when the phone is \"low\" which I think is at < 40% (when the battery turns yellow).  The phone gets more efficient below 40% and seems to last as long if not longer than the last 60%.The battery has done really well so far and I liken it to an Iphone battery, doing more with less.  If you are coming from a razr maxx or Note2 you may be disappointed otherwise I think this will do surprisingly well for you.  -Recommended apps--If like me you are coming from one of the other platforms with 6X as many apps you may want to know which apps you should pick up.-The new Facebook and Twitter work well I think they have been updated since most of the reviews.-I like USAToday and WSJ news apps, I missed apps like stubleupon, pulse and flipboard so I started to use weave but I didn't really like it.-UC browser is better than IE.  IE is ok, it will work but you should try UC browser.-Customizable tiles(wifi, bluetooth, location) getting one of those apps is handy-Netflix works well-Audible is an app I use daily and It works well-ebay and amazon are good-Pageonce is a good app if your bank isn't in the windows store like me-I love the roku remote app (if you have a roku), I really like not losing that little remoteOverall I really recommend the phone.  I think its stability is great and its not boring at all, the camera is a standout and the usability of the phone is through the roof!", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thinking about a Galaxy S4 or Iphone 5?

Let's see if I can convince you", "Author": "Soner Bicici", "ReviewID": "RMJNC2219IJ9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you.First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps!As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S.My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S.Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review.Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier.Here are the pros:- Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808.- Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time.- Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can.- Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy!- Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free.- Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home.- Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers.- Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen.- Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most.- Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus.- Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too.Now time for the Cons:- As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness.- No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card lost so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage.- Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it.- Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no \"x\" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps.- Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not.Conclusion:I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try.

The metro interface carried from Windows Phone 8 is a fantastic touch interface, but having a regular desktop, micro sd slots,full usb ports made them the most versatile platform by far. Windows Phone 8 on the other had is a more limited, simplistic, and straightforward OS. Coming from Several Android, Iphone, Blackberry and even Windows Phone 5/6 devices I was pretty excited to see how things would work.Design: Honestly as first I thought it was a bit chunky, It has a lot of bezel, and is pretty thick. However after using it I really realized this actually helped usability a lot. It feels better in the hand and it's easier to operate than some of the phones trying to be as thin and bezel free as they can. Every time I hold it I just think that this is the best feeling phone I've ever had, I'm just really in love with the design now. Honestly I think they could have gone better with making it a 16gb with a micro sd slot, but windows phone isn't so great with SD cards I don't think (read software for more info) so i think it had something to do with that. One other thing I really miss is a notification LED on the front notifying me of missed texts/calls etc.Performance: Even though it's last gen hardware now, 1.5 ghz S4, 1gb ram, 720p screen it doesn't hold it back at all. The screen looks gorgeous (I can't tell the difference between a 720 and 1080p smartphone screen honestly) and it performs like a champ. It would have been nice to have 2gb of ram when going through the multitasking sometimes it had to resume the item which takes quite a bit.Software: Here's the big difference, The software, in a word is refreshing. The animations I thought would get annoying but keep the flow of movement really well, and when it gets done 9 times out of 10 the app is ready and loaded right away. Live tiles are really great, I had a couple of issues with some not updating right, but either way they make the main screen extremely lively. The \"app drawer\" I guess is what you would call it when you swipe to the right, It is functional but with only a single line of apps it makes kind of cumbersome sometimes.Windows phone 8 also doesn't allow access to the file system like android does. For instance I had a comic book reading application to read some .CBR files I had. I couldn't connect my phone to the computer and put the files on the phone to use though, I had to upload them to skydrive, then link my account with the app and download them. While I'm glad that atleast you can do this, it makes a 2 step process to like 5+ steps. The only thing I really found I could drop on and use from the internal memory was media files.One odd thing about the software is the search button, on windows 8 the search button will search throughout whichever app your in which is great. However the search button on windows phone is only a hotkey for Bing. It's kind of counter-intuitive, and should honestly just be a Bing button.Apps: This is a grey area, of course Nokia can only do so much on this front, it's up to the developers to make these apps, and Microsoft to attract them. Most every app from my previous android phone I was able to find. The community has been really great at making great alternatives to the missing apps like Flipboard, instagram, youtube and most everything else, finding the needed apps wasn't really a problem. A big HOWEVER though is that I found some apps missing functionality, they were like the red headed stepchild app of their android/iphone counterpart. For instance in both the official ebay app and an alternative one I was unable to add tracking information on my sales or manage my messages really. This is just one of a few I found that were just not up to par with the functionality i expected. Most of the time it isn't a deal breaker but it's something to think about.Things I miss are firstly a notification center. I pretty much manage everything with the live tiles but it would be great to have a spot to just check everything together though. Widgets I don't miss much, the tiles replace it almost mostly for me though one thing I would like would be interactive tiles where I can do things without actually going into the app.Camera: Lumias are known for their cameras and the pureview on this was no exception. It has a really bright f/2.0 lens, and whatever else the pureview technology does to help. The camera button works perfect, it will turn it to the camera from being off and it is a 2 step button meaning you can half press it to focus. Pics I took in low light looked like they were taken with like sunlight shining in, they turned out amazing. I tested it against my other canon point and shoot and the lumia blew the canon out of the water as far as low light performance. There are a ton of cool lenses that you can download to do different functions as well. The only thing that is missing however is the ability to take pictures while recording video which i really miss.Battery / Call quality: I'm not sure why people combine these 2 but they do, so why not try it. Call quality had no issues, I've heard complaints on other reviews but I experienced no signal difference or call quality from previous phones. Battery life was more than acceptable. After an 8 hour work day of between light and medium use I would have over 75% left usually. I had no issues lasting a day. From 6am waking up till 10pm going to bed I would almost never be below 50%. Also the wireless charger works without a hitch, thought the phone got decently warm during it which was odd.Conclusion: Well Microsoft has something really amazing on it's hands, Windows phone is just a joyful, unique experience. It makes heads turn, you can't go into work without having someone ask you about it. However can it replace your current smartphone is the question. I manage my life on my smartphone, and it needs to be able to keep up with me. My experience finds that Windows Phone will most definitely be able to keep pace.I do think that unlike an android device though I wouldn't be able to manage everything on my phone. If I were away from home or something I would probably need to access a computer at some point to manage thing. It just doesn't have that versatility yet. However Coming from the Iphone users will get an experience that is just as or more fluid, crisp and easy to use. Just don't expect the \"theres an app for that\" line to always work.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Aaron L. Smith", "ReviewID": "RPQDHRNE9IH1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon, and this is the first review I have been compelled to write here.  This phone is that good.I am coming from a Droid X2, which I wasn't really unhappy with except for the battery life.  I won't get into the battery life issue as I am not reviewing the Droid, but let's just say it was atrocious.  I was not unhappy with Android OS, but I didn't love it either, so when my contract was up I was willing to take a look around to see what else was out there for me.All of the phones I was considering (Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note II, Iphone 5, Droid Maxx) were $200 or more, so I was surprised to find this Nokia for $29.99 here at amazon (It can be had for $19.99 right now at wirefly.com, but I am a Prime member so the basically overnight shipping and support was worth the extra $10).  I read about the issues with app availability and synching to Google, then I went down to the local Verizon store and played with the phone.  I loved the interface and the look of the live tiles, but it still took me a couple of days to decide I was comfortable moving away from Android.  I am so glad I did.Pros:-price.  There just is not another deal like this out there.-Windows8 Phone OS.  It is so simple, visually attractive, fast, and stable.  My apps launch now, switching between apps or from apps to the home screen, the phone never hangs.  It just runs silky smooth everywhere, and everything is easy to find and work with.  Apps just work in WP8, and they work the same way every time.  I had a lot of on again/off again functionality with the Droid apps, they would work like they were supposed to most of the time, but sometimes they wouldn't.  The Droid OS did the same kind of stuff to me, sometimes it would sign on to the wireless at work or home automatically like it was supposed to, sometimes it wouldn't and I would need to do it manually.  I also love being able to uninstall any app, I hated the amount of pre-loaded crap that was on my Droid.  There is a ton more to love about WP8, like the way it consolidates all of your contact information from multiple sources into one contact (so facebook profile, LinkedIn profile gmail profile, etc... for the same person are all presented to you as a unified profile with all the data from the separate services, but the profiles all remain distinct in the background and can be edited individually), but I won't get into every bit of it, you should just try it yourself.-email client. This really belongs under the WP8 OS heading, but that was getting long and the email interface is so nice on this phone that it deserves it's own section.  It's the little things, but it really is the most pleasant email interface I have used.  Gmail works flawlessly here too.-Integration with other Microsoft services.  I love how smooth the MS Office apps work here, they are so useable it is just a pleasure to work with Excel, Word, Outlook, PP, etc...-MS SmartGlass integration.  I am a gamer and Xbox is my proffered platform for consoles (I have and like a PS3 as well but the 360 is what I use for multiplayer so I use it a lot more).  The SmartGlass app works so smoothly and is so cool, it is just a great feature.  I know it is available on Android/iOS as well, but it just functions flawlessly here on WP8.  Spartan Assault is also very cool, really good Halo game on a phone.-Nokia phone.  I have always loved Nokias and this is no exception.  Good solid build quality and well thought out overall.-Performance.  This phone blazes and switches between tasks so fast.  It is only a dual core, 1.5 GHz processor but it really works great.  From what I have read (and experienced), WP8 is not the processor hog that Android is.-Battery life.  I can go a whole day and part of the next without a recharge unless I am hammering it with games/video and tons of downloading.  This was my main complaint about my Droid and I am really pleased with the Nokia battery so far.  It also has built in wireless charging.  I didn't think I cared about this until I tried it, now I won't be going back to plugging in a phone to charge, ever.-Reception.  I get 4G reception with this phone in areas where my wife is only getting 3G, and I get signal in pretty remote areas where others are getting nothing.  I hike and ride my mountain bike pretty deep in the boonies, so this is really great.  I will add here that while the Nokia Here maps program doesn't have as much \"places\" detail as Google maps, it does give you the option to download the maps to the phone so you can view it offline.  Handy feature for those aforementioned trips to the boonies.  The maps themselves are good as well, and I like the directions feature better than Google maps.-Camera.  The camera is great, it is a champ in low light conditions and the xenon flash produces great looking (if not quite true to life) colors, I love it.  That's all I am going to say on he camera, but there are lost of detailed review of it out there.-Screen.  The screen is beautiful and the colors are so vibrant.  Pics and video look great as well, best phone screen I have owned.Cons:-App selection for app hounds.  I have found an app to replace most all that I used on Android, but there is not even close to the selection.  The big ones are here though for the most part and the app list is growing daily.-Google integration is not seamless as it is with Android.  I hesitate to put this under \"Cons\" because I have gotten Google to work pretty good here.  It is not automatic as it is with an Android device however.  The niggle is Google Calender, it doesn't integrate fabulously yet because Google hasn't supported WP8 with an app, but it does work via the email section with alerts etc..., you just have to use the Google mobile site to work with the calender itself.  Google maps must be used on the mobile site as well.-Can't expand internal storage. The 928 has 32GB of internal storage, so you have a lot on board, but you can't install any more.  This is mitigated by really easy and free access to MS SkyDrive.  You can set the phone up to automatically backup your pics, videos, docs, whatever to SkyDrive so you don't need to keep everything on the device.  I don't mind but other might, so I am including it on the \"Cons\" list.-Can't replace the battery manually.  I never carried an extra battery with me until I got my Droid, and I haven't carried one since I got rid of my Droid, so there's that.  I also have a roll up solar charging mat I carry in my backpack, so I don't need an extra battery when I go out in the boonies.  If my internal battery starts to significantly degrade before my 2 year contract is up, this will turn into a problem for me.These are the only negatives I can come up with yet, but I will edit my review if I come up with some more.  I was initially worried about committing to two years of WP8, but I couldn't be happier with my choice.

Been very happy with Amazon's service when I needed an exchange. There was an initial smudge on the screen and my order was promptly replaced with no questions asked. This second one is looking very good.Product:- Well designed and constructed. My HTC Thunderbolt had issues that I don't see here.- One of the best things I can say is that this phone is fast. Loading apps, switching, closing, playing is all snappy and fluid. I trust it will hold up with future OS updates.- It's a bit of a heavy phone if you're going to compare it to the iPhone, though much larger. I likely the matte finish of the black over the glossy finish of the white. It fits in a pocket well. The main issue I have with this is that when it's sitting flat on the back the Carl Zeiss shiny area rests a bit higher than the rest of the phone.- Wireless charging is a huge plus. I rather enjoy not having to plug this thing in when I get home.- The screen is fantastic. Nokia's PureBlack tech is good to have and it has some vibrant colors.- Camera is also great. This takes amazing low-light photos. I was recently out at a party after sunset and was able to take portraits with little flash needed (if any). Nokia has some good apps to help take advantage of this capability.- It's mostly rectangular with slightly curved edges but has a slightly curved back to help the stereo speaker, which sounds great.OSI do like Windows Phone and I think the platform has something going for it. It integrates well with my Surface and xBox. So you can clearly see I'm in the platform deep. Good SkyDrive compatibility and I can edit Word docs with no problem. Sure there are some apps to be desired but that's mostly items I check every now and then. Development is good from Nokia and independent developers (i.e., Using \"Instance\" as an Instagram app and 6sec as a Vine app). Some features Microsoft really needs to communicate better about. For instance, using the people hub to connect to multiple social networks is really great. The photos hub can filter out all these social interactions for just photo-related posts from my contacts. The gaming hub notifies me when my xBox friends come online and want to play a specific game.

There are a multitude of photo-editing apps available.Windows8: The operating system is the biggie here as it is the interface between you and the phone. I'm not a great fan of Microsoft forcing Windows8 on desktops or laptops but it's great for mobile devices. It's easy and quick to learn and easy to customize. One thing I love is the return button. If you click something by mistake, you can simply hit the return button and go back, with Apple products you have to go home and then click the app again. Another thing I like is the search button, no need to find the app to search; the bad thing is that the search engine is Bing!The browser is fast and I can load up image/content heavy websites fast. Actually the whole phone is fast.Battery: Hard to say so far. It's supposed to be good, but I've been using the phone almost non-stop playing games and it's lasting less than a whole day. I like the charge port is at the top, seems more convenient that way. Unfortunately, you cannot remove the permanent battery for a fresh one. This means I will have to keep a charging cord with me while out and playing marathon games. But at least it doesn't use some kind of proprietary cable.Phone: Call quality is fine. This phone will be a good choice for Verizon customers.Apps: Migrating over from Apple products, some of the apps I use like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. are missing but that's the price of Windows. It was a long process to download the initial app because you have to go through a tedious initial set up. Update: There are some complaints about the lack of apps but I'm starting to find a lot of apps now, including an app that gives you Google. And I really like Nokia's Map Here which is even available offline.Overall very satisfied with it. The important things are that it's very fast and the operating system easy to learn. I give it 9/10, the 1 pt deduction being the permanent battery and on Amazon's 5 star rating system, that is still 5 stars.Update 1: The phone has also survived it's first drop on the floor.Update 2: 5 mins ago, the phone was dropped again by the same culprit, this time on its corner. The top part of that corner actually popped off about 1mm along the edge but we just popped it in again.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "FESAL ALTOUKHY", "ReviewID": "R1I10O326BNHPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been the happy owner of iPhone for 3 years.

The addition of a AMOLED screen makes this phone a winner in terms of display over the other phones and the Windows Phone is snappy and intuitive.  Has most of the major apps I would use that are also big on Samsung and iPhone, but would be even better eventually when other apps are there in time.

Very fluid with swipes and works well outside. Just yesterday a friend was trying to show me a photo on his iPhone5 while we were outside on a sunny day we were trying to shade it with our hands so we could see something/anything. The Nokia 928 has no such problems.Photos are great, especially indoor photos which would normally not come out well on a camera phone. Nokia Smart Shoot takes 5 photos with just one push of the button. When doing family shots it's great. You take a photo, which is really five, then you flip through the five and pick your favorite. Panorama is pretty cool too but I don't use it as much.Nokia maps, city lens, and drive are great! The ability to use the drive with no data usage is key to keeping your data usage down. The ability to set if and when it sounds the speeding warning is great. You can set different levels for speeds posted over and under 30 mph. So for under 30 I have it set to 5, for over 30 it is set to 9. The only thing I wish the Nokia drive had was an option to show a line by line of the directions. My Garmin has that feature and I used it often.The OS is the best. I love the live tiles and the ability to change the size of the tiles. If you use a app or feature more often you can give it a larger tile to make it easier to see/tap. Pining and unpinning tiles to the start page is a breeze.People hub is amazing for those that use there phone as a social device.All the Microsoft products that are included are great for people that use it more as a business phone.Cons:If you are coming from Apple the lack of some apps will be troublesome to you. Windows now has about 5.6% of the smartphone market, up from 3.8 YOY according to Kantor Research. I think once it hit's about 10% which should be early next year the apps will really start coming in.Size: If you are coming from an iPhone the phone might seem too large. Trying to use it with a single hand if you are a woman or a man with small hands might be difficult. I wanted a bigger screen to make web browsing and typing easier so I was appreciative of the larger screen.Finishing thoughts: The Nokia deserves a look whether you are entering the smartphone market for the first time or thinking of switching from Apple or Android.

The interface is very intuitive and most functions can be completed with just a thumb.Battery life has been outstanding so far.  I used to turn off 4G on my old phone to preserve battery but so far I have left it on with the Lumia 928 and easily get a full day of mixed usage.The one thing I thought I would miss from Android is the lack of LED alerting.  I like to keep my ringer off and get notification of new email, appointment,  text or phonecall based on the color LED.  This phone doesn't have that feature, however I am not missing it as much as I expected.  I generally leave the alerts on low volumne and they are sufficient to have me check my messages without being overly intrusive to those around me.The integration with Skydrive for the camera app is a nice feature that automatically backs up you photos to the cloud.  I was surprised that my favorites from IE on my desktop didn't sync like they would to my Surface tablet but I have missed this less than I thought because of the live tiles.

I didn't like the iOS7 update at all, and I was already ready for a change of scenery. I needed a smartphone so my choices came down to an Android phone or a Windows Phone (since I had seen the trouble Blackberry had been having).  Many of my friends have Android phones and they always complain about random things going wrong with it or just a laggy experience in general.  Maybe there's an Android phone out there for me, but after talking to my friends, I decided to look elsewhere.When I started reading about Windows Phone, it seemed like many of the tech review sites were mostly negative.  They'd say a few nice things about a Windows Phone, but then they'd go on to talk about how it doesn't stack up to iPhone and Android phones.  In my experience using my new Lumia 928, I've gotta say I only find it lacking in battery life (which may be because I've been playing with it constantly since I've gotten it.  I have a feeling I'll make it from sun up to sun down once the shine wears off a bit.Pros:Windows Phone interface is clean.  The live tiles are a refreshing change of pace from the boring icons that I was used to on iOS.The camera is great on this phone.  If you get this phone, make sure and use the Nokia Pro Camera app.  I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I can get from this phone, and I was already pretty happy with the job the iPhone 4s did.  This wins hands down.Fast.  I don't know how they did it, but they made this system run very smoothly and with great speed.  Apps load quickly on this phone and the transition animations don't feel like they are covering up lag like other phones I've used.Nokia Apps.  Nokia did a really good job of creating apps that make this experience a great one.  Nokia Pro Camera, Nokia Creative Studio, NOKIA MUSIC (HELLO!), Nokia Here Maps, Nokia Here City Lens, etc are really great, high quality apps that make this phone stand out over even other Windows phones.Cons:Learning Curve.  If you've never had a smartphone before, I don't think the learning curve will be too bad.  A lot of the interface is very intuitive.  However, coming from iOS, I had to give myself a good 2 days of getting familiar with the phone before my head stopped spinning completely.  :)  It's just a different way of doing things, and I'm glad that I stuck with it.Battery life.  I'm really hoping my battery will get me through to bed time once I start using it normally like I used my iPhone.  I plan to get a wireless charger for my desk at work though just in case I get in a pinch.Apps.  If you like Pinterest, you're not going to find it on this phone just yet (Sept. 2013).  All of the apps I used on my iPhone are on my Lumia so I'm good on that.  However, if you always want the newest app on the day it comes out, you'll need to stick with iOS or Android in some cases.  Don't count the Windows Phone app selection out though.  YOu really should look for yourself.Wrap Up:I'm sincerely delighted to have this phone in my possession.  I never enjoyed the iPhone for the 14-15 months that I had it.  Don't get me wrong.  The phone did just about everything I wanted it to do.  I just didn't enjoy it.  Using this phone is a pleasure, and it's going to take something really special from another company to pull me away from Windows Phone.UPDATE:My issues with battery life are no more!  I get through the whole day with the phone now with normal use.  There's some juice left over at the end of the day, but I charge it every night so it'll be full for the following day.  I stream music and videos a lot on my phone, and I use it constantly at work for email and calls, so I'm really pleased to see that I get through the day with it.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid phone, a delight to use", "Author": "Pollywog", "ReviewID": "R2JYPETMWLBZ7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hardware is fantastic, solid feel, gorgeous screen and feels great in the hand (and I don't have the biggest hands).

Plus, it has a some features the iPhone didn't - like a super high quality camera, wireless charging and live tiles on the home screen. The WP8 software is really fast, intuitive and easy to look at. By comparison, the iPhone now seems lackluster and in need of a refresh, but Apple's been slow to show us something new. Seems like Microsoft and Nokia have been working very hard on this one and it really shows. Great job. Great prices right now too!Other Pros:-Calls are loud and clear.-Screen is big, clear and vibrant.-Great flow. Moving around is fast and buttery smooth -  no hesitation or hiccups.-White text on black background makes reading email and menus very easy on the eyes.-If you have a Mac, you can sync iTunes, iPhoto, etc.-Camera  performance rivals a very good compact camera. Close-up mode is absolutely incredible.-Live tiles are useful and customizable. No more hunting through tiny same-sized squares for an app.-App selection is sufficient.  I'm not an app fanatic; they have all the major ones I want.-Tight integration across phone. For example: if you open a contact, you can view recent emails, text messages, social media updates and photos right from within their profile and not have to open separate apps like Messaging, Facebook or Twitter.Some Cons:-Headphones not included.-Wireless charger not included (only a wall charger) so it costs extra to take advantage of this feature.-Phone is slightly larger and heavier than I wanted. This is actually a pro when using it as a camera.-Camera settings are not quick to get at -there's no hidden overlay you can quickly pull up- so unless you use Auto mode all the time, you always have to tap the menus to change settings . Also, some backlit shooting situations can be a little tricky if you don't practice.-No audio streaming that I know of (like Apple's Airplay) .

I wanted something different than my old starter Thunderbolt HTC, didn't want to pay for a new iphone, didn't want to go with an older Samsung.  I liked the way the Windows phone looked, and I'm always into the underdog as a rule anyway.I had issues getting the sim card to sync, but that had a lot to do with Verizon not flipping the switch from old to new, and I forgot to pull the battery out of my old phone to make sure it was off so it's recognized properly.Phone is a beauty, it's like going from SD to HD with a TV, just looks gorgeous.  I was able to move my contacts easily with a transfer app, free.  I already dl Pandora and am playing music on this bad boy.  Thunderbolt had low sound, this is much better.

Give this one a shot.  I love it, huge upgrade for me.CNET:The good: Nokia's Lumia 928 introduces a slimmer body and straight, grippable sides. Low light camera performance is top-notch.The bad: Verizon's typically blazing speeds stumbled on the Lumia 928, and call quality sounded harsher than Nokia's usual standard. Those looking for Nokia's bright statement hues won't find them here. (I don't find faults with either of these issues the reviewer had, and either did any of the reviews I read)The bottom line: Windows Phone fans on Verizon should buy the $100 Nokia Lumia 928 (I paid $49.99 on Amazon family plan) for its strong feature set, but watch out for slower-than-usual data speeds.CNET Users:  4.5/5 based on 8 reviews***Update:  I'm not a normal user, because I get free use of the phone on my family plan so I'm limited in data usage.  So a few notes.  This is the prettiest phone I've ever had, slick as heck, beuatiful screens, great having all your apps on the front page with all the customization you want, nice easy to use camera.  However, this phone is super sensitive to water. I'm talking drops when I clean the screen with a cleaner, or a light overspray from the sink, the phone can flip out.  You can't take the battery out to reset it.  I couldn;t even figure out how to manually shut it off, cuz you normally shut it off slide screen and when that was frozen I panicked.  You hold power and volume down to pass the slide screen when stuck.  I thought my phone was dead over the weekend, touch screen didn't work, I couldn't turn it off because of that.I  t finally shut off from the battery dying and restarted good as new. So a very very light spray on a microfiber cloth is my next move to clean it.  Other issue is apps, like instagram isn't compatable yet, there aren't normal iphone and android apps available always, very anoying.  Otherwise it's a brilliant phone.

Very pleased with the performance, build quality, and the screen is excellent. The Windows Phone 8 OS is a huge improvement over WP7. The interface is still elegant. I know of a few people that switched from a Windows Phone to an Android, they now regret it. No one phone will be right for everyone, but there is no doubt that the Lumia 928 is one of the best phones regardless of OS now available on Verizon. I love the tight integration with Windows 8 desktop and I highly recommend using it with Office 365 for seamlessly syncing all your contacts, tasks, calendar, and email. (Your free Live Account will do a lot of that for you too, and you get 7GB Skydrive for free). If you had (or are leaving) a Blackberry, then that's the way to go.  The phone should have some life to it because the hardware will handle the next major software upgrade from Microsoft.One problem I have with the Lumia 928 is something Verizon did, not Nokia: You can't add your PIN to the voicemail so it automatically goes to voicemail, pause a few seconds, provides the PIN, and you are ready to hear messages.  Verizon must of killed the option so they could push their $3 a month Visual Voicemail.  I hate those type of carrier practices, shame on Verizon.  (One workaround is to add a person call Voice Mail to your contacts with a home number of *86,,PPPP#  where PPPP is your PIN, then pin that contact to your home screen.)  Again, that is a Verizon induced problem, not the Lumia's fault.The major criticism with the Windows Phone platform is the lack of Apps. Reviews are fond of pointing out that Apple and Android have a lot more Apps.  But lets be real, of the hundreds of thousands of Apps, the majority are at best redundant but usually out right junk that no has downloaded and if they did they deleted them immediately after using them once.  Also Microsoft does a much better job at scanning Apps for malware. So far I've been able to find the Apps I need on the Windows Phone.  Those Apps tend to be well written, and consistent to the Microsoft App design guidelines.  This consistency in design, menu place, overall organization make the phone a pleasure to use.  Whereas Android does have many elegant Apps, the majority of Android Apps are a free for all of design, cluttered, inconsistent, and all too often darn right ugly to look at.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great bang for Your buck!", "Author": "Evan Kevelson \"Music Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1QR3SI8HYQG4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone, and I am very pleased with 99% of the technical specs on the phone.

The Battery Life is also significantly better.I can't compare it to the specs on the Galaxy IV  because that was a higher price range, but compared to the Galaxy IV & the Apple I5 this has 32 GB of storage! Based on what I have read it is 720 HD resolution for Netflix and YouTube. The Galaxy IV or Apple I5 are both 1080p. For me personally this is not significant for a five inch screen. It records in 1080 HD and can be connected to your TV via an HDMI cable.Although the music app is Nokia Music Tunes, you can upload the majority of your I-tune library via a Windows 7 or 8 PC.The only negative for me regarding this phone is the lack of Apps primarily regarding Video application such as HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, and Amazon Prime video watching. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT ADOBE FLASH PLAYER, hopefully this will change in the near future.

SO FOR SPORT ADDICTS DURING PLAYOFF TIME THIS PHONE WILL NOT HELP YOU AT THE MOMENT.Another MAJOR PLUS if you actually use a smart phone in Business; is that it comes with all Microsoft Office applications, Excel, Word, Outlook, Notebook, and Power Point.If you decide to get this phone I highly recommend you attain the phone here or at Best Buy, a Verizon store or Verizon online will cost you double which is simply not necessary. When I saw how it was priced online, here and other sites, I was disgusted with Verizon. I was eligible for an upgrade, but the only difference in the end between myself as an existing Verizon customer, and a new Verizon customer (the service as a carrier is superior) was a mere 5 dollars. I hope the better business bureau looks into Verizon wireless, because the reality is for existing Verizon customers, it is a bate and switch scam, I was content with my \"dumb\" phone, and their email to me that I would get an upgrade at a discount was simply a means to get me into the store. I could have upgraded my device here and saved A LOT of money. that being said for 50 dollars you are getting an awesome phone that I would put up there with the I phone 5 (with much better battery life) and any high end Android Device.In summary Great Phone- if you are a TV addict you need a Droid or I phone at this juncture and this phone is not for you. As far as Verizon DO NOT buy it at verizonwireless.com or in at a Verizon retail store you will pay double.

I wasn't really sure what to expect. I'm an avid Android phone use--all the way back to the first Droid Eris but between my Android tablet, phone, was getting bored with the os (I know, I'm weird) plus I used to have a Nokia phone way back in the day before smartphones and it was an awesome device. I really wanted to try another Nokia. I don't really play games or watch movies on my phone as much as some people, I use my tablet for that. I look a great phone, apps for weather, news, facebook, twitter, and a great camera. The camera was a selling point because mine had an 10 mp camera, but just wasn't that great. I am so surprised at how many features this phone has that my droid does. I can talk my texts which is a must, wireless charging is a must (I'll never buy another phone without it), speak my calls or my webpages and the voice pickup is very accurate. The one thing that surprised me the most was you can talk and tell your text messages to send which on Android you always had to hit the send button which defeated the hands off approach. The Nokia maps is great. Ability to have those offline as well as music app download offline is really great. Call quality on this thing is amazing, just as I thought it would be. Speaker and speaker phone is also great. The speaker phone hardly picks up any background swoosh noise or anything, which is nice for the person on the other end of the call. You can customize the tiles and make them as big or small as you want, so if you like a picture on your phone, make the tile bigger. My gmail and all my email accounts come over flawlessly to this phone as well as all of my contacts from my gmail side. Like I said, I'm truly shocked--I wasn't expecting to like this phone very much but the free price tag really was appealing. Oh, camera is awesome! Screen is nice and bright even in sunlight.

There is no lag. Every app runs and opens quickly. Shoot, nearly all of the apps look absolutely gorgeous on this screen.I have played a few games on this (Mass Effect: Infilitrator and Halo: Spartan Assault) and both games load really quickly and run well on the phone, although extensive high graphics gaming will drain the battery. Super fun games, by the way.2) The camera is just so so good. Video, photo, low light, high light, all good. It's only - only - weakness is if you're near a bright window, it always tends to make the subject dark. But, for the advanced photographer, it includes controls of Exposure, ISO, and white balance, as well as the typical \"scenes\" presets. With this you can overcome those problems. The flash is good too, but I normally choose to see the low-light power excel than use the flash.Add in Nokia's Photobeam, which lets you connect a slideshow of your phone's photos to any web browser on any screen, and it's a great photo suite. I haven't even touched Nokia's many Lens apps: burst shots, panorama app, etc.3) Nokia is awesome. Especially Here apps. Here Drive is their built in Turn-by-Turn voice navigation with OFFLINE function! So useful. Here Maps is just a plain good maps app, and if you want your direction in a viewable list, you use this.Here City Lens is a really cool app which lets you find stuff near you by just raising the camera, and it will list all local stuff in that direction.

This year I decided I wanted something different as the IPhones have gotten a little mundane and boring.  Even the new IPhone5S and ios7 was looking same old same old.  So I tried the Galaxy S4.  Had it for about 4 months and hated it.  Build quality was poor, battery performance was horrendous, and the screen was nearly invisible outside on a bright day, and totally invisible when I had my polarized sun glasses on.  Gave it to my daughter who loved her S3.  So I picked up the Nokia 928 Windows 8 Phone.  The phone has been awesome. Build quality is far better than the Galaxy S4 and has none of the screen visibility problems of the S4.  I can see the screen clearly in full sunlight and even with my polarized sunglasses.  Battery life is awesome, all day and will into the next with heavy use.  S4 could only make it to bedtime, well, that's when I like to play a few games/watch videos and the 928 still has the juice to get me through.  S4 never could do that.  As far as Windows Phone 8 OS, well it is fast and flawless.  I love it and the tiled interface is fresh, new, easy to use and very practical.  If Windows Phone 8 doesn't become #1 or #2, I'll be shocked. IMO it blows the doors off ios and android.  Now I am not an app junkie so the catching up that has to take place with the Microsoft app store collection is not a problem for me and no doubt they will catch up and get better.  So far everything I have wanted was there or there was a very satisfactory alternative.

As such, it's unsurprisingly a pretty great phone.  Nokia's always been known for good reception.  The screen is high quality and a pretty nice size (I'm increasingly leaning towards liking even larger screens, but 4.5\" isn't bad).  It's got tech in it for dealing with sun glare, and is supposed to work even if you're wearing gloves (though I haven't tried, since...well, it's 85 degrees out!)  The CPU/GPU/RAM are all high end.  (You can get quad core CPUs on high end Android phones, but I've found Windows Phone 8 seems to be a much faster OS-it feels fast even on the low end Nokia 521, much less this 928, and I doubt much software actually takes advantage of more than 2 cores on mobile devices like this)  It's also got a great camera-apparently the best low light performance of any phone.  CNET's pictures show it clearly better than even HTC's One or Apple's iPhone 5, and it absolutely destroys Samsung's Galaxy S4.  The camera even has a xenon flash, which is incredibly rare for a phone.One of the things I love about both iOS and Windows Phone 8 as compared to Android is how the OS doesn't come mucked up by a third party skin running over the top, like most android phones do.  Besides giving phones a consistent interface, this also means Windows Phones can get updates faster-the updates don't have to be customized so much for every phone, the way they do for most Android devices.  Instead of obnoxious custom skins, Windows Phone manufacturers are allowed to include custom programs, either on the phone, or available in the \"app\" store, which only run on that manufacturer's phones.  Nokia by far has the most and best programs available for their phones.  My favorite by far is Nokia's \"drive\" program, which is basically the equivalent of TomTom's software on iOS or Android, only Nokia gives it to you free.  Maps get installed on the phone itself, so you don't waste data doing navigation, and navigation works even if you don't have a data connection.  I'm not sure that Nokia's program is as good as TomTom's, but it still works pretty well, and is an amazing bonus for free!I personally like Windows Phone 8 quite a bit.  I think WP8's start screen is quite a bit better than iOS or Android's.  \"Tiles\" are kind of the equivalent of program icons on iOS or Android, but there are three tile sizes.  You can also pin things like individual contacts to the start screen as a tile.  In my case there are two people I contact most often, so I have both pinned as tiles right on the start screen, and any calls or texts or emails from them show up on the tiles, separately from the main phone or texting program.  Things like that make Windows Phone really customizable compared to the competition.  \"Live tiles\" are kind of neat too, although mostly the Weather Channel program is the only one that I use that actually updates with anything particularly useful (since programs on iOS can update with the number of new texts/voicemails, etc. also).  From the start screen, a quick swipe to the left pulls up an alphabetical list of all programs installed on the phone.  The interface is generally just very intuitive and clean.The email, texting, web browser, etc. are all good too.  Pretty intuitive, fast, and work like you'd expect.There are a lot of there little things I like about WP8 too.  The lock screen can use the Bing Desktop picture-like a smaller version of the same picture you can get on a Windows PC every day can just automatically gets used as your lock screen, which is a LOT more interesting and appealing than what Android and iOS do.  Even the way the lock screen kind of bounces is intuitive and appealing.  It's just small things here and there that really make Windows Phone pleasant to use, particularly compared to Android...it just feels a lot faster and more intuitive.I had a funny moment a week ago where my friend's android phone's network connection was refusing to work, while I'm just talking to my phone to pull up movie listings.  I felt like we were in some kind of Windows Phone ad lolOne thing I DON'T like about WP8-for whatever reason, the time and reception bars at the top tend to be hidden more often than on iOS.  I suppose Microsoft's thinking is that that gives you more screen real-estate.  True, and maybe it's just psychological, but I prefer seeing the reception bars, battery, and time up there most of the time.  A quick swipe down from the top, but still.  iOS programs CAN hide that bar, but most programs (outside of games or full screen video) tend to leave it up there.  The other oddity-for some reason there's no way to lock screen orientation.  That can be useful (for example) to prevent the screen from rotating if you're lying in bed and trying to read something.  I think individual programs can include screen orientation lock though.Also, for me, iOS handles podcasts FAR better than anything else.  Android has no native podcast ability at all, and there's no good way to manage podcasts on a PC and sync, like what iTunes gives you.  Windows Phone 8 is better, though still nowhere near as good as iOS.  WP8 has podcast management built in to the phone-you can subscribe to stuff, have it auto-download when you're on Wifi, etc.  Problem is, there's still not a great way to sync it with a PC if you want to.Files can be manually copied between a PC and windows phone just like to any drive, and Microsoft does have a pretty nice, easy to use \"Windows Phone\" program for syncing files (available as both a Windows 8 \"app\", and a more full featured desktop version for any version of Windows).  That program even lets you synchronize with iTunes if you want to, but in my experience it's not flawless, the way it would be syncing an iPod/iphone, at least for podcasts.  Playback position doesn't get saved right.  Play counts don't seem to work quite right, etc.  At least it runs well...honestly every single Android syncing equivalent has been a mess, often even containing malware, and never working right.  At least this desktop program is light weight, easy to use, and built by Microsoft.  I think MAYBE if you ONLY wanted to have podcasts on your phone, then Windows Phone would work roughly as well as an iPhone.  Or of course if you only care about syncing music, it should work just fine.  I don't like the Windows Phone media player as well as iOS', but still, it more or less gets the job done as you'd expect, and has lock screen controls like iOS, etc.  (I do wonder if the 8.1 update coming later this year will make some of this stuff even better).I'll mention that while Windows Phone lags behind iOS and Android in terms of the total number of programs available, I've actually found more programs on it I care about than on Android.  Most of the \"big\" stuff seems to be here.  A lot of the same games are available, although iOS is still best for that.  (It is cool that games can have achievement points just like Xbox and PC games.)  I'm sure it'll keep getting better, but really most everything I want is already available, though obviously that may not be the case for everyone.  It's worth mentioning that when you download programs for Android, Google gives out your personal info to the developer.  Microsoft (and I guess Apple?) don't, which I appreciate, and which is another reason I like Windows Phone better than Android for programs.I'll probably think of other things to say about it all, but bottom line is I mostly really love my Nokia Lumia 928, and mostly love Windows Phone 8.  I really wish it could match iOS for podcast support, but for the most part it's pretty awesome, and well worth considering.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but heavy and glitchy", "Author": "Blue", "ReviewID": "R1RUFWOLNFA1TC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I find this phone heavy and very awkward to hold due to the square corners and buttons relatively low on the right side. Unfortunately this resulted in my dropping the phone several times, which eventually shattered the entire screen.  However, long before the phone was ever dropped, it had some issues:1) Poor call signal with any case on the phone.  - I was instructed to remove the case (tried 3 different ones) because every time I put one on, the signal and call quality dropped significantly2) Microsoft tech support finally confirmed this one: the Windows OS automatically modulates the master volume  - so every time it goes to sleep or is turned fully off, the volume resets itself to 13/30 (was 19 then went down after an update)  - volume adjusts itself down if it thinks you're listening to something that is too loud (i.e. to protect your hearing)  - unfortunately the volume on the entire phone goes down, so you have nearly inaudible phone calls, alarms, ringers etc.3) In addition to the automatic volume modulation (which is irritating even for someone like me with good hearing), my Nokia Lumia 928 would decrease the volume (audibly), but the volume setting still said 30/30 (this is not a Windows \"feature,\" and is a problem)  - no matter how many times you turned the volume down then back up again, it still stayed at a low volume (even though it said 30/30)  - the only solution to this was to turn the phone completely off and back on again, at which time it would display the true volume (13/30) and could be turned back up  - except that the volume went right back down the minute it went to sleep or was turned off.4) After 2 months of use, calls could no longer be heard reliably through the handset (i.e. had to use speakerphone or Bluetooth at all times).  - I would call someone/receive a call and hear nothing until I turned on the speakerphone5) After 3 months of use, the phone randomly would not place or receive phone calls despite good signal, and would randomly fail to send/receive texts.  - this problem never happened when hooked to Bluetooth for some reason.6) Phone repeatedly disconnected from certain wifi without picking it back up, even though the secure username and password had been entered  - had to manually hook to some wifi every single time7) The screen orientation randomly got stuck on vertical  - so at times, I could not take or rotate pictures/videos/internet anything to the horizontal positionAll that said, the call quality is good if you can make or receive calls. The screen looks great, and this phone takes beautiful pictures with an outstanding flash for a phone. A major plus compared to many phones is that the Nokia Lumia still has an actual button for taking pictures/videos. Unfortunately this button is right where you need to grip the phone for doing anything other than taking pictures. Although heavy and fairly thick, it\u2019s narrower than many phones. The wireless charging is a nice bonus, although I would rather give up this feature if the phone could be lighter. Overall, I suspect that the Windows OS is responsible for some of the glitches with this phone. So perhaps the Windows 8.1 update will fix some of the problems. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone before I could send it for warranty service, so I had to buy a new phone. I would probably not recommend this Nokia unless you mainly email and take pics/vids, but don\u2019t talk on the phone or listen to music much. All together, I spent at least 20 cumulative hours on the phone or chatting with various tech supports (Verizon, Nokia, Microsoft) dealing with this phone's issues over the 8 months that I had it.

In Android and IOS, you can drag and drop icons and folders to group things. In Windows Phone 8, its all just there. You can pin apps to your main screen, but it can get cluttered if you have too many there. Ive got just enough to not have to scroll down at all.If you add something like facebook or hotmail, all of your friends information will be imported into your \"People\" tile. This is your address book. I removed facebook on here for that reason, I dont want 200 phone numbers in there when I only talk to a few people.The contract can be expensive, Ive got 500 mb a month plan and its 99.70 a month. I barely use 100 mbs, but some people will used more-------------------------Things I like:Camera is good, I think. The most advanced camera Id used before this was the iPod touch 4. Compared to that, this is like HD.Battery is AWESOME. I can make it 2 days with use throughout the days, before hitting 0. On constant battery saver mode, I can make it 3 - 4 days. Battery saver with music on at all times will drain it in about 24 - 32 hours.You can sync all of your microsoft accounts, like hotmail, skydrive, xbox live; all that, to your phone and check updates for those on here.All of the pictures you take are auto uploaded to your skydrive.Its got nice, comfortable edges. Not super rounded like samsung, and not rigid like a brick. I like how almost the whole front face is the screen; makes you feel like youre in the future.There is a bing search button built into the screen, next to the windows button. Sometimes it might get in the way, but its nice when you hear a song and youre thinking, \"Ive heard this, what is it?\" You can run your search and click on the music note, and it listens to tell you. Its been so far accurate with what ive tested it on.This is a Nokia so it comes preloaded with their apps.

The people on the other line can still hear you talking, but you can hear them at all.  It fixes itself if you knock the back of the phone on your leg, but that is only a temporary solution that you have to repeat multiple times a call.  Apparently this happens because the charging port and speaker are in such close proximity to each other (basically one behind the other) that the workings get knocked around and disconnected.

The new Windows 8 OS is intuitive, well presented visually and very easy to use. My favorite yet.2. The app's that I have used in the past are available in Windows 8, so I do not see either Android or Apple having  any real advantage. The Nokia app's for photo, maps and music are actually top notch, unlike most of the bloat that comes under most suppliers branding.3. The camera is a standout feature of this unit. Coupled with the photo programs available through Windows 8, this is a true \"takeover\" camera for all but the better SLR's.4. My battery life has been over 24 hours with moderate use5. The signal pick up of the Wi-Fi has been a pleasant surprise. Areas of poor reception on my Android and Apple handsets come through with solid signals and amazingly fast performance. Nice!6. I live in a poor reception area for Verizon and would see one bar or 3g a lot, especially with my Apple. Not so with the 928. For the first time with a smart handset, I have great clarity throughout the house.7. The screen clarity is also an impressive. At least on par with my Apple 5 and with it's slightly larger size, it's a nice improvement.8.

Not so good but I really liked the idea of easy sync with my computer.  Since then I have had about 6 phones...blackberry, I-Phone, and android with my most recent the Droid RAZR MAXX HD.  The Blackberry's were great but started falling behind.  The Androids are fun but a little buggy, and the I-Phone and I just are not compatible.Then along came the Nokia 928 to Verizon, I love it.  It is not as playful and gadget filled as others but it just plain works effectively and trouble free.  It is not as \"Powerful\" as some, but it does not need the same amount of processing power because the operating system is much more efficient than Android.  This 928 is every bit as fast as the MAXX HD, I-Phone, S3 and S4The battery specs also do not match some others, but I am just going to say the battery life is just as good as what I experienced on my Droid RAZR Maxx HD, my son's S4 and the I-Phone.  The sound quality on calls is every bit as good and the external speaker for music and speaker phone is definitely better.I read in one review that the NFC does not work with Android devices.  This is simply not true.  Maybe it does not work with all, but I know for a fact it works with my wife's S3 and my Son's S4.  We have traded pictures, videos and other data with NFC.I read in another review that the pictures are not very good or have a red tint. This has not been my experience.  The quality is definitely not as good as our fancy DSLR but it is as good as our small point and shoot digital.  Video is also very good for a phone.The call quality and reception seems to be the best of all the phones I have owned.  Even with a large multi-layer protective cover and skinomi skin.And now the \"lack of Apps.\"  I am not one who likes to use my phone as a level or as entertainment for my 5 year old.  I use my phone for communication, keeping my schedule, music, and tracking my rides and hikes.  Guess I also use it for maps and travel...I do use it for a lot of things and I have found all the apps I need...for free.  And I must admit my five year old has been playing games.So In summary, this phone is better than any android, blackberry, and i-phone I have ever used.

I guess since it's a phone I'll start with the voice quality. It is as clear as a land line, and that has not always been my experience with smart phones. I've had numerous other smartphones, the most recent an HTC Thunderbolt that had fairly poor call quality. The speaker phone has great quality too.The camera is incredible. Even the front facing camera produces high quality photos, and the phone has a number of built-in photo editing features. I've been trying to find a receipt scanning software program that will replace manually entering my business expenses, but the cameras on my other portable devices don't have good enough resolution for those great programs to work. Last night I tried scanning on my 928 and it came out crystal clear.That brings me to Windows Apps. That is the one weakness with this phone. I didn't realize how much I was going to miss the huge selection of Android apps. Windows has all the basics in productivity, games, entertainment, but just doesn't have as much to choose from. I'm sure that will improve with time.I bought the wireless charging pad and love it. No hooking the phone up to it. I just lay the phone on the charging pad (which does have to be plugged in to the wall or a computer). This phone charges faster than any smartphone I've had in the past. However, if you're using programs heavy on graphics like games, it goes through battery pretty quickly. I'm not getting nearly as much time per charge as I expected. The fact that it has a sealed battery means that I can't just pop in a spare battery when I run down, so it's essential to have a portable battery to plug into on the go or a phone charging cable.Customizing the home screen is easy, making it convenient to access the icons I need most often.The only button placement I don't like is the camera button. I take dozens of accidental pictures every day because that button is fairly sensitive and is placed on the side right where the heel of my hand fits. If I change to hold it in my left hand, my little finger rests on that button and triggers it. Hopefully I'll get used to this problem and adjust my touch.The phone has a good heft to it, feeling like it's made of good quality materials, but not so heavy that it bothers me. I have fairly large hands for a woman, and it fits just right in my hand. I bought this phone on the recommendation of a friend who has much smaller hands than I and the size is no problem for her.Overall, I'm happier with this phone than any I've owned in the past.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Standout Phone / Initial Impressions / Windows 8", "Author": "Publicagent \"Publicagent\"", "ReviewID": "R22LORSR05QYKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: this is my first smartphone. I have a Google Nexus 7, and Apple laptop and desktop. So why would I get the Lumia 928? 1) It's the best reviewed phone on Verizon. 2) I like what I have seen of Windows 8 touchscreens. 3) I am impressed with Nokia's direction. 4) I wanted a high quality camera. 5) It's free.PHONE - It's difficult to separate the phone from the operating system, but I will try. First, call quality is outstanding. I had my clearest conversation ever on this phone. The speaker phone works great. The pictures are superb with nice editing options from Nokia. Personally I like the size/shape. It feels great in the hand, and can stand upright. Te screen is just large enough for e-reading, and comfortable enough for the pocket. In fact, I am very impressed with the screen. It really jumps out.HOME SCREEN - Beautifully done. The Windows tiling system is the best option out there. I enjoyed customizing my Nexus, but just picking and choosing where you put apps is not the same. Sizing the apps (only 3 options), placing them, and coloring them is fun and makes for a more enjoyable experience. On the downside, the tiles are unequal in live updates. Some provide them, some do not. Some update better than others. Still, what I see in front of me looks great, and gives me critical information.GOOGLE/APPLE USERS - I was initially concerned. There is a Windows Phone App for Mac. I downloaded it as the Getting Started pamphlet suggested. I uploaded iphotos and isongs to the phone, no problem. Gmail is my primary email. The phone tells me when I have new messages on the lockscreen, and my homescreen email tile. The interface when opening gmail is black and white, and it doesn't separate the promotions, updates, etc. into tabs. Basically it does what I need, minus the ads. Also, it logs threads. The simplicity is actually refreshing. Google Calender is my calendar. Although not as slick as on Android, it gets the job done. I don't see how to view the calendar weekly, but all of my upcoming appointments are listed under \"agenda\" for as far down as I can scroll. Daily appointments are visible on a homescreen calendar tile.APPS - There are lots of free apps for ereading (kindle looks great), audiobooks, photos, flashlights, social media, news, music, games, etc. The Windows App market is growing rapidly. I have found their selection to be more than adequate in almost all cases. For particular niches, in my case chess (semi-serious player), the app market can be too weak. A great thing about the lower selection is that it's easier to find cool apps that get buried elsewhere. For instance, I found a white noise sleeping app that I would have never looked up. There are far more apps than expected, and Nokia's own apps are an added bonus.WINDOWS 8/LUMIA 928 - It's absurd that some have said Windows 8 is not ready for prime-time. It's far from perfect, but it's fun, slick and improving fast. I have composed audio emails and texts flawlessly. I was able to download super cool free ringtones from the App store. Pandora has no ads! The settings could have more options, but they do the essentials. Having a basic free Office program is nice. Explorer reads differently depending on the page, but it's usually very clear. The back button works better than Android. The keyboard is solid. All apps are one swipe away. Did I mention my homescreen looks great? No crashes or stalls.OVERALL - I am very happy with this phone. I was hesitant to finally make the $30 a month jump to the smartphone world. Now I can't believe I waited so long. My camera, ipod, tablet and GPS have been subsumed into one device that is ridiculously underpriced. Why get bogged down by particular platforms? These days it's super-easy to jump from Apple to Android to Windows and back again. Windows 8 is a solid 4 stars on the mobile platform, and the Nokia Lumia 928 is a definite 5. There is a reason why the Verizon attendant said no one is returning with problems with this phone, whereas they regularly do for Android. Nokia has been in the phone-making business for a long time and it really shows. Windows 8 is contemporary, and will only get better. They make a standout combination. Why get what everyone else has? You will stand out with this phone.UDPATE: Love Nokia Music, the free version that comes with the phone. Audio commands work quite well. Photo editing has been fun.

The display is amazing, its response is fast and fluid and in general it looks and feels like a solid, quality device. Coming from a Motorola Razr Maxx, I was afraid no other phone would keep me happy, as the Razr Maxx's massive battery had really spoiled me. However, I was fairly impressed with the battery capacity of the Lumia 928 which, after average use, I would end up with 50% - ~30% remaining at the end of a typical 12 -14 hour day. I also purchased the vertical wireless charging cradles which I immediately fell in love with - they make charging such an easy, convenient task. I'm not much of a cell phone photographer but the picture quality (without flash - more on this below) is stunning. Call quality is super clear and the speakers/mic certainly live up to their tasks. Now on to the shortcomings...Cons:Integrated Battery - cannot add a larger capacity batteryNo Memory Expansion - I really didn't mind when I bought it due to SkyDrive. However, with memory cards being so cheap, I really resent the new trend in committing your memory capacity on an otherwise extremely versatile piece of equipment.Xenon Flash - Although the camera is impressive, the xenon flash gives pictures a very yellowish tint - best to take pics without flash.Lack of Swype - Android has really spoiled me on this one (originally a Microsoft feature? and man, do I miss the physical, vertical QWERTYs - never had to look at my phone to accomplish one-handed texting on those!). Although WP8 uses word prediction, it's still not quite as practical #(wasn't it also a Microsoft product to begin with?).Lack of a Built-In Bedside App - the last few phones I have had prior to this turn the phone into a bedside clock when plugged into the charging dock. There's an available app but it's not automatic. Not a big deal, but just a slight annoyance.Last But Not Least - The OS Limitations...Fist off, as I mentioned earlier, the windows 8 phones cannot play .wav files (at least some variants). I receive my voicemails from work via email so when I'm away from the office, I get an email and immediately listen to the voicemail. First email I received, and I get a popup to the extent of \"sorry, cannot play this type of file.\" I read several forums and this has been a known issue since at least November of last year and although some people have reported that Microsoft is working on a solution, I found none. I contacted Verizon, Microsoft and Nokia which they all confirmed wav files are not supported. I wasn't given any expectation of a fix, much less a timeframe. As such, I cannot use this phone or any WP8 phone for that matter (All my previous phones - every variant of a Motorola Droid has never had a problem playing my voicemail attachments). There's a couple of online services that convert the wav files and reroute the emails to you, but this did not work for me, since my faxes get emailed as well and when I tried the service, my fax messages disappeared in the cloud. A luck few have been able to get their phone providers to change they type of file extension they send out, but I had no such luck. Such a shame, because I really liked this phone. I had been waiting several years for a decent Windows phone to become available (to integrate with all my office applications for mobility) and when it finally came, it was a huge disappointment.Other than the wav files issue, Windows 8 phones cannot sync directly with Microsoft Outlook. I ended up having to set several loops through a Hotmail account, an Outlook.com account and my gmail account to get email, contacts and calendar all synced. As a result, I have double reminders on my calendar events. Even worse, when I log into Outlook.com directly, my appointments don't show!As I mentioned, I had been anticipating a phone like this for such a long time and the Lumia 928 is almost everything I wanted in a phone, but the Windows Phone 8 OS is not ready for business-oriented consumers, especially considering the basic, established functions and popularity of the lacking services.If those few issues are not a concern to you, then you might be extremely happy with the Lumia 928. I highly recommend the phone in and of itself which is a beautiful, high quality phone. Hopefully it's clear that my rant is aimed at the OS more than at the phone itself but the bottom line is, I cannot use this phone. I hope Microsoft can work out the kinks by the time my eligibility for another upgrade rolls around in a couple of years, then I might give it another try. In the meantime, it's back to Android for me.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first dance with a Windows phone", "Author": "A. Clark", "ReviewID": "R36BYF84BMPXG2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 928 didn't live up to all the rave reviews here and on Verizon's site, in my experience.  I sent back my glossy little white 928.  Well, not little, it's big, and heavy.  Too much.  With a case this thing flopped around like a mini brick in my pocket, and the sharp corners made taking it out of my front pockets about as easy as taking well-used bubble gum out of your pocket.  Didn't like the three buttons on one side, at all, and I pressed that @#$% camera button accidentally more times than I can say.  Had lots of candid shots of my toes and the living room and blurry who knows what, but luckily they automatically downloaded to sky drive so I had to go delete them there also.  Actually, I know it is handy to have them automatically backed up like that, but only if you don't mind everything getting backed up.  I love the idea of a designated camera button, but it really should be some small, round button near a top corner or something.  Or, maybe it's just how I hold a phone, but the three button setup on one side didn't work for me.  Also, keyboard (and it's all you get) doesn't have a way to enter numbers on the main board..you  have to go into a second screen for numbers, then back to the other screen for letters.  This became really frustrating as so many emails, passwords, not to mention texts and emails have plenty of numbers and letters thrown in there.  Keyboard autocorrects decently well, but is still lacking in several ways.  It was much like the OS in general..very fluid and uncluttered, but over-simple not always in a good way.  The good: low light camera..they tout this for a reason, but, for me anyway, doesn't make a phone in and of itself.  Live Tiles are different..I think many will like the kind of mosaic, visual page they create (I did), while others will miss their static droid and iphone screens and think the windows phone looks chaotic.  Live tiles often don't update quickly enough to be very useful (say, battery percentage, for one), but overall kind of different and fun.  OS does work fluidly with most apps, which is nice.  Email like gmail and yahoo worked well with the built in email app, loved it.  However, it's sort of a take it or leave it OS and app store, very much like iOS, though of course Apple has a vast app store.  If you like Windows Phone ok, then great, because that's it.  No notifications, which Windows Phone will probably fix as it's just become too much a part of people's other smartphone experiences: ESPN news or scores for your favorite team, say..no go on the windows phone.  Or just having all your notifications at a glance on one page.  Again, some won't mind, but for others very frustrating.  I'm not a social media fiend or even hard core phone user, and I still missed my notifications (and a notification light on the front, which 928 does not have)As much as I wanted to try something different, it was hard not to keep getting the sneaking feeling my phone was behind the time, by at least a year if not more.  Obviously some don't mind and want something different enough that they're willing to wait it out as Windows throws money at developers to at least get the 'normal' stuff out in Windows apps.  Not to say 928 doesn't work quickly..no problem with speed and whatnot..then again I fully expect that of any new phone I get.  Battery life..so so. And the phone ran hot way too often for my comfort.  On the plus side, wireless charging is available for this phone and is an awesome feature.  IMHO, that should be universal for all smartphones today, but alas no.  Also, despite battery life being mediocre (and no ability to swap batteries like you can with the galaxies, for example) I will say it charged quickly.  It was nice to be at about 20% and get most of it charged back up in about an hour.  That's great.  I just found myself not enjoying my 'phone experience' as days went on..the shape and heft, the button placement, the concessions you need to make (just being able to change your tiles from red to mauve does not mean customization in my book).  I also had what I assume were SIM problems, but I don't know how much to blame on the phone.  A couple times texts would not go through, then suddenly would later in the day.  On first activation it took a long time and several attempts to reseat the SIM to get it working.  Later, a couple times my phone went dead and would not turn on, then magically after minutes or hours would just turn on by itself.  Not confidence-inspiring, and unfortunately you just don't have the luxury of seeing whether things work themselves out as time goes on.  Worthy of note here: if you need to return your contract upgrade phone via amazon, do it as quick as you can.  I returned it within the 14 day Verizon mandate, but of course after shipping time, processing time, etc., it was past the 14 day, and Verizon makes you jump through some hoops.  I called both customer services..Verizon will treat you like a bit of second class citizen if you don't buy through their store, so be ready.  Amazon cell phone cust service was great however, and I had to call them a couple times before finally getting my upgrade date reset by Verizon. You will have a few more do-it-yourself moments if you purchase through another vendor like Amazon, BB, etc., but price usually makes it worth it (for me anyway)..just be ready to have a bit of hassle here or there perhaps.  Again, AMazon service (the specific cell phone folk) were friendly and helped a good deal and even will help you activate your old phone if you wish now that you've had to send your new one back..the worst of it was some waiting and some being put on long hold, which is sort of part of the deal.  Anyway, wish I could have loved the 928 as much as I wanted to, but didn't feel comfortable thinking of 2 yrs with the phone.  For the price, super..I think that is what has them getting a ton sold, which is smart on their part.

Verizon sent me another promising a Saturday delivery but screwed that up and didn't get the phone until Monday late. Imagine my joy at their customer service!

I was there for two hours and they couldn't do it either.

The first one had all the Capacity buttons white but the Windows Buttons had something inside like glue ( looks horrible when the light lit).

I was hoping it was a problem with the White version but so far I got 2 phones (black version) with Amazon and they have the same issue.

Very annoying if you place it in your pocket when its on because VR activates and goes on and off with little nagging noises. Vibrator alert  is hardly discernible.

Meager selection in the Windows App Store. 2. Screen Freezes. About the meager app selection, it will suit all of your social media needs. But, when it comes to games it does not have a very good selection.  Considering that it just came out, it is doing very good at getting the basic needed apps in there first. About the screen freezes. The screen freezes probably 2-3 times every week if you use it all day every day. The simple fix is to press down on the volume and the standby/on/off button for about 15 seconds. This will hard restart your phone and bring you to your main screen. On the other hand, the way the main screen looks is awesome. Its one of the things that mainly attracted me to this phone. My battery, on this phone. Lasts approximately 16 hours with use constantly throughout the day. Now, granted the background data was shut down. Well, my last remarks will be about the durability of this phone. I have dropped this phone multiple times. I once dropped it so wickedly that I thought for sure the phone would not survive. Well, I can say, to this day it is still in flawless condition.

I have had my phone for ~3 months. At the beginning, I thought it was awesome. I particularly liked having a windows platform as I had had an apple iphone, so it was very nice having MS Office always in my hand. However, I have a few issues with the device itself.First off, it always drops calls (I know everyone says that is due to carrier, but I could always get clear calls at home, work, and school.) even though it has full bars. Second, the call quality is very poor when you do get through. My boss and coworkers complain that they have trouble hearing me (hence, the fat check I am about to write to get a better quality phone mid-contract). Third, it freezes 1-2 times per week (I am not a heavy user. No games, but text, phone, email, and internet). Fourth, headphone jack is very poor quality. It stopped working, the housing started to break. Fifth, picture quality is terrible. While I understand that a cell phone won't have great pictures, anything larger than viewing on the phone itself it is grainy and fuzzy.Pros: Very StylishCons: Poor reception  Poor Call Quality  Freezes  Poor Quality Headphone jack  Terrible Picture Quality", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A decent alternative to the Apple and Google world.", "Author": "William Grose \"Tzu Crazy\"", "ReviewID": "R29VS9MUILVTR0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been an Apple person for many years now, but curiosity had me checking out the Lumia 928, and I'm glad I did. Given that this Nokia is a flagship device for Windows Phone 8, it's only fair to compare it to Apple's flagship, the iPhone 5.First things first. The Nokia Lumia 928 is by no means a light phone. At 162 grams (my scale says 166 grams), it's noticeably heavier than the iPhone 5 at 112 grams. This means the Lumia is roughly 50% heavier than the iPhone.The 4.5\" screen on the Lumia 928 puts out 1280x768 pixels vs the 4\" iPhone 5 with 1136x640 resolution. This translates into 334 pixels per inch on the Lumia vs the iPhone 5's 326 pixels per inch. On paper it sounds like the Lumia 928 is the sharper display, but in practice this is not the case. Because of the pentile arrangement of pixels on the Lumia, text especially just comes across a little... fuzzy. It's certainly not awful, and if you've never used an iPhone 4/4S/5 or for example an HTC ONE, you'd perhaps not notice. In any case, this is not the sharpest display on the market - the iPhone 5 is noticeably sharper. The HTC ONE is the sharpest of them all (sharper than the Galaxy S4). The Lumia display is very vibrant, though, due to its OLED display. It's a little too vibrant for some people, but it certainly can't be accused of being washed out!The Camera:The 8.7MP camera on the Lumia 928 really shines. It takes some of the best low-light photos I've seen on a mobile device. It certainly does a better job than my iPhone 5. Very impressive. While I don't care for direct flash devices, the xenon flash here does help in extremely low light, and the Lumia 928 also uses it to help achieve focus. Daytime photos also look fantastic. The bar has been raised here for low-light phone photography, no question.The Phone:I've found the call quality to be excellent, with little/no distortion at the higher volumes. It just works well. The speakerphone is also quite loud.Apps:This is the biggest problem with Windows Phone 8. There are quite simply not enough apps available. If you're thinking of switching from Android, - and especially iOS, you may want to check to see if your favorite apps are even available for the Windows Phone platform. Chances are, - they're not.I downloaded a few of my favorite apps (from iOS) on the Lumia, - \"Plex,\" and \"Words with Friends.\" \"Plex\" just didn't run as well over my network, dropping frames from streamed video. And \"Words with Friends\" is just a travesty of an app. All the smoothness is gone. It crashes a lot, doesn't have some of the newer features from Android/iOS (like giving you a word-score total before submitting the word etc).And gaming is a total downer on Windows Phone 8 for several reasons. First, there are very few games available, and the ones that are available just don't run that well on the Lumia 928. This is likely to do with the (relatively speaking) outdated 1.5 Ghz dual-core processor.Functionality:The Lumia 928 situates all its buttons on the right side of the device. The volume up/down, power, and camera button all feel very similar, and it's not at all obvious which way up you're holding the phone when you pick it up. After several days of use, I'm still struggling to find the power button, which is situated in between the volume buttons and the camera button. I wish the power button was at the top of the phone...Overall: I really do like the Windows Phone platform. But it's certainly not perfect. Multitasking is a bit of a mess (you can't close apps unless you go into them and then back out), and the lack of actual good, solid apps is a REAL problem. The other issue is the hardware. While nothing here would be considered \"bad,\" it just doesn't feel flagship enough to compete with Apple and Android's best. Not enough processing power, not enough resolution, too heavy, gets quite hot when playing games etc. All these things conspire against Nokia.That said, if you want a stable alternative to Android/iOS coupled with the absolute best low-light camera on any phone out there, you may just find the Lumia 928 is the phone you. Just make sure the apps you want are there before you make the jump.3 stars out of 5.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW, WOW, WOW, INCREDIBLE PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Ram Wats \"Ram Wat\"", "ReviewID": "R3A7EBS080WJLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Slimmer body and straight than the 920.Low light camera performance is top-notch!!!The camera is amazing!!!The video is smooth and flawless.It's the best phone I've used and I haven't yet used it in any real low light situations.Finally -- wireless charging is cool.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone with an awesome display, features and Camera", "Author": "Washington", "ReviewID": "RRH3YNO2QZX5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am lucky to be the first one to get a black phone from Verizon with a new ordered batch of phones.

Lucky or so I thought.  Initially I was impressed, big screen, loved WP8 (mostly but the OS issues I will leave for an OS specific review site), audio initially sounded great.My first major issue was the camera button, way to easy to push accidentally.  I took more photos of my pocket and side of my car then I had ever with all previous phones, granted they were great pictures, when they didn't blur, but basically useless.  The other problem I had was the cell reception on the phone.  It would constantly jump around between 1-5 bars, literally all over the place.  Initially I thought it might be my location, but I had two other Verizon phones (HTC Trophy & Casino g'Zone Ravine 2) that didn't have that problem.  Anywhere I went, reception was all over the place.  The bars on my phone were more hyper than a Jack Russel Terrier.Other than that I didn't have any problems, for about 25+ days.  Then out of nowhere, the camera failed, camera app would not load, even the flashlight app wouldn't turn on (flash on phone attached to camera).  Around the same time, the ear speaker also failed.  Voices would constantly cut-out, to the point where I could ONLY talk to people on speaker-phone.  I tried every suggestion to fix, soft-reset, hard-reset, hard-reset without restoring anything (that hurt).  Had to send the phone into Verizon and get a refurb (they already had refurbs less than a month after this model had been released, scary).  I got the refurb, and after less than two weeks (Verizon had not even received by first unit back by mail yet!!) the same problem with the ear speaker happens (voices cut-out, must use speaker-phone).

I got this phone on the day of launch at noon time. The Verizon store told me we were the 5th buyer. I bought two, one for me and any wife.  I was switching from AT&T.;I know this will irk off some people because they will say the phone is good and I am rating the service...please note these phones are essentially married to Verizon. Unless I buy it at full price and then use it with AT&T...; it will unusable for me. IMHO the phone and service go hand in hand.Lumia 928:-----------The phone is very, very good. It is very fast. The UI is fluid and a joy to use. No lag or sluggish behavior like I notice in Android devices, especially noticeable on Android on the very first swipe to left of right (after the phone has been sitting). I was surprised how much faster apps open compared to my old Samsung Focus Windows phone. Screen size is very nice. The weight is just right. The shape is better than the HTC 8X, whose sharp edges digs into your fingers.Most of the apps I need are all there. Some banks' apps are missing but you can easily use their WAP website instead. For others like Disney, well you can only hope they release a Windows Phone version soon.It does however have a few problems; none of them are deal killers. I am known to be picky:1. The AMOLED screen changes color if you tilt the screen. Dead on the screen is nice, you tilt is a little to the left or right, it becomes bluish. I compared it with my old Samsung Focus...that also has an AMOLED screen, which does not do the same thing.  It may not bother you but it bothered me. It was very obvious in screens where the background is white, like while reading e-mail or web pages. Viewing photos also shows the bluish tinge and while it may not matter to the person holding the phone but if you are showing photos to a couple of people standing beside you....well you get the idea.1.1: AMOLED cannot be dimmed easily.Now this is a serious flaw of this technology. I did not realize until I got a Lumia 920 with a regular IPS LCD display. If you like to read in bed, you will like the non AMOLED screens better. The brightness of a AMOLED screen does not do down a lot. So in a totally dark room, it will still be way too bright to be comfortably read. I searched and found that the inability to dim properly is a hallmark of AMOLED screens. My old Samsung Focus with a AMOLED also used to do the same thing.BTW, in almost all other respects, the AMOLED is better.2. The camera button has no middle stop. Lumia 920 has a clearly felt \"half press\" to focus stop. You push down a little and the camera focuses, gives a \"ting\" sound....then you press it fully to take a picture. 928 does have that feature but the hardware button does not have a clearly felt half press. This results in out of focus pics (sometimes).3. The flash is useless. The highly touted flash results in pictures which are too yellow. At first, the white balance seems to be very off. But if you look closely the foreground is properly white balanced but the background is not...it comes out to be very yellow. Maybe the flash \"drops off\" very quickly? To be fair, you can turn off the flash and the pics come out fine.  The 920 does not have this problem. I hope a software update will fix this issue.4. Bluetooth issues.a. Phone behaves strangely with music playback. For example, suppose you were listening to Pandora music in the morning and you stopped playback. Then in the afternoon a call comes in, you take that call. After the call ends, the music starts playing again! I did not play music, so why does the phone play music? Even weird is that at that time I cannot find Pandora running in the background (by keeping the back button held down)! The only way to stop Pandora at that time is to start Pandora again from the apps list, then stop it. Same thing happens if you use something other than Pandora, like the phone's own native application for music. None of my other phones do this.b. It starts playing music when it loses BT connection. For example, you have it paired to your car and listening to music. When you end your journey, you stop the music (actually pause) then get down from the car and walk away. Eventually you will be far enough from the car to lose the BT connection (or the car's BT will switch off). At that time the 928 will suddenly start playing music from its own speakers. None of my other phones do this.c. It drops connection with my Plantronics Voyager Legend. About one or twice a day the BT connection drops, sometimes in the middle of a call. This could be the fault of the Voyager also.d. While paired to the headset, you dial a number using the keypad, the sound sometimes starts coming from the phone. To switch to the BT headset, you have to press the BT button on the call screen...very annoying. Note that this problem does not happen all the time.e. To be fair, I hear that the Nokia 920 also has some of these BT issues. So maybe it is a Windows OS problem? But how come my older Windows 7.8 does not have this problem.Verizon:------------1. Verizon's coverage was much worse than AT&T.;I was getting only one bar at home (Woodbridge, VA) and none at work (in downtown DC). In comparison, I get 5 bars and 3 bars with AT&T;, respectively. Maybe AT&T;'s signal penetrates building more easily? They say Verizon's coverage is the best but that was not the case in my experience. Having no connection at work was a deal breaker.2. Voice quality of Verizon is significantly worse than AT&T.;I was surprised how bad it sounded. Even the ringer sounds bad. It sounds like a very low bitrate MP3. People sound garbled inside my home, where I get only one bar. I was having difficulty understanding what the other person is saying. When I dialed 611 to complain to their customer service, I had to tell the rep to repeat again and again...I simply could not understand what she was saying. To be fair, none of the people I called said that they were having any trouble...so it was only on my side. At first I thought it was the lumia 928 but I went to their store and made a couple of calls using Android devices, the sound quality seemed to be the same. I am sure I am being nit-picky here. I am an audiophile at heart. But why does AT&T; sound so much better? I googled and noticed many people saying the same thing, most of them saying Verizon's antique CDMA network is to blame.As a result of having service problems I have returned the phones and have been hit with a $140 fee. $35 activation fee + $35 restocking fee on each of our two phones. I am fighting for these fees with Verizon.I have ported my numbers back to AT&T;, voice quality is again clear, like a land line.I would advise anyone switching carriers to:A) Thoroughly test the device in the first 2 daysB) Find a seller with no restocking fee (e.g. Costco)C) Return it within first 3 days to avoid no refund of the activation fee.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "jojo", "ReviewID": "RXL7UNAXSGC39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone it self was good, like making calls and durability but was not for me I had to go back to a more functional phone with the apps", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Restricted use outside of US", "Author": "Clive Knott", "ReviewID": "R231YWNZAD9IW8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Buttons tough to locate; restricted functionality outside of US; can't use Access Point.

I have a POP 3 email account that I connect to. I have 2 email accounts that I check. I check email on 2 laptops, 1 tablet, 1 phone. I found after a week that the Nokia 928 was deleting the emails from the server and that I could not get those emails on my other devices once deleted on the server. (My 3 year old HTC Droid did not do this) I called Verizon service who did not understand the problem and started reading to me from the manual, which I had and read prior to calling. I told him I had already read that and did he have a secondary source of reference. He said no and determined that the problem was with Nokia. He didn't ask any questions or offer to troubleshoot the issue. Instead, he gave me Nokia's number and didn't offer to guide me or stay with me or asked me to get back to him - sort of like, \"It's not my problem, see you later.\"  Excellent support Verizon and excellent support training. BTW, the Nokia 928 is Verizon's flagship product. You would think they would be more interested.I called Nokia who listened, didn't understand the problem, and said it was not their problem and sent me to Microsoft. Again, Nokia expressed no interest in my problem or the fact that I was having a problem and no questions about the issue. Nokia gave me Microsoft's number, which as it turns out is a general support desk number for Windows 8. I had to go through two transfers to get to the right group.Microsoft listened and said it was not their problem and sent me back to Nokia. I said no, it was a software problem and Nokia said they didn't make the software. I went through the problem again and the person didn't try to ask me questions or do any other troubleshooting.  I was sent to another phone support number in Microsoft that turned out to be \"Supplemental Parts\" support and the guy said sorry he couldn't help me, didn't know why I was sent to that number,  and didn't know who I should call.It appears that Verizon can't technically support the Nokia 928 and faced with a support issue it doesn't understand, it blamed Nokia without actually knowing it was or was not. As the primary support for its products, I would expect Verizon to take charge of the problem and get back to me with a solution instead of making me responsible. I'm not sure that Nokia or Microsoft are responsible for direct support to a customer for a Verizon product but I expected more from them in terms of analysis or troubleshooting. Not one of the three companies offered any real support that one would expect.This all took about 45 minutes of me having to make the calls and get shuttled back and forth. I finally called Verizon back and said I want my old phone back, which they did. I am very disappointed in the whole support experience and expected much more. It seems that for Verizon, Nokia, and Microsoft that support is not a critical element in the customer lifecycle and if you have one or two disappointed customers, it is cheaper than offering real support staffing.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "quit working", "Author": "hunter", "ReviewID": "R1AVJ9Y0GQEBTX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "had one for six weeks and the earpiece stopped working. verizon overnighted a new one and ten days later had the same problem plus speaker phone malfunction and would not hold a charge. do not!! buy this phone", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Verizon Windows Phone device that you have been waiting all this time for?", "Author": "Felickz", "ReviewID": "R3DMATBVHCXNZ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Coming from a Galaxy S3... have been \"waiting\" for a VZW WP flagship for 4 years now!Good+ Camera+ Autosync pics to skydrive+ Ability to uninstall Verizon crapware+ Google Calendar sync with multiple calendars shared with you!!!

It was mostly ok except for Xbox Music. Regarding the 928, the size was just a tad too big, but livable. I didn't care for every button being on one side. I didn't care for the Micro USB port being on top either.The display was bright, the camera SUPERB. For the most part the phone was fluid in operation.BAD STUFF: I played a 30 minute game of Battleship this morning. I began right after I took it off the charger when the phone was at 100%. Battleship is not a graphics intensive game and I play it on my Motorola Bionic. 10 minutes in I noticed the back getting very warm. 20 minutes in it was bugging me. 30 minutes I stopped playing because the phone was uncomfortable to hold.When I stopped the game I went to the homescreen and immediately noticed my battery went from 100% to 47% in that 30 minute game session.I did some searching online and discovered others had this same issue. I called Nokia. Nokia told me this was normal behavior. Really? a 2000mah battery burns thru half its juice playing one game? Not to mention heating up as it did. This wasnt just warm. It was hot and uncomfortable to hold.I unfortunately had to return it. I would love to stay on a Windows Phone as I was looking forward to it, but Verizon has no other viable option in this size, with 32gB of memory, or an SD slot.Too bad.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned it...", "Author": "J.

The display is amazing, its response is fast and fluid and in general it looks and feels like a solid, quality device. Coming from a Motorola Razr Maxx, I was afraid no other phone would keep me happy, as the Razr Maxx's massive battery had really spoiled me. However, I was fairly impressed with the battery capacity of the Lumia 928 which, after average use, I would end up with 50% - ~30% remaining at the end of a typical 12 -14 hour day. I also purchased the vertical wireless charging cradles which I immediately fell in love with - they make charging such an easy, convenient task. I'm not much of a cell phone photographer but the picture quality (without flash - more on this below) is stunning. Call quality is super clear and the speakers/mic certainly live up to their tasks. Now on to the shortcomings...Cons:Integrated Battery - cannot add a larger capacity batteryNo Memory Expansion - I really didn't mind when I bought it due to SkyDrive. However, with memory cards being so cheap, I really resent the new trend in committing your memory capacity on an otherwise extremely versatile piece of equipment.Xenon Flash - Although the camera is impressive, the xenon flash gives pictures a very yellowish tint - best to take pics without flash.Lack of Swype - Android has really spoiled me on this one (originally a Microsoft feature? and man, do I miss the physical, vertical QWERTYs - never had to look at my phone to accomplish one-handed texting on those!). Although WP8 uses word prediction, it's still not quite as practical #(wasn't it also a Microsoft product to begin with?).Lack of a Built-In Bedside App - the last few phones I have had prior to this turn the phone into a bedside clock when plugged into the charging dock. There's an available app but it's not automatic. Not a big deal, but just a slight annoyance.Last But Not Least - The OS Limitations...Fist off, as I mentioned earlier, the windows 8 phones cannot play .wav files (at least some variants). I receive my voicemails from work via email so when I'm away from the office, I get an email and immediately listen to the voicemail. First email I received, and I get a popup to the extent of \"sorry, cannot play this type of file.\" I read several forums and this has been a known issue since at least November of last year and although some people have reported that Microsoft is working on a solution, I found none. I contacted Verizon, Microsoft and Nokia which they all confirmed wav files are not supported. I wasn't given any expectation of a fix, much less a timeframe. As such, I cannot use this phone or any WP8 phone for that matter (All my previous phones - every variant of a Motorola Droid has never had a problem playing my voicemail attachments). There's a couple of online services that convert the wav files and reroute the emails to you, but this did not work for me, since my faxes get emailed as well and when I tried the service, my fax messages disappeared in the cloud. A luck few have been able to get their phone providers to change they type of file extension they send out, but I had no such luck. Such a shame, because I really liked this phone. I had been waiting several years for a decent Windows phone to become available (to integrate with all my office applications for mobility) and when it finally came, it was a huge disappointment.Other than the wav files issue, Windows 8 phones cannot sync directly with Microsoft Outlook. I ended up having to set several loops through a Hotmail account, an Outlook.com account and my gmail account to get email, contacts and calendar all synced. As a result, I have double reminders on my calendar events. Even worse, when I log into Outlook.com directly, my appointments don't show!As I mentioned, I had been anticipating a phone like this for such a long time and the Lumia 928 is almost everything I wanted in a phone, but the Windows Phone 8 OS is not ready for business-oriented consumers, especially considering the basic, established functions and popularity of the lacking services.If those few issues are not a concern to you, then you might be extremely happy with the Lumia 928. I highly recommend the phone in and of itself which is a beautiful, high quality phone. Hopefully it's clear that my rant is aimed at the OS more than at the phone itself but the bottom line is, I cannot use this phone. I hope Microsoft can work out the kinks by the time my eligibility for another upgrade rolls around in a couple of years, then I might give it another try. In the meantime, it's back to Android for me.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first dance with a Windows phone", "Author": "A. Clark", "ReviewID": "R36BYF84BMPXG2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 928 didn't live up to all the rave reviews here and on Verizon's site, in my experience.  I sent back my glossy little white 928.  Well, not little, it's big, and heavy.  Too much.  With a case this thing flopped around like a mini brick in my pocket, and the sharp corners made taking it out of my front pockets about as easy as taking well-used bubble gum out of your pocket.  Didn't like the three buttons on one side, at all, and I pressed that @#$% camera button accidentally more times than I can say.  Had lots of candid shots of my toes and the living room and blurry who knows what, but luckily they automatically downloaded to sky drive so I had to go delete them there also.  Actually, I know it is handy to have them automatically backed up like that, but only if you don't mind everything getting backed up.  I love the idea of a designated camera button, but it really should be some small, round button near a top corner or something.  Or, maybe it's just how I hold a phone, but the three button setup on one side didn't work for me.  Also, keyboard (and it's all you get) doesn't have a way to enter numbers on the main board..you  have to go into a second screen for numbers, then back to the other screen for letters.  This became really frustrating as so many emails, passwords, not to mention texts and emails have plenty of numbers and letters thrown in there.  Keyboard autocorrects decently well, but is still lacking in several ways.  It was much like the OS in general..very fluid and uncluttered, but over-simple not always in a good way.  The good: low light camera..they tout this for a reason, but, for me anyway, doesn't make a phone in and of itself.  Live Tiles are different..I think many will like the kind of mosaic, visual page they create (I did), while others will miss their static droid and iphone screens and think the windows phone looks chaotic.  Live tiles often don't update quickly enough to be very useful (say, battery percentage, for one), but overall kind of different and fun.  OS does work fluidly with most apps, which is nice.  Email like gmail and yahoo worked well with the built in email app, loved it.  However, it's sort of a take it or leave it OS and app store, very much like iOS, though of course Apple has a vast app store.  If you like Windows Phone ok, then great, because that's it.  No notifications, which Windows Phone will probably fix as it's just become too much a part of people's other smartphone experiences: ESPN news or scores for your favorite team, say..no go on the windows phone.  Or just having all your notifications at a glance on one page.  Again, some won't mind, but for others very frustrating.  I'm not a social media fiend or even hard core phone user, and I still missed my notifications (and a notification light on the front, which 928 does not have)As much as I wanted to try something different, it was hard not to keep getting the sneaking feeling my phone was behind the time, by at least a year if not more.  Obviously some don't mind and want something different enough that they're willing to wait it out as Windows throws money at developers to at least get the 'normal' stuff out in Windows apps.  Not to say 928 doesn't work quickly..no problem with speed and whatnot..then again I fully expect that of any new phone I get.  Battery life..so so. And the phone ran hot way too often for my comfort.  On the plus side, wireless charging is available for this phone and is an awesome feature.  IMHO, that should be universal for all smartphones today, but alas no.  Also, despite battery life being mediocre (and no ability to swap batteries like you can with the galaxies, for example) I will say it charged quickly.  It was nice to be at about 20% and get most of it charged back up in about an hour.  That's great.  I just found myself not enjoying my 'phone experience' as days went on..the shape and heft, the button placement, the concessions you need to make (just being able to change your tiles from red to mauve does not mean customization in my book).  I also had what I assume were SIM problems, but I don't know how much to blame on the phone.  A couple times texts would not go through, then suddenly would later in the day.  On first activation it took a long time and several attempts to reseat the SIM to get it working.  Later, a couple times my phone went dead and would not turn on, then magically after minutes or hours would just turn on by itself.  Not confidence-inspiring, and unfortunately you just don't have the luxury of seeing whether things work themselves out as time goes on.  Worthy of note here: if you need to return your contract upgrade phone via amazon, do it as quick as you can.  I returned it within the 14 day Verizon mandate, but of course after shipping time, processing time, etc., it was past the 14 day, and Verizon makes you jump through some hoops.  I called both customer services..Verizon will treat you like a bit of second class citizen if you don't buy through their store, so be ready.  Amazon cell phone cust service was great however, and I had to call them a couple times before finally getting my upgrade date reset by Verizon. You will have a few more do-it-yourself moments if you purchase through another vendor like Amazon, BB, etc., but price usually makes it worth it (for me anyway)..just be ready to have a bit of hassle here or there perhaps.  Again, AMazon service (the specific cell phone folk) were friendly and helped a good deal and even will help you activate your old phone if you wish now that you've had to send your new one back..the worst of it was some waiting and some being put on long hold, which is sort of part of the deal.  Anyway, wish I could have loved the 928 as much as I wanted to, but didn't feel comfortable thinking of 2 yrs with the phone.  For the price, super..I think that is what has them getting a ton sold, which is smart on their part.
