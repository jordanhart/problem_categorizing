This was a replacement for the T239 I had previously and has since fallen apart from heavy use.  The functionality is very similar to my old phone, which I like, but there are a few upgrades from the T239.  This phone has 4 bands, a nicer screen, nicer sounds, and has expandable memory.  The only thing I miss is the ability to customize the soft keys, otherwise this is a great phone for those that don't want the fancy, expensive, and unnecessary internet connectivity found in today's smarty phones.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's mostly represented to be what it actually is...mostly but?", "Author": "David L \"DLP\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZAFKSJ9YVR5A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received this phone and it was easy to switch my T-Mobile sim card from my old T-Mobile phone to this one.  I need this phone as it is interactive with the 2012 Honda CRV's audio system and works with it very well.  It's a nice, simple phone with the following major flaws.The only thing I wish it had is the ability to transmit my contacts to T-Mobile for backup, but it's not available for this phone.  And you cannot backup your contacts onto your microSD memory card either.  You can ONLY backup your contacts onto the phone's SIM card.  That's it!  So, if backing up your phone contacts is not very important to you this phone is a nice, simple phone for you.It's easy to use and understand and if you just want a simple \"phone\" it's just fine.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Relieved", "Author": "ES Marshall", "ReviewID": "R3JR0CWQG7W1BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In this time of progressive phones that do everything else besides what you need - Call someone, Text someone - just a regular phone is hard to come by. I'm pretty simple these days, but still pretty cautious, esp. with online purchasing. This was my first buy for such an item, but it won't be my last. My daughter's phone is about to die soon and I'm not looking to get her another phone with tons of opts and apps. A plain phone like this will suffice.I was worried when it showed up so quickly, but then saw that it was in perfect shape too, I was Very Happy =)", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "great for a cheap pohne", "Author": "dennis p", "ReviewID": "R1JJU768I3CT7N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got this phone for my mom.  my parents have a phone under my contract and they dont use a lot of min, maybe 70 min at the most a month and they only needed it for making phone calls .  this phone is not complicated at all and battery life is ok, about 4 days goes by without charging the battery", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done surprisingly well for a prepaid phone", "Author": "G.

Can go 10 days or more on standby without charging.Picture quality with the phone camera isn't that great. You can set it to save your pictures to your micoSD card instead of your phone which is great! Very bright lights makes it difficult to take a good picture with this phone.Reception is good and haven't noticed any dropped calls. No static during calls.Known issue with the voicemail. If you let this phone's battery drain completely. After recharging it, they're will be a voicemail indicator eventhough you will have no new voicemail message. It will remain there until you call T-Mobile customer support to remove it. They say its a known issue and can't be fixed.Music player on this phone is good. I put in my old 1gb microSD card from another phone. Add and edited songs to my playlist and off I go. Each playlist hold 50 songs and there are 10 playlist available. Wish the MegaPixels was higher for the camera.It fills my expectations for a simple prepaid phone.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Henry Lee", "ReviewID": "R1OTSIYH8W39JU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Product came in sealed but slightly damaged original packaging. All items were in box as listed in the ad. When I called T-Mobile to activate the phone, I was told the SIM card included was \"in cold status\". It could not be activated nor could the status be changed. Despite my arguments w/different employees, I was told I needed to buy a new SIM card for $25. This is T-Mobile policy for any of their phones not purchased at one of their stores. It would apply even if I got the phone from a local chain store.It's possible the original box was opened & the original SIM card switched w/another & resealed. I advise going to a T-Mobile store or their website to order.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Cullen775", "ReviewID": "R348D34IINQI05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great pre-paid phone that I purchased for my mom.

It usually has great reception and internet connection is fast and easy. The only down side is that it doesn't have a keyboard, so typing anything into the phone is a pain, butif you have patience you should be just fine. I've had mine for about a year now and I've dropped it at least 10 times on my concrete driveway and other places, and it still works like its new.

At first, I had trouble deciding between this phone and the Sparq but after hearing from one of my friends that the Sparq was not as good, I chose this phone. PROS: The color blue on it is nice and slide out buttons work good. Message sending is fast and camera is alright. Web2go is fast and has a wide selection of stuff for a basic phone. Easy exiting the phone.CONS: It will make a beeping noise it makes when it's low on power but that just a signal telling you to charge it. Not a wide selection of marks like !@#$%^&*() when texting (Since it doesn't come with a QWERTY keyboard).Overall 5 stars Must buy phone if your looking for a prepaid.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone has some irritating flaws", "Author": "Ormewood", "ReviewID": "RDT1FMDIUHHV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The back of this phone started falling off after a few weeks of use.  It's held in by tiny plastic tabs which fail to do their job after a small amount of wear.  I resorted to taping the back on to keep it from falling off all the time.If you don't set the phone up so that the keyboard is locked when it's slid shut, the phone's buttons get pressed as it moves around in your pocket, and you end up autodialing people on your contact list a few times every day.  If you do set it up so that the keyboard is locked when it's slid shut, it still beeps constantly as you move around.  Even if locked, it sometimes comes unlocked and you end up finding out that another chunk of your prepaid time has been used to go on the web or autodial someone.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Merchant Supplies Phone With Invalid SIM Card", "Author": "RICH ROCHELLE", "ReviewID": "R1BRKXGLDM85C0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Samsung T249 is an excellent phone for my needs; I ordered it to replace a lost T249, but a cellphone is useless without a SIM card.

There is also no way to turn the keyboard sounds off completely. So, when the phone is in a pocket or a bag, the very sensitive keys on the face get pushed by something and turn on the screen, draining the battery, and also making annoying bipping sounds - all the time.
