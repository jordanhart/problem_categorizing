Winston", "ReviewID": "RGF3SLJQE45OG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great starter phone for somebody new to the smartphone era. It is thin and sleek and can fit into any pocket or purse with ease. It has a smooth feel to it when it is in your hand and has great finger access, with maneuvering to all the accessible buttons.Will all that said, a few things about the phone need to be commented on. The screen is not worthwhile, as you have to press pretty hard to swipe or select an on-screen command. The phone is beyond difficult to conduct a text-message with, as you will constantly push the correct key, only for the phone to tell give you a different. If you can deal with the texting and screen than this would be a great starter phone for you.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Cool", "Author": "Kanisha", "ReviewID": "R3MXBOAB06P4K0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone messes up here and there.
