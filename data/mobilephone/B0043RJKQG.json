My biggest pet peeve with this phone coupled with Net10 service is that the browser button is the same for the back key and exit key. Press it a third time and you get a charge for the Web browser. Seems like a cheap money maker for Net10.Talking to people seems to be fine. I don't discern any problems with quality or quantity when talking to people.I had bought the LG620G and hated it as the browser button was getting pressed even when it was in my pocket. I envisioned 3 or 4 hours of browser time without knowing it.I switched that phone for the Motorola since it is a flip phone and must be opened to be able to get hosed by the browser button.BTW: A Warning-if you switch phones with Net10 service, be prepared for an hour or two talking to customer service.So, if you like an inexpensive phone with a cheap plan then I would recommend the Motorola W408gCheers,Hammer", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Jeremy \"Jeremy\"", "ReviewID": "R2G3QTNUY5IJHG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst phone I've ever owned.  I don't know what's more shocking, the quality of the phone, or the fact that Motorola put their name on it and sells it.  I have nothing good to say about it. If you're looking for a phone in this price range check out the LG320G.  It is much more reliable and has a much better user interface.  This motorola phone does have bluetooth and a camera, but with a phone as crappy as this those features are pretty pointless...1) It has horrible input lag.  Press a button and it takes nearly half a second or more to respond.2) It is poorly made.  The battery cover and battery fall off with just a small drop.3) The user interface is utterly ridiculous.  Useful things like alarm clock, calendar, camera and calculator are buried as much as 4 menus deep.  This is doubly frustrating because of the horrendous input lag.4) It has horrible reception.  I've had quite a few phones in this price range, but this is the only one I usually have to go outside to use.5) If you try to send text message but close the phone before the *second* pop up alert appears telling you it has been \"sent,\" (yes, it pops up twice), the text message does not get sent, and the only indication of this is the number of message in your outbox increases by 1.  You have to go and manually send it again.  This has caused me drama on multiple occasions.6) Sometimes the phone loses signal and won't get it back until it is turned off and on again.  The input lag can make this incredibly challenging if you're in a hurry. You have to press the power button for an extended period of time to turn the phone on or of.  It is easy to inadvertently set it to turn off before you receive any indication that it is turning on.  Sadly I literally spent a half hour in this cycle trying frantically to get in touch with my girlfriend who was waiting for me.7)  Even when the display shows a strong signal, calls frequently fail to connect.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "CHEAP AND WORKS FINE", "Author": "Barry Cusano", "ReviewID": "R2U8UWMQZPXDGD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We were Verizon customers for many years because of their family plan and good service.

The Moto w408G phone is just OK. It is adequate for people that only make occasional calls like we do.

Also this would make a nice mother's day gift, for the mother who does not need a phone, with all the bells and whistles, but something that's not truly lowend either.

COHEN \"schriftsteller43\"", "ReviewID": "R2GGZGUJI0OGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been a Sprint customer since the early days of cell phones. While being in touch by cell phone is essential for me, I seldom use more than about 80 minutes in a month. Internet and e-mail away from home are low priorities in my particular situation. I keep a landline, so as to restrict my cell number to essential callers.The last time when I needed a new Sprint phone, I was short on upgrade credit. I got soaked $180 for a bare-bones phone that could be activated without a pricey data plan. In October 2011, I got a letter from Sprint, saying they were abolishing upgrade credit altogether. My accrued upgrade credit would disappear unless I used it to buy a new phone before the end of 2011.Thus was I stimulated to reach out and see what my options are these days. Net10 and this phone are serving me well. I had no trouble transferring my number to this phone. Thankfully, I have had no experience with Net10 customer service. The night before the last day of Sprint's billing cycle, I set up my account. In the morning, my new phone was working fine with the old number. With the new phone came a few minutes of airtime with more than 400 service days. $30 bought me 300 minutes good for 14 months--not just 60 days. This makes for terms far more generous than those advertised. It appears that for the first 14 months with this phone, the overall cost--phone, accessories and airtime--will be under $10 per month. I had been paying Sprint >$35 per month for less functionality.With Sprint, I was deterred from using the browser, since ala carte data was so expensive and I did not have enough use for it to justify having a data plan month in and month out. Now, I can do Internet ala carte at appropriate rates. I was deterred from using a camera while with Sprint. Rather than pay the photo upload surcharge, I just used my dedicated camera. For the new phone, I got a USB cable and a micro SD card for about $4 each on Ebay. For the first time, I can upload phone pix or video to my computer without going through the cell phone company! Now I can have the cell phone camera at the ready.This phone is perfectly adequate in its class. The booklet that came with it is a quick start guide, not a manual. There are essential things that you will find out only from the user manual available on Motorola's web site. `Nothing wrong with that.10/8/2012 update: I have had a reception issue when at home. I thought the phone was at fault, so I got another of the same model. That did not correct the reception issue--but it did give me a better deal on a lot of extra minutes and service days than simply buying them \u00e0 la carte. The reception issue seems to be with the AT&T; network used in my neighborhood.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money", "Author": "Bro", "ReviewID": "R2XXX02QEP169W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because of the price and it takes photos as  a security device for my wife,, if you need all that other stuff go buy a more expense phone.

With full bars, it will not dial the number...It will act like it's dialing and just display the number and name and nothing happens...repeatedly. When the phone rings (full bars again), I do not hear the person on the other end when answered.. I can't believe that Motorola made such an unreliable phone.Texting is slow and annoying on this model. Press a letter button and you then you have to scroll to the letter you want and then select it. It requires changing keys 3 times for each letter you enter.. Good in theory but much slower in practice. Previous method of just pushing the button again to change the letter was much faster and standard on most cell phones. I won't go into how cheap the plastic is on this one.. The camera was better but I'm primarily in need of a phone now. I believe Motorola should be ashamed of having their name on this one.

I was just looking for something cheap that would make calls and send the occasional text message. I don't care about email, Facebook, or GPS mapping -- I just want a phone.Well, long story short, even with such low expectations I was still disappointed. The phone itself is ultra-lightweight, and not in a good way, more a \"Wow, how did they make a cellphone without using any metal?\" way. The website is slick to look at, but proceeded to do something I've never seen done before that made my jaw drop: when I created my account, it sent my password and security question as parameters *in the URL*, meaning anybody watching the network traffic could see exactly what my password and security phrase were. Not a good sign.After this experience, my wife got cold feet about the whole thing and called their help line to cancel the transfer of her old cell phone number before it was too late. After the obligatory phone menu, she got a recording saying that all their operators were busy. This was a Saturday night at 6 pm -- hard to imagine the phones are ringing off the hook at that exact moment. After fifteen minutes, she got a human (and a native English speaker to boot!), who told her he was going to transfer her to their technical support department. After he made the transfer, she got a recording saying the number had been disconnected. Goodbye.One of the things I want from a cell phone, perhaps the most important thing, is reliability. I don't need the bells and whistles, but I don't want to be in an emergency wishing I had forked over the requisite cash to get a phone and service that actually worked.

However it shows the first 4-5 characters of a text before you have to pay so if your friends text really short messages they are free.  The bad thing about texting is that the phone charges you for the text then tries to send it.  If it doesn't send, you still get charged.  If you close your phone while it is sending, it will not send.  That means that you have to wait a few seconds after you text for it to go through and you can close your phone.  Close early, and you get charged but no text sent.I think the battery life is ok.  When I first got it it would last 2 days max, for some reason now it will go 5 days between charging.  I usually just charge Mondays and Fridays.My receptions is good on the ATT network.  When I first got the phone reception was terrible and for some reason now it is good, weird.The reason I got this phone is because my previous phone was butt dialing all the time.  That is the best feature of this phone!  It will not dial unless you want it to.The worst features of this phone is:  The headphone jack is 2.5mm so no headphones fit.  The Largest Micro SD card you can fit in it is 2gb.  Of course I have a 4 gig so it is worthless with this phone.  In my opinion that is just dumb.Overall I like the phone and will get a new one when this dies after keeping it for probably 1 1/2 yrs.  The SUDUKO game on the phone is great too.I think the best feature of prepaid cellular is that you own the phone and can upgrade/replace anytime you want.  That is why I left Sprint, I just didn't want to be stuck with a phone for 2 years that I didn't really like or was not worth locking in for two more years of service.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Low Priced Phone", "Author": "William D.

Sager \"fancyface\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q5XF9T3A06L0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent phone but I have some complaints as far as texting goes and the browser. To text with this phone you can choose abc or something very similar to t9 but you have to select which word you want to use because it pulls up a few words it guesses you want to use and then select okay. It should just automatically guess the word you want to use. I text more then anything which makes this phone very annoying for me to use. The browser is also annoying and difficult to use as well as very slow compared to other cheap prepaid phones I have used in the past. The phone is also cheaply made and flimsey. Normally that is not something that I notice but with this phone you can tell that the quality is not good. Also after adding contacts to your phone book it will not let you edit it. You will have to delete the name and number and start over again which is shocking that there is no edit feature with this phone. I am not even able to download graphics or ringtones, etc with this phone because it sais this plan is not allowed and to visit the website for info on how to be able to download features to my phone. I paid $29.99 for my phone which is way over priced for this phone. I bought a tracfone flip style phone for only $15 and liked it much better then this phone but decided to go with this phone because of the good plans with Net10 and there were only a few phone choices. In fact, there were no other flip phones then this model available to choose from where I bought my phone. I am disappointed that there were only 2 phones to choose from for Net10 at the store where I bought my phone. I am very satisfied with the reception and clarity of this phone and it would be a decent phone to just make and receive phone calls but not to text or surf the web, in my opinion.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work", "Author": "M.

Texting is so ridiculously slow and fumbling that it's not even worth bothering. Even after changing settings away from T9 it's still a trial to use. The keys always miss a letter or go to the next letter. Beyond frustrating. Text messages also do not show a number or who they are from in your inbox... so you have to open each message and scroll to the end to see who it is. The actually quality of the phone material is as cheap as they come. Drop this even from a short distance and I'm sure it would shatter all over the place. The browser is just as much of a joke as the texting interface.This phone is nothing but a disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.
