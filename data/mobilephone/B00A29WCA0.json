Main Review===========So I bought this phone to replace an iPhone 4. Been having it for 2 years and the antennagate issue's been getting worse especially this year... So I thought I'd make a small phone upgrade and I got the S3 Mini.Personally, my unit was from Wireless Everything. The phone arrived promptly in its original packaging with an untampered security seal. As an icing on top of the cake, the seller included a free Europlug to US 2 Pin adapter so the S III Mini charger would fit into a US wall socket.My thoughts on this phone after using it for 3 months,Pros\u00af\u00af\u00af-Very light for its size, isn't too big-3.5G is pretty fast (Btw the power saver feature can throttle your bandwidth aka internet \"speed\" apart from the processor)-Android 4.1 preloaded-Very smooth UI-Still has the good multitasking feature on GS3-(Call Quality) So I tested its battery life with voice calls. On one occasion, I had a 1 hour long call and it battery was down from 100% to 90%. So that equates to probably a 10 hr continuous talktime with a full charge. Very clear speaker-Touching/Pointing is accurate-Sensitive screenNeutral\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af-Battery Life (expected it to be better, still pretty decent though)-Rendering lag on certain websites that contain a lot of images-Screen resolution (Though the resolution isn't high, pixelation isn't obvious from viewing distance. Its not grainy and still very clear-Direct Call isn't always responsive. I think the camera doesn't see your ear always while you're messaging or in the contact list. It might take 1-2 more tries.-Screen contrast & brightness - Excellent indoors, good outdoors (without direct sun). Could have done better under direct sunlight (\"By design\" of AMOLED).Cons\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af-\"Actual\" Free internal memory is about 4.5GB/8GB-Contains some bloatware that autostarts and clogs the system by Samsung & Other parties I'll list them below.-Minijack is a little soft with the volume.-MAJOR CONS: You can't put your apps on the SD card without rooting it.. Firmware limitation on Samsung's side most probably :(-There is no LED notification blinker light like on the big brother Galaxy S3 (on the left of the front speaker). You have to wake up the screen to check if you've received messages (Pointed out by Nelson Wong).Bloatware in my opinion (These apps can autostart and they \"revive\" when you attempt to kill them) clog RAM, have a toll on the battery life as they attempt to communicate with the internet or use the processor mainly.To disable these services/apps -> Application Manager -> All -> Locate them -> Uninstall updates/Disable -> Disable -> Restart your phone1.SNS (Facebook integration stuff)2.Samsung Kies3.Samsung Account4.Samsung Chat On5.S Voice (If you don't need a voice assistant)6.Help7.GTalk (You gotta be in the right context menu to sign out of GTalk/Gmail Chat)8.Google Search app (there's already a Chrome)9.Google Plus10.Flip Board (If you don't need this)11. All Share12.Polaris viewer 4.1 (It keeps popping up the dialogue asking you to purchase the pro version.. I disabled it and got adobe reader and a free office app)13. Samsung's \"Music Player\" (Not a bloatware but its quite clunky). \"Google Play Music\", a media player from the play store's a lot more easier to use and integrates better to the notification screen. For the video player, MX Player is an good one that plays lots of media compression formats (MX player codec packs are also available on Google Play). With hardware acceleration enabled, this provides smooth video playback.Conclusion\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThis phone's great for my use. As an ex-iOS user, I found the Android OS to be a lot less restrictive and apps were better integrated. Good call quality, good reception.Out-of-the-box experience was 3/5 imo largely due to high amounts of bloatware that are turned on by default, if you tweaked these stuff by disabling them you should be able to optimise RAM usage and increase your battery life by a noticeable margin.I bought a 16GB Micro SD for this phone because I thought apps would run on it but unfortunately, no. I do hope this feature will be enabled via a software update some time in the future.. because 4.5GB/8GB of unused NAND on the GS3 Mini's abit too low if you're a smartphone gamer (fortunately I'm not).The biggest plus? Price. Absolutely great value and I am keeping this phone.Overall, 4/5. :)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afIf this info's helpful, mark it as a helpful post to allow others to get the message. Honestly, I like Samsung hardware (look at my profile) but these are the pros & cons I've identified. I do like this phone but it isn't perfect, certain limitations listed above may be hated by some (SD card doesn't store apps using original Samsung firmware), a non-issue to others. If you could live with those limitations, I'm pretty sure you'll love this phone.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afJust an additional note to anyone interested in this phone FOR the SERIOUS buyers...The Galaxy S3 Mini is NOT an officially sold product in the US, Samsung's probably tired of the Apple litigation and they're not wanting to create any circumstance that would create more accusations against them. To me, this is a loss for fellow US consumers.On the product itself... most likely the seller(s) would have acquired the phone directly from Europe (probably the UK or Germany). This is a parallel imported product.- Don't expect your manual or GS3Mini's \"setup language\" to be english. You should've seen this coming.- No US warranty.- As I've said in the review, network compatibility - your carrier's frequency - don't complain if your phone does not call if you haven't made this check.- IMPORTANT: Since the product is a parallel import, YOUR TRUST to YOUR SELLER is KEY in this types of purchase. Consider the seller's:1.Reputation and seller review. Poor delivery, opened/used product etc in reviews2.The reputation and track record is a good indicator if the seller's handled the GS3 and its packaging properly (Lower chances of DOA)-Assuming these 2 \"factors\" are considered, find out if the seller's item is \"FULFILLED BY AMAZON\" or the seller. You know what I'm talking about :) Amazon's extremely efficient shipment ETA.-If prices are *almost* the same between a \"Fufilled by Amazon\" vs a complete 3rd party, go for the Amazon. If the 3rd party's giving you a better deal in pricing, you probably should give the 3rd party a try. :) I bought mine from a third party seller on Amazon personally.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afJust made this extra section dedicated to:==================================3.The power users & geeks - Rooting the i8190==================================WARNING: I do not recommend rooting your phone if you have a weak heart or you're unaware of what you're doing. It may/may not be risky depending on your level of proficiency; this is a $220 phone. If you're wanting to root your phone, keep backups of your files. Make sure you back up (your personal files) anything you don't want to lose.Additionally, if you're on a custom ROM, make sure you back up your IMEI/EFS partition in case of a bad flash that bricks your device of it's cellular functionalities.I decided to open up this section of the review since I've rooted my S3 mini after a couple of months from purchase in an attempt to unlock the capability of installing apps on my SD card. Thankfully, this capability does work on the rooted S3 mini!To do this, you'll have to install an app like \"Link2SD\" on the Play Store which is capable of moving files to your SD card using the \"link method\".What the link method does is actually similar to the \"rmdir\" command on Windows. It creates a \"shortcut\" which points to your SD card, where your app files will be stored at instead of the internal storage. This tricks the OS to think that apps on the SD card are actually stored on the internal memory.If you want to conserve more battery life, consider using the \"Greenify\" app on the Play Store. Allow Greenify to hibernate all your apps EXCEPT messaging apps and essentials! (Note: Apps added to auto hibernate during idle will not be able to send you notifications). Your idle time battery life can be increased noticeably with this app!That said, what rooted Android ROMs work well with the S3 mini (i8190)?There are 2 on XDA developers I'd like to mention and I've used without stability issues\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af-There are lots of helpful tools from software-based bricks to other rooting utilities available on XDA's Galaxy S3 Mini Android Development section including the Samsung Odin utility.-avicohh's I8190XXAMG1 [NOT FOR NFC N, T or L model]. This rooted firmware is based on the official Samsung firmware for the i8190 only WITH the addition of root capabilities. That's the only difference.-New Maclaw's CyanogenMod 10.2 [JellyBean 4.3.1][Unofficial port]. This is a custom ROM based on AOSP and Cyanogenmod sources. The only differences are that Maclaw has incorporated various fixes for glitches that have arouse as a result of the port. The reference Android interface seen on Google Nexus phones are used here with small tweaks added through CM's Trebuchet 1.0.-Various other flavors of 4.3.1 ROMs by Maclaw's also available on his site. i.e. Carbon, PAC-man, SlimROM.(But CyanogenMod receives the most attention from the both the community and the developer as the most mainstream custom ROM)Note: New Maclaw's CyanogenMod 11 [JB 4.4.2] is available BUT UNSUITABLE for daily use currently because it's a WIP. However, users who'd like to help/ the developer accelerate/contribute the development of CM11 by providing logs of their phones to the Maclaw's team for debugging purposes.Rooting Tools Required (for custom i8190 ROMs)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afWarning: This section is meant to be deliberately dense.

So do backups routinely!Other good mentions are that you'll probably want to install a firewall for added privacy and security for your phone.

Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S3 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Update 8/24/13 - Just received today, the newest firmware/OS for the 4.1.2 OTA (on my phone directly) as it was updated from Samsung and this is very new at this date of Monday, August 5, 2013 and arrived in my phone's Notification area today. After the upgrade completed, I noticed at once that this phone is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very, very fast and responsive! This is the THIRD update that I received since I purchased this phone in April 2013. Each update is not that large, however, it enhances the performance of this phone. Very encouraged as if the updates keep coming regularly, perhaps4.2.2 will be coming to the S3 Mini. And from my research, it is possible that the S3 Mini may receive the 4.2 OS but it will be a while longer...Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. And when not near a WiFi, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

I have three phones in the family and mine gets dropped calls/inability to text/missed texts etc.  I attempted to return this defective phone only to receive an email saying I can't because it's pass the 14 day period.  If you review the return policy, you will see it's EXTREMELY difficult (if not impossible) to make any kind of return even for a defective product.  If you used the phone for more than 30min, you can't return it without a 50% restocking fee.  Wow.  Chances are, you will use it for more than 30min.  Honestly, I wouldn't buy a phone after reviewing the policy.  It is my fault for assuming amazon has a standard 30day return policy and for assuming amazon takes care of their customers.  I would rather pay full price at a legitimate store for the warranty alone.  Cell phones are never guaranteed to function properly.  Do you want to take that $300 risk?Here's the important stuff that I quote from the return policy:\"All International phones are not USA manufacture warranty, and no our store warranty neither, including the accessoriesIf there is returned and refund needed, has to be return item within 14 business days from the delivery, and with buyer own expense. After 14 days there is no returned and refund acceptable no matter what problem on the phone.Our 14 days return period only effect for defective phone, or ShopEbest sends out wrong order. Any other reasons would cost buyer 20% to 25% of restocking fee.50% restocking fee will be charger, if buyer returning phone not as brand new condition and not in resell able condition , such as missing plastic bag, phone's life time minute has been used more than 30 minutes, writing on the box, screen protector is missing on the screen, missing accessories, etc.All unlocked phone's feature is not 100% guarantee suitable to all locked same network frequency carrier.

Here are some highlights:- It has a regular size SIM card, therefore no need to cut it. When you travel abroad usually you get a local regular size SIM and save on roaming.- it has a beautiful screen, just the right size. I wish Galaxy S3 had this screen because the one it has is way too big and can't be operated with one hand.- Battery life is impressive, with just the voice and WIFI turned on it managed to run close to 4 (four) days on one charge. You can see that complaining on short battery life is not productive at all since it is not just phone's fault. There are many factors that contribute to short battery life: wireless coverage in the area you live, whether you have all possible social gimmicks turned on that keep draining your battery, running apps in background that are poorly written and waste CPU cycles, amount of time the screen is on and so on.- Jelly Bean is easy flowingI am not a app junkie and mostly use the phone as a phone with occasional use of apps when I am in WiFi hotspot range.By achieving 4 days on a charge with no wireless data on, tells me how power hungry 3G and wireless data can be, and multiplied by horrific cell coverage, where instead of 5 towers we have just  one, blasting at full power, we get this sub par battery life on the smart-phones.  I believe LTE should be worse and drain you battery even faster, just in stand-by. Therefore we should blame the carriers and not the phones in 98% of the cases.Hope this review is helpful.

Chin", "ReviewID": "R31NA8MEJG85DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a week and I'm quite impressed with it.This is not a full product review as many kind owners already have done so.  I'll concentrate on provider/network compatibility, to include mobile data connectivity (speed/capability).Before that, I'd like to touch on a few concerns I've come across:1) 8GB storage - When you view the storage on this phone, the available space reported is about 4.5GB.  This is because a portion of the 8GB has been used by Android itself, leaving 4.5GB for users.  This  is the same on any Android phone and computers. A phone advertised to have 16GB will leave about 12GB  or 13GB for user.  Moreover, an 8GB phone actually has a little over 7GB to start with.  OS will  always reserve a portion for superblock when setting up file system.  And, there's always a rounding  preference (1000Kb vs 1024Kb).  Plus, the presence of bloatware.  My 16GB phone has about 13GB of  free space after getting a makeover using CyanogenMod (JB 4.2.2).  Therefore, having 4.5GB on an 8GB  is about right.  On the other hand, having 8GB of available space on a 16GB is a problem, as is on a  fresh S4 device.2) Not a new product comment - The box should be sealed, if it is factory new.  Some sellers may have  opened the boxes to perform some locale setup.  Some phones are probably returned items due to buyer's  remorse that are almost factory new.  This is an unlocked/unbranded phone besides the Samsung logo.  If the phone asks you to unlock, return it.  If you see any carrier logo (I've read about Orange),  return it.  If the language is not the language of the your resident country, return it.  I do believe  the default language on an unopened phone is UK-English.  Also, a brand new phone will ask you to  choose a language on initial boot up.  This behavior is also the same on the phone after a factory  reset.3) International phone? - Just about any quad-band GSM phone is an international phone.  A quad-band GSM  phone guarantees to allow you to receive voice/slow data access.  If the phone is from AT&T; or T-Mobile, you  will not be able to use it while you travel outside of the U.S. unless your carrier unlocks it for you.  I own a  Samsung designed specifically for AT&T; and I've used it in different countries, also with different providers  in the same country, just fine - all because AT&T; unlocked it for me.  An AT&T; phone became an international  phone after a few minutes of chat with AT&T; service rep.  There are certain rules AT&T; may follow to decide  or determine whether your phone is eligible for unlock.  Most phone manufactures that used the once  dominating Nokia Symbian OS have supported multi-language for years.  Android is no different.  Sellers love to  use the word international as their marketing technique.4) Charger is not correct - Chargers will accept the range of A/C 110v~240v these days, no problem.  If  the plug does not fit U.S. wall jack, you can get an adapter easily for $2.  I've been using a  European USB charger on all my phones for the past 3 years.  The S3 Mini is not designated for U.S.  market, therefore it is not unusual to get a charger with European style plug.Now, onwards with my main objective.The first note on provider/network compatibility is that if your current phones you consider replacing carry the name Verizon or Sprint, or Virgin Mobile, this phone is -not- for you, unless you are looking to switch mobile provider.This phone does -not- work with Verizon and Sprint. Not because the unit is defective, it is simply not compatible with Verizon and Sprint networks. And, no expert at Verizon, Sprint or Best Buy can make it work for you, not even having Amy Poehler with you at Best Buy.  And no, we certainly don't need to activate GSM phone, and contacts can be downloaded onto your S3 Mini from the cloud if you've used Google ecosystem.  So, please, no negative review for this reason.The above note essentially leaves the rest of us GSM users, or potential GSM users, in the U.S. and other countries, to further consider/evaluate whether this phone fits the bill.This phone is -not- tied to any carrier, therefore is an unlocked phone that accepts mini SIM card from any GSM provider in the world. GSM providers in the U.S. are AT&T;, T-Mobile and other mobile virtual network operators such as Straight Talk and Net10, who resell similar services on/through AT&T; and T-Mobile network infrastructures.The model I tested is I8190.  I've read that there are 3 versions: i8190, i8190L and i8190N.  The i8190L is desiginated for Latin America; the i8190N is supposedly the i8190 with NFC, then there is the vanilla i8190 - the original, I suppose.  I haven't come across any document showing these 3 versions are different from network support perspective.  My advise is to consult with the seller for accuracy.  You should also check with your provider to find out what your provider network accepts.The I8190 supports GSM quad-band 850/900/1800/1900MHz which cover just about the entire spectrum 2G/EDGE/GPRS services that include voice service and slow data access. If your primary concern is voice service availability, you are all set with this phone in the U.S., when you jet set around the world or if you live in other countries which is 80% GSM world. And, you can still receive slow data access through 2G/EDGE.  You can also use WiFi as your alternative data access option.If you are also interested in using your phone as an high speed data device, the evaluation has just become much more complicated. This is where I think the biggest part of the community is always asking when potential buyers want to know if this phone will work.  The whether-it-works question should be divided into 2 parts: voice and high speed data access.  The voice/slow data access part has been addressed, and we'll discuss the high speed data access.In the U.S., to get 3G or HSPA-4G, aka WCDMA (not LTE-4G) service, the phone needs to support either 850Mhz or 1900MHz frequency bands.  When the product description shows \"3G: 900/2100MHz\", you will -not- get high speed data service. This is because AT&T; and T-Mobile do not operate 3G/HSPA+ on 900/2100MHz spectrum.  Yet, sellers can advertise the product as 3G capable without falsely advertise their products.  Please note this carefully.About 18 months ago, T-Mobile launched its new business model of \"Bring your own devices\" to mostly lure AT&T; iPhone users over. To achieve this, T-Mobile reconfigured most of its 3G/4G network onto 1900MHz, to stay compatible with AT&T; signal frequency. This has made it easier for us to switch between AT&T; and T-Mobile as long as the phone supports 1900MHz, and is unlocked.Please note that T-Mobile may -not- have 3G/HSPA service on 1900MHz deployed everywhere in the U.S., though the coverage is/has been expanding.In the Latin America, most mobile providers deploy their 3G/HSPA+ on 850/1900MHz, and that is why \"L\" version will most likely cover the entire the Americas. Some providers in the Americas do use 1700/2100MHz.In Europe/Asia, most providers deploy 3G/HSPA+ on 900/2100MHz; the 2 continents S3 Mini seems to target.  The best practice is to check with your mobile provider on the appropriate frequency bands before buying. And, contact Amazon/seller to check the bands supported on the devices.How well does the I8190 play in the confusing 3G/HSPA+ world? Quite well, I think. I confirm through the service menu that, the version I tested is a tri-band 3G/HSPA+ phone, supporting 900/1900/2100MHz spectrum. This is consistent with information I dug up everywhere but it doesn't address what I8190L is.  If we are willing to assume there is no difference on 3G/HSPA frequencies support, I believe the 1900/2100MHz range will cover most of the  3G access in the AmericasThe lack of 3G-850MHz support on this phone may render it less attractive.  Then again, this phone is intended more for Euro-Aisa market.  Nonetheless, this phone will serve as a wonderful phone, no punt intended, maybe even a camera, not a full-fledged PDA.  Please verify with your respective providers for network compatibility.I've personally tested the I8190 on both AT&T; and T-Mobile 1900MHz networks. The phone shows it canconnect to HSPA service, as denoted by the \"H\" symbol, on both networks.  In theory, it's probably H+ (HSPA+) but hardware design may have omitted the \"+\" symbol.I've also tested the phone's WiFi range capability and am impressed with it.  The range is even betterthan some of my other devices connecting to the same access point from the same spot.I further compared its speed performance with my Verizon LTE MiFi, and felt that this phone was able to keep pace in terms of internet access.  I tested apps download on the phone from Google Play, and I've also turn the phone into an access point for tethering from my tablet where I tested apps download and update, just to push the limit a bit.I have no intention to compare 3G/HSPA+ speed with LTE speed, particularly when I'm using two different providers on two different types of services.  I used this setup just to see how well the S3 Mini stacks up against a carrier-optimized device running on its native network. The user experience does not disappoint, I feel the S3 Mini can hold its own.  It is swift on the 3G/HSPA+ network as a mobile device, and being an access point to my Android tablet.To recap, here are the points to note:- GSM phones will -not- work with Verizon, Sprint or any CDMA operators.  Keywords in the product description to look for are \"GSM\", \"unlocked\",\"international phone.\" Such keywords imply you're looking at a GSM phone.* Amazon does have a separate section for phones with service contract which includes Verizon and Sprint, along with AT&T;, if you enjoy shopping on Amazon like I do.- With GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz support, the phone will guarantee compatibility for voice/slow data (2G/EDGE) service anywhere in the GSM world.- 3G/HSPA data access depends on HSPA bands supported on the phone. Frequency must match network operated by the specific provider. 3G bands are 850/900/1900/2100MHz.  This phone supports all but 850MHz.- Be sure to buy the phone that has the proper frequency support. HSPA quad-band is the safest choice if available.- Must match at least 1 of the HSPA frequency to receive 3G/HSPA data service.- In the U.S., a phone with support for HSPA 1900MHz band will get 3G/HSPA service on both AT&T; and T-Mobile networks.- Get detail info on supported bands from mobile provider and communicate with seller to ensure the phone has support for the particular frequency bands.Cheers!!", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "s3 mini", "Author": "Justin W.

I mainly text and send email, occasionally use navigation and sometimes use the data like if I need store hours or to find an ATM.

It read my T-Mo SIM card with no problems, synced up my contacts  via gmail and them synched up my bookmarks via chrome and danngggg I was on my way to being a Samsung fan.Some notes:  1) this phone takes a standard SIM, not a micro one. 2) The three buttons on the front are sensor lights.  There is no indicator light.  3) Use battery save mode and tone the screen down to a lower brightness to save battery.  Mine phone rarely goes down past 50% in any day when I do this.

I was on a family plan with AT&T; and had a flip phone for it originally. I was given another old 'smart' phone by a friend and when I did Data was added onto the plan. I wasn't able to use it so I wanted to buy a newer smart phone to use what we were paying for on our plan.Everything was working great at first. Around late November though my Data stopped working, and I thought it was the plan, and then realized it was the phone. I thought maybe it was a glitch that sometimes devices got those and I have been meaning to reset it to see if it fixed the problem.So the people I was on the plan with decided to switch carriers, so I was left with an unlocked phone. I got a SIM card from AT&T; for a GoPhone plan. I paid for it, even made a call to tell my mother that I had a phone number again.THAT'S WHERE THE REAL PROBLEM STARTS. All the sudden I couldn't make or receive calls or texts. I spend forever on the phone with AT&T; and they tell me that my account was locked because the phone I was using was reported stolen.STOLEN! I had bought this thing, it came right out of the box, even had a seal on it that said do not accept if seal is broken. The seal wasn't broken.I've been using the phone for months and now all the sudden it's stolen!? Far too late to return it now! I'm pissed! To top that off, I can't even put that SIM card into that old smart phone I have to use the phone for work because the account is locked and their fraud department won't unlock it.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "im not pleased", "Author": "Tivana", "ReviewID": "RM4SSPWE3L79Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I keep having this power reset or unknown upload mode problem.

I do not watch videos on my phone. I play a few games and text and make calls so I am not a heavy phone user. The biggest complaint I saw was the battery draining down to fast. I have not had the issue at all. I have to try and drain the battery. It will go a good 24 hours and only takes a few hours to charge (I plug it in around midnight, it will be down to about 15%, and it is done charging by 4 am) I do plug it in every night. But then I wasn't expecting the battery life of a non smart phone. I am sure as I figure out more of the phones features that I will it even more.The one down side that just can't be avoided is that the directions and the language on the phone was in French, this is an international phone and not sold in the US, so I was expecting this. I was able to Google how to change the language to English and down load an English version of the users manual, so it was easily over come.I am using this phone on a straight talk plan, on the east coast of the US and it works great so far!Overall, I am very happy with this phone, it meets my needs and then some.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung galaxy s3 mini", "Author": "Maredil", "ReviewID": "R1R4IPO94O3S10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is just perfect.

It is 8MP but some of the settings and options make the camera brilliant, some of the photos I have taken are better than photos I have seen on professional cameras.The screen is excellent and is the clearest screen I have ever seen. The first thing I did when I got the phone was play the sample movie, it shows how clear and detailed the screen is. Videos in High Definition are very clear !!. The sound is very clear too. I like games, so i'll comment on that. The performance for games is amazing. I downloaded 'ShadowGun' Which is free for the S3 from the Samsung app store. The revised version makes use of the quad core processor in the phone. The visuals are details, smooth and hardly any jagged edges. It performs with a solid frame rate; and I've never experienced slowdown on any games. The graphics are powerful enough to emulate play-station games.Other notable features are the sensors in the phone which do more things than I've actually used yet. This phone, granted, is expensive.

While the Fitbit sync is a bit unpredictable as the phone isn't on Fitbit's \"officially supported\" list, the phone itself is fine. There isn't a whole lot to say about it apart from that. If you want a Samsung smartphone that runs Android Jellybean, that is a reasonable size, this is a good choice. If you really want the 5\" screen, you won't want this as it's closer in size to older smartphones.There are a few things you need to be aware of if you plan to use this phone in the USA or Canada. First, it boots up in German, and it took me a bit of random tapping to find the Locale settings to change it to US-English. As soon as I got that over with, it hooked up just fine with my US carrier after (obviously) moving the SIM card from my old phone to my new one.Another thing is the charger -- it's a European style plug, not US. However, it comes with a regular USB cable, so you can connect it to your computer to charge, or to any 110v or 12v USB charger you happen to have lying around. It also doesn't come with a user manual, although you can find the PDF version by searching the web.Finally, although the phone is unlocked and will work with any GSM carrier, if you're looking for 3G data speeds this phone may not support the 3g channels your network uses. If you must have a 3g compatible phone, buy one from your carrier; if you just need one for voice calls, it will work fine on any GSM network.There's a good selection of \"aftermarket\" roms and modifications available if you're inclined to root your phone. Obviously this voids your warranty, and it isn't something you should attempt without at least some technical savvy and the awareness that you may \"brick\" the device or lose settings and data if you mess up.Bottom line: If you're looking for a small, reasonably priced smartphone that doesn't tie you to a specific carrier, this one's a good bet.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Security reasons", "Author": "Richard G.

There are many factors that contribute to short battery life: wireless coverage in the area you live, whether you have all possible social gimmicks turned on that keep draining your battery, running apps in background that are poorly written and waste CPU cycles, amount of time the screen is on and so on.Hope this review is helpful.

I plugged in my AT&T; sim card and it worked fine.My previous phone, a Nokia N85 would not act as a \"hot spot\" for my Kindle 8.9, something I desired.  This Samsung does.I had unlimited data on the Nokia with AT&T.; When I previously changed from a N75 to a N85, my unlimited data transferred with out a notice  from  ATT, who I far as I know, no longer offer unlimited data.  I was hoping it would slip by to the Samsung.  Not to be.  ATT almost immediately emailed me that my new smart phone was not eligible for continued unlimited data and signed me up for 3 GB plan, the smallest I believe they offer.  Oh well, no turning back.On the plus side, the data transfer rate (using speedtest) using my laptop through the phones as hot spots, is four to five times faster with the Samsung.The battery life was not good until I took some advice from some reviewers on dis-enabling some apps (search reviews for info). Also, leaving the wi-fi off when not in use is a big help.All my contacts came across to the Samsung with the sim card.  However, as far as I can find out,the Samsung contact list only allows for a one mobile and email entry, nothing else such as addresses or notes.I pretty much agree with all the positive comments about the phone.And that is all I have to say about that.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelent", "Author": "Abril Paolini Guaita", "ReviewID": "R1KBV88G4R6E9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this cellphone is spectacular.

She went back to a feature phone for two months with the big sim before I got the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini. The big AT&T; sim works with the S3 mini so no trip to the AT&T; store. She loves the phone. It's hard to pry it from her hands. The screen resolution is good but not iPhone 4/5 or Galaxy S3/ S4 great. She has all the features you would expect as a front and back facing camera and plenty of storage for apps. She can add extra storage but so far it's not needed. She uses the Pandora app for music and can watch Netflix as well (why would you want to with that 4 inch screen.) She's got all her games and apps. Now here's the great part for parents.When I got my daughter the iPhone 4 I was FORCED to include a data plan with it ($30 extra a month on my bill.)  The Samsung Galaxy S3 mini it seems a data plan is NOT required. AT&T; has not identified this phone as a smart phone and therefore I'm currently not paying for data only 9.99 plus tax for the line a month. AT&T; will automatically identify a smartphone and charge a data plan if you do not have data plan connected to that sim used to activate most smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini is not one of them. When I look at my account at AT&T; wireless my daughters phone is listed as a generic flip phone.So how is she accessing apps? Through wireless. The Galaxy S3 mini can connect to wireless networks like our home.  Starbucks, McDonalds etc does not seem to work for some reason. She can only connect at home. Im not sure why but i bet it's a setting she's not doing properly. So she still uses data at home. Just not cellular wireless data. And I save $30 dollars a month and don't have to monitor her data usage. Only her talk minutes. We have unlimited text messages on our plan.If you have a teenager without a job bugging you for a smartphone and your on AT&T;, get the Samsun Galaxy S3 mini. We've had the phone for 3 weeks now. My new billing cycle starts today so I'll truly know if AT&T; added a prorated data plan but I don't think so. Outside if the home she has no data.

My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void. I would LOVE to be writing a glowing review of this phone, but instead I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth regarding this so-called \"warranty\". I will likely steer as far away from Samsung as possible in the future. I had an LG that fell from a 6 foot high railing onto a concrete patio and the only thing that happened was the battery falling out. This fragile hunk of plastic broke in my pocket. I think I'll stick with LG next time... in the meantime, I get to spend the next 18 months with a phone that makes me angry every time I look at it. It's going to be a long 18 months.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung GT-i8190 Galaxy S3 Mini 3G 900/1900/2100 factory Unlocked..", "Author": "ROSA VIRGINIA GARCIA GUZMAN", "ReviewID": "R1H71PR8DAIUVN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone you buy unlocked clearly thought this time is that when trying to use is not compatible with any of the operators in my country (Venezuela) seems to me a lack of respect for these people who are not careful with the product you are finally dispatching.

Wat a rip off! !", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung I8190 S3 Mini Unlocked White Android", "Author": "Santa Candor", "ReviewID": "R3JU8EM7LL5X2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received today, the newest firmware/OS for the 4.1.2 OTA (on my phone directly) as it was updated from Samsung and this is very new at this date of Monday, August 5, 2013 and arrived in my phone's Notification area today. After the upgrade completed, I noticed at once that this phone is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very, very fast and responsive! This is the THIRD update that I received since I purchased this phone in April 2013. Each update is not that large, however, it enhances the performance of this phone. Very encouraged as if the updates keep coming regularly, perhaps4.2.2 will be coming to the S3 Mini. And from my research, it is possible that the S3 Mini may receive the 4.2 OS but it will be a while longer...Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. And when not near a WiFi, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

I researched for a long time and it had to have the following simple, but important features: Small enough to fit in my pocket, camera, video, text, and phone with audible, clear sound. This has all these features and so much more!When I first turned it on it came in a different language, but the easy start up settings allowed me to change the language. I also downloaded the english version of the manual from samsung.com.  Just google it, you'll find it. This smartphone is so easy to use and If you want the battery to last just disable the apps you don't want to use.The camera is my favorite feature.  I recently went on a trip and the pictures and video were awesome. I dare say better than my digitial camera.I also love the calendar widget.  I can enter all my appointments and tasks and it displays on my home page and keeps me on track.I have T-mobile and everyhing synchronized beautifully.  Even the employees at T-Mobile were blown away by my phone. They had never seen the mini and they thought is was so cute.Anyway, if you're looking for something easy to use, this is it.  I'm not a techy guru so I guess if you need fancier features then buy a huge brick phone, but I think this does just about everything a person needs. The only downside is that since its not sold in the U.S. a warranty is not provided and T-Mobile won't insure it. Why it's not sold in the U.S. is beyond me.

I was very happy to find it was brand-new, and came in a sealed box. The box said it was for use in Nordic countries, and all of the instructions were in Nordic languages, but that wasn't a problem because it is very user friendly. I charged it overnight (the charger worked in the local outlets), put in my SIM card (MTN Rwanda), and it has worked perfectly ever since! The phone is beautiful, has a crystal clear screen, and it meets all of my needs! However, I would suggest that you also get a case with a little grip. The phone by itself is very smooth and slippery!It was a lot cheaper to buy a Samsung phone online rather than buy it in Rwanda. It's also a lot better quality than the local brands that are shipped in from China.

My biggest complaint is what you'll see on various online reviews of this phone: sometimes it refuses to charge and I have to shut it off and then plug it in for it to charge properly. This will happen for a day or two and then it will suddenly decide that it can be charged while turned on for a week or so. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the issue. The AC charging cord that it came with was surprisingly cheap-looking, but it charges with the myriad of Blackberry cords that I have from past phones so that wasn't a big deal.

It was mostly a positive experience.I bought a SIM card through Straight Talk website (ATT-card, not Tmobile one), installed it, activated it (again, through website) and I was ready to make calls.One issue that I came across and why I'm taking away one star. At first I didn't have 3G connectivity (only E). Hours with Straight Talk shoot-me-in-the-face-customer-support didn't help. Restarting the phone, entering and re-entering all the settings - nothing got it to work. If you are having the same issues:-go to settings>more settings>mobile networks>network mode-switch to GSM or WCDMA (not auto) (it will ask you if you want to turn off data to do it, say ok)-switch back to Auto mode-if that doesn't change your data to 3G or H do it a few more times.After a couple weeks the problem may return - you will be stuck with E (EDGE). All I can do is to keep following the same procedure.Other than that the phone is great. Tons of apps on google play, amazing screen contrast and resolution, perfect size, and since it's not the top model anymore - affordable price.

Two days after I received the phone, the wall charger stopped charging. The charger that came with the phone was cheap looking and the micro USB was already slightly loose before it stopped charging. I tried several wall chargers, but these phones expect some fairly specific chargers. After several attempts, I succeeded in getting it charged using an iphone wall charging block and a Samsung  Galaxy Note 10.1 charger. Then more charging problems appeared: the battery would not fully charge even letting it charge overnight night (it would reach 86-87% maximum); the phone would discharge rapidly with modest use (email reading, a couple of phone calls/text messages) even with power saving mode on and terminating applications often. Final problem: as I heard that upgrading to firmware 1.4.2 may help with the charging issues, I tried to update it using Kies. Kies would not even recognize it as a Samsung phone. I tried various versions of Kies, with no success. It seems like this phone cannot be upgraded in the US unless you do in an unofficial way.

The actual charger outlet plug is a GB outlet but it came with a american charger adapter, also there was a usb cable included(phone can be charged this way also). There is a standard sim card slot NOT micro.  Phone also came with headphones. There is also a micro SD slot.The phone is very easy to use and the size is just right the mini size is ABOUT the size of a iphone, the non-mini is quite too lage for me. I can just throw this phone in my pocket without it being bulky. I have used this phone for about 2 months now.  U can view movies and play games of course but the battery goes quite fast so it needs to be charged daily. Even with just standard use (phone calls and text only) it can only go 2 days without charging.The flashlight and calender functions is my favorite.  The camera is good but it does have a tendency to blurr. This phone does work with US carriers and european but u must buy a sim card from them, its cheaper to go to walmart/bestbuy and buy a sim card.

Essentially, I always got the subsidy phone (i.e. free/cheapy phone) whenever I renewed my contact with Tmobile.  However, since they've scrapped their subsidies, I figured it was time to branch out a bit.I was torn between the Galaxy S3, and the new Nokia Lumia. Was honestly leaning more toward the Nokia, but my friend has been having nothing but trouble with her Nokia (different model, to be fair) so I erred on the side of caution.I bought from one of the independent sellers and figured I was totally safe since I already knew this model was compatible with my carrier.  WELL, no one told me about \"international\" phones, so imagine my shock when I opened up the box and EVERYTHING was in French. (next time do MORE research before purchasing.  Lesson learned!)Charged her up (thank GOD it's USB, because wall charger was European), and turned it on. After fumbling around for a bit, finally set the language to English.After that, everything is great! The OS runs super fast (or maybe it just seems that way since my last phone was the G2 (google phone)), and navigating a website in Firefox no longer makes me want to smash my head into walls.  Video runs smooth, and I hardly ever have streaming issues (especially on wifi).Speaking of videos, the picture is amazing, and for scale, the screen is almost the exact size of a credit card.  Lightweight, palm sized, and let's face it... it's cute as hell!When I first showed this phone off to my friend, her exact words were:  \"That's not a Samsung Galaxy.  It's too damn small!\"  Apparently the mini isn't well known?  (or maybe just not in the States?  I have no idea..)My only gripes are minimal:1) being a European phone, apparently there's something about the device itself that makes it so you cannot disable the shutter sound when you take pics (even if you have an app to do so).  Bummer.  No more taking covert pics of drunks on the bus.  (It's pretty loud, too).2) The display does not have 4G.  After doing some research on this, learned that for whatever reason, 4G is displayed as \"H\" (to mean \"high speed\"?)  But when the \"H\" is up, it is, in fact, running on 4G.3) Sometimes there are inexplicable signal drops.  Not sure why this is happening, was never an issue with the ol' G2.Anyhoo, hope this helps if you're thinking about it.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Redial Issue", "Author": "Shaji John", "ReviewID": "R1RIJONP76ZG7F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I live in the United States and when I redial a number, it automatically adds a plus in front of it.

Although the Amazon product technical specs will say it has NFC but not all seller sells the NFC version. They are pretty much the same price but I'm one of the unlucky ones that just click on the first available seller and gotten the non-NFC version. Grrrr... Not very happy about that because I specifically picked this phone because of the NFC capability technical specs on Amazon... And this is a phone for my wife. I have the S3 (it's bigger brother) and the NFC feature would have allow us to transfer and share media with much eased.PROS: The phone has great power for its small size. As a gear head for high tech devices, for this price I would have chosen the better performance of the Nexus 4 but this phone is not for me. This is for my wife (not too concern with performance) and she wants a smaller phone. She wants the best performance phone at a much smaller size. So... S3 mini is the best bet (without resorting to the iPhone). Although this phone carries a no name CPU, this phone out of the box this phone will score around 3000 on quadrant which is beats the performance of many full size phones (such as the galaxy nexus, Galaxy S2,LG optimus 2X, etc). One thing Amazon forgot to mentioned is it's awesome gorilla glass which make the screen scratch resistant. That is definitely a very nice feature to have. Speakers are also very load for its size and battery life is awesome.CONS: It comes with Touchwiz and I'm not a Touchwiz fan but you can download your own launcher. The storage space is also small. Althought it is 8GB, it is only around 4GB usable space so don't look to install a lot of apps and games. This phone is for my wife and she is mostly concern with pictures and music. Pictures, music, and non-app files can be stored on micro SD card so this 4GB internal storage is plenty of room for her. If you want to install a lot of apps and games, consider the 16GB version.Looks very similar to S3. Performance is not at par with the regular S3 but it's very impressive for a small phone. I would have given 5 stars if not for the False advertisement.

I experienced a long list of issues with this device.-First, there is no reason why it should exist at this price point. So far as I can tell the only reason why anyone ever buys one of these is because it says \"Samsung Galaxy SIII\" and it costs a lot less than a real Galaxy SIII. But underneath its roughly the same as a bad Motorolla Atrix (the first generation one that was state of the art back in 2011). $300 for an unlocked GSM Android phone with a 1ghz CPU, 8 gigs of storage and no LTE? Give me a break. The Motorola Atrix HD I replaced this with (much bigger higher res screen, better camera, better battery life, 50% faster CPU, and LTE capability) was actually cheaper. In late 2013 this would be a $100 phone even if it wasn't a complete piece of crap. I made the mistake of ordering it because I get a drop of water under the glass of my real Galaxy SIII knew I only had a very few minutes to order a replacement before my screen would be gone forever and my phone unusable, and I did not have time to shop around or check the specs carefully enough. Don't make my mistake. If all you need is an HSDP+ phone with a 1 gig CPU and minimal storage there are a million old models that are reasonably durable, work properly, and are much cheaper.Other problems with this device:-Like the real Galaxy SIII the screen is very fragile, only moreso because the glass is thinner. I cracked my screen by knocking it onto a wood floor and the drop was literally 2' I'd left the phone sitting on to of a small paper shredder.-Everything that Samsung finally did right with the real Galaxy SIII (good quality sound, relatively long battery life, generally good fit and finish, general lack of bugs in the OS, reliable bluetooth connectivity and tethering, ect) they cheaped out on with the mini. This was a direct throwback to the original quirky and unreliable Galaxy S and I mean that in a bad way.-The typical side mounted power/wake button used on so many android (and esp Samsung Android phones) was way oversensitive, as was the touchscreen. I've never seen a capcitive touchscreen that could be activated by so many random touches that did not come from my fingers. This caused constant random setting changes, ass-dialing and ass-texting worse than I experienced with some phones with push button controls, and some setting changes I never even figured out how to reverse.-GPS reception was also the worst of any android phone I've used (and this was my 6th) it was the first such phone that did not allow me to use the Runkeeper app to track the distance I run because it would constantly loose GPS reception in the park where I'd finish my runs.-Call quality on the receiving end was abysmal. My conversations were constantly interrupted because the person on the other end could not understand me.-Finally, after just 5 months, the phone quit charging. Even though I spent over $300 on this thing, and its still under warranty (I admit I'm typically really hard on phones, but I was very careful with this one), and it cost me well over $300, I'm honestly not sure whether I'm even going to bother to send this in. My 3 year old Samsung Infuse with the cracked screen is seriously looking like a better backup option.Ok, look with every phone some people are bound to get a lemon, so its not impossible you could order this phone and not have the same oversensitive side button/screen issue I had. But you will inevitably overpay for this thing, and its going to be way slower than the real SIII. Also I doubt the crappy sound quality, GPS reception, bluetooth, ect was luck of the draw. More often than not, Samsung has put out phones that in my experience did not have the same quality hardware as say Motorola (my previous real Galaxy SIII was an exception to this), they obviously cut corners left and right with regard to the specifications they advertise, so I strongly doubt the low quality I experienced with regard to the hardware components was simply bad luck with regard to quality control. Bottom line, the \"full size\" (ie real) Galaxy SIII is a very good phone apart from the fragile screen (I don't know anyone who owned on for more than 4 months without cracking the screen), and totally worth owning if you can stand the price (which is still high even though there's now an S4). The S III Mini on the other hand is a terrible phone, noticeably inferior in just about every way possible, and sold at a ridiculously high price considering what you get.

The screen size is actually  than iphone4 . However there are some downsides that seriously negatively affect my scoring on this item. The charger is the most stupid one I have ever seen, it plugs into an adaptor and then another adaptor before it is able to plug into a power outlet. The stacking of adapters not only looks awful but very inefficient as well , it disconnects from power from time to time during charging. Several times I charged this phone overnight but only got 10% charged! The seller tried to help me with a replacement charger, but it does not well either. The second drawback is its typing input. Other devices wll let you know which letter you touched and selected from the tiny pop out keyboard but galaxy mini does not .this is particularly annoying when typing passwords that the screen does not display the letters you typed. Except the above , this device is good.After writing the review above, one commented that it's stupid to give a low rate just because of its charger. The problem is more than the charger, it's design needs to improve as well. The on/off button on the side is so protruding that it's very easy to accidentally touch the button and uneventfully close the screen you are watching or working on. Because it happened so frequently to me( I believe same to other users t) compared to my iPhone 4, I tend to like more of my iPhone 4 and dislike this mini .Now the price is again dropped another $50, it's not too bad to buy it compared to unchanged iPhone.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I paid double shipment and and handling", "Author": "Joy", "ReviewID": "R2N1SZUTRF67AS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Because I have to pay double shipment.
