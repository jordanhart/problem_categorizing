{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My entire family LOVES it", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Amazon.com Fan!\"", "ReviewID": "R2KXHYIHYG3QZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband is hard of hearing and does not see well.  My mom is 78 years old and is tech impaired. We all wanted a basic phone that we could call with and receive calls with.  This phone has large enough keys that my husband can use it and he has large fingers. The fonts and buttons are large enough that he can see them without having to put on reading glasses, yet since it is a flip phone it is still small. My mom can use it without trouble. All she has to do is dial or answer.  Flip it open to answer and close it to hang up. (That is an option.) It can be turned up loud enough so that my husband can hear with no trouble.  I like the fact that I can use it as a prepaid phone as we don't make or receive many calls.  It is wonderful to have in case of an emergency or to talk to each other when away from them. So far, I have not found a place that I could not receive a signal.  The one and only drawback is that it does not have bluetooth capability. That is my complaint. Nobody else in my family wants one.  This is the best phone for senior citizens or disabled people that I have ever seen. Small enough to carry in your pocket or you can use a holster.  The part I absolutely LOVE is that it has a charging cradle so all you have to do is set it in the cradle to charge it. My husband would have a problem charging it any other way due to his vision problems.  And the charge lasts for over a week, whether you talk on it a lot or not.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs just a basic phone or has any of the problems I mentioned above. It is also very inexpensive, and that is also a big plus.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for visually impaired, especially with Page Plus Cellular", "Author": "Carl L.

This replaced an LG, which had Page Plus Cellular service that works through the Verizon network. Because the U310 is already set up to work with the Verizon network, it was very easy to transfer the service from the old LG to the new Samsung Knack U310 on Page Plus Cellular. Phone number remained the same. All the minutes transferred to the Knack. Also renewed the Page Plus Service for another 120 days simply by adding $10 worth of minutes. This is a good, basic phone with large buttons. So, it is a natural for anybody with vision problems. Also, it has no camera or other things to confuse anybody who just wants a simple, basic phone. I did extensive research before purchasing this phone and highly recommend it.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't work.", "Author": "Lotte", "ReviewID": "R3TK7DB3XXYK2Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product cuz the description said that the ESN was clear.
