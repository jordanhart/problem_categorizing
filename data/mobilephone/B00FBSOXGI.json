It was shipped in just a flimsy soft envelope, with a bit of bubble wrap.  It certainly should have been shipped in a small box!  The apple box was previously opened and the corner smashed.  The phone was covered with greasy fingerprints.  All the attachments, except the cheap earbuds were missing.  No info or operating instructions.  There is no identification if it is an 15s, or 15, or locked or not.Now I have to wait up to three days to obtain approval from \"Solid (Crap) Purchases\" to return it, and wait again for a refund.. Other shipping companies associated with Amazon have better wrapped and cared more in delivering a $10 item, in comparison to a fragile new apple iphone costing several hundred dollars.  I will never purchase anything from \"Solid Purchases\" again.  Avoid the big disappoint I am experiencing, and consider selecting another shipper.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great and beautiful!", "Author": "AppleFriend", "ReviewID": "R3JQ4KIOG1MRXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes I love it...works great ..is fast..gold is fancy!
