{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't buy via FGS Trading", "Author": "jcminaz", "ReviewID": "R3BCLYVUR342JH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to take on a trip to South America.  The phone arrived the day before my trip.  I ordered late so this arrival date was expected.  I purchased this phone because I needed an unlocked quad band phone.  When I opened the box there was not users manual.  I turned the phone on only to find out that the phone was manufactured for European usage. The screen language was some unreadable Eastern European language. Czch, Polish, I don't know.  I spent several hours trying to hack my way around the set up. It was apparently asking for various codes to initiate the phone.  I have a full size android phone so I figured I could figure out how to get into settings and change the language to English.  However, I could not get past the two entry screens that were asking for some kind of code.  I had no idea I was buying an Easter European phone.  The description on Amazon was not clear that I would need a language decoder to figure out how to turn the phone on.  Of course, FGS trading does not have a customer service phone number. You must attempt to communicate via email. After I finally got a response, they basically were of no help and told me that I should have know it was a European phone. Thanks FGS!  I finally decided to call the SIM chip provider while sitting in the Miami airport. They took the time to help me try to figure out the missing code situation. Finally, after an hour on the phone with them, I got the phone past the sign in problem and was able to get into settings and change the language.  I think it is really poor service to send a phone to a customer with no explanation that they are not going to be able to read the phone when they turn it on.  If FGS is going to send a Eastern European phone to a US customer, they should, first make it clear with bold print on the Amazon page that this is not a US phone. Second, they should include a \"cheat sheet\" in the box that explains how to get past the unreadable log in process to initiate the phone.As for the phone itself.  I had poor reception in Latin America. Not sure if this was the phone of the SIM company I chose. I have since used the phone in the South Pacific with a Vodifone SIM and had very good reception.  Be warned, this phone is tiny. I have a Samsung Galaxy so I assumed this Galaxy would be of similar size. Wrong.  The \"Y\" stands for \"Youth\" which apparently means it is designed for a tiny hand. Read the small print on the Amazon page about the dimensions.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "jamal", "ReviewID": "R11FWRBS5OSL8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a lovely item i will definitely recommend this to anyone..also it is affordable so you get to save on some funds as well..", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gran celulra, es muy bueno.", "Author": "Jose P.", "ReviewID": "R24Z3L1522KAXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "este tel\u00e9fono celular lo compre para ser utilizado en Venezuela y trabaja de maravilla, viene desbloqueado para trabajar con cualquiera operadora telef\u00f3nica.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "excellent", "ReviewID": "RLU6MPPCPKMWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent // I love it..
