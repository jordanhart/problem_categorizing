First, lightweight, but with a feel of value, not cheap.  When writing this review I have only had the phone for two days.  Next, within 24 hours of receiving the phone Asus upgraded the Os to Jellybean, which I had experienced on the Samsung Note II and the Samsung 10.1.  Everyone, this phone is like a Subaru, one of the best cars around that almost no one knows about.  I am not really going to talk about the OS, everyone can read about it.  However, I will say that I use Tmobile, and this International phone connected well.  The ease of taking the phone out of the docking station and using it as a regular phone . . . awesome.  The ease of putting the phone into the docking station and using it as a tablet, awesome.  This phone does it all good, very good.  Now, the bad, it does not have a stylus, and I wish it did because the aftermarket ones just do not feel right.  It is not easy to obtain protective wear for it, so . . .  Finally the price, it might be hard to completely justify it.  However, by going on the Tmobile phone service, reduced my bill by $650.00 per year, the ability to carry a tablet to meeting, conduct about 3200 text messages a month, and 2400 minutes of talk time per month.  I can account for the price.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "PadFone 2 - Android phone with a useful gimmick", "Author": "Jonas", "ReviewID": "RJGLAZASE5AVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I need to state that I have tested this product as part of ASUS's test pilot programme, so you'll just have to take my word for it when I say that I'm not biased in any way.So whats good about the PadFone 2?+ The display is excellent with seriously bright backlighting at highest setting and nice colors and black levels. Its IPS+ and has pretty good viewing angles.+ Light. Because its almost all plastic it feels light but still manages to feel solid at the same time.+ The camera is awesome for a mobile phone camera! It also records in 1080p.+ The hardware in this thing is superb, sporting 2 gigabytes of RAM, a Snapdragon S4 processor and Adreno 320 GPU.+ The battery life, especially with the tablet, is good considering its performance. The battery on my PadFone lasts on average 36 hours of average use. The fact that the tablet can charge the phone while you use it is a huge plus as well!+ Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean and the standard user interface free of branded clutter. Well, almost free anyhow.+ Phone and tablet share hardware, so it does'nt need a separate SIM-card. Its also one less gadget to carry with you and synch files and apps to.So what about the not-so-good?- Hot! This thing gets real warm under heavier workloads, even going so far as to get hot when used docked in the tablet.- Non-standard USB. Sure, they threw in an adapter for micro-USB but this will still mean that extra cables will probably be expensive and/or a pain to find.NOTE!!: Regular micro-USB WILL fit in the port and seems to charge the unit. I have however heard people say that this might damage the port if one is not careful.- There is a minor bug where apps disappear from the taskmanager when docked and vice versa. I also encountered a system crash in camera-mode but it only happened once or twice.All in all this is a really nice phone that happens to come with a pretty good tablet that offers you a lot of interesting sollutions. After testing it out for a week I found the phone to be much better than my old HTC One X since the former runs better due to superior hardware specs and its user interface is regular Jelly Bean as opposed to HTC's \"Sense\" which tends to be a regular pocket-sized bloatware-festival. Considering the price this might not be the best choice for those who just want a phone and could do without the tablet, but if you appreciate the benefits of the phone/tablet-hybrid and are looking for a tablet as well as a phone, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option right now.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Nordic Testpilot checking in", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1754EM1BZHB0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am part of the testpilot program, which ASUS is running in Scandinavia. That means I get to borrow a Padfone 2 2-in1 set, and do what I want with for a month.I have only used it over the weekend, so this is not complete review, and I'll keep it short.Positives:- The station is light, while the phone is just heavy enough. It feels a bit more massive than the S3.- The screens on the phone and station are crisp.- Everything runs fast and smooth. Though, I have not installed alot of apps.Negatives:- The screen and touchbuttons on the phone are just a bit too close. I often, mistakenly hit the homebutton instead of space (I use Swiftkey).- Whenever you dock the phone, and pull it back out, background apps restart. I use Timeriffic to automatically change a few settings. This will close and function until I manually start it up again. (This I have found a solution for: settings -> asus customized settings -> Dynamic Display Switch List)It runs vanilla Android, which in my opinion is a huge plus. The few apps ASUS has bundled seem ok, but I have not used them.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Padfone 2, The Best in Town?", "Author": "Disco", "ReviewID": "R35A8GJ3KCEAJD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my 32GB ASUS Padfone 2 and Tablet combination now for nearly three weeks. I do not intend to talk about specs as if you are looking at one of these you probably already know them. I would like to talk about my personal impressions of the set up. Firstly the handset: It is sleek, a good weight and well made. The screen is pin sharp in all lighting conditions. All buttons are metal and operate well, I would of preferred a dedicated camera button but many handsets leave these off these days. The shape is pretty much the same as most high end handsets out there apart from its width which is decidedly wedge shaped. Whilst the reason for this is obvious, it allows it to slot in its Tablet with ease, it has negated the potential provision (for now) of suitable cases for it, leaves you the pull out pouch and a flip front that goes down, I always seem to have the damn thing upside down when I need to answer call etc. I like Gel covers, it makes the grip better and allows quicker access to your screen, no-one has come up with a suitable case so far in my opinion. You can argue that it would slow down utilising tablet insertion but so do the other cases. There are no physical buttons on the front, I certainly miss my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Home Button, it would be ok if the three virtual buttons didnt dissapear so quickly after operation, I guess I will get used to this. It is not the latest Jelly Bean version you get which is a shame but the unlock screen works well to Google Now & Camera, very slick. ASUS havent overly skinned Android here which is nice, there is a whole host of customisations of course but I find the stock setup just fine. A massive positive for me was how strong my mobile and data reception was compared to my friends S3, iPhone 5, Droids etc. It loads data at a fiercely quick pace and keeps its signal when others fail, this is essential to me and an all too common failure in other handsets I have owned. Now to its shortcomings: the audio is pretty terrible, the sound is very tinny and there is perceptable vibration on high volume calls, this is very dissapointing for a high end handset such as this. The audio when listing to music is also under par, either through the appalling provided headphones of through its speaker. ASUS seemed to have saved its best audio traits for when it connects to the tablet, ASUS make much of its performance when docked but to be honest its nothing to shout home about, my Playbook does far better, as did my Sammy Note. Now to the camera, at 13mp and reputedly a Sony provided sensor etc, I expect much better performance, it just doesnt lock on to subjects as well as my Sammy or my Razr, the burst capability is neat but still I think gimmicky. I have found it hard so far to get a steady shot, I need practice however so will report back later on my success. I certainly would not leave my stand alone camera at home if i needed quality shots like I could with my Sammy Note! Leaving the handet now, it is a very nice and slick piece of kit, as nice looking as anything else on the market. Would I keep it as a standalone productt though? Actually no, I reckon there are a couple of handsets out there that have the beating of it HOWEVER, I havent yet mentioned its party piece, the Tablet. A superb piece of engineering went into the operation of placing the handset into the back of its tablet, it just so works. I seem to be able to guide it into the back from the front without looking at it, even in the dark and, it NEVER falls out, well done ASUS! When in, instantly it transforms into a lovely tablet configeration. Even if not all Apps will allow themselves to grow with it (ASUS need to work on gettng more devs on board) there is more than enough to make this combo shine. The screen although not as good as the handset is plenty good enough. The look on others faces when I carry out this operation and start using the tablet still makes me smile. When holding with one hand it can creak a little, I dont get this with my iPad or Playbook and dont see why it should here but, I guess compromises have been made to allow the handset and tablet to be lighter than an iPad. Battery sharing options are excellent, I dont think I am experiencing the same levels of charge as ASUS claim but they are still pretty good. I would of preferred a bigger battery than inbuilt and would still love to be able to hotswap batteries and external memory but you cant have everything. The tablet does rock on a flat surface but i almost never laid my other tablets flat anyway so thats no biggie. In conclusion, I LOVE THE COMBINATION, I wish 1. There was keyboard for this padfone and 2. They didnt bring out three padfones in one year, (mine became obsolete immediately after i purchased it as they outed the Padfone Infinity a day later), not bad going as none of them are even avialable in the UK yet. This combination and convergence can only get better in my humble opionion and credit where credit is due to ASUS for trying. Will it sell? I dont know but IF YOU DONT BRING IT OUT IN MY COUNTRY ASUS, HOW CAN YOU TELL.
