Its been approx. 10 years and it hasn't stopped. Im 20, but I have gotten so usto this phone I have a hard time parting with $100+ for a phone that isn't as reliable.  I love this phone, its just too bad cel phone companies don't make reliable phones like this one. Texting can be annoying but I got usto it. Its an old phone after all. Great for someone who wants a simple phone that does what its supposed to -call & text. And it should last a lifetime. I've dropped it more times than I can possibly imagine from many surfaces -without a cover or case- and this thing is as solid a brick. most guys my age pitty me for having an old phone but I pity them for having to lose another 150 bucks or more for a new one every time theirs breaks (every year or two). This phone has saved me a lot of money, but I may keep it as a backup for my new phone. As great as it is, I want a newer more modern phone that takes better pics -although people are surprised at the clear pics I've taken with this oldie. I only with I can have another one of these custom made into a newer touch screen model. if my new phone breaks, Ill always have this old faithful.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00727JEEM"}}
