There are absolutely NO other phones, that even compare, beleieve me i've dealt with Sony Erricson, Samsing, LG and what not. Nokia are the best. THey're previous Communicators were bigger, and as amaing, I never thought they could beat it. But of course, being nokia, they paved the way.  This phone, is smaller, and thinner than the previous 9500 and 9300i. It is just slightly wider, the chasm used to open it is much stronger, and the keys illumuminated (finally! in the inner keyboard), and the outer keys are amazingly easy to use. The software, the speed, and camera, all amaing. Nokia outdid themselves on this one, this is a much improved phone, working seamlessly, keeping up with every task. The camera, 3.2 MP is a nice addition as is the 2nd VGA camera. Dont be fooled by the review above me, this phone is amazing. I've had it for abt 3 months now, bought it for a very high price. I cudnt be happier...if you do hear bad reviews abt this, its coz most ppl are new to the symbian software. It allows multiple programs to run simultaneously, for e.g. you can surf the net, access the menu turn on the media player listen to music, and at the same time  view a powerpoint of word file. Course, you can switch between these like on a computer, but you need to know how to. Many ppl new to this, just think like any other phone pressing the 'end call' button closes everything. Thats not the case here! Ppl forget to close the programs, and open in addition to 4 or 5, and then complain abt it crashing. It can handle many many at the same time, but sometimes you forget and have too many open (there is a dedicated button to see whats open and switch). So anyone complaining it abt it being slow, is simply not using it properly. All Sumbian 60 series phones can do this...my last phone was the N93.

Exel", "ReviewID": "R21FP0CA7EQIR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to an E90 after 1.5 years using a Nokia 9300 to it's limits.My impression is that they made a list of every single complaint I had about the 9300 and addressed each of them! It's a fantastic cell phone and I love it.- on the 9300 I didn't even bother looking at the outside S40 screen, I opened it each time even to place a call; with the E90, switching seamlessly from screen to screen just by opening and closing the phone, I find myself using the outside screen more and more, I even T9 type text in the numeric keypad!... the outside screen is great for one hand operation, great not to call too much attention to a full qwerty phone when I don't want to and great for the casual email read... I think if I didn't have the option of switching to the internal big and high-resolution screen I'd find myself cursing the QVGA outside screen, but knowing I have the option of a big screen at any time makes me more tolerant to the smaller resolution outside screen and I use it a lot- the keyboard back-light is something you don't use all the time but when you do you realize how incredibly great it is- the inside screen, with even higher resolution than on the 9300 is absolutely great- the keyboard could be a little softer but the truth is that I find myself making less typing mistakes than with the 9300; the new layout is much better and the \"joystick\" much more precise- vibrating alert is great but I miss the timed mode that makes it come back to the ringing General profile at a specified time- the camera could have an optical zoom but it's good enough like it is... 640*480 30fps video is great- sound recording and playback has very good quality- the interface to the WiFi interface and to the GPRS/EDGE/3G APNs is great and makes me confident I'm in control of what is being used or not, unlike some complaints I heard with WM6 that you suddenly find yourself using EDGE when you wanted wifi, etc- the GPS and Nokia Maps is awesome but I also use Google Maps a lot with it- firmware/software upgrade through PC Suite is a blessing- I had a 9300 (no WiFi) and an unlimited data plan, I find myself using GPRS (or EDGE or 3G) data much more often than WiFi in the E90 but in some situations, specially when you are away from your country and GPRS data is expensive, Wifi is very much welcome- the 9300 Internet browser was a joke... very slow! when I found Opera Mini for it I never looked back to the internal browser; on the E90 the internal browser is very good, and the ability to play Flash and even YouTube video is very interestingThe single complaint I have about it is that it's S60 and not S80... the larger availability of software is welcome but I miss having a menu, I miss having more qwerty keyboard shortcuts, I miss the more elaborate S80 Calendar application...Not S60/S80 related:The few keyboard shortcuts it has are totally undocumented, I can't understand why.Another complaint is the lack of a \"open new window\" command on the Internet browser... it does that when you click a link that instructs is to open a new window, but this command is not in the browser interface! I'd also like the Back command not to reload the page... would make it faster!Last point: don't make the mistake of buying this phone and using a limited or expensive data plan, you'll be missing a lot!", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "IT'S MADE IN FINLAND.

(that's huge and prefect for it's OS; you can do lots of multi-tasking!)MicroSD HC! (8 GB support confirmed; probably even 16 and 32 GB will work!!!)The QWERTY keyboard is just perfect: takes very little time to get used to it and keys are big enough.Both screens are awesome! You can play games, music and movies and read and write documents without burning your eyes.It's 3.2 MP Camera is pretty decent (It's similar to Nokia N73, without Carl-Zeiss optics). It even records video at 640x480 at 30 fps!!!It's got integrated GPS (with AGPS support).I can't say there are cons; however this is what I would improve/implement in future versions:-WCDMA 850/900/1800/1900 MHz-5 MP camera with Carl-Zeiss Optics and Xenon flash (like N82).-Camera lens cover (either like N73 or N82).-Multiaxis (3 or 6-way) Accelerometer (like N82/N95).-Pencil Key (Nokia removed this extremely useful key from newer phones; I got used to it with my previous N73)-Magnetometer (Compass) like 6210 Navigator.Hope this is useful for anyone thinking of buying this phone.It's worth every single cent!!!Regards,Gonza", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON IS MISSING.

For about 1200$. If you think this is expensive, at the same time in russia these phones were going for almost 6000 dollars.Given finland borders russia. Hehe. Well my phone was made in singapore or korea i dont remeber precisely but definitely not in finland. Back in those times this model was way ahead of its competitors. Bluetooth printing options wifi tons of apps for symbian, easy friendly yet familiar and powerful os. The big screen was amazing and best till amoled and other recent advances were made in that department. The keyboard is still the best to date in my opinion. Speakers are exceptional with plenty of power. Mg alloy was used for internal chassis and 90 percent external plates ( you had to have plastic covering antenna). I was a 20 year old kid when I bought this premium business phone and with all misuse and abuse it looked brand new for 2 years after. The paint is extremely tough.Now the issues I had. First the rubber stumps on the phone which suppose to dumpen the screen being closed and keep it elevated from the keaboard after several years wore down and the keys started scratching the screen. I was careless and let it scratch up the screen pretty bad. To a point where i got a 60 dollar replacement screen which worked just as good. The reception was quite mediocre due to all mg alloy in this phone. Especially when the phone is used in open mode reception for some reason went down drastically. It was very annoying for traffic using apps such as ebuddy im. This phone survived to many drops but one fatal drop 4 years later the mic crapped out. I know some people replace them, but it is some hightech piezoelectric crystal based unit which was a pita. Also at that point the phone could not compete with android and iphone in terms of web browsing. It is slow and buggy comparatively to modern phones.  Why did i say it was the best phone? Today people go through one phone a year spending 400 to 800 dollars. I had this phone for almost 5 years for just 1200 and it was a leader phone for 2 years atleas and a competent adversary to other phones on the market to the end, and only one part of it (mic) broke. Also i ended up selling it easy for 200 $ afterwards. For today my advice would be get an old e61 in good condition if you have that itch to own one of the nokias bulet proof phones from back of the day I use it right now in conjunction with android tablet.

Nokia knows about certain design flaws that make actually talking and hearing on their phones impossible.  My E-90 cost me the biggest part of $1000 US Dollars, but stopped working in less than 18 months.  Nokia said that there was a change in design that had corrected that problem, but though they knew about it, they did not feel any responsibility to fix it. \"Would I be interested in buying a new phone?\"  Hmmmmm....  The prior Nokia Communicator had a joy stick that got stuck which also did not meet their minimum requirements for a design flaw; so they wouldn't fix it.  The Nokia I owned before that had keys that disolved and came right off; before I lost all my keys, I called to them about it, and they said -- in less than 1 year -- that is was cosmetic that their keys wouldn't stay on.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to recommend their latest phones, but one thing is sure.  Nokia doesn't care anything about customer service and about maintaining their good name.  If they did, they wouldn't abandon people who have such a memory about being repeatedly burned.

Die bilder/filme-files werden auch immer mit vorschau angzeigt, was ja an sich auch eine tolle option ist, aber abschaltbar w\u00e4re n\u00f6tig.o kleinschrift gibt's nicht, das erste wort wird immer gross geschrieben. F\u00fcr notorische kleinschreiber wie mich ist das nervig.o Die anzeige-einstellungen (beim vorg\u00e4nger meist in etwa 3 gr\u00f6ssenstufen) sind hier zwar einstellbar \u00fcber schriftgr\u00f6sse (einmal pro ger\u00e4t), aber sie werden nur an ganz wenigen stellen \u00fcberhaupt eingesetzt, der rest bleibt unver\u00e4ndert.o Ein neues sms ist reingekommen, beim alten ger\u00e4t ein tastendruck, das anzusehen.

Kein r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig, kein abbrechen, kein speichern unter. batterie raus, das k\u00f6nnte helfen.o Daf\u00fcr gibt es in fast jedem men\u00fc ein eintrag hilfe. Das w\u00e4re ja grunds\u00e4tzlich nichts schlechtes, da aber die men\u00fcs auf dem breitschirm immer vertikal, von oben nach unten angezeigt werden (ein absoluter bl\u00f6dsinn) muss jedes men\u00fc gescrollt werden. Der eintrag hilfe macht einfach noch ein bisschen mehr scrollen n\u00f6tig.dabei ist die hilfe jederzeit \u00fcber die tastatur ganz einfach zug\u00e4nglich.auch in jedem men\u00fc ist ein eintrag schliessen, um das men\u00fc zu schliessen (beim alten 3390 wurde einfach die taste men\u00fc nochmals gedr\u00fcckt, oder esc). Beim e90 werden die men\u00fcs einfach noch etwas l\u00e4nger.o Wer hofft, dass er bildschirmweise texte oder lange liste scrollen kann, vergiss es. Das handy hat zwar 5 tasten shift, alt und strg, diese werden aber nicht f\u00fcr solche feinheiten eingesetzt. (worte markieren in texten, das geht mit shift).o Es gibt eine kurze liste mit tastenk\u00fcrzeln f\u00fcr das e90 (im internet, im handbuch). WICHTIG: Das sind alle, dies gibt. Aus, ende. Wer mit enter einen listeneintrag ausw\u00e4hlen will, hat selten gl\u00fcck, meist geht das \u00fcber option - ausw\u00e4hlen.o Wer mit ctrl-c ein bild oder ein programm ausw\u00e4hlen und in einen anderen ordner verschieben will: vergiss es. Das geht heute so:zum ordner navigieren (auf der rechten seite sind die files sichtbar, aber das ist rein informativ, die lassen sich nicht ausw\u00e4hlen oder anspringen, die rechte seite des explorerfensters ist verzierung. Also den ordner \u00f6ffnen (dann ist der ordnerbaum weg, aber die files sind sicht- und ausw\u00e4hlbar. Dann file mittels rauf/runter ausw\u00e4hlen, dann option, dann 4x runter: in ordner kopieren, dann ordner suchen (immer vom stammordner aus!!), dann enter.hier haben fr\u00fcher 9 tastendr\u00fccke gereicht: ordner ausw\u00e4hlen, tab, file ausw\u00e4hlen, ctrl-x, tab, ordner wechseln, ctrl-v.heute sind wir da bei 14-20 tastendr\u00fccken.o Fazit: der e90 hat zwar eine tastatur, nur kommt diese im bedienkonzept nicht vor. Und er ben\u00fctzt men\u00fcs, so als w\u00e4ren men\u00fcs heute im jahr 2007 eine neuheit, anstelle von links nach rechts, wo platz ist, und sie sofort erkannt werden sind sie von oben nach unten angeordnet.o Die software ist unausgegoren und f\u00fcr dieses handy nicht konzipiert.o Eine der schlimmeren erfahrungen ist es, einen termin von heute auf morgen zu verschieben. Ging das fr\u00fcher mit 3 tastendr\u00fccken auch zur not noch auf der autobahn, so ist heute die n\u00e4chste rastst\u00e4tte aufzusuchen, ein kaffee zu bestellen, oder einfacher: ein notizblock mitzuf\u00fchren. Das gleiche gilt daf\u00fcr, einen termin zu \u00e4ndern. Nachdem ich den monat ansehe, die woche ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, den tag ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, den termin ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, kann ich ihn, verteilt auf etwa 3 bildschirmh\u00f6hen \u00e4ndern. Sorry, nokia, aber das ist absolut unbrauchbar. Termine in outlook erfassen und am e90 anschauen, das geht, sch\u00f6ne darstellung. Aber etwas daran \u00e4ndern: no way, das werde ich in zukunft wieder im kopf machen.o Diese liste liesse sich beliebig verl\u00e4ngern. Doch leider habe ich dazu nicht die zeit. Und auch keinen usability-test-auftrag von nokia.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
