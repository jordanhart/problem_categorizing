I have found no issues with the phone at all. Great interface, fast processing, and love the new track pad instead of the track ball. Maybe someone had bad luck or maybe the issue with ATT txt's was fixed, either way this phone is great get it and for $70.00 you get unlimited everything.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love Blackberry!!!!!!!!!! Best phone!", "Author": "Agent 007!", "ReviewID": "R3O6P4MH4206V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first blackberry and I am glad i made the switch to go ahead with a blackberry. The Curve 8530 is one of the top blackberry phone line out there. These phones are great for handling Business like emails, surfing the web with lightspeed, texting and messenging. The Blackberry 8530 is definitely a worthy opponent to the iphones. The keyboard did seem to appear small but you get used to the keyboard fast. I love blackberry phones. Get yourself a blackberry my friend!", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone!", "Author": "Gabriel Cole", "ReviewID": "RTH5785C6FDSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was really unhappy with my Android phone and wanted something that I could actually type with again! I am one of those people who gets new phone all the time just to get something new and fun. I have never had a phone that worked so well or efficiently. It is faster on the internet then my Android was. I actually receive all of my emails and messages on time. There is no stalling or glitches that riddled my Android before. The screen is slightly smaller than my full screen phone was before but I am ok with that! I can see everything perfectly and it is so easy to use. I was very unhappy to hear that Virgin Mobile isn't carrying Blackberry's anymore and if wanted to get a new one or I needed a new one I will probably have to go to another carrier but I am very very happy with this phone. Also the sender was quick and simple. Everything was new and packaged as advertised and I was very happy to hear that if I had ANY problems that they would have me send it back for FREE! I would defiantly recommend this product and seller!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Terry Erickson", "ReviewID": "RVY51BJL82BIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The BlackBerry Curve 8530 is perfect for my needs. I ordered the phone through walmart.com and saved $40. In Walmart stores and on Virgin Mobile's website, the phone was $199.Virgin Mobile's \"Beyond Talk Plan\", was the push I needed to consider a smartphone. I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a couple of years.I'm not tech savvy. I don't talk, text and/or surf the web 24/7. Yet, I have all of those features available when needed.I chose the BlackBerry over the LG Optimus, and the Samsung Intercept. The BlackBerry's keyboard sealed the deal for me. I type with my thumbs. (Only on the BlackBerry, not a full sized keyboard). The keys are solid and easy to distinguish/manipulate before pressing.It's the perfect phone for me. I get my emails, texts and calls without any problems. I like the track pad. Sound quality is good.Battery life seems decent for a phone that does so much. I have a spare battery just in case.I suggest buying an OtterBox Defender Series case to protect your investment. They retail for $50 new. I purchased mine on eBay for $32 with free shipping. The cases are bulletproof.If you're reading my review, you're probably shopping for a smartphone. If you want the \"latest, greatest\" smartphone...the BlackBerry might not be your best choice.I hope my review was helpful.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Durable and stable best for music of VM", "Author": "Jane Doe \"It's ME\"", "ReviewID": "RBL394T4UHPVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is the best so far of VM beyond talk phones for music sound, headphone bass boost and playing MP3 and streaming Pandora radio.PROS: easy, stable, notification light, speaker adjustable with treble bass and preset equalizer, headphone sound boost, voice commands, can add google for voice web search, wifi and cell connection can be shut off separately or both saving on batter usage when not using one or both, can pull sd card without unmounting no corruption issues, MMS sent to email as thumbnail and link to be able to view larger and rotate pic also download the full picture files. desktop syncing software with easy one click backup of all data on phone to computer, secure, can schedule automatic daily phone off and on to save battery....CONS: small hard to see keys, no arrow keys, slightly saturated camera pictures with fixed focus, smaller screen, can not shut off camera sound (must use a app to mute it), camera only 2mp", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Summary of my order", "Author": "abe israde", "ReviewID": "R1EFP2Q5XZ29A6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "-The Car Charger did not function.-The jack to the headphones were not the correct size, correspondent to the headphone import to the Blackberry, so it did not function.- The phone its self was in good condition and worked.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "best virgin mobile phone", "Author": "deesibecool", "ReviewID": "R5S5IG18FZ151", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is the best phone virgin mobile offers, which is exactly why they don't offer it anymore! all of their android phones are filled with bloatware and have very little memory.

For an entry level smart phone user, the blackberry 8530 is the way to go, sure i would love to get a torch or the new bold touch 9930, but i would have to put down a hefty deposit as my credit is a bummer,There are more things to do with this phone than you can imagine, so hard to put down, BB appworld< Blackberry messenger, video and photos,get a larger SD card than the 2 gig that comes with it and put thousands of songs and videos on it to enjoy with the click of your trackpad, just a sweet little device, i recommend this phone highly, just one thing though, contact(EMail) the seller before your purchase and in a nice way ask if the device is bran new and never used, i didnt do that the first time and it turned out to be refurbished,and if your looking for a refurb than no problem im sure if you get it and it doesnt work or something they would refund you or trade you for another, just make sure what there policies are for returns beforehand..

The only negative I have is not with the phone but with the plan as web usuage is based on having a Wi-Fi connection which isn't always accessible.

I feel in love with it the instant I open the difficult plastic packaging haha. My first thought was it's gorgeous, it's black but it has a shine to it that makes it look very expensive, and the chrome around the track pad is very nice. At first I was like wow that keypad is so small! But you get used to it very fast. I'm a huge texter so I didn't want an iPhone but I need to physically have a keyboard to type, so it was great for that. I love that it's a monthly payment thing and not where you have to buy minutes over and over again after you spend them. I have the $35 dollar plan, which is 300 minutes and unlimited text and web. Overall, this is a great phone. My brother and dad loved it so much that they even got one. Only thing I wish is that they had the latest BlackBerrys. I'm a huge sucker for the Bold with the chrome around the sides.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "blackberry!!!!", "Author": "claudia", "ReviewID": "R2LY3EZM6ASWPG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ive had this phone for about 1 month now!! i was excited to get my hands on a blackberry when i bought the phone i was happy with it because of the comments and low price!! when i recieved my phone it was well protected no damage quick shipping!! the ONLY conser i had was that the volume button to increase music does not work which is a bummer because i loveeee lisning to music!! but other then that yes get this phone its a goo price and youll love it! best luck!!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pay-as-you-go phone", "Author": "Patty", "ReviewID": "R3M5BWPPSBP36P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter bought herself this phone and loves it.

With discounts and such I was able to get this phone for about $120. The phone itself is all plastic and at first appeared low quality. After using it I can say that impression was wrong. It's Blackberry's entry level phone but it does everything that a high end Blackberry can do. The keyboard is a little harder to use than say the BB Bold but it is very usable. For messaging, this form factor can't be beat! Battery life was a little disappointing if you have a lot of apps going but modern smartphones have outpaced battery technology I guess! The big surprise for me was Virgin Mobile's (over the Sprint network)service. Sprint must have upgraded their network because I had a 3g signal in places where other carriers had no signal. It was very easy to start the service on Virgin Mobile's website. I opted for the $35 dollar plan which includes 300 talk minutes and unlimited everything else. If they had more modern phones on Virgin Mobile, I'd consider dropping my post paid account.

Mobile customer for so long that I can't remember. . . I loved their selection of phones but then they went mostly android and I do not like Android or touch phones much anymore so I went back to something simple. I dreaded a Blackberry because I had one before and did not like it but the BB have the keyboard I like. . .simple, able to use with one hand and can fit in the palm of my hand, no phone does that but the BB so I have adjusted to it. I really dislike the lack of being able to have better texting conversations but I have grown to, well not like it but deal with it. The battery power is good. I truly dislike how long it takes to turn the phone off and how long it takes for it to come back on. It's a hassle for sure. I love the ease of the music but the lack of memory is killing me and I have an 8G memory card but it still doesn't seem to act right. I've had few problems with it, a few power surges but most of all its been the ideal phone aside from it being the not ideal phone. . .lol. It's a BB. . .it works, the protectant cases stay on them like glue which is awesome and call quality is okie doke. . .the menu options could be easier but its not an android so. . . .I shall keep looking in the future for something better. . .", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Skottikins \"Scottie\"", "ReviewID": "R3RRH4OANBO5QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this as a gift to replace an aging device.

Virgin Mobil has the WORST customer service besides SPRINT - mark my word!  It takes HOURS to get things set up and to even get a person on the phone!  The particular device that I received did not have a working internet.  The phone would also randomly restart, which was very frustrating.  I have had other 8530's from other carries, ie: Verizon and it's been fine, but NOT this carrier and not SPRINT, either (both are horrible).My experience with this phone and service and even the person I bought it from sucked horribly.  Over all, however, the 8530 phones are very nice, and I rank them a 4 or 5 on a 1-5 scale.  I especially love the older Blackberry software that some of these 8530's still come with - the 5.0 vs. 6.0.
