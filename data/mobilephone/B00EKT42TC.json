So I was used to a fast network and a top notch phone then I got this phone. which is a huge reduction in phone quality AND network quality. GOOD: The phone is rugged. The phone is loud which is good for a blue collar environment. The Torque has potential but don't expect this phone to do all the things as advertised. BAD: First the phone can not run 4g and direct connect at the same time\u2026if you want direct connect you have to switch to a cdma network which is not 4g. Second, Sprint direct connect is very unreliable. Often it simply will not work and I have to phone my supervisors. Third, many apps on the phone freeze up and will not work on this phone. It is VERY COMMON to have to exit an app because it has crashed. Four, Sprint says it has a 4g network but it is much worse than Verizon. I don't even try to get on the internet from most places very disappointing. For a rugged phone this is okay\u2026for a smart phone this phone is VERY POOR.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "dont work in my area", "Author": "charles", "ReviewID": "RA4IARM4WA2VF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "no bars not good in my area no use to me here need to send it back......i caint use it", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EKT42TC"}}
