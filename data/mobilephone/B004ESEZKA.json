This phone does everything you want it to and it's light weight, the speaker is loud and clear and T-mobile no longer sellsthem. My phone has water damage and I am not in search for a cheaper one. I will buy in 1 month and continue to google cheaper than $56.D", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Older technology but good phone", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R2OZE002UVLUP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is in better condition than I expected it would be.

It does everything you need it to as a phone (and then some), if you need it to do more get a smart phone.  The only thing that could have been improved is the volume control not loud enough when not in speaker mode.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not satisfied with the Quality", "Author": "reviewer", "ReviewID": "R365MW2Q52RZ80", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my dad. It has started giving trouble in about 10 months. Although it was never 'misused', or dropped on floor, but still it turns off by itself, sometimes while talking, and the call gets disconnected. Sometimes while on the charger, it turns off. My dad had a similar phone before which lasted much longer, but unfortunately was destroyed in an accident. I got this similar one for him as he liked it and was familiar with its use, but I am disappointed by the quality of this second purchase. Maybe it was because you get what you pay for. The cheap price ($ 35/-) gave the cheap quality??", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 Years Old and Still Going!", "Author": "The Blissful Tree \"*Knowledge speaks, but wis...", "ReviewID": "R2739204W760UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung (purchased new through T-Mobile) has been awesome. I have owned it for over three years and it still works great.Its a fairly basic phone but quite durable. After being dropped countless times the slider still functions perfectly. The battery lasts a long time when on stand-by or texting, but I have noticed it dies faster when used for calling. Nevertheless, I charge it once every two days max (usually less).This phone features shortcuts to a new text, recent calls, and the contact list from the home screen. Very useful. The menu is cute. The key tones and ringtones included are decent. More are available to purchase, or you can record your own. The contact list is easy to search and edit. Assigning pictures to contacts is possible, as well as home and email addresses. The camera is 2Mps, not great but decent in the correct lighting. It features a nice picture editor. It is also possible to edit images downloaded from texts. Other accessories including a calendar, GPS system, alarm, tasks, memo pad, calculator, world clock, converter, timer/stopwatch and RSS reader all come standard.All in all, this phone has weathered beautifully through the three years that I have owned it. For basic calling, texting, and occasional photography purposes as well as a technological friend that won't let you down, this is the phone to turn to.*Note: I do not have a data plan. Thus I do not use the browser or IM functions, so they are not taken into account in this review.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung SGH-T659 Used Cell Phone T-Mobile", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B004ESEZKA"}}
