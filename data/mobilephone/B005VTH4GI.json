The Kyocera Domino seemed like a good deal, because of the low price. I WAS WRONG!!! The telephone requires resetting at least once a day and the buttons cycle through the applications at will. Texting is a painful experience as the spacing keys work irregularly. I do not recommend this phone for anyone or any purpose.
