I replaced a Lg800 phone that I did not like because of the horrible touch screen - which made texting very frustrating.  I know how a good touch screen is supposed to work because I own an IPad.  However, I don't want the monthly payment of a smart phone.  I have owned a Blackberry that I liked a lot.  Thus I decided to try the 530g.The qwerty keyboard works as well as the Blackberry - I can text again!  The screen has a good resolution.  I have not seen anything advertised or on the phone packaging saying it is 3G, but in the upper left hand corner of the phone by the signal bars is \"3G\".  I tried it yesterday - looking up Espn to get the score of the KU game while we were running errands, and it was pretty fast.  I can also access e-mail and Facebook. I didn't get the phone for these features, and it is not a replacement for a smart phone as far as speed and convenience, but I was impressed nonetheless.The phone looks expensive.  Its not so obvious I have a \"dumb phone\" It is pretty thin.  I'm on Amazon looking for a case - nothing out yet since the phone is newly out.Overall - I'm very happy with it.  My only complaint, which is true for all tracfones, is that it does not record text conversations - only individual texts.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Philip L Tanner", "ReviewID": "RUYQN9BGA6OZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this tracfone, the pouch case, the combo charger and 1 year of service.

My contract service through a popular service provider was OK at best in the area where I live....many, many dropped called prompted me to purchase the Tracfone.  It worked better than my contract phone.  But I had a contract and was waiting until the contract was up.  In the meantime I researched which provider gave better service in this area.  Many of you are probably very familiar with the problems I encountered.Long story short....I decided to upgrade the basic phone and purchase the LG 530G with Triple Minutes.  The phone arrived through Amazon services in 2-days and I couldn't be happier.  I had very little trouble transporting the phone number to the new phone and the triple minutes are wonderful.  I am not a heavy cell phone user so it is perfect for me.  AND, and.... it works everywhere.  No more dropped calls....I get 4 or more bars everywhere, and I do mean everywhere I go.  It has a lot more bells and whistles than I need but happy to know they are there.I work from home so talking and texting is more than enough, at the moment.  I am very happy with this phone and I am seriously considering not renewing my contract with the big cell service provider and/or moving to another contract provider.My only complaint is I cannot find a cover/case.  If anyone knows where I can find one I would very much appreciate if you post the information.

Phones arrived quickly (put the order through on a Sunday night, phones arrived Tuesday morning) from this seller, well packaged, and they seem pretty sturdy & quality, which was kind of unexpected for the low price! The keys are much easier to push & better laid out for texting than other phones I have had (not a fan of touch screen phones).  The functions are straight forward, and the menu is easy. There is also an interactive tutorial on the Tracfone website where you can learn all the ins & outs, but really, most people probably wouldn't need it. (it's THAT straight forward). Tonight we ported my husband's # from our old wireless company, (he didn't want to lose his old phone # and we are switching from Verizon Wireless).  We did the request online, and it took about 30 mins for his phone # to be switched. We then activated the phone, and added a minutes/service package all online. We did not have to talk to anyone over the phone, and it went fairly well. With the triple minutes, (Awesome), he got 4600 mins total from the 1500 min card (which means somehow we got a 100 mins bonus), and 14 mo. of service time. (don't know where the extra 2 mos of svc time came from, but we'll take it). This means his phone time for the next year will cost us about $.05 per minute. The only confusing part was entering in this code from the tracfone site to activate the phone - you would type in this code, then had to keep hitting the \"accept\" button on the computer, and then it would come up with another code to enter. Just keep going, and after 3 different codes entered successfully, it was ready to go!  Back to the phone - overall, nice looking, easy to use, fully functional for all the basics - calling, texting, photos, bluetooth, video, alarm clock, calendar, tip calculator. What more could you ask for about $30?  As long as you're not constantly needing to get online with it (which you Could do, but apparently from other reviews it's not real great at it), you're good to go!

I saw another reviewer mention it, but I ignored their warning.The hot key used for the browser is the same key as you use for \"back\" when you're in the folders.There is NO WAY TO DISABLE the BROWSER.Yeah, I figured so what.... I'll be careful, not like those \"other\" people.  I've been using the phone 3 weeks and have had it go to browser at least 6 times, just from being in my purse.  I started keeping it inside of a small pouch to try to keep the browser from being activated accidentally (why would I use this phone to go online anyway).  Every time I'm done using the phone, I stare at the screen to be sure it's completely black before I put it away.Today I came home, removed it from my purse, and tossed it on my bed, face up.  Several hours later I went to use it and .... no idea how long it had been on the browser, but hundreds of units are gone ...EDIT 2 MONTHS IN:  Recently I put the LOCKED phone in my pocket.  Walked around a store.  Twenty minutes later, heard a phone sound, pulled it out, a message was asking if I was sure I wanted to close the browser.  Turned out I didn't notice I had keys and phone in the same pocket.  Un-be-LIEVE-able ...SO...  I'm returning to using a favorite LG phone from back in the day.  I called Tracfone, they were very easy to talk to, and they're sending a new sim card for the old phone (no cost).

I re-read everything below.  Tried Master-CLEAR.  (Unlock code default is '0000').  (Why didn't the c.s. reps suggest that this time?  I'd misremembered having to reprogram for this problem.  The reprograms were only on initial activation.)  Text is now WORKING!  I did not lose my contacts because I'd moved them to my SIM card.  I did not lose the music on my SD memory card.  I will keep this phone and buy more service!Edit 3: Jan 2014.  Phone started off in the morning with all battery bars.  Used it very little during the day.  Lost one, two, three bars & mid-evening, it shut itself off.  When I recharged it and turned it on, sure enough, not able to receive texts and (if the same as last times) not notified of voicemails.  Since I'm 'old', I don't use the texing much anyway.  I really appreciate the thin form factor, might just keep it as a phone rather than buying a more-expensive (and not always less troublesome) name-brand smartphone service.  (Later:)  Spent a few hours on web chat and on voice (through a landline).  After numerous 'master reset' and 'send yourself a text', it still does not work.  Their answer:  'Your phone is bad.  It is past the one year warranty so you have to buy a new one.'  Difficulty understanding tech support person's heavily-accented English, had to guess about 1/2 the content of the conversation.  'Deceptive' because when it was in warranty, they refused to exchange it, giving half-a**ed workarounds.  Then, when it was out of warranty, they told me to buy another & refused to provide even the half-a**ed workaround.Edit 2:  Mid-June 2013, still working about 4 months into activation.  I never shut it off & maybe this helps it stay working.  Nice little phone, like the size & features.  Wish the ringer was a little louder but it's tolerable.Edit ('The morning after'):  I'll withhold full negative judgement if this, the 3rd reprogramming of the phone in the month since activation, fixes it for a long time.  I've spent more hours trying to fix this phone than hours using it.Original ('D*** you, Tracfone!'):  Tracfone LG 530G. Had to reprogram twice during & shortly after activation.  If this was the only problem, I'd give it five stars.  I like the ergonomics & size.  Internet access really guzzles minutes, but I knew that from other review, so, four stars then; this is not the phone or service to get if you want to surf the web.However, a week or so after activating, not sure exactly when, the phone stopped receiving text messages & voicemail notifications.  Cannot get texts, can get voicemail but only if I call & check manually. After several sessions stretching over days and totalling hours of time spent with the rep and working with the phone, Tracfone representative states it's a problem with the particular phone model. The fix is, when noticing that texts are not received, to master-clear the phone. This fixes the texts problem (temporarily I'm advised) but loses all my data including contacts.  Unacceptable in two ways: (1) losing texts and voicemail without knowing it and (2) losing all data including contact list when it's reset.  Tracfone says it will not refund the phone (since I bought it from the Amazon seller and more than 30 days ago) or refund my airtime (since I bought it more than 30 days ago). So, I have a phone that periodically fails to receive texts and then loses all my contacts, can't be fixed and can't be refunded or exchanged. Unacceptable. The phone and service has a one-year warranty I'm told, but it's only good for 30 days. I will continue trying to get this fixed or refunded. Can't belive I spent all this money and got a piece of junk that they won't take back. At this time it appears I will have to get a different phone and different service if I want something that works right.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the lg800!", "Author": "Matt Steward", "ReviewID": "R3M3ZKAJNHS34T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I recieved this phone very quickly with amazon 2-day shipping.

I finally decided on this one, and I haven't been disappointed!  I'll try to highlight the main things here:Texting: Much easier than on my old phone.  The keys are small, and I do occasionally have to backspace to correct a typo, but I also have to correct typos on my computer, so no big deal.  It's so nice to have all the symbols, letters, and numbers right there instead of having to go to a different screen or hit the same button several times to get the right letter.Calling: Again, the keys are small, but I'm still able to easily dial a number.  Also, I transferred all my contacts from my old phone via Bluetooth, so that also makes calling easier.  Sound quality is good, and answering calls is easier than with my old phone because I don't have to flip it open first.Music: It's easy to add music by putting it on a micro SD card (not included with this phone) and then putting it in the phone.  I put in an 8G card, and there's plenty of room for the music I want.  But if you're going to add songs pretty often, you'd be better off buying a cord to hook it up to your computer, because the micro SD card actually fits in underneath the back plate of the phone.  Fortunately for me, the USB cord from my digital camera also fits this phone and makes adding songs EXTREMELY easy!  Music sound quality is good.  My only complaint is that the lowest sound level is a bit too loud with earbuds, and if you try to turn it down, it just mutes it.  I'm planning to buy some earbuds that have their own volume control, which should solve the problem.Pictures: This phone takes pretty good pictures, and although I haven't tried it yet, it should be pretty easy to transfer the pictures to my computer with a USB cord.  I've tried transferring pictures from my computer to this phone, which works OK except that it says some of the pictures are too big, so I guess I'll have to figure out how to resize them.Internet: I don't really need to get online with my phone, but it's nice to have the option in case I need to check my e-mail or something.  I've played with it just a little bit, but it eats up a lot of minutes.  I think I was online for about 5 minutes, and it used up 15 phone minutes.  But it's pretty easy to check my e-mail with it, so if I just need to check quickly, it works well.  I haven't tried installing any apps on it yet.I've read other reviews complaining about this phone getting online by just getting bumped or something.  I've been using this phone for almost a week and haven't had ANY trouble with this at all.  I have it in a semi-hard case that clips to my belt.  Before I put the phone in the case, I wait for it to lock.  After putting it in the case, I've experimented with shaking it a little bit to see if it would press the buttons (it didn't), and I've checked lots of times just to make sure it stays locked.  I think I might have unlocked the phone by pressing the buttons really hard through the case, but I had to press pretty hard.  I don't think it'll ever unlock itself and turn the internet on as long as I keep it in the case and make sure it's locked.Ringtones: This phone comes with a few ringtones, but I haven't listened to them because I had ringtones that I'd created and I just transferred them from my old phone via Bluetooth.  My only complaints are that you can't assign different ringtones to different contacts and the volume settings for ringtones and message alerts are on separate screens.  But I just found a button that apparently puts the entire phone on vibrate, so maybe that will solve that problem.Transferring Service to This Phone (from another Tracfone): I was able to easily transfer my minutes, service days, and phone number to this phone on the Tracfone website.  It only took a few minutes for the transfer to go through.The only thing I have left to say is that I absolutely love this phone!  It meets my needs well, and I'm very glad I decided to buy it.  If I think of anything else to say, I'll post an update to this review.UPDATE: I've now had the phone for about six weeks.  There was one time when my sister called and my phone didn't show the call, and there was one time when I had my phone in my pocket and accidentally pressed it against something, and it turned on the internet.  But I realized right away that I had it pressed against something and immediately checked, so I didn't lose lots of minutes.  As long as I'm careful with it, I don't have a problem.

I spent about $30 for the phone and about $100 for enough minutes and time to last me more than a year.  Phone calls, texts, camera, video, alarm, calender, music and internet if needed in a pinch.  The triple minutes included with this phone really cuts down on what you have to buy.  I don't need to pay for an expensive phone and $70 a month for service, I can easily use my laptop for most of those services.  I like the full keyboard for texting much better than my kids touchscreen phones.  My Tracfones have always gotten better service than other phones when we travel because Tracfone uses signal from 4 major networks, not just one.  And I really like this phone compared to my last few because the battery lasts for more than a week on one charge when I just leave it in my purse and use it for a few calls every day.  I really have no complaints about this phone at all.  The screen locks quickly and I have not had any issues with accidental dialing from my purse or pocket.If you are comparing this phone to any of the newest smart phones and expecting the same out of it, then of course you will be disappointed.  If you just need a low cost phone for calls, texts, music, and rare internet use, then this phone will be much more than you expect for the price.  We like it enough that my husband will be giving up his more expensive phone for one of these, and the kids have already been converted to Tracfones as well.

Moreover, I have been using this phone for over a year now (one year and two months) so far, and it has been working just as well as the first time I used it. Although, I have dropped the cell phone a few times, the phone didn't get damaged internally at all (there's not even any visible scratches or cracks on my LG 530G, which is in some ways impressive. So, my phone still looks new). Here are some of the pros and cons I have found that the LG 530G has:Triple Minutes For Life- Quality 5/5 (this means that the cell phone is already equip with triple minutes that you never have to buy separately to get it, which is great. For example, let say you buy the 60 minutes card, and use it, you will get 180 minutes b/c of the triple minutes, so you're actually getting 120 minutes extra for free, as well as saving $30 since a 120 minute card cost $30)Long Battery Life- Quality 5/5 (This is one of my main reasons why I decide to wait for over a year before giving this great cell phone a review just to see how long the battery life can still last. Anyway, since I had the phone, the battery life can still last for ten days straight if you don't use it much, but it will last for around six to eight days if you use it for a while. In addition, if you use the phone quite a lot, it can still last for three to five days. You can talk to a person for about 3.8 hours, which is pretty decent. Additionally, I personally have talked with two of my friends at the same time for over an  hour in one day, and the battery still last for about four to six days, which is pretty good. You can text for a while too, which I personally text three different people for over an hour in one day, and my phone still last for a few more days. Furthermore, I let my LG 530G charge for at least four and a half hours before I stop charging it, rather than just for an hour and a half to two hours only. So, 4:30 hours to 5:00 hours is good enough to let the phone last for ten days if you don't use it or barely use it, or to last as long as I have said already if you use it quite a bit or quite a lot. I have been doing this for over a year, and my phone can still last for ten days if I barely used it or don't use it at all. Also, you don't have to let the phone die before charging it, so you can start charging the phone when it has only one bar of energy left, or no bar of energy left. Also, when the cell phone shows no bar of energy, it will start making a sound to let you know that you really need to start charging it. Overall, the LG 530 G has a great battery life)Signal- Quality 4/5 (Where I live, the signal for my LG 530G is pretty damn good b/c I always have signal where I go, which is nice since I can call and text people or people can call or text me with no problems. Even during Sandy, I still had signal, while my dad's iPhone that used Sprint service didn't. Although, in some trains I have been in I got no signal. However, the reason why I don't give a perfect score for signal quality is b/c I know there are cities outside of the state I live in where I wouldn't get good signal, but that's why you have to check if you can get good signal where you live by either going to the Tracfone website which provides you that feature, or asking somebody who uses cell phones from Tracfone how well the signal work in their area)Complete QWERTY Keyboard- Quality 4/5 (If you're like me, and you text often or when you need to, then a QWERTY keyboard might be very useful for you. Personally, I enjoy the QWERTY keyboard that the LG 530G has because for me it is comfortable, and way better to have it for texting than to have to press each button a few times before getting the letter you want like the Motorola W175. Plus, the QWERTY Keyboard is pretty much like a normal keyboard, which is nice. In addition, if you want to text numbers, just press the FN button first b/c then the cell phone will allow you to text numbers or symbols such as lines and the question mark, which is cool. If you want to capitalize letters, press the up arrow key that is located under letter z or at the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard. Additionally, the space bar is also located at the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard, or located below the letters v and b. However, some people with big hands have complained that the QWERTY keyboard is too small for them, but that is something you will have to find out for yourself. One thing I would say that is bad about the QWERTY keyboard is that if you press the backspace button for too long, it will erase your whole text. So, please don't hold the backspace button for too long if you don't want to erase your whole text, instead just press it once at a time to erase what you want to delete. The good thing is that you can go back to a word that you want to erase, and then delete it using the backspace button. Overall, THE QWERTY keyboard is nice, even though sometimes you may press the wrong button, but it is not a big deal for the most part)Internet- Quality 2/5 (You can use the internet, which is a nice option to have. Although, there's no wireless connection to find internet, so you have to use the internet of the phone at home. Personally, I don't use the LG 530G internet because it is somewhat slow and uses too much of your minutes. Still, it could be useful for sending quick emails. Also, If you accidentally click on the Browser, quickly press the End button so that you don't waste any of your minutes)Up to 1000 Contacts- Quality 5/5 (Yes, you can have up to 1000 contacts, but let's be honest, who really knows 1000 people? Facebook doesn't count, unless you know those people personally)1.3 MP Camera/Video Recorder- Quality 2.5/5 (The LG 530G has a surprisingly decent camera for a phone that was most likely never meant to have one in the first place. Although, the pictures won't look as good or big as the ones from iPhone or Android, the picture quality still looks pretty decent. Video recording is not bad either for this phone, but again, don't expect much)SMS and MMS Picture Messaging- Quality 2.5/5 (You can send text with pictures, but this feature is ok. Still, good option to have if you need to send quick pictures to someone. However, sending texts with pictures may use more minutes than average, so be careful)MP3 Player- Quality 3/5 (The MP3 player is not bad for this phone, but don't think it will be great either. Still, you can buy a memory card up to 32GB, so you can listen to quite a lot of music. Although, the earphones or headphones you can use are limited. If you want to buy the USB Data cable, which you need to transfer music from your computer to your cell phone, here's the link for it For TracFone LG 530g Premium Case + Car Charger Adapter + USB Data Cable)Hands-Free Speaker- Quality 4/5 (Speaker works well and is easy to use. It is also surprisingly loud, which makes things easier when you're trying to listen to what someone is saying to you)Calling- Quality 4/5 (When you talk to someone, they will be able to hear you really well, which is important. Furthermore, you can hear people really well too when they're speaking to you. Overall, the calling quality of this cell phone is pretty good)Bluetooth\u00ae Wireless Technology- Quality 3/5 (For things such as downloading music it is decent, but not for finding internet when you're outside of your home. Overall, it works well for its purpose)Voicemail, Call Waiting, and Caller ID- Quality 4/5 (Voice mail works well, but you have to hold the number one button or letter w to hear your voice mail. To delete it, press 7. Call Waiting works well too, as well as Caller ID. However, Caller ID will only show names of the people that are in your contacts, and only numbers of people that aren't in your contacts)Voice/Sound Recorder- Quality 2.5/5 (It is a decent feature, not the best, but works well for this type of cell phone)Alarm Clock 5/5 (Pretty loud, especially when you have max volume. So, if you use cell phones as your alarm clock, this one should work well for you)Includes Battery, Charger, Activation Card, Services Guide and User Manual- Quality 4/5  (So, you don't have to buy a charger or battery, which is nice. Some Android chargers do work for this phone though since I have an android charger as a backup that works for this phone, which used to be owned by somebody else. However, I don't know which Android chargers work for this phone b/c I don't know which Android the other person used to have)Auto Key Lock- Quality 4/5 (I love this feature b/c it works really well, especially if you have your cell phone in your pocket. To use this feature, just go to Settings, then click Phone Settings, after that Click Auto Key Lock. You can choose to have it wait for 5, 15, 30, and 45 seconds before the auto key lock goes to function. I personally choose 45 seconds. If you want to use your phone and need to unlock it, just press the Top row button first, which is a line, and then the right button, which is another line. The top left button on the top row is above the camera calendar button, while the top right button on the top row is above the camera button. It is very use to unlock the cell phone yourself, but usually it doesn't unlock itself. For that to happen, both the top left and right buttons need to be pressed hard enough at the right moment to unlock the phone, so it usually never happens unless you do it yourself)Set Hotkeys- Quality 5/5 (Certain keys you can have as the main ones, which is nice. The square button or the middle button that is in the middle or about the middle of the buttons such as calendar, camera, Send, etc, is what you use to go to your hotkeys. So, to set it up, go to Settings, Phone Settings,  and then Set Hotkeys. Personally, I have the up key as my alarm, the down key as my contacts, the left key as create message, and right key as music player)Durability- Quality 3/5 (The LG 530G is surprisingly durable b/c as I stated before, I have dropped it several times already, and it still works fine. I don't have any hard cover to protect my phone either, yet it can still take hits quite well. The LG 530G is definitely more durable than the average Android or iPhone)In conclusion, these are all the main pros and cons I have found that the LG 530G has. Moreover, this is a great cell phone from Tracfone b/c it provides the features that a person who uses a cell phone for calling and texting (and not for gaming) would like to have or need (which is why I recommend the LG 530G for those kind of people). Overall, I give the LG 530G a 5/5 in terms of cell phone quality as a cell phone from Tracfone, while a 4/5 in terms of quality as a cell phone itself.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lasted a very long time", "Author": "charlie", "ReviewID": "R3TKNAEJ1VXCK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My son broke this phone like ten times and it kept working and working even with a completelycracked screen.

It's not as stupid as the phones I've previously owned, but not nearly as smart as the popular bigbar camera viewscreen phones. The price is good, the texting is very good, and (I was surprised by this because I don't remember reading about this in other reviews) the speakerphone is excellent. The coverage is fine in well-covered areas, but I'm not sure I'd expect too much in rural areas. On a recent Canada trip I had no signal until I got back to the States; I'm not sure why this was, perhaps I was supposed to change some setting ... all I know is that my old Verizon phone gave me great coverage *everywhere*. I don't regret purchasing this product because I'm saving money and getting good use out of it.Update #1: Last night I pulled my phone out of its pouch and found it had been online by itself. I *think* this occurred because I placed it into my pocket before the screen locked. This phone (imo) too easily connects to the web. If you hit the right dash button you'll be connected to the Web whether you want to or not. This *could* be fixed with a simple: \"Are you sure you want to connect to browser?\" After all, they already have the question: \"Are you sure you want to exit browser?\" Seems to be a setup for customer frustration. But there is a fix: stare at your phone until you are sure the screen has locked before you put it away (but not while driving nor performing circus acts).Update #2: LOTS of dropped calls (I'm not used-to that w/Verizon) either due to the device or Tracphone, I don't know. Tried to use Facebook on the 530's browser and could not enter my username and password; the five-way controller allowed me to click on the correct field, but I was unable to enter any text -- what good is a ding-dang browser if you can't enter text in some of the text fields??

I have tried using my mom's smartphone and am not a fan of the touchscreen. I like the full QWERTY keyboard, the images to choose from for your wallpaper are interesting enough, and the good thing about this phone (as opposed to the 500G) is that there is a one button push to turn it from vibrating to non-vibrating. I leave it on vibrate all the time, as I don't like the key tone when texting annoying).I have to admit, I don't use it for the internet as I have a laptop and I don't want to suck the units down to go online.For texting and phone calls though, this phone does it and it does it well.Clarity: I maybe give it a 4 out of 5. It's not terrible but not super awesome like a home phone would be.It is a little slippery so a case would be nice, but I have yet to come across any cases customized for this particular phone.I saw the good reviews on this and am glad I bought it.

Finding a case is a bit difficult, but along with the leather one on Amazon, I found one on eBay for $7. Paying $28 for a unit sold by Tracfone for $40 was a pleasant surprise. A friend gave me a 120 minute card that was tripled automatically to 360 plus I found an online code for 30 more free minutes. Definitely Google Tracfone Codes periodically to get some free time. My monthly bill on their family plan will only be $22 on Tracfone's Family Plan which is great for 3 people that are not heavy phone users. Being able to buy another 180 minutes for $20 in just about any store is another great benefit. The phone itself feels solid. The keyboard is small,but I'm getting pretty good with it.

I have downloaded free ebooks in the Qioo format. (They will self install when you open them.) You can get free Qioo ebooks at numerous web sites.

Game playing is difficult, especially with a timed game.Thinking the phone would work for watching videos, I downloaded some .3gp files to the phone. The videos play, but the standard \"1/4\" screen is too small and full screen is to jerky - like a dvd played at x2 speed - for the phone to be practical as a video player.The mp3 player function works very well and the phone has a standard headphone jack.The camera takes pictures at 1280x960 resolution, and the phone will display .jpg files at up to 2560x1920, which is just under 5mp. The phone will not display 3200x2400 or 3072x2048 for example, so using the phone as a picture viewer may require resizing images. I can't detect a visual difference between 1280x960 and higher resolutions on the phone screen.The LG530G fits nicely in a blackberry case.I miss the convenience of the flip phone secondary screen, and not having to lock the keyboard after use, which is very important with the LG530G, especially since the right soft key instantly activates the browser.This phone receives 3G service, but the browser eats up minutes fast.

When you call customer service to transfer minutes, be sure the rep agrees with you on how many minutes you had in the old phone.More control over the volume would be nice in games, especially between \"off\" and the next setting.Because of the small buttons, the usual 2abc, 3def, 4ghi, etc. is not present.In conclusion, this is a feature rich phone and should work well if you don't mind the button size.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Perry J.

Virgin Mobile's prices were better than almost all, and I only paid $25 and then $35 a month for more than I could use. But, for a variety of reasons, I decided that a smartphone was not good for me, and the money I spent was indeed excessive (after all, I paid for high speed Internet at home). So I switched to a dumbphone, a phone for calling and texting.The ability to port phone numbers is legally required in the USA, so switching from any carrier to another should be easy to do. Switching from Virgin Mobile to Tracfone was easy.My search for the absolute lowest price for what I wanted led me back to Tracfone, and my requirement for a phone with a QWERTY keyboard (I never sent a text message on a phone key pad) was my only restriction. The LG 530G has the features I wanted, and it has Triple Minutes.While I could go feature by feature in this review, that does not seem to be that useful. I have no major complaints. The keyboard is good enough, the call quality is better than my old service (in my location, AT&T; network is being used), and I would say the music player is actually pretty good. It can use a MicroSD card for storage.The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. Maybe I was just used to the smartphone thirst for power, but this is a big difference for me.One negative thing is that the clock does not seem to have a 24 hour display mode.But, overall, I am very happy with it, and the good things I did not expect outweigh the few things which I wish were different.The biggest thing to consider is the Triple Minutes. Given that any network activity will use minutes, including opening text messages (receiving them does not use them), maximizing one's minutes even for very low volume users like myself is a good thing to do.I have not used the \"Mobile Web\" and I do not plan to do so.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does it's job x 3!", "Author": "MarkTyke", "ReviewID": "R3OAQXDDGFP52V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty decent phone, nothing fancy but you should know that, I got it as a work phone.It has games on it, but they are demos which you can purchase with minutes.The triple minutes is wonderful and definitely worth the couple dollars more.Using it for music is okay if you are okay with only hearing most of the high end of a song(Almost zero bass response), but what do you expect from a phone that is mainly a utility piece anyway.Speaking of utility...The tools are what you'd expect.The voice recorder is pretty decent though.All in all I'm pleased with it, I haven't gotten any grief from it yet and the service is pretty okay too,", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than my old phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3KOPSRXWGCA0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone, texting is a lot easier on this phone, Porting my number was easy too.

But that's not what I got the phone for and don't really expect that from a phone at this price.The phone is very easy to use. However, it was not easy to set up. The directions that came with the phone were not at all adequate to get the phone set up and programed so that you could actually use it through Tracfone's network. Nor is the information you can get online from Tracfone's website about setting up this particular phone adequate for you to be able to set the phone up. I needed to spend a good deal of time with someone from a call center in order to enter the appropriate information into the phone before I was actually able to make and receive calls and messages. (And the call center was not the most adept -- it took a lot of time waiting on hold to get someone; it wasn't that easy to understand their english; they weren't able answer questions quickly or explain things throughly). Once the phone was set up, the phone itself is easy enough to use.Furthermore, you will not be able to find a case for this phone through the normal suppliers. The rubber \"skins\" that a lot of people use as cases are custom sizes and they only seem to be made for the most popular phone models on the market like iphones or smart phones. (So there are actually a lot of different model cel phones that you might buy and you won't be able to find cases for them). I did manage to find a pouch-style case for the phone in a small outlet store that works fine but it was not easy to find.It's also supposed to be possible to \"lock\" the keys so that when the phone is in standby mode and sitting in your pocket or a bag, one of the buttons won't actually get pushed and start a function inadvertently and use up all of the minutes. I have not been able to activate the key locks, despite following the directions explicitly. It hasn't been a problem for me because I don't use the phone that much so I don't leave it in stand by mode -- I always turn it completely off and just turn it on to use it or check for messages. But for others it would be a real problem.So if you need the most basic cel phone for calls and text messages, this phone is a great value.

The display is noticeably nicer; higher resolution and larger than its little cousin. I chose this phone because it has QWERTY which not many Tracfones do. I've been using it since May and I'm happy with it so far.Pros:-Any units you buy to put on this phone get automatically tripled. Very good deal. I talk and text a lot so I usually buy 1500 units at a time, which gets tripled to 4500 units. That's currently the best price per minute on any prepaid phone plan I've seen.-There are handy shortcut buttons to the camera, email inbox, and SMS inbox-keys are easy to press-screen looks pretty nice for a phone of this size-camera is surprisingly OK for a dumbphone. Even if you don't have an extra memory card, you can take photos and transfer them to a computer via Bluetooth.-it can send and receive email for a pretty reasonable cost of airtime units. Usually less than sending and receiving SMS even though emails are often longer than SMS.Cons:-had to spend over 2 weeks trying to get Tracfone to activate this phone with my old phone number-I've twice now had a phone conversation cut off with the error message \"Temporary failure.\" Temporary failure of what? Maybe I have a faulty phone.Notes:-The back of the phone requires you to press it down in several places to snap it on properly.-The keys are sometimes too easy to press. Have to check everything I type for accidentally repeated letters.-When you hold down the backspace key it deletes everything you typed in the message. Kind of annoying because I expected it to delete 1 character or 1 word at a time.-If you're having problems activating the phone, don't call Tracfone customer service, use the online Tracfone forums.

What a disaster this item is -- not typical of my experience with LG phones.First, the phone gobbles up minutes when the browser is open because it is slower than dial-up, pulls up windows that are too small to read w/o using Options to Zoom the page, and the toggle for page direction is inaccurate and prone to error. So, minutes go by with no positive outcome.Second, the phone uses a toggle button instead of arrows to navigate a page.  You press the top or bottom of the toggle to scroll up or down, and press the right or left side of the button to go laterally.  The equivalent of \"enter\" is the center of the toggle button. It is difficult to press the toggle exactly correctly in order to get the response you want, especially the \"down\" toggle -- frequently need to use my fingernail the press it in order not the have it read as \"enter\" and bring up a page I don't want.I've had much lower grade, simpler phones (including LG) with better internet access and visual display.  The toggle is annoying to the point that I consider this wasted money.Pros: keyboard is accurate, including the tiny number keys on the left (in spite of the drawback listed above.)I can set it to go directly to my email account of choice from the EMAIL menu key --nice.Cons:  Non-existent internet service.
