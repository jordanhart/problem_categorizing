{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great inexpensive console...", "Author": "rex", "ReviewID": "R1G10IMIKBJBZG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fairly powerful handheld console with a 1.5ghz dual core processor. If you are comfortable with downloading emulators from the Google Play store and playing your game roms, then this is a good console for you. Updating the firmware to a custom version is recommended as the stock firmware that ships has some weaknesses. The main disadvantage of this console is the poor battery life, averaging about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I have been using mine for about 2 months without problems. Getting everything setup correctly takes some effort, but it is well worth it.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "fun android gamer", "Author": "lon", "ReviewID": "R3DIUU1H4MUAJR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "we bought this for our so the game fanatic when we got our new phones .it`s performance is vary good ,but has a short battery life and eats chargers .play and charge from usb is fine but use the factory charge jack and you will kill a charger every week .", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DYI0MLM"}}
