Working in IT I change phones frequently.  I can honestly say this is the nicest Android phone I've ever had... Compared to the HTC One X the size and battery life are far superior (LTE to blame), compared to the Nexus S it is about the same but a better hardware design in my opinion.  I could go on and on but I'll just say I'm very impressed with this device and am looking forward to the ICS update as I imagine it can only get better!", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Ruth Elise Johnsen \"Release\"", "ReviewID": "REAIUHEFVVYL1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome phone.I upgraded from an Xperia x10i mini, and going to this, I am amazed.Pros:It has a great big screen with good quality, instead of only 3 colors, Sony decided to add white, so it is a lot brighter, also in sunlight, than others.So far it has the android 2.3, but the upgrade to 4.0.1 will come some time soon, in the fall.One thing I did not know until I bought it, was that it uses MicroSIM, so I had to get a new sim-card. This was not said in the previews and on Sony Mobile's website.The camera is 8mp and it aslo has a front-view vga camera for videocalls.The touchscreen can be controlled with up to 4 fingers.The phone is made of steel, so it can handle some scrathes and a few falls, but if you get one that is not silver, the color will scratch. I therefore recommend getting a rubber-cover for it.Cons:Xperia P has an internal memory of 16 GB, where about 11 GB are available. Sadly, there is no slot for en extra memory card, but I figured I could live without. 11 GB is still a lot.The speaker is pretty decent, though I have heard better (my x10i mini was probably almost just as good).Another thing is that the battery is only 1300 mAh, which is not much for a phone with a great big screen like this. You may have to charge your phone up to twice a day, if you use it very heavily. On the other hand, it charges very quickly. From 0 to 100% it takes about 2 hours. If you turn the phone off while charging, it takes less. If you make sure you turn off wifi when you don't use it, and other battery-suckers like it, the phone may need to charge once a dayOverall, despite the cons, I am very pleased with this phone, it gives me great entertainment, and I do recommend it for you Xperia-lovers.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent smarthphone NEW - fast - android 4.0. - Unlocked", "Author": "Josh T.", "ReviewID": "R2Z8HADJCAVIEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente celular, llego super rapido por parte de vendedor, Vino totalmente NUEVO, DESLOQUEADO, estoy contento con el vendedor, el celular es buenisimo, rapido y viene con Android 4.0 excelete (la descripcion decia 2.3 por eso me parece excelente q venga con el 4.0 instalado)", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied so far", "Author": "Stephen M", "ReviewID": "RKER8DW66BGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from an LG Optimus G2X, first of all, I really appreciate ICS and all the goodness the Xperia has under the hook...so far I love everything about this phone to bits.  The display seems way better, and while I'm yet to try out the all-hailed WhiteMagic, indoors everything looks crisp and clear, and without any screen bleeding issues.The music player is a breeze to use and setup, and the lock screen widget is very handy...I recall having to get an extra app on my previous phone before the music experience was as good as the Xperia's.  I'm no audiophile, but I like what I hear.  Other basic stuff seem to work very well...wifi & bluetooth setup is straightforward and no weird disconnections so far.  I did have to fiddle about with the microsim before I realized you really need to push it back into the sim tray before it's securely locked.I think that's the much I can say so far given I've had the phone for about four hours now.  In case of anything, I shall post an update.  All in all, a solid phone with a premium feel to it.  Would have been nice to beef up the battery capacity a bit, but given my average usage, it'll do just fine", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent cellphone xperia p lt22i", "Author": "ricardo", "ReviewID": "R2ZTTRXPG8IW0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have iphone 5, samsung galaxy s3 and i can tell you that for the great price its a really fast cellphone amazing camera excellent battery life i love it im even going to cell my other two phones! really good for work emailing!!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good phone", "Author": "P. Wright", "ReviewID": "R1OMYEVWDITC21", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony phones have gotten a lot better, especially in their ability to view the screen outside.  That is, if you remember to set the auto brightness instead of worrying about the power saving.  I imagine you could just purchase some NFC tags and pretty much change your settings automatically so you could alternate between saving on the battery and screen use when you're outside, some people just don't like that extra step though.  I have no problem with the battery but can see where a very heavy user would run low at the end of the day.  Just regular phone calls for me and checking my email and I still return home at night with a 70% charge.  But, I don't surf the net or watch movies and such on my cell phone, that's what my tablet and my laptop are for.If you use GPS navigation a lot it will run down the battery quickly, but when I use that feature I'm in the car so have power cord available.  I personally don't know people that use cell phone GPS for walking so for most the built-in battery will work fine.  Don't get me wrong, I miss having a spare battery available for easy replacement, but it looks like everyone is going this route lately.  The only thing I've found wrong with this phone is what is wrong with all Android phones when compared to the iPhone, the setup.  It is pretty neat that you have more personal choice what is on your phone and that you can always root your phone and open up many more possibilities, but it is too time consuming to really get Android where you want it.Plenty of screens for your icons, runs quickly for all the programs I've thrown at it, plenty of built-in storage unless you're a very, very heavy music lover or videophile, then you would miss having an SD card option.  As previously, I use other electronics for those purposes, don't like looking at those little screens for my entertainment.  Very happy with this phone, a little better reception would be nice though.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "ceri86", "ReviewID": "R24T3GYALXMHH2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cellphone has a really nice android xperience, works really nice and the price is very good too, the only thing isn't good at all, the box didn't bring \"Sony Smart Tags\" as product decription said.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It has the looks and the specs, yet the result dissapoints", "Author": "Fabio", "ReviewID": "R3IA31QJ78F3HJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'll keep it simple. Sorry for the bad english. I'm running Ice Cream Sandwich on it, if anyone wants to know. This phone has three mayor problems:- Though it looks pretty, I feel as if this phone will break any second. I was being extra careful with it until a scratch appeared out of nowhere  in the screen within a week. Several others have appeared since then, too. Also, it is very easy for it to get damaged at the corners. Sure, other phones get scratched, but not like this. So I just have one advice: if you're still buying this phone, buy a protector for the screen and a case too. Both. I SERIOUSLY recommend it.- The battery life is not good. I bought it knowing this, so I guess that's my fault. It's just so weird to think that any company would release a phone with such a mediocre battery life in 2012. Apart from that, it also has weird glitches like having 90% one second and then 30% at the other, only to stop at %70. It probably is a software problem; but anyhow, it's not good. The screen is what drains the battery the most, weird considering that the supposedly \"White Magic\" technology would solve that problem. If this really is the \"brightest phone in the market\", as Sony claims, you just won't be able to enjoy it, because the battery will drain even faster. Don't think about \"I'll turn off the wi-fi and the 3G\", that won't work. The problem is the screen.- One of the things I found to be the most insulting is the fact that THE CAMERA IS NOT REALLY 8MP. It only takes 8MP photos at a 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 photos, you'll have to settle for 6MP. The camera as a whole is disappointing, considering the history Sony has with cameras. Basically, with light (preferably sun) pictures should be fine; but when it's dark it just takes the most ugly photos.As a whole, the phone just does not seem to work. It has great specs for a mid.range device; but they don't reflect at the end. There ara many, many glitches in general. The 16:9 aspect ratio, thought beautiful (I have to admit)kills the compatibility with many Apps on the Play Store. Other than that, the phone has a great display. But my last advice is: don't buy this phone.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Cell phone!!", "Author": "gmo", "ReviewID": "RKTFXI4YKVR7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I saw the design I loved it!! but, when I received it just was impacted by the phone!!

And now the Xperia P, this phone is just great, light, sturdy, metal, cool translucid illuminated button... a pretty classy phone.If you are looking for a phone able to run usual office tasks, casual gaming, listen to music, casual photo shoots with a slight above average quality, not too expensive, and that is able to work on almost any 3G network, then this is it.But I give you an advice, before you buy it review the Xperia ION LT28. It's a 4G phone with 12.1 MP Camera and 1.5 Ghz dual Core with SD Slot and 4.5 inch screen and Playstation Certified. All that for about the same price (3$ to 7$ plus). But be cautious because the price it's only for the AT&T; (LT28a - US Version) which will only work on some 3G net, even though some sellers claim it as LT28i (international), the international version price are higher (80$ plus or aprox. 350$).Also there is the Xperia S that is also 1.5 Ghz Dual Core, playstation certified, 4.2 inch screen, and looks pretty much the same as the Xperia P, and also works for almost any 3G network as the P, and only cost aprox 330$If you are in the US, this phone will work in some if not all networks. but take precautions before you buy it.It didn't included the 2 NFC smart tags as they described. What they indeed included was the earbuds (a surprise to me because, I've thought it would include earphones which are not environment isolators), charger, usb cable, and an euro converter for the charger.This phone has only 2 Gb for apps, and about 12 Gb for user data.I bought it to use it in Venezuela (Digitel), but it also works 3G with other networks in here (I went for the sure thing, with a tight budget and tight schedule).Did i mention that it came with ICS installed?", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this Cell phone", "Author": "Lity B", "ReviewID": "R2506VATT0KZT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It looks amaizing, not heavy, fast, good size, I really like it and I'm enjoing this cell, the only bad thing is that there are no so many accessories for this one....", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am in LOVE with this phone!", "Author": "Vonnie", "ReviewID": "R1F2KUUTFNBRI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend, love the phone.
