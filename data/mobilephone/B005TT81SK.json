Why?  Could it be because it is the only cellphone I have had since 1996 that has outlived the battery?  Tough little bugger.  Made a mistake of buying a smartphone and really like this simple one much better.  Most people think the keyboard is too small, but I find it very easy to use.  Not real good for web/Internet, but I still use my laptop for most of that anyway.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "gooselady0720", "ReviewID": "R1CW4U156A97P7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Samsung Dart- Worst battery life ever.  I backtracked to this phone.  It is the best phone I've ever had. Not an android though. very easy to use and clear screen and never dropped a call no matter where I am at. It has lots of features that I like. I bought it used and have used it over a year and it's still going strong. the alarm is a good feature also.you can play some java games with it and I can get online with the web to go but its not fast or easy- takes patience but it's not an android. It's called a \"Smiley\" cause it will make you smile instead of making you cuss at it like the Samsung Dart I had. If you are looking for a good non android this is the \"one \" to get.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to find a good \"Not-a-Touch\" phone", "Author": "Diane Wendt \"alwayz readn\"", "ReviewID": "R3708YM3MFDU11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've shunned touch phones due to a medical condition that has my hands shaking sometimes. In this day and age it is becomming harder and harder to find a good, \"old-fashioned\" cell phone. This phone is NOT old-fashioned in any way except not being touch or supporting 4G. For quality, Samsung is definately my choice in cell phone (also TV and BlueRay dvd player). As to the \"T-Moble prepaid\" aspect of this phone, I just put my own SIM chip in it instead of the one provided. The only negative I have to say is that I seem to be charging it more often than my old one, but that's a negative comment on the battery, not the phone itself. On the up side, my 6-year-old grandson does not ask to borrow it to play games on when he's bored . . .\"you know, grandma, it doesn't DO anything!\" when he touches the screen.

I have a pay as you go plan and I don't want to use all of my minutes playing on my phone. This is an excellent phone for texting and you can access the net if you really want to. I'm very satisfied with it. As with any new phone you have to read the book and try each thing to get to know all of things it does.

It has everything I need - text and calling obviously, email, a camera, a multi-alarm, a calendar with reminders, you can access the web, you can review your web browsing history, and you can bookmark pages.  The phone is very durable - which is why I got it, in the hopes that it would be.  I thought the small keys would be a problem; however, I have gotten use to them which I find amazing.  There's a visual voicemail option I like - instead of calling your voicemail, you can set-up the phone like a media player with the recording information (date/time/length) displayed along with play, pause, etc. buttons; it's very convenient.  The envelope button on the far left of the phone can be programmed directly to a folder of your choice.  Mine goes to my text messages inbox.  I like the instant emoticon button on the keypad.  Lastly, it comes with great features, such as Google Maps, Tasks, Memo, reg. calc., tip calc., world clock, converter, timer, stopwatch, and an RSS reader (I haven't used the last feature).What I don't care for: This phone does not group text messages together in a conversation...which is very annoying to me.  I believe you can only have about 75 or so text messages in your inbox at a time before your phone informs you the inbox is full and asks you if you want to delete ALL of your messages.  You can say no (to select which ones you'd like to delete) but the message will repeatedly - like every 10 seconds - pop up until you lower the number of messages in your inbox.  Deleting messages in your outbox has no bearing on the messages in the inbox seemingly.  The phone randomly let's you know you don't have any new emails - which is annoying to me.  You can lock the phone; however, you cannot control how long it will take or not take for the phone to do so.  You cannot delete ANY of the games provided  and ALL of them are trial versions only; to purchase them they cost $3 and up which is ridiculous in my opinion.  Accessing the web can be a bit slow...about 13 seconds or so.  I do not like the TeleNav GPS feature.If the games set-up and alert for the full inbox were different, I would have given this phone 4 stars.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfecet phone for non android users", "Author": "Young Lou", "ReviewID": "RWQN6SZB33IFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has blackberry similarities but its only 3G.
