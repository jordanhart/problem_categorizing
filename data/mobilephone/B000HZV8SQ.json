{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phancy Phenomenal Phabulous Petite Pink Phone", "Author": "Mamalinde \"mamalinde\"", "ReviewID": "R3VQ6M81AANF4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, pink just makes a Mamalinde happy.  After spending WAY too much time on the phone with Cingular in a long and drawn out \"upgrade\" request and after being promised the phone twice and having it not shipped as promised, I had about reached the point of switching carriers and stopping the torture.  But, I finally got my phancy pink phone and it was worth the wait.  Where to start?  How about with one thing at a time, which is how I managed the learning curve on this pheature laden phoneAddress Book:  It is huge.  And ... I was able to move the card from my nokia so I did not have to rebuild my address book, and I absolutely love the one button, voice call feature, though there is a limit to how many names can be loaded in.  The button is conveniently located on the right side of the phone, just say the pre-recorded name clearly and that number will be dialed for you automatically.  I use this a LOT.  Recording the name took a bit of practice, but gets much easier.iTunes:  I selected this phone not just because of the color, but primarily because of the built-in iPod.  I am a daily bus rider it seemed to make more sense than the cumbersome CD player that required batteries once a week and the awkward changing of disks - not to mention a LOT more space in my purse.  The download was really pretty easy, but I had been using iTunes on home computer for some time so I had a familiarity with the program.  Sounds as good as the CD player ever did, and the shuffle songs feature gives a nice variety of about 100 songs - way nicer than the CD player.  A phone call will interrupt the play, but then the music will go right back to where it was.  I can also listen to tunes without using the headphones, which I find handy on my morning bike rides.  The speaker is just loud enough but I can still hear traffic and I'm not being too noisy.  The model phone I have will not allow you to take an iTune song and make it a ringtone.Camera/Videocam:  I did not expect to use this feature very much but it has come in quite handy.  Setting it up to be able to e-mail the pictures/videos was a real hassle and there is a charge (but Cingular is patient and persistent), but using the cameras is very easy.  Actually my 9 and 10 year old nieces have taught me everything I could possibly need to know, and have a delightful time making 20 second videos (see mamalinde on youtube for some delightful examples of their genius).  Easy to make a picture into a screensaver too, right now it is a pink peony.Mobile e-mail.  This feature is a good one to have, but a bit cumbersome and slow.  It took over an hour on the phone with Cingular to get this set up but we finally got there.  I get a notification beep everytime I get an e-mail, which is a bit distracting even with a good junk philter on that address.  And the attachments, links don't work on the phone.  It is nice to be able to confirm that an e-mail arrived or to check what may be stacking up when you can't get to a computer.Text messaging.  Okay, get past it.  Not just for teens and young folks, if this gramma to text message, so can you.  Besides better manners than talking it offers a bit more privacy when riding the bus or out in a crowd, and sometimes a reminder in writing is much more effective and can be stored if referring back is necessary.  If your kiddo can't talk right now, you can STILL communicate with them!  The Quick Note feature, where you can store repetitious messages (check e-mail, thank you, ok, call me, where are you, yes and no), this is very very handy and quick.  And sending and receiving sweet nothings with the phella, well, that will keep you young.Ringing/Vibrating.  Using this feature is easy.  Just the up and down sound buttons on the upper left portion of the phone will move you from ringing volumes to vibrate (or silent).IM.  I haven't used this yet.  Hmmm.  Maybe it will be next?Internet.  This can be customized to your demands, mine gives me local weather and news.  I find it hard to search for something specific, but it is very handy to have access to news stories or the weather radar.  Maybe I should play with this a bit more?In sum I have used this phone for several months now and find it quite worthy of a Princess like me.  It has also been dropped a couple of times onto cement, with no harmful effect except for some scratches on the pink paint.  The petite size is phenomenal, especially considering all the pheatures and it's a showstopper too.  Everyone who sees it wants one!", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Karen P.", "ReviewID": "R1ZKT2VI5F8Q3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The texturized buttons don't bother me; in fact, they seem to keep my fingers from slipping when I dial. The color is great (getting lots of compliments). Lots of storage for numbers. The camera feature takes clear pics for a cell phone. It has an alarm clock in the tools section, which I like to use when I am away from home. The battery standby time is really long. Several days go by before I need to recharge. This is my first phone with bluetooth; it's easy to use, but it takes some getting used to. The phone has speaker too. I am getting great reception and others tell me that I sound more clear than my old phone. The phone is easy to navigate; you can even program the buttons to have the function you want if the preprogrammed ones don't feel natural to you. The music capability is convenient, the phone came with the appropriate cable to hook up to the computer to download the songs. The screen does get smudgy, but it is very colorful and clear.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "B. Fogarty \"hugabl\"", "ReviewID": "RL3ARYO88R4WA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an unlocked SLVR L7 Pink phone and it is really great. My son liked it so much he bought a black SLVR L7. I really don't have any complaints other than my Phone service doesn't support the phone at this time and I can't get any downloads, but that doesn't have anything to do with the phone itself.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Oh how I wish I could give this 5 stars!", "Author": "A. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2CQLBIOPD7DHO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off this is my first review for an item off of Amazon because I felt like the truth needed to be told.I really really really want to give this phone 5 stars, but I can't.  I give it a 3 and that is mostly for its looks.Pros:-Beautful pink metal finish-Built well-Screen is very clear-Itunes works greatCons--The phone's antenna must not be very strong since I keep getting dropped calls, while my husband's brand new Sony w300i has not dropped any calls.  This is my main complaint about the phone.  I drove down two roads today and lost my phone call 3 times.  I had my husband call me when he was driving the same two roads and he didn't even experience interference.  This phone might be great where there are strong signals all the time, but not for the areas with less than 4 bars.-The volume on this phone is lousy!  I can't even hear it ring when I am in another room, so I have missed quite a few calls.-Speakerphone is a joke! In the car, I have to hold it near my ear to hear it at a comfortable volume.  It is okay in a quiet room but I would still like it louder.-Buttons are admittedly awkward even with my tiny fingersIn conclusion,  if you want a phone that is pink, looks great, and plays itunes then this is the phone for you.  If you want a phone that picks up signals well and has a decent call/ring/speakerphone volume, this is not the phone for you. My last LG phone was better than this one and that just isn't right.So now I hope to exchange it, ugh.  I really will miss the pink but I need a reliable phone.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "practically no hassle, and ended up saving a lot of $$$, esp. with rebate", "Author": "pretty hikes", "ReviewID": "RXLZNOIO8X4IV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just wanted to let people know that they don't have to worry about porting their number when purchasing new service with Cingular through Amazon.  I was a little concerned about how smoothly this would go, given the mixed reviews, but it only took a couple hours.  However, I am only giving 4 stars because the pink phone is a bit brighter than is depicted in the picture.  Also, does anyone know how I can set my phone so that it does not roll over to voicemail so quickly when someone calls?  I have not been able to find any settings for this, either on the phone, or through the voicemail feature.  All in all though, I am enjoying my new phone!", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Few complaints", "Author": "PrivateFolks", "ReviewID": "RJO2HJDI7PBHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in Nov/Dec. 2006 and have enjoyed it quite a bit.Granted, I don't use the iTunes and special features all that much, but for what I use, it's good.It fits easily into a jacket pocket or the pocket of a purse, which is nice.  However, I do have to set it to vibrate *and* ring when it's tucked away or else I won't hear it in the store or another location with background noise.  If it's out on a countertop or in my hand, it's plenty loud.The buttons/keys are rather tiny and I have to use my fingernail to press them usually.  A little aggrivating sometimes, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  Most people who complain about reception are probably dealing with a faulty phone or are not giving proper (dis-)credit to their service provider.  I've never had reception problems with this phone.I also found a good scratch-resistant screen protector on amazon (by Eforcity) for under $2 that fits this screen perfectly.  You can't even see it.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone and CUTE!!", "Author": "J. Schenk \"amznian\"", "ReviewID": "R36KWY20W8ELBO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was strongly cautioned not the buy either a RAZR or SLVR, so I did research to find a phone that would best suit my needs AND be something cute and attractive (if I am keeping it for two years, this is a must!).  I fell in love with the look of the SLVR but I still felt like I needed to look into it and compare with other phones.  I read all of the reviews, good, bad and ugly and decided, for my needs, this was the phone for me.So far, this has been a great choice!  The phone itself is very attractive and I was able to find a case specifically made for the L7's that enhanced this even more, instead of hiding it behind some bulky material.  I have no problems with the reception and can always hear clearly and be heard clearly.The biggest disappointment I had was that I couldn't figure out how to assign individual ringtones and assumed this this was not an option of the phone rather than being the outcome of the ill-informed user that I was.  Reading other reviews showed that this was a disappointment for other users as well.  WE WERE WRONG!  My best advice: READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL!  But to sum it up, to get an individual ringtone, a number has to be saved to the phone rather than the SIM card.  So this is no longer a disappointment for me.For those of you who get this phone through Cingular/AT&T;, the phone comes with a memory card (nice bonus!) and I was able to find another micro memory card with more storage and 2 micro card adaptors (to fit the micro in other memory card slots) for just over $13 on Amazon.  I do not use the iTUNES feature (as of yet) but have put music on my card and played it through the \"my sounds\" function, which has worked great for me.I have seen complaints about the keypad and have found them, for myself, to be unfounded.  I have no problems with them.  However, I do not text a lot, but when I have, the functions have been easy to use and unconfusing.The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the quality of the camera.  Pictures are a little blurry and dark.  Since this is not my primary sourse of photos, this is not a huge disappointment for me.For my use, this phone is fantastic, but bear in mind that I am pretty easy on my cell phones, with a little less than an average amount of use.  It's got all the fun features and bells and whistles I wanted to have a little fun with my phone, but works great in it's most basic form as well!", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!!", "Author": "R.

I have not had any major problems with it at all.The only complaint is that I cannot assign specific speed dial numbers to certain numbers.The itunes function will only allow 100 songs on your phone, no matter how big your card is. However, I love the itunes function on the phone because I can just play it whenever I like (it is great to use when waiting for the bus).You need to use a San Disk micro sd card with the phone though, I tried to use a kingston micro sd card and the phone would not recognize it.The buttons, menus, and programs are easy to use with the phone. I would recommend that if the phone is in your purse or pocket, you lock the keyboard often because the number pad is very sensitive to touch.The phone is durable, I have dropped it several times and it still kept on working.If you are looking for a slim phone to play music text, and surf the internet once in a while, it is a great choice among phones.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pretty Pink Practical Phone", "Author": "pinay1130", "ReviewID": "R3FQ3X3UUK134P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently ordered this phone through amazon and I must say I love it!!

THEY DRIVE ME POSITIVELY  INSANE. The \"brushed steel\" thing is horrible, it feels like pushing on sandpaper. The buttons are not raised at all, in fact they are RECESSED into the phone! Everything about them is horrible. I hate pushing buttons, and that is the main function of the phone! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET!! Go into a store and look at it and push the buttons before you buy it!!!!!!! If you don't, you will probably reallllly regret it. Trust me on this, I would've loved the phone but for the buttons :(!

Greaves", "ReviewID": "R7UIDEB2PTE10", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are looking for an mp3 player and don't plan on talking on your phone much, then you may want to check out the SLVR. For the rest of you who like to use your phone TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE, I recommend buying a different phone. I am constantly having to say \"what?\" \"huh?\" \"can you repeat that?\" because of the totally digitized and fuzzy voice quality of this phone.If that's not enough, the functionality is unintuitive. You have to press 5 buttons to dial the previously missed call. 8 buttons to get to voicemail. What?Then of course, other functions are TOO easy to get to. Like firing up the web browser. Yeah, that's one touch and it's easy to accidentally press that button. Of course if you do, you get charged like 20 cents a second - a costly mistake that adds up.But if that's not enough, you can't add information to an address entry without starting over and creating a new contact. It's insane. But if you want to add another phone number, unique ring tone, etc.....well, you can't because you there is no \"save\" option for the SIM card when you're editing. I bet several of my friends they couldn't save a ringtone to their name. No one could (and these are people who are tech-savvy and all work in the tech industry). This is ridiculous.If I were the president of Motorola, I'd promptly fire the people who were in charge of this last piece of functionality. Embarrassing.Addendum on Jan 14, 2006: Today, I took a picture using this phone and the camera froze and NO buttons work - not even the off button. Now, I'm waiting the four hours for the battery to die (4 hr battery life - one of the few good things about this phone) so that the software can reset. In the meantime, when people call my phone, the message is \"The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time\". And so there's no way to even leave a message. Four hours and counting....", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Motorola SLVR L7 Pink Phone (AT&T)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E4EPAS80L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000HZV8SQ"}}
