Simple just like myself!", "Author": "Earth Goddess \"Born Rebel\"", "ReviewID": "RJB5R7AUBN7GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone this past week and I love it so far, its very simple which is what I love about it! Not all the bells and whistles like all the new phones and all the smartphones! My husband wants me to convert to a smartphone and I keep telling him \"I don't need any phone that's smarter then ME!\" Lol! I love this pink color its not overpowering and the flowery detail on the front and the back has a tactile feel to it as well. I have 2 digital cameras and 2 ipods so I don't really care for all that jazz with a cellphone! (I switched over from a samsung rant and I hated it, it was slow and lagged all the time the time on it was always wrong the speaker was always muffled friends always complained they couldn't hear me on it and using my hand-free device on it was way worse! Which poses a safety risk for me while driving I always use my hand-free device! sending email was terrible so was the texting the battery life was horrible as well only thing this phone could successfully do is NOTHING!) The only thing the sanyo 2700 lacks for me is a notepad which I use to save my grocery lists on. I can easily substitute with the voice memo it holds up to 125 minutes worth of recording! A cellphone to me is a means to communicate and that's exactly what this phone delivers! Communication, texting and checking my email! You will not go wrong with this phone if you just want a simple phone that actually does what its suppose to do! If you want to access the internet at blazing speeds and watch videos this is NOT the phone for you! I have a laptop, iPod touch and a desktop so I have plenty of ways to access youtube, facebook or whatever else. Oh yea the GPS navigation is great on this device I'm no longer lost when trying to get somewhere anymore! There is a built in GPS chip in this device, Love it!Hope this clears some of your questions on this phone! God bless! :)", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "boost phone", "Author": "Ms. Nay", "ReviewID": "R67TWTXMI9919", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was great for my daughter she's only ten she only need a phone to call me when she leaves for school its easy to work n she loves it so yes I would recommend this phone as a starter phone.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice, pretty", "Author": "Karen R.

The most reliable, basic phone I've ever owned. NEVER had one problem with it. Simple and easy to navigate. Very basic but gets the job done for phone calls and texting. Most people thought it was a Blackberry :)", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mediocre phone", "Author": "Kean Erickson", "ReviewID": "R2L52LVONIZSC2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "+The keypad's not bad, though the tiny buttons are easy to fatfinger initially.+This phone vibrates extremely hard. I wonder who they're marketing it towards....-No sim card.-MicroUSB port is locked, this phone will NOT communicate with your computer. You don't even have the option to transfer your pictures from your phone to your computer. I think this is particularly despicable--if you own a phone, you should by all means have free access to everything on it. Instead here you're expected to use an overpriced dataplan to email yourself the pictures. Even then, and then each image takes several minutes to upload..-A voice recorder, but no notepad?! What the hell? In this regard the Sanyo 2700 has actually devolved compared to previous phone generations.. truly a feat.-This is moreso a fault of this variety of phone, but if you buy this you'll find yourself struggling eternally with a phone that either locks too quickly (when you're writing a message or reading a phone number), or buttdials people because it's unlocked for too long in your pocket after they call or message you.-The recent history list is clunky. Only four entries will fit on the screen, two at the very top of the list (I've unintentionally neglected missed calls because of this).-Zero support, no troubleshooting documentation in paper or on the web.A few weeks ago I came home to see this phone grayscreened--it could ring and take calls, but the interface was inaccessible. Ordered a new phone, and then three days later it was working again. There was no water damage, and didn't drop it. This phone's unreliable.If you sign up with Credo Mobile, don't fall for this option, it's not a good phone.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "No.", "Author": "makeda18", "ReviewID": "R2R9D2EPNUBEBC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It barely worked at all! It kept dropping calls. I wouldn't get text messages or phone calls, period, at times. This phone aggravated me so much! The seller said it worked perfectly fine. No. I couldn't even return it! Never again people. Such an old phone. I only bought it because I really needed a phone at the time. I ended up selling it back to sprint.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "expensive through this offer", "Author": "Lmiller", "ReviewID": "R7P7UUDTC17EF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is for sale at fred meyer for $15.

Useful address book system too. Even a damn smiley button.Email: well integrated support for major email systems (yahoo/gmail etc).GPS:  Very responsive, though a slow start up time. A hands free feature calls Sprint Navigation and you can dictate your location.  The voice and directions are well timed and loud.  Its quite the battery drain though.Battery: If you just use it to lightly call and text its held charge for over 5 days for me.Web: Very simple web browsing, restrict yourself to only mobile sites.  If you do that, its actually quite fast.Camera: For utility, not for taking pictures of a lifetime.Chat: Integrated AIM, msn chat and such, but I didn't know people still used them.  No google chat though.Cons:There is a mild amount of bloatware, and \"apps\" and ads that feels retro in that 1990s WWW look.  They are easily avoided, by never going to \"Shopping\", \"my stuff\" or \"Chat and Dating\".The keyboard is small, and its tough to dial a number without looking.  You will eventually get used to it though.The reception varies at times, but that could just be the areas I am in.  It does seem worse than my previous cheap Sprint phones.There is a micro-USB interface,but it doesn't allow you to transfer files.  It forces you to sign up to some Sprint back up system.  Sucks.No integrated facebook, though I've had no problems using the web browser and signing onto mobile facebook website.So if you just want an inexpensive phone to call, text, read email, take pictures, and a useful GPS with a great battery and not pay 3/4G rates.  You will need to pay for a non 3G dataplan as well as Sprint Navigation.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
