I simply rose my eyebrow and just restored it on Itunes and the problem was fixed! Yay so happy (cue sunshine and rainbows) right? No. Just 2 weeks after i did that i had the wifi issue again and very calmly i backed up my Iphone and restored it.Nothing. It still wasnt fixed. Now i was sweating a bit.I tried everything it said on the apple website but still no luck. Unfortunetly for me they wont take my iphone back because i waited longer than 30 days (heaven forbid i notice a problem after 30 days!) so now im stuck with a wifi-less Iphone and im heading to apple tomorrow to see if i can fix it. If not i just wasted 500 dollars.Seller claims they are low profit (which is hard to believe since they just basically robbed me of 500 dollars) so they cant give me a refund for a DAMAGED product. Really? Not buying from this seller again. I WILL be contacting Amazon with a claim.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's an iPhone...", "Author": "sickle", "ReviewID": "R1F61HKIW8UKIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone knows about iPhones, I prefer them over android but it's preference.
