It is a good phone but has negative things like everything.Positive points:- Perfectly fit to your hand so it is very easy to use and reach every corner of the screen.- Pretty thin and light- Has dual core 1 ghz processor so it is fast- Very easy to use keyboard- For its price range this the best phone- Camera is pretty good- Still working under the waterNegative points:- Has 512 mb ram and it is not enough- Back cover doesn't feel good- Has still gingerbread. it is going to be ice cream sandwich but don't know when.At the end, it is a perfect phone for its price but if you have money you can buy a phone which has 1 gb ram cuz 512 mb ram is not enough.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, great deal, but no 3G with Tmobile US", "Author": "A. Guilmo", "ReviewID": "RY67SNLAQWSVJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 6 month now and it works great. It's compact (i didn't want any 4+ inches screen, too big), fast, light.Sony keeps updating the software (jelly bean and Xperia layer updates recently released) and some of their softwares are good (free TrackID, Walkman, Astro file manager)Three small negative points:1/ the camera is not great. It lacks options and quality is just ok. I don't mind much though, if i want good photos i use a real camera... Still they could have added a picture button to the side (bothered me when i was trying to take pictures underwater where the touch screen wasn't very responsive haha)2/ the screen resolution isn't high either. Doesn't really bother me. I don't wanna read font size 6 on my browser anyway.3/ the frequency bands it uses are not compatible with Tmobile's 3G or 4G. Here's why: the phone uses the following, 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 -  3G Network HSDPA 900 / 2100 while Tmobile uses 1700 / 2100 for it's 3G and 4G.(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_US#Radio_frequency_spectrum_chart )Although the good thing with an unlocked phone is that i can change carriers anytime... I still need to figure out who makes 3G over those bands.Other than that, great phone! The reasonable price (230$), shock/water-resistance (but not really -proof!), compactness, unlocked, good battery life, are really the features that convinced me.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too slow", "Author": "Samantha Corchado", "ReviewID": "R24OXWW0CLZU9O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Within the first 2 days the phone would randomly shut down on me, It laggs way to much.

The product lives up to its IP67 rating in its dust proof and waterproof-ness but that's where it stops. The durability of the internal parts are horribly made. I bought this phone thinking it would last for at least a couple years without any-sort of replacement issues but apparently there seems to be a common problem with sony waterproof phones in particular the Xperia Go where by after some time left side of the touchscreen stops working and then the touchscreen becomes less and less responsive with each use... THIS HAPPENED TO ME WITHIN 7 MONTHS! SERIOUSLY? A WEATHER PROOF PRODUCT WITH ALL THIS MARKETING HYPE!!?. I was expecting longevity for a least 2-3 years but boy was i wrong...I Have no problems with the seller but this product is ridiculous...I am never trusting Sony when it comes to their longevity of their items EVER especially this waterproof, dust proof CRAP!!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice cellphone, resistent", "Author": "Evening Perez", "ReviewID": "R1YFMB7H7ITQN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my cellphone, but its not that perfecta as sony says... and about the water resist, well, the cell will be resistant while the caps are not damaged (audio outputs and usb port).About the seller, everything was ok", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "It doesn't work", "Author": "Garronizo CR", "ReviewID": "R221P7YX0G6OQA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone, stick software turns off, the signal is lost, and not least the 3g does not work, could not be programmed, apezar that says it is factory unlocked, also brings assurance", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice seller", "Author": "Jose A.
