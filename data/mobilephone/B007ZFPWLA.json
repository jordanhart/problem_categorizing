Allbright \"talon1812\"", "ReviewID": "R31YQ0MEU3HXZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly, some people should NOT leave reviews. They comment on items that are not even applicable.I ordered this phone to replace a 3rd Samsung Impression 877(which is the worst phone ever perpetrated onto the world)I researched for phones that were smart phones, but did NOT require a data plan. This one suited everything I needed in the phone I was looking to replace.It has excellent call quality, great slide-out keyboard. The screen is extremely sensitive, so I don't know why some are saying that it isn't.I've had it for 2 weeks now, and wanted to hold off reviewing it before leaving a review. And when people leave reviews, I wish they would consider that they're reviewing the PRODUCT, not the seller or transaction. I get so tired of hearing about how LONG it took an item to receive, or if they have a certain problem with a seller. This has NO bearing on the item.If you're looking for a NO-DATA required smart phone, but don't want to spend $400, this is a WONDERFUL phone and I highly recommend it.  If I had anything negative to say about it, it's just that the internal storage is only 512 mb. Many of the internal system apps are required on the phone. I did install a 32 GB micro sd card, but many system apps cannot be moved to the external storage!! And YES, it DOES support 32 gb micro SD cards.Buy it, you won't be dispappointed (unless you're expecting a Droid DNA, I-phone 5 or Samsung Galaxy 4).And it DID come with a 2 GB micro SD card.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp Fx Plus", "Author": "Joan G.", "ReviewID": "R30YXEWV9YE0VM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone a couple of days ago, and fortunately is eligible for Prime, so the shipping was quick.  Once I got the phone, I tried it out and it works very well for a $70 phone.  I can actually play certain versions of angry birds, which I thought I would not be able to do with such a low-quality smartphone.  The speed is nice; once in a while the phone locks up, but that's not a big deal.  The screen has a very nice, high resolution display.  The only problem is that I cannot tell apps and games from the play store to automatically download and install to my sd card, but on the other hand there probably wouldn't be any games or apps that my phone could handle that would exceed my phone's built-in memory limit.  The internet is relatively fast, although it sometimes takes longer than usual to open a more complex web page.  I downloaded the Dolphin web browser for Android, and it is faster than the default browser.  Another problem with the phone is that when it came, I did not find the 2GB micro SD card that Amazon said would be included with the phone, but I had my own 4GB that I had previously bought, so it wasn't a problem for me.  The slide-out keyboard on the phone is okay; the keys feel slightly mushy when pressed and aren't raised to much from the body of the phone.  The capacitive screen is very sensitive, making it easy to navigate different areas of the phone.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fix for sending/receiving pics", "Author": "L. Oakley", "ReviewID": "R6MNTDMICEXME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife loves the key board etc.  The battery seemed to loose its charge at first but got better after a few weeks and using an eraser on the contacts.  I have read the battery lasts 30 hrs with light use.  That seems about right.The point of this review, however, is the allusive fix for sending and receiving pics with text messaging.  In our case I discovered that the phone had no data connection with wifi off.  Here is what I had to do.  We use t-mobile or tmobile.  This is on their site, but what we got over the phone was a little different.  I am putting our experience.From the Home screen, press the Menu key.Touch Settings, Wireless & Networks,Verify that the Airplane Mode or Flight Mode check box is cleared.Scroll down to \"Mobile Networks\" tap itverify that Data Enabled is checkedData Roaming is check in my caseNote: This incurs charges if you roam internationally.Touch \"Access Point Names\" or APNs.Press the Menu key.Touch Reset to default. (family mobile says to check your connection, but it didn't work at this point for us)press the Menu key, and touch New APN.Tap Name type \"familymobile\"Tap APN and type web.omwtoday.com then tap okProxy: <Not set>Port: <Not set>Username: <Not set>Password: <Not set>Server: <Not set>scroll down toMMSC tap MMSC type [...]MMS proxy: <Not set>MMS port: <Not set>MCC: 310 (I did not need to enter this but it is there now)MNC: 260 (I did not need to enter this but it is there now)Authentication type: <Not set>I had to tap \"save\" on the bottom left after which I had a data connection without using wifi.

I could not go 4 to 5 hours without needing to charge the phone again.2 the memory was not enough for me. This phone is loaded with not needed apps that took up way too much space. I placed two apps that I use almost everyday and already was at the limit of space.3 When I tried to move my apps to the SD card to conserve memory the apps stopped working.

I often find it easier/faster to use it rather than the touch screen.If the battery life was better, it would have earned an extra star. ******I feel it only fair to add that I do live in an area where my cell signal comes and goes, and because of this the phone does use more energy as it is in search mode a lot****", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap replacement phone", "Author": "Nk", "ReviewID": "R1ZTPC3TT9RIMG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I brought this phone after my wife drunkly tossed my HTC out the window. it works ok for what it is.

Honestly, I don't know they sell these thing this cheap.  The phone works like it should but the one thing that is a real stand out is the speaker volume.  I bought this phone for my wife and she keeps it in her purse.  At maximum volume, you can barely hear it her purse when it rings.  She misses 9 out of 10 calls because of this.  I am of the old school that still believe that the primary function of a phone is still to make and receive calls and that no matter what else they put in a phone, they should never skimp on the hardware that serves these basic functions. Unfortunately, Sharp skimped big time on the speaker in this phone.

I am on my second phone in 6 months and both have the same issues.  The phone has a clear display and sounds great for calls and I like the ease of texting.  Now for the bad, the phone will not keep the SD card docked and you have to constantly dock and undock the SD card to access the apps on the card.  The phone will reboot itself for no reason or shut itself off.  The phone will also turn itself on from hibernation while sitting on a table, get hot, and drain the battery.
