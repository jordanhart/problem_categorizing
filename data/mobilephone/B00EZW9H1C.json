When my fiance' decided to put me on his account, I had to switch providers and phones.  Missed the Blackberry ever since!  I cannot get the hang of touch screen typing.

I have been a very proud and happy Blackberry user for 5 years now. The phone is very polished and  a very solid phone. The blackberry 10 OS took some getting use to after using the older BB 6 OS but after a couple days I was very impressed. Very Reliable and I can use it from 5 in the morning until 10  at night with a single charge with heavy texting and the screen brightness turned all the way to maximum. I find this is to be a very serious phone for those who value communication, emailing, and texting. Although the screen is smaller than most phones I tend to use the phone as a phone and not so much a entertainment tool. This phone may not be perfect BUT it is perfect for me! I know there are other phones than may be faster or bigger but I wouldnt choose any other phone than my Q10. Even though the generally population may not appreciate Blackberry I think those who are discriminating as i am  realize that this a solid well made very secure communication tool! I love this phone!

The browser is lighting fast, the OS is different than before but very easy to use and it feel great in my hand. I got the hang of it in about a day in a half, it gives you a tutorial that shows you all of the how to use it which I thought was really neat. I upgraded the OS last night so I am now able to download and use Android apps which is a huge plus. Plus it was so simple to do, there are plenty of youtube videos that will give you detailed steps. The only some what issue I think people would have is the battery, I performed my own stress test today on my commute to work. For 2 1/2hrs I listened to music, surfed the web, played candy crush and angry birds, texted and used bbm (my all time favorite app). When I made it to work my battery was at about 52%, which isn't bad at all but I know some phones can got a lot but I can always buy a portable battery packs. Other than that, I'm in love with this phone. Hopefully people will take note of it's awesomeness and jump off the Iphone bandwagon. Oh, did I mention that it has 16GB of internal storage and you can add memory card up to 32GB", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade!", "Author": "Jeff Lamb", "ReviewID": "RCXD31UMJ0HR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had the Blackberry Bold before this purchase.

Switching between various apps is a breeze, and its download speeds are extremely fast. The screen is crystal clear, as is the phone sound quality. I am not a \"candy crush\" or \"instagram\" person. The only thing I really miss about my old Blackberry is the green blinking LED service light, im not sure why the BB10 took this feature away. I also hope to see Netflix added sometime in the future.

I've been waiting 2 years for blackberry to come out with a phone that has it all. I was hoping the Q10 would be it. Though I like the form factor and design of the phone, I must point out that it's greatly lacking in features that seem to come standard on other smartphones. Call quality is decent, web surfing is quick enough, and everything else is just ok. Though I'm not a heavy user battery life is very important to me. Unfortunately the battery life on the Q10 is horrible. I can't get through 4 hours without significant battery drain (even after trying all of the battery saving techniques recommended for this device). The great price on Amazon prompted me to buy the phone and I'm glad I did not pay more than $50, as it's not worth the price to me. I would have been extremely upset had I paid more.
