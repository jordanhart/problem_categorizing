It was fast (no lag) and it had all the functionality of any android phone. By the time I got home, I had already played with the GPS, the back flick pad, online downloading (3G speed max) and the FM radio (YES, it has an FM radio with great quality [you need earphones, thou]). I was like holly poop, this phone is awesome! Not only that, I went to a friend house across the border in Mexico where there is no T-mobile signal. I connected my phone to his Wi-fi and there is an app in (already installed in the phone) that lets me use my T-mobile phone through the internet (I think this is a T-mobile exclusive app, but not sure)... I was like \"DAMN! I can call and receive calls even with no signal.\" Another thing that I thought was going to be a problem is the screen size. It looks like the keyboard overwhelms the screen, but it actually helps a lot because it does not take screen size when you need to type. It is BIG plus right there.So now I feel like I'm going to cry a little when I break this phone apart... but I think I will get another one of these :)Highly recommended phone, it looks better in person than in the picture and is very functional and \"CHEAP\"Notes: Although I buy most of my online merchandise from Amazon, I did not purchase this phone here.My actual carrier is T-mobile, there are other reviews complaining that this phone has bugs when using with other carriers.

This message was generated frequently and for a prepaid plan that you pay per text message it drains your balance in moment(20 cent per messagge). I thought thath this was an error from  A&TT; but after several discussions with the A&TT; technical support people they told me that the messages were generated by my phone.

I don't buy at eBay, and now I can proudly add Amazon to the list of places I won't buy from. at least BestBuy tries to get the technical descriptions of electronics correct for the consumer. I will drive to a store for electronics next time.UnlockedCellPhoneKings promised an Unlocked Motorola MB502 Charm, Bronze color, compatible with TMobile 3G data.  What I received was a LOCKED MB502, in a deep sapphire blue color, which would not work on TMobile 3G databand.  The phone would not work with an ATT nor a TMobile simcard, because it was still LOCKED to AmericaMovil cell carrier from somewhere in LatinAmerica. The blue color was fine, but the phone was un-useable.Particularly aggrevating was the fact that the cache had a previous user's personal data in the memory. Odd, this phone is being sold as new in box, UNLOCKED, and stated to work on TMobile.  Why would it have a MotoBlur account already set up?  I did a complete wipe of the cache and still no go. I have received an RMA to return this totally wrong phone.It is ironic that the reviews here show a lot of disappointment for a large portion of the people buying this phone. For different reasons. Some folk want to use this on ATT 3G. Some do not like the TMobile ROM it should have. Funny, but I had checked the descriptions, and looked forward to a stated TMobile compatibility.  If this phone had actually been UNLOCKED, I could have overlooked everything else.  But the personal data in the phone cache of this \"NEW\" phone was a real pisser. There is quite a bit of documented, fraudalent advertised claims here, using re-imported and grey market phones, foisted on buyers via the US mail.  Hmmm.I credit AMAZON primarily, for getting this wrong technically, and for allowing UNLOCKEDCELLPHONEKINGS to list it wrong, technically.

Yeah it's only 3G but the kicker is the wifi is 150mbs! yeah 150, not 15, that means you don't need 3G or 4G for internet use. If you don't have access then this phone may not be for you, but I have access on the train, at the coffee shop, restaurants and if I'm at someone's house with no reception I can just turn on the wifi calling. An impressive way to test the ability of this phone is go into the youtube app and turn on the camcorder, then take a video and upload it, it will upload as fast as a laptop. If you don't go into the youtube app and record a video too long it wont upload though, the app stops it, but then you can just make clips. The camera takes high resolution pics that you can use as a desktop background on a 27\" LCD monitor, the only catch is they have to be in day light or a room lit like daylight, because there is no flash and low light pics suffer, same with the camcorder. This phone has a dual microphone which means you hear everything and they hear you, especially on speaker phone. I could put this phone on speaker while I was cooking and they didn't even know they were on speaker. The android 2.0 is also the least glitchy they say and with a 32GB SD card you're right up there with the top new phones for storage. I could load albums of music and with some good tube headphones the frequency response is phenomenal, never needed an ipod at the gym with this phone in an armband. I have to admit I'm in the habit of using this size keyboard which only a few other phones have, but it's efficient because you can text from the palm of your hand and a thumb which is good for inopportune times. I also love the size which fits in a shirt pocket or even the front pocket of pants. Some reviews say the battery life is terrible, but what they don't tell you is all phones come with an extended battery which only adds about 2mm of thickness to the bottom half of the phone and keeps the phone charged all day. The extra battery is also convenient if your battery ever does die without a charger around because it holds a charge. Another great thing about this phone is it has a track pad on the back if your fingers are ever too dirty to use the screen. I never had a problem with the touch screen in 7 years and the only reason insurance replaced it was the keyboard light went out so I couldn't see the keys in the dark, but could still use the touch keyboard. The phone is solidly built and I like the rubberized plastic that seems to bounce and I have dropped it countless times and it was never damaged or flew apart like my Blackberrys did. If Motorola came out with this phone just the way it looks with all the new features of their best phones I think Blackberry would go out of business and I would have one perfect phone.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I really like this phone", "Author": "Melissa A Henry", "ReviewID": "RP7A0KJGBJNBC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for almost two years now (which is longer than I have stayed with any one phone ever). I purchased it from T-mobile directly, not from Amazon so I can't say anything about this seller.I have had a love/hate relationship with this phone. Thought it was a lemon when I first purchased it. I actually had it replaced twice within the first three months. The third phone has been a keeper, don't know if the first two were just defective or if I was expecting the phone to do more than it could handle. T-mobile had told me they would give me a different phone if the third has issues and I was actually pretty happy that didn't happen because there is a lot about this phone I really like.It is durable. I one time flung it over the railing of a stair case from two stories up. It hit the ground, came apart (the case, battery cover and battery were all in seperate places.) I put it back together and it was fine. No scratches or anyhing. I have dropped it/bounced it several time and have not had any problems. I take it to the beach with me, brought it home covered in sand and even dropped it into a sink full of dishes and completly submerged it. I dried it off quickly, put it on the window sill to dry and the next day...worked perfectly.I like the design of the phone, I am a heavy texter so I love the keyboard. I have heard others say it takes up too much room and/or takes away from screen space but don't agree with that personally. I love the thingy (I don't know the technical term) on the back that can be used for scrolling. It is a good thing that is there because I have found scrolling directly on the screen doesn't work well as the screen is too jumpy. The camera is descent but lacking a flash. If you want to take self portraits, it is a little tricky on this phone. The phone comes w/ wi-fi calling already installed and works really well when needed.I currently really only use the phone for making phone calls, texting, emailing, social networking and some light internet surfing. Anything more than that would not be good for the phone. When I first got the phone I was excited to have my first Android phone and downloaded all kinds of apps and games. I realized on Charm #3 that the phone is just not meant to have a lot of apps on it and was causing major issues in the phone: freezing to where the battery had to be removed, not being able to answer incoming phone calls, shutting off, battery dying after about 2 hours. I found the extended battery which the phone came with was worse than the regular one. Finally when I sent back my second phone I was told by the tech the phone is just not meant for many apps even thought it is has an Android OS. Now I do have some apps, just not many and no games. I had to add them slowly a day at a time to see how the phone was affected. The internet can be at times sluggish, but I don't use it often enough for it to be a big deal to me. I also found the battery is nothing to brag about, but there are a few things that can be done to help that. An App Killer is definitley needed. I also set my wi-fi calling to only search for a network when the screen is lit up and I have a charger in my car, at my work and extra one in my purse...pretty much just am prepared to charge it in the middle of the day and then again at night.All in all the phone does have some quirks, but those aside I have loved this phone...tried a different one somebody gave me for about an hour and went right back to my Charm, it is very easy to use, the set up and functions are great, there aren't too many buttons, home screen is customizable...I do have to say that when I am eligible for another upgrade (T-mobile let you do that every two years) I will look for a similar design but with more capabilities.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap but not that good", "Author": "Tad", "ReviewID": "R3Q5IM06O01T5W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its a little slow and you frequently hit the wrong app by accident when sliding between screens.
