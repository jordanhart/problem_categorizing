{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good phone; economical", "Author": "pseudonym", "ReviewID": "R1M2WY3C23ZIUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you do not need all the latest bells and whistles from Google/Apple, and do not spend most of your time on Facebook and Twitter, this phone might suit your needs, and could save you some money in data charges. It uses the Symbian operating system, which is supported only through 2016 (though exactly what that means is not clear), but you have a web browser, email, music, a decent camera (except for the fact that you can't take closeup shots), and a full navigational system with maps stored on the phone (means you can use as a GPS even without a network connection, unlike Google or Apple Maps). You do not have apps for every conceivable service and business, so if you rely on a particular app for banking, etc., you're probably better off with another phone. On the other hand, the phone is not constantly monitoring your whereabouts and activities and uploading the data to Google or Apple, so it's possible that you have somewhat more privacy. If you want to use this phone in the USA, AT&T; will not insist on adding a smartphone data plan, so you can have opt to an \"unlimited\" (probably throttled after 2 or 3 GB) feature phone plan for $15/month (as of 10/2013). Priced at about 200 to 250 dollars, this is not the cheapest phone, but then you do not lock yourself in to a specific carrier for 2 years. Good travel phone: you can pop in a standard SIM card from almost anywhere, and you'll be able to obtain service. I purchased this phone through amazon from FGS Trading, and was happy with the product I received.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice lightweight Cell", "Author": "Rui Afonso Stracke \"nozama\"", "ReviewID": "R3QA020AO8SF5I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Own one by a couple of years.Although it is a cell phone that uses Symbian system for which few apps are made, it works well and is very user friendly.Its size and its format are points to emphasize.
