{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's an \"Average\" Phone", "Author": "Saeed Rezaei", "ReviewID": "R3GU0GIAQ871JM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a year now. I got it for free with a 2 year contract with Verizon. I guess I can't say much about a free Android phone, but still, this phone has its faults.First off, the phone has a pretty good design. It's not too flashy, but still has a nice and slim design. I like the fact it has physical navigation buttons rather than the touch navigation buttons, that are on most other Android Phones. The sound quality is also good. The sound quality is loud, clear, and crisp. The Speaker Phone is also very clear and loud. Plus it's backed up by Verizon's network so you shouldn't have much problem with it. This phone is also pretty durable. I've never bought a case for it and I've dropped it around a few times on some hard surfaces. The phone still looks and works great. The back battery cover and the screen is not prone to any scratches.Now for the many faults of this phone. First off, It states that this phone can do 20+ Days of Stand By and 7.5 Hours of Talk, but I highly doubt this phone can pull it off. Obviously it was tested in certain conditions, but for average users like me, you'll never get anywhere near those numbers.  Next is the phone's processing power. This phone does not have a good processor. The phone has a 600MHz Processor, which is the equivalent to an iPhone 3GS, but is no where close to running as smooth as a 3GS. When you're simply just navigating through menus, there is always a little delay and you see some screen tearing. Things take some time to load up and the phone freezes A LOT! What's worse is that playing most games on the phone is awful! I try to play a simple game of Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja and the phone lags like crazy! It's almost unbearable to play games with this phone. It also doesn't help that the touchscreen is not that responsive. It's \"OK,\" but not great. Another big flaw is that the browser on this phone does not have Adobe Flash Support, which basically blocks you off from most of the glory of the web. Of coarse there are Apps for certain sites like YouTube or Facebook, but I wish they just included Flash. The phone comes with 3.2 MP Camera, but the quality is not that good. The controls for it are bad, there's no flash, and pictures come out blurry unless you really try hard to keep your hand. What's worse however is that LG does not have much support from the Android community. There are a some apps that don't work with the phone and LG stopped supporting the phone long times ago.Overall, this phone isn't the best, but you could do a lot worse. Plus it's cheap price justifies its flaws. You really don't find 2.2 Android Phones for free. It's a good entry line phone with Android 2.2, but for someone that wants a really smooth and fast phone, with Flash Support, and a good camera, you might need to look else where.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good entry level Android phone", "Author": "Richard Keeler", "ReviewID": "R2GEMR8F9TRHTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In general this is a great phone for the price.  My only complaints are:1) The keyboard isn't quite as easy to use as I expected, although the Swype technology helps2) As you're typing a text message, you can only see 2 lines of your message at a time, so you have to scroll up and down to proof-read, which is a little annoying3) The battery life seems pretty short - occasionally less than a day with normal usage.  I may try changing some app settings and whatnot to see if I can improve that.But overall, I would recommend it if you're on a budget.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone is great ...

I got this when I lost my phone and didn't have an upgrade available. It seems to struggle technically when trying to run some apps (turn by turn directions just did not work for example) and frequently run low on storage space because many apps can't be moved to the SD card, but it gets the basics like phone, text and email done if you need it. I was glad to trade it in for a higher end phone when my contract was up for renewal/upgrade.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Okay Phone", "Author": "Glowe", "ReviewID": "R3GX1XDWUX267T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone because I needed to upgrade from my env2, which I had had since 7th grade (I am a senior now). When I first got it I was pretty impressed- it worked great, the interface was pretty intuitive- but then I started to notice a few things about it that I was not so pleased with. I downloaded a few apps and, next thing I know, the phone was telling me that my internal memory was full, and my text memory was full. It would not send a text message until I fixed this problem. I found myself constantly being kicked out of apps, always fighting the memory (which was always above 1.5 gb, even when it was telling me it was full), and always having to erase all of my texts. The second problem I had with this phone is that it was always overheating while plugged in, and would only be 20% charged after a few hours. I finally found that I needed to keep everything off of it, so that nothing covers even a little portion of it, while it is charging. Maybe I just had a bad expierience with this phone, but it seems to me that older android phones all have the memory issues, and the battery issues. However, this is a good simple, multi-messaging phone, as it did work fine for texting, calling, and sending pictures. The e-mail app works great after you set it up, and I found that it was a good music player as well if you are looking for an alternative to an mp3 player. I would suggest that, if you do put music on it, you get an SD card with a decent capacity. I would also suggest putting most of your apps on the SD card as well, if they will work on the SD card.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "mommas got her own phone back :)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jessynvanessa\"", "ReviewID": "R11A5FCRHEGKCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works.
