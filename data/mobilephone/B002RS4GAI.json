{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just as I expected", "Author": "J. Howell", "ReviewID": "R1T6AZ4N0AOXVU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some of the other reviewers mentioned that you do not get a camera with it. When I first ordered it, I was freaking out thinking it would not come with one. However, the one I got was a official Samsung Blackjack and came with the camera and had everything it was supposed to (Perhaps some of the sellers were sending out knockoff phones? No idea). Everything was brand new, although it came in a generic AT&T; Box with 1 battery, USB cable, and charger. It did not come with a driver CD, however (Although the drivers can be easily be found online).As for the actual phone, it is a very decent upgrade to my Razor V3. The picture quality is pretty decent, and you can put up to a additional 2GB in the phone via the SD Card slot on the side. You can also upgrade it to Windows Mobile 6, which you can get for free by going to the Samsung website and follow the FAQ in the i607 section. The sound quality is pretty decent, and the range of games is just what I was looking for. It might not be able to handle full 3D games all the way, but it does a good job on most of the 2D games. The menus can be a little confusing at times, and the phone is a little older, but look at this if you want to get a no-contract phone on the cheap without going through a phone provider.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good phone for Costa Rica", "Author": "L.

I use a high-tech phone for myself daily so the tech that this Samsung has is not amazing or anything like the kind, but if you're moving from a regular cell phone to a Windows phone, well you will love this Samsung.It is light weight, it has nice display, you can add some Windows mobile applications to it, and it's a 3G phone for less than a 100 bucks, a bargain for my taste.Addional note: The reviewer that put a video in Spanish, said (I will translate some part for you) that he feels ripped off since he got a phone with no camera on the front and that the phone has written the AT&T; badge, that also the description said that the phone would came with to batteries and only got one and that the phone did not came with the factory box but on a regular one.

The Blackjack does that effortlessly!I originally became so frustrated with my Samsung Solstice a887 Phone (AT&T;) that I resolved to spend the bucks to get an unlocked phone a full year and a half before my contract was to expire.  My chief complaint with the Solstice was the calendar, it's bad enough that it doesn't sync directly with Outlook (it has its own proprietary calendar/contacts software that does that) but the real problem is that the file record limitations for the Solstice mean that you'll retain little more than the name of the appointment, the phone number or address and little else.The Blackjack has none of those limitations, which means that I can put an entire travel itinerary in an appointment file and easily retrieve flight numbers and references without the fear of the text ending early.I like the keyboard, it's great for texting.  And using Activsync, all I have to do is plug my phone into a USB port and the calendar is updated within minutes.Technologically speaking, this is probably a couple years behind the curve.  I wouldn't suggest this to heavy mobile internet users, but for the occaisional email retrieval or send it's fine.  What's important is that you have a good idea as to what functions you'll actually use and/or need.  Why spend more for bells and whistles that hold little or no appeal to you?", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "This phone is a toy/joke for anyone over age 13", "Author": "Rich P", "ReviewID": "R2EPA2HIPW6ADL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I give this phone 1 star because I can't give it zero stars.I thought this would be a good phone for occasional access to the internet as well as keeping a mobile copy of the address book I have on my computer at home.  I found out that in spite of remotely resembling a Blackberry it is nothing of the sort.  It's a kiddie toy.First problem - there's no way to connect to computer, except by miniSD card.  You CAN NOT find drivers so your computer can transfer data via USB cable or Bluetooth.  You can connect a USB cable to it, but it's not for data.  It's just for charging the phone from the PC.  It comes with a wall wart charger.  Yes, the phone has Bluetooth capabilities, but only for headsets, etc.  A Bluetooth receiver on a computer can see and identify the phone.  But without drivers the connection is useless.  You can use the miniSD card, but that means you have to write the address book to the card on your computer, remove it, install it in the phone and then copy the addresses into the phone's address book.  Plus you have to repeat the process or reverse it whenever you add or edit an address.  Ridiculously cumbersome.Also remember if you take any pictures with the phone you cant' transfer them to your PC either.  You either have to use the miniSD card or transmit them to yourself over the data network (using the \"pay as you go minutes\" the whole time).  If you use the mini SD card the phone restricts maximum miniSD capacity to 16 MB.  If you take very many pictures you're going to have to do the miniSD shuffle more than once for a batch of pictures.  Ridiculously cumbersome.But back to the address book.  The other option is to manually key them in to the phone.  The keys on this phone are not much bigger than grape seeds.  For anyone with fingers larger than a child's keying in the addresses and phone numbers, and having to toggle the function for soem of the keys between alpha and numeric would be ridiculously cumbersome.  Especially when there are other phones available that can transfer the address book from a PC in a matter of seconds.I never got to trying out the phone sound quality, taking any pictures or accessing the web on this phone.  I figured they would be fraught with similar shortcomings and returned the phone.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loved my phone!", "Author": "Sexy Eyes", "ReviewID": "R3F30465HOQD0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this as a gift and from the moment I received my phone I fell in love.
