{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "Todd Boostrom", "ReviewID": "R3NP6JB8687AHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been partial to LG phones for a few years, so I was biased towards this phone to begin with, but its features have exceeded my expectations. This was not an out of the box phone, but a project that takes a bit of time, patience, and a few accessories to get it configured and setup just right.Firstly, the music mp3 player works great, with clear extrenal speakers and a headphone/ microphone jack. It uses a 4 part, not 3 part 2.5mm mini-plug, so this restricts the headphones or adapters you can use with it. I bought the Jabra C220 stereo earbuds, and they work nicely. I also bought two 512 Mb Sandisk mini SD cards to hold music, though I heard the 1 Gb mini SD card also works fine. Make sure you buy mini SD instead of regular SD cards. To load the mp3s on the card from my computer, I bought a  USB card reader that reads SD cards. The first time you put in a mini SD card, the phone puts three folders on the card, one for sounds, one for pictures, and one for mp3s. The phone's mp3 player is somewhat buried, but you can create a shortcut to it: OK button -> right toggle 2 times -> OK button -> down toggle 2 times -> OK button -> 0 -> hit CLR button twiceNow, when you hit the down toggle button, the mp3 player comes right up.Secondly, I knew the video and music player capabilities would take extra battery power, so I went ahead and bought the extended life battery, and it's been a great investment, lasting well through heavy usage. Be aware the battery is larger and makes the phone a little bulkier.You can synchronize and download your phone book, wallpaper, Outlook Calendar and ringtones with the free program BitPim and a n LG VX8100 data cable you can buy on eBay or elsewhere that connects via USB to your computer.I also picked up the Bluetooth Logitech wireless headset, and it works great, but I prefer using the built-in speakerphone on my lap while driving.This phone has all sorts of interesting possible tweaks for those so inclined to tinkering-- at your own risk.The bottom line is that this is the cell phone with the functionality I've always wanted, phone + extended battery + mini SD cards + card reader + Jabra headphones + BitPim + data cable.The only warnings: find documentation online, not from Verizon; slim and petite this phone is not; and don't expect everything ready to roll directly out of the box.", "Date": "October 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cant go wrong here", "Author": "J. Griffin", "ReviewID": "RD5YIDPO6B4T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone on all fronts. I bought it with the intention of leveraging all features including mp3s and full customization without a connection kit or extra service fee. I've gotten it to do everything I wanted. To get all the features I'd say you need  to be a bit tech savy. But even basic users will enjoy the phone.Standard stuff is excellent - reception, interface, contacts, calendar, talk and standby time, very nice/bright lcd, etc. Also feels much more solid than the 815e.I use bluetooth and opensource pc software to exchange images, and ringers(mp3s). Very easy once learned. I'm a bit techy.I load mp3s (renamed to .mid and <~15 chars) to a miniSD card - very nice player. Stereo speakers work very well. Although cant close lid. Great to listen to audio books or lectures. Does play videos/movies but has to be converted by software, big hassle but its an option.Camera: Very good phone cam - I also have a 7mp canon sd500 camera (awesome camera!) so it doesn't compare. I save pix/video to miniSD card.Speakerphone: ok, but very handy when needed.EV-DO: broadband internet - via bluetooth - very nice - simple and fast, I connected at ~110k on XP laptop. I use it as a backup net connection but not really needed as there are so many ways to connect to the net. Can be a bit tricky to set up on laptop. Not documented. Does cost $15 per month extra (not bad though).Cons:1) Can be a bit difficult to hear other person in ear.2) Some features are hidden - must find settings to enable.3) Manual is lame for advanced users.Overall its a very personalizable phone. With some google searching and about 2 or 3 hours you can get it to do lots of stuff not mentioned in the book or in the store.  Worth it for the mp3 player with miniSD card.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Bluetooth and Internet access that really work", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"By His Grace\"", "ReviewID": "R3A79E1DI2ER50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new VX8100 is an upgrade from VX6000's so I skipped a few models while holding out for bluetooth support. I didn't expect the EV-DO, but it is quite a bonus. If you subscribe to those wifi hotspot networks, you can save your money and take your own hotspot with you. Using bluetooth, I don't even take the phone out of my pocket to get my laptop or pda onto the Internet. I use Verizon's National Access (formerly Express Network) which is about 50kbps even in rural areas. The list of metro areas supporting EV-DO is growing fast, and that will get you something like 500kbps even way out into the burbs for the metro areas fortunate enough to have it already.. If you are considering use of your wireless phone to provide Internet access, that appears to be one area where Verizon has an edge over the other major providers, and this phone is broadband ready.Voice communication is also impressive. I had to get used to the old VX6000's frequency response when I first got them. What those, I would often press it to my ear to hear what somebody was saying, but if the person on the other end uttered the right syllable at the right pitch there was this resonant frequency that would send a sharp pain in the ear and down my spine. (No, King Arthur, it isn't the knights who say NEIGHK but maybe something like that.) The VX8100 seems to have the spectrum smoothed out a bit.Voice command of the VX8100 also works well, although I've not used any other phone with voice command features so I've got nothing to compare it with. Using my bluetooth headset (two year old Jabra model) and without taking the phone out of my pocket, I seem to be able to call anyone, check my voice mail, etc., and there is no need to record voice-dial names onto the contacts as the VX6000 required. So far, it has done a great job at guessing how to pronounce the names just by the spelling, and to recognize them when I say them. I haven't given that a thorough workout, but I'm impressed so far.Buying it right when it hit the stores was a risk. I usually would rather read a few of these reviews before buying, and wait until a firmware update or two has gone out just to see how the hold up. So I guess it was my turn to test the water. After one week of a variety of tests and a lot of airtime, I have found it to be more than I expected in some areas, and have found no reason to be disappointed. If you are a Verizon customer and up for a 2-year update, check the verizonwireless website and see what price you can get. Do that first so you can tell them you saw it for xxx, otherwise you get the price with a bag of items that you're better off buying somewhere else. And most worth of mention, you may want to avoid the hands-free headset they provide with that package deal because you may want to consider a Bluetooth headset. You can finally go wireless without the wires!", "Date": "July 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Papa Ski", "ReviewID": "R3T30K2UOB5A9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a little while now thanks to my \"free every two upgrade\" and I love it.  I've almost always had flip phones just because of the durability they usually offer.  Out of all the phones I've had this is the most user friendly phone I have ever seen.  If you know how to press the power button the phone will teach you the rest.I wasn't very impressed with the camera and video functions.  It's useable but not a substitute for a digital camera as they lead you to believe.  I have not had any of the crashing problems that the rest of the users have had.  Maybe I'm just lucky.For me the biggest plus to this phone was its reception.  I live in two places that make reception hell.  My first site is a concrete apartment building on top of a parking garage.  With my old phone I struggled to get 1 bar.  Now I have a full signal all the time.  The second site is 15-20 minutes from the nearest real city with plenty of hills and trees in the way.  Previously, I had no hope of service but now I can actually carry on a conversation and have 1-2 sevice bars.Verizon has definitely improved their product once again.  I would highly recommend this phone.  I can't wait to see what they have available two years from now when I get my next free upgrade.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Paul Krzywicki", "ReviewID": "R2RAL2NTPX4OXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was between this phone and the Motorola e815. I was in the store playing with the two phones, and I decided on this. I'm more than happy with the decision. OK, enough history, my review:Pros:-The menu is very familar. Not saying that the Motorola was bad, just this didn't take getting used to. If you've ever had an LG or Samsung (like myself) than the menu will be second nature.-The phone itself has a solid feel to it. I have a VERY bad habit of dropping cell phones, and I trust this one will stand up to quite a few big drops.-Comes with IM software with AIM on it. It costs text messages, but I have plenty of those to burn up, and seeing as how I text more than I talk, this was pretty important feature. It's nice to beable to do the whole AIM thing, through you're phone.-The speakers are incredible. Although I have no intention of using the MP3 player, I plan on loading this thing with ring tones, and I know they are going to sound amazing on this thing.-The speaker phone is great. Because of the speakers, it's no problem at all to hear the party you're talking to.-The MiniSD slot is great if you do intend on using the MP3 player. I do however question the battery life when using it. Granted, I'm only assuming, but I don't see how that wouldn't drain the battery something fierce.-Camera is 1.3mp. Not something you're going to want to take important pictures with, but it's excellent for those moments when you don't have the digital camera on you, and something cool just needs to be captured.-The bluetooth's range is pretty impressive. I can walk around my house (within reason) and leave the phone in my room, and make calls with just the ear piece. I would guess this also relies on the ear piece though.-I had a Samsung a670 before this, and the Mobile Web was crap on it. Maybe it's just ignorance, but I find this phone's internet very fast.-Although it's stupid and ultimately useless, it's fun being able to read text messages on the outside window. Also, the \"disco\" light on the outside that flashes when you get a call/text, its cool. Some hate it, I like it.and now, the cons:-The Bluetooth is crippled, and I know I sound like a broken record at this point with all the other reviews saying this, but it is a pain. It would be nice to get ring tones and not have to pay $2 a piece for them. Although, this is nothing that the right software can't fix.-While you can hear the party you're talking to find with the speaker phone, you have to hold the phone relativly close to you're face when talking. Which makes me think, why not just go the extra 4 inches, and hold it to you ear. Whatever.-It doesn't bother me, but in a world of nano iPods and Razr cell phones, I can see how people could be taken back by the size and \"bulk\" of the phone. The speakers make the phone look a little heavy at the hinge.So if you're looking for a phone with a decent camera, speaker phone, bluetooth, and just things to impress people with, this is a great choice.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Verizon sabotage this phone by disabling too many features", "Author": "Jason Tu \"Dog Photo Man\"", "ReviewID": "R24QD542HAF5FZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone has many nice features - like the dual LCD screen displays, a nice front MP3 player with front plate control (supposing Verizon did not disable it), loud speaker phone, solid assembly, blue tooth (also disabled greatly by Verizon which disallows you doing file transfers).The biggest problems I experienced with the phone is the lack of the software for you to transfer the phone numbers, customize your ringtones, internet access (if you want to use mobile office kit to access internet, a very weak battery (daily charge is needed), the user interface is also not as intuitive as Motorola 710/720, the font size enlargement only goes half way (only the phone numbers you dial will be enlarged. As a phone for regular use, I find it is light, bright, EV features allowing to access internet/news are great.But to get the phone numbers backup,you have to sign up with Verizon to pay $2/month is really not that appealing. The ring tones customization costs you $2 up per ringtone - I believe you can customize your previous LG phones without these charges.You can get around with the ringtones customization, customized wallpaper through some popular software on the web. However, going throgh this hassle is not something for everyone.Until Verizon makes the phone fully functional by providing all the software, I think that this phone is only worth a 3.0 rating.", "Date": "July 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "Could have been perfect...", "Author": "E. Henson", "ReviewID": "R37ARB8EPM9TYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, the phone looks and feels great.  I love how you can read your text messages without ever opening the phone.  The MP3 player is awesome once you get the version 4 firmware update.  To avoid paying for the expensive ringtones, you can buy a $7 USB cable off ebay and transfer MP3s from your PC.  Ringer volume is nice and loud and MP3s sound great coming out of these speakers.  The screens look great, nice colors and clarity.  You can set the phone up to ring and vibrate and the same time which I love b/c sometimes when I have the phone in my pocket in a loud environment, I can't hear it.  The video recorder is a fun feature though the quality is what you would expect on a cell phone.Some negatives...the speakerphone is nice and loud, but everyone says I sound distorted and they have trouble understanding me.  Also, the earpiece volume doesn't get loud enough.  I have a hard time hearing people in louder enviornments.  The camera does not perfrom well in low light or at nighttime.  The battery life is not the greatest, but I always put mine on the home charger when I go to bed at night anyway, so I'm not sure how long it would really last.So in conclusion...PROS- looks and feels great- miniSD card slot- great MP3 player- excellent speakers, nice and loud- strong vibrate feature- beautiful screen displays- Bluetooth enabled- read text messages without opening phone- good signalCONS- speakerphone sucks for other person- camera is subpar- earpiece volume not loud enoughFor the record, I am very happy with this phone and highly recommend it to others.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Forget the iPod.

I know  Motorola is the Big Dog and all the sheep flock to it but the LG VX8100 is perfect. First off you dont need a mp3 player since this phone has that covered. You can go into the secret menu and enable mp3 without going to verizon. Save your money and dont buy the vcast essintials cd unless you plan on buying music from them. They say you have to use Windows Media Player and thats fine but you can stay with iTunes player as long as you rip your cds into mp3 format. I have the one gig card and can hold about twenty cds at 192kb. I take the card and place it into my computers sd reader and right click and send songs to the sd that way and you dont need usb for that and also can move pics from the card or video to my computer by clicking on my computer and the icon for the sd card. They make a 2 gig but 1 is plenty for me. You can set it up so when you press and hold play on outside of phone it brings up the mp3 player. The earbuds arent the best but I can hear the music while mowing the yard. Also takes good pictures but you sometimes have to add to brightness. You have tip calculater and calander and all that stuff. I like the bluetooth since I can push one button on my ear piece and check messages and call people without opening the phone. Also you dont have to record peoples names since the phone goes by the directory. You push the button and the womans voice says \"please say a comand\" and you say call someone \" please say a name \" pizza hut \"did you say pizza hut\" yes \"calling\" and thats it. Mp3 player is grate and the 15 second videos are ok also but if you buy for camera only then buy a camera or video cam but if you want to take pictures, video, mp3 player and bluetooth then this is your phone. A bit heave and little thicker but have to make room for sd card I guess. Limited and sucky Wallpaper and Sounds and Ringers. Come on LG you can do better although the phone rocks so kudos and you are forgiven. Also Verizon Wireless is great. I was with them for seven years and whent to Suncom with two year contract and with 16 months to go ended the contract with penalty but hey if your mom or dad call and you can here them then that dont cut it. Back with Verizon to stay although they need to work on customer appreciation but hey when your the best I guess thats how it is although they tried to work with me to keep me but Sunom alot cheaper, guess thays why there cheaper and Im back with Verizon.Hope my review helped and maybe you will like it to.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Pretty good, so far.", "Author": "Meels-holio", "ReviewID": "R1LSXVQNMBOMTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I do not use my phone to its full capability since I am not \"tech savvy\", so I don't know how well the bluetooth, mp3 player, V Cast, EV-DO, etc. perform. I have used the camera, and it's easy to use and works well. The size, shape, weight, and overall design and layout (i.e. buttons) of the phone is all great. Back to size, one reviewer commented on the bulkiness of the phone; I often carry a small hobo bag that features a small cell phone pocket, and the phone fits fine in there. Also, if you have big hands, I'm not sure you'd appreciate the fit of the phone in your hand or the contours of the buttons. If you haven't done so already, venture into a Verizon store and test the phone's fit to your hand.The reception through the ear hole is occasionally not ideal, but it's infrequent, and I can easily adjust the volume to the level I want by pressing a button on the side of the phone. The phone manual provided by Verizon is incomplete & crap. Sounds like you need to get the manual from a different source. Oh, the speaker phone is handy, which took me forever to find, as it doesn't seem to be listed in that crap manual. If anyone else is as non \"tech savvy\" as I, you activate the speaker phone by pressing & holding down the CLR button.My husband's got the Motorola E815, so if you're also looking at the Motorola E815, you should know that the E815 seems to get better reception through the ear, and that the design and userability is less \"elegant\" than the LG VX8100. The E815 is possibly more targeted to someone who's more appreciative of functionality and less concerned with aesthetics. The E815 seems a little sturdier and less likely to suffer cosmetically if you're rough with your phone.That's my 2 cents.", "Date": "November 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best cellphone I've ever had", "Author": "Siddhartha Azad \"http://www.ashtophoenix.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3NBAAJDIEKM8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great cellphone.

I have had it for about two months now, and I must say that the bluetooth is totally awesome. Everywhere I go people ask me, \"what kind of phone is that\"? This phone has it all, awesome features, bluetooth, an MP3 player with speakers that fool my friends into thinking someone has switched on the radio, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera with flash built in, a space for a memory card, you name it this phone has it!Reception: I have never had a problem with reception with this phone or ever dropped a call in an area that has more than two bars of service. This phone almost always has 4-5 bars, and it doesn't drop calls! I knew I had to get another LG brand phone because my last one was an older model LG, and I broke it to smithereens on countless occasions and it still worked, so LG knows what they're about when it comes to making great phones!Service: I love Verizon wireless. I used to have Sprint (what a HORRIBLE provider) I have had them for over two years now, and I have never had a problem. The customer service is great, not to mention the best possible network when it comes to reception and never dropping calls!Goodies: A++! THis phone has TONS of cool features and goodies. My personal favorite is the acclaimed bluetooth, which is one of those \"once you have it you don't know how you ever went without\" deals. All I have to do is press a button, give a command and say a name. No voice training, no programming, all you have to do is put the person's name and number in your phone! No more worrying where that stupid headset with the cord is!Sounds/Ringers: The sound on this phone is very clear. So clear in fact that when people hear the \"Truetones\" ringers (with an actual song by an artist), they wonder \"where did you get that phone\" because it sounds as good as a radio! The MP3 speakers make the sound quality blow other phones out of the water! I dowload all my ringers from Get It Now. And Verizon Ringback tones are great too.Camera: The camera in this phone is a real 1.3 megapixel digital camera with flash. It takes really good pictures for what it is, and it is always nice to always have a digital camera on hand at all times!Other features: This phone has a color screen on both the front display and main display, is very nice-looking and sturdy, and it has these cool little lights that light up in different colors when the phone rings. It has a schedule, alarm clock, tip calculator, regular calculator, notepad, world clock, e-mail and of course mobile web and text & pix mesaging.I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone, even though it is one of the pricier models available from VZW, it is WELL worth the cost, and if you are in the market for a new cell phone, bluetooth is definitely the way to go!", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice phone with some annoying flaws", "Author": "alltheusernamesaretaken", "ReviewID": "R2WFTSVRTMPIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*** Updated Jan 26, 2006 to account for v07 firmware update ***If you have an older version of the phone, bring it to a Verizon Wireless store and ask them to update the firmware for you.Basically, the VX8100 (for Verizon) is good phone that's unfortunately held back by a few irritating problems.Camera------Good:The 1.3 megapixel camera takes good pictures as long as there's adequate lighting (otherwise, there'll be a lot of noise in the photo).The camera has a lot of adjustable functions (flash, white balance, color effects, night shooting, etc.).The outside screen can also be used as a viewfinder for taking pictures of yourself, or as a makeshift mirror.Bad:Bad shutter lag.  At the highest resolution, it takes 3-4 seconds to capture an image.  The viewfinder (screen) will appear to take a picture as soon as you press the shutter button, but it actually just freezes the phone while it takes a different picture in the background.  Make sure your subjects stand very still.The camcorder function is limited to 15-second videos, regardless of memory card size.Interface---------Good:For the most part, I like the user interface on this phone.  All the major functions I want are present: the menus are clear, if layered a bit deep; the address book works as expected (multiple #s per entry, per-person ringtones and pictures, groups, up to 99 quick dial numbers); T9 predictive text input is helpful for messaging (but if you do a lot of that, I'd look into the VX9800 instead).Bad:My only real gripe is the lack of customizability for shortcut keys.  You can only customize one button, the down d-pad button, and doing so will replace the caledar.  I'd rather replace the Web Browser, Get It Now, or any of the other buttons that I don't use, but the phone won't allow me to.Applications------------Good:The phone comes with several useful applications/utilities, including a web browser, calendar, an alarm clock, a world clock, a notepad, a calculator, and a tip calculator.Bad:Third-party applications are limited to Verizon programs from GetItNow, as is apparently the case with all Verizon phones.  This means that if you want more functionality out of your phone, you're going to have to pay for it.Data/internet access--------------------Good:EV-DO support means fast connections to the web.  Streaming video (V-Cast) works as expected, and the $15 package includes unlimited web browsing.Bad:The web browser just plain sucks.  There is no way to directly bookmark a page -- or, for that matter, go directly to a URL -- without first going to a special Verizon page.  This means you have to memorize or write down the address you want to go to, navigate to the special Verizon page, and then manually re-enter the address.  I have no idea why they designed it this way, but it's so unuseable that it made me cancel my mobile web service.Sound-----Good:As of firmware version v07, the phone supports V-Cast music downloads.  They can either be downloaded on the phone directly ($1.99 per song) or purchased on a PC and then transferred over a USB cable (99 cents per song).  You must have an active V-Cast plan to download songs on the phone.Sound quality is okay on the speakerphone, but you'd probably want to get a stereo headset if you want to do any real listening.The phone has an equalizer function with settings for Pop, Rock, 3D surround and more.The version 7 firmware mysteriously disables the phone's original MP3 playback capability, but this can be easily restored by entering a hidden menu:  Push the \"Menu\" button and then enter 000000 when asked for the service code.  Go to item #11 and enable MP3 playback.  Now the phone will be able to play MP3s and WMAs from the memory card again.Bad:Playlists are only supported for V-Cast downloads, not songs on the memory card.The song title is not displayed on the front screen, only the inside.  The front screen displays the current equalizer setting and also a huge and worthless visualization animation.Earlier versions of the phone had a problem with headset volume, but this was fixed with version 7 firmware.  You may need to update your phone if you encounter this problem.The speakerphone quality isn't great.  It works, but sounds bad at louder levels.  I'm not sure how well it'd work with music (but you could always buy special stereo headphones for the phone).Voice Dialing, Voice Command, Text to Speech--------------------------------------------Good:The phone uses an actual speech recognition engine, meaning you can theoretically dial any name or speak any command without prior training.  This works... somewhat.  75% of the time, the phone would do just what I told it to do.Voice command allows you to do more than just dial people in your address book.  You call any telephone number (if you say the numbers clearly enough); check your voicemail; have your missed calls listed; check your text messages; and have the current time and date spoken to you.The \"Announce Alert\" feature will speak out loud, using the phone's text-to-speech capability, whenever a call or message arrives, e.g. \"Incoming call from Bob\" or \"Incoming message from 123-123-1234\".  I personally like this feature, but if you find it annoying, you can turn it off.Bad:Speech recognition is a double-edged sword.  With that many more possible voice commands, 25% of the time the phone will simply get it wrong, especially in noisy environments.A more serious issue is the voice interface itself:  Instead of allowing you to dial a name with just one button push, you have to navigate through the whole menu system every time.  It's like having to talk to those voice menu systems you sometimes get when calling a company.  The procedure goes something like this:Phone: Please say a command.Me: Call someone.Phone; Please say a name.Me: Bob.Phone: Did you say, \"Rob\"?Me: No.Phone: Please say a name.\"Me: Bob.Phone: Did you say, \"Bob\"?Me. Yes.Phone: Call mobile?Me: No.Phone: Call home?Me: No.Phone: Call work?Me: Yes.Phone: Calling.I'd have much preferred being able to just say \"Bob\", even if I had to first train the phone.Conclusion----------In summary, the phone seems to be a great gadget crippled by flawed software.  If you can live with the annoyances, you may like the phone for its abundance of features.  Personally, I just wish LG and Verizon did more testing and bugfixing before releasing this phone.

I was sick of being tethered to my e-mail all of the time and decided to become a normal, picture-taking, phone-flipping, ringtone-changing American.So far, I've been impressed.  Pictures are easy to take and good for a cell phone.  Same with videos.  Messaging is easy, which can include pics and videos if I want.  I bought a $5 cable and now I can export songs, contacts, etc directly from my computer using a USB cable.One thing I liked about my Blackberry and didn't want to give up was that I could send little reminder e-mails to myself.  On this phone, in two clicks I can be recording a voice memo that's at least as effective.The phone plays MP3s, and while I think that's been disabled by Verizon somehow in anticipation of their own service being rolled out, I'm confident I'll be able to get some MP3s on there soon.What else?  Verizon reception in Chicago seems just OK to me on this phone, which is why I subtracted a star.  Battery life seems to be at least what they claim.  VCast at $15/mo is expensive and probably not worth it in the long run, but it's a neat toy and I'm enjoying it (8 minute Jon Stewart interviews!).

Therefore, I spent A LOT of time searching and comparing, then re-searching and re-comparing. The debate was between this phone and the E815. My final conclusion was that, though both have had reported problems and benefits, the problems with the E815 worried me much more than the problems with the 8100. So I went with the 8100 and after 3 months, I see nothing to make me think I made the wrong choice. The phone is sturdy and the layout is logical. Whether it is the phone or verizon, my signal and voice quality is vastly improved from my old provider, and I've been told I sound like I'm on a land line. The phone is also very handy: I use the picture and camcorder all the time, with very good results.A word of caution: I have seen several people complain about things that are due only to their own stupidity or inability to look at the big picture. (For example, several people couldn't figure out how to work some aspect, where it was child's play to most people.) Several other complaints are complaints against Verizon in general and may apply to any phone you get with them. (I'm thinking bluetooth here.) Several others would complain about sound or signal strenth, when this is largely due to other factors like location and carrier. I have had no problems with sound quality. Just be careful when listening to complaints.Lastly, as with any technology lately, whatever you want this phone to do, it can most likely do, and there are plenty of people out there willing to help you do it. For example, there is plenty of advice out there on how to get MP3's on your phone faster/easier.

My primary reason for buying it was the bluetooth capability, and the phone delivers on that front. It pairs easily with my Jabra BT250v headset (it also works with the wired headsets I have laying around, despite the stereo-capable headset jack). With some tinkering I was even able to use it to connect my laptop to the internet using a USB bluetooth adapter.The phone delivers on other fronts as well. It has survived a couple of drops (which is par for the course with my phones) and the charge lasts long enough that I am never surprised by a sudden dead battery. Voice recognition requires no training, and the name announcement, while definitely synthesized, is at least recognizable.I do have a few reasons for withholding a perfect rating (note that I haven't upgraded my software at all, so some of these may no longer apply). The reception on the phone is not as good as it was on my Motorola v120e. The echo cancellation could use some work, especially in speakerphone mode. I have to go through several layers of menus to play my games. There is an annoying delay between when I press the capture button and when the camera actually takes a picture. The voice recognition engine has a problem understanding the word \"Yes\". And while the handset volume has never been a problem for me, it takes a little practice to figure out where to hold the speaker to your ear--it's not easy to do by feel, and improper placement will drastically reduce the effective volume.If I had the decision to make over again, I would definitely still buy this phone.

I have used it on other phones and I do enjoy so having it available is a plus.My only concerns are the supposed mp3 player that is not active.

Original specs stated the phone had 512 MB but I'm not seeing anything near that much available at the moment.

I use the mp3 function on my walks or when I'm on vacation for music in the room.  I bought a 1G miniSD card (here) through Amazon with the companion USB mobile flash reader to transfer Mp3 files from my computer to the phone.  Simple.

I was dissatisfied with the LG8100 for several reasons. First, in my house I use to have full signal strength with my older model LG4400. With the new LG8100 the signal strength would bounce between 2 and 3 bars. If the other party was talking and the signal bounced back and forth (which was frequent) their speech would break up. Also, several people complained that I sounded muted on the LG8100 and would ask that I call back from my home phone. Also in other locations where I use to have good signal strength I had no signal with the LG8100.The volume on the LG8100 does not go high enough either. When in the car or a location with a little background noise it is very difficult to hear the other party even with the volume on the highest setting.I also didn't like the design of the phone. When the phone is flipped open you will notice that there is a large gap between the speakers and the hinges stick out far. If you hold the phone too close to your face I found the hard plastic hinges were uncomfortable against my face.I now have the Motorola E815 and love it! Reception is excellent! Single strength has always been high and I even have a good signal when in remote locations. Friends are also glad I got a different phone because they say I now sound clear and normal again.The volume on the E815 is also much better. On the highest setting in the car or in restaurants I can clearly hear callers.Many people complain that the E815 is large. But I think the design is much better than the LG8100.

The camera is great and has a \"flash,\" which is more or less a flashlight. The zoom feature on the photo mode only works on lower resolution (it is digital not an actual zoom, it just essentially crops your photo). Verizon actually lets you save pictures to the memory card, so they are easy to remove. The built in memory is higher than on most phones, but it fills quick (32 mb unformated). The built in memory can hold about four pictures and 11 songs at 64 kbps wma. Mac users (like me) beware, music syncing will not work nor will address book syncing (bluetooth sees it but wont connect). I have access to a pc so I can sync if needed. The phone is well built and sturdy, and is an awesome upgrade from a motorola v265. Also, keep in mind the phone uses a 2.5\" jack and not the standard 3.5\" jack, so your normal headphones will not work without an adaptor. The front button do work for playback, so ignore older reviews (older verzion software made the front buttons just for show, they had no use). To elbaborate on music playback (since this is the major draw of this phone)... music storage can be extended with a memory card (I went to newegg.com, got a 512 shipped for about 22), you must use Windows Media Player 10 and can only use wma (xp only, you can get mp3 playback by reverting to older phone software, but you must demand it) you can startup music playback without opening the phone, just hold down the middle play button. The music organization is poor compared to an iPod or other DAP, if you do not open the phone, it just plays it in order, everytime. If you open the phone while the music is playing, there is about a one or two second period in which the music will stop and restart. The music interface on the large display is not common... it does not use the usual hierarchical interface making it difficult and cumbersome. I have not used VCast music, at 15 a month plus I believe 1.99 a song, you spend more money on one song as you would on buying a conventional CD, so I cannot comment on download speeds or playback. Verzion's headphones are good enough and feature a mic so you can use them as a \"hands free set\"... I ended up buying their music pack which comes with the drivers, usb cable and headphones. Beware, Verzion says using a third party usb cable will void the warranty (Verzion in my experience has poor customer service and rips you off at any chance (20 dollars to bring put a number on a new phone)). Syncing with the Verizon cable is fast (usb 2.0). Do not make my mistake... I thought it would sync by making a sync list in wmp and then connecting it, Wrong. You must go to menu> get it now> get tunes and tones> sync music. Verzion and microsoft should take a page from apple... if you plug your phone in your computer your probably want to sync, you shouldn't have to go through three or four submenus. I have not used address book syncing through outlook, but trying to do it on my mac, there are just as many submenus. Video capture is limited to 15 seconds on this phone. The internal screen is fairly large compared to most phones, and very bright. I can actually see it on bright Arizona days, compared to by old moto, which would be  a blur. All in all, if you are looking for a solid phone that is featured pack pick this up.

Unless you *really* need a full keyboard, this phone should take care of your needs.  Here's a breakdown by function:Call Quality - my wife was coming from a Samsung SCH-A630, and the difference is substantial.  The calls are very clear on both ends, and it has a good speakerphone too.Text Messaging - this phone has T9 for predictive text entry.  For the occasional text message user, this is more than sufficient.  If you are a pay as you go rather than having a text bundle, this phone will meet your needs.  It is nice to be able to set a callback number and have it sent automatically with your messages.Bluetooth - here's another strong feature on this phone.  While it doesn't support the full bluetooth profiles, no phone from Verizon does.  That's a trade off that you make for using \"The Network\", and in my opinion, it's worth it.  We paired the phone with our PC at home and made a backup of her phonebook using DataPilot - this will save you $10 the next time you change phones.  We also paired it with a Motorola HS850(see my review) which has worked consistently with all of the bluetooth phones I've used.  It supports voice commands and automatic call transfer - if you set the \"auto answer\" option in Tools -> Call Settings.Mobile Web 2.0 - this works pretty well.  The T9 function works in the Openwave browser so unless you are entering proper names, this is sufficient.  The EV-DO speed is great.  The resolution is not as good as on the 9800, but the 256k color screen still does a nice job.V-Cast - the videos look great, and the stereo speakers make for a nice experience. They could stand to add some more content, but it's not bad for $15/mo. The bonus that you get with V-Cast is that you don't get charged for minute usage on Mobile Web - a big bonus indeed!Music - this has changed recently with the V-Cast Music.  You can no longer use MP3 files like you could on older models.  We don't use our phones as music players so this doesn't really matter to us.Ringtones - typical weak selection from the LG line of phones.

Luckily, I'm not a Mac user (nobody from Verizon ever mentioned or asked about this), because then I would be screwed. However, while I am a Windows user, I've been avoiding upgrading to Media Player 10 because it has downright invasive DRM moniotring/managing abilities (Google for \"Digital Rights Management\" if you don't know what I'm talking about.)

I got it to replace a basic Nokia non-camera, non-flip phone whose keypad went bad after about three years, and all I wanted was a new basic Nokia phone but the family decided to switch to Verizon at this time and I ended up with this monstrosity. Immediately I noticed that the reception was worse and it dropped phone calls about ten times more often as my old Nokia, but I guess thats the risk you run switching service providers; I apparently live, work, go to school, shop for groceries, hang out, etc. next to Cingular antennas. Besides the poor reception, its just a poorly designed phone altogether. For instance, my old Nokia had an elegant, well implemented, and most importantly, quiet vibrate function, but on the LG the buzzer is louder than the actual ringer in many instances; its not the least bit discreet if an entire lecture hall can hear my phone vibrating away in my pocket so its useless to me. The keypad is illuminated with a very deep blue, which while very attractive, is the hardest color for the human eye to resolve so its actually fairly difficult to see in the dark. The phone is laden with all kinds of useless gimmicks which seem to distract most people from its shortcomings. I remark to my family that the reception is poor and they respond, dont you love the camera? Well no since I have a 4 megapixel digital camera that I use to take pictures. Its awkward to answer calls/adjust the volume/continually have to flip/unflip/reflip, etc....Isn't the MP3 player great? No, thats why I have an ipod. Its a terrible phone....Have you gone on the internet with it yet? (no, I spend enough of my day on the internet).

Often this list doesn't even include the actual person you were trying to call in the first place. If you finally do get to the right name, and can understand the computer-mushmouth, here is how it goes:You say \"Yes\"The phone says nothing for 10 seconds and then goes \"Blooooooooooooooooop\" really loud in your ear, then waits a little longer and repeats \"Did you say 'mlllmmm?\"This can be repeated indefinitely while you try several variations of the word \"Yes\".

Hey, I tolarated their bad customer services for almost a decade.  After some research, I decided to get the VX8100 and Verizon.  On paper sounded fantastic, also the reviewers seemed to be very careful not to trash any bad features on any phone.  Well this was one of those phones.First, I will let everyone know that this phones has pretty slick gimmicks.  Camera, voice recording, MP3 player, records mini movies, plays pre recorded movies, can download games and other non-phone type stuff.  And the part were Verizon makes money not providong any phone service works perfectly.Now about the phone, as a phone this phone is just OK.The speaker phone is half way decent (once you find out on the web how to use it since Verizon payed someone to write over 20 pages on the VCAST stuff but not one line in how to activate the speaker phone (shows what is important to them).You can only program 1 shortcut key which removes the calendar.Although you can access VCAST news in one click, it takes some navigating find out missed calls.The text typing using T9 sucks big time as it has problem if you switch in mid word example you want to type daddy smith well that is 3-2-3-3-9 (oh but I had the t9 off lets turn it on) well you have to start all over again because the stupid phone does not know that you type dadd already, my other phones never had such problems.  Also I could save the prefer state of input.  So if I like typing in T9 I it would be the default, not in the VX8100 you better like having the standard Abc as a default.oice recognition is so-so, but lacks of many commands and choices.  There are hundred of things that could be done and are not.  For one would it be nioce if it told you which phone is dialing before it does let say is asking if you want to dial jimmy at work.  The current choices are yes or no, it would be nice if it had a third that you can say maybe and it just tells the number.  Heck, I could suggest hundred of improvements to the thing that would make it a better PHONE.I could go on about the mediocre phone capabilities but I imagine that most people that are looking at this phone are the ones that most likely waste some money getting ringers, pix, wallpaper, and games, sending and receiveing text messages, pix, and videos.  For those people, I recommend to buy extra batteries as you never know when you may get a CALL and you need to use you PHONE and it may be dead from all the non-phone activity.If you are looking for a phone with lots of gimmicks this may be your phone.  If you actually need a GOOD phone and careless about the gimmicks you may want to look for another as this phone as a phone is not that good try a phone that is designed to eb the best phone out there (not an MP3 player, camera, video, web browser).As for me I most likely be returning it as I need a very good phone that is a good phone not an entertainment center eats money.", "Date": "December 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Audio and Video go out of sync, Reboot upon REWIND", "Author": "Harikishan Desineni \"harik\"", "ReviewID": "RLDXKCOQBDACH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UI look and feel is very good.

Everything from the way it feels in the hand to the way it feels when you open it to trying to find a number.  This phone is the perfect example of bad design.  Everytime I go to use it I find myself frustrated.I chose verizon for it's reliable service but the phones they choose are such junk.-the reception is the worst of the three verizon phones I've had.-it's ugly-it doesn't feel good to hold.-it's heavy-it feels like a heavy piece of junk-it's not pleasing to open.-the menu layout is very unintuitive-it's got something like eight logos on the case.", "Date": "September 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Telling from the reviews, really really cool!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RXCXOJAJIYVXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read into this and by the reviews, facts, and details it sounds like the phone that I want to get!!
