There's no zoom on the camera, it couldn't send or receive pictures even though it says it could, the phone is made as if it's made for a left handed person, the only part of this thing that is actually touch sensitive is the dial pad, which must be activated by pressing a button, when typing a message out the phone will actually get slower and slower as the message gets longer which will screw up your typing, if you start typing fast, the keys that also act as arrows will act as if you had hit them as arrows, so they will move the position of where you are typing back up into your message above, so you'll start typing the rest of your message out in the middle of an above sentence, which screws the message up, and can often be done without noticing at first. The phone is very slow otherwise, has an absolutely retarded system of picture keeping and editing, there's NO zoom at all on the camera, to make a picture your background, you have to take multiple pictures of what you want if you want it to be something different than the default ones on the phone already, the back plate on the phone that keeps the battery in only locks firmly in place at one point, and if dropped, the battery can pop out and the back might stay on completely, making it so you don't notice the battery popping out, which would lead to losing the battery like my idiot self did.

I had hoped to be able to resell it at that point, or maybe give it to family member who didn't have a smartphone yet. It worked well for maybe 3 months.The phone FEELS well built. It's small, compact, and you get the feeling it would survive a fall very well, although I never had the 'opportunity' to test that. Having a full keyboard is nice, although the keys feel a bit weird. You have to press down on them a little harder than you would think, and some of the button placements are a little weird, which lead to a lot of prematurely sent messages while I was first get used to it. Compared to the keyboard of the Samsung Glide, which is the phone that I replaced this one with, it felt awkward, although one could probably get used to it within a week or two.The interface is nice, and using a touch keypad for dialing was a nice bit of functionality as well. I do kind of wish they had expanded the touch functionality for other things however, maybe for some games, but it wasn't too big of a deal.However, all of this was rendered moot once this phone decided to have problems calling people. More often than not, I would be unable to have a conversation with anyone. I would try to call someone, but then I would be unable to hear anything coming through. People could hear me, apparently, but all they heard was me asking \"Hello?\" over and over again, trying to tell if it was working or not. I soon learned that if I couldn't hear the phone ringing within the first 5 seconds of calling, I would have to hang up and try again. Once I could hear their phone ringing, I would stay on, assured that I would be able to hear the other person, assuming they would answer. Oddly enough, I don't recall having this problem when someone called me, only the other way around.Luckily my phone only started having problems just before I was eligible for an upgrade from my carrier. I don't really regret getting this phone, but I certainly wouldn't get it again.

Was it a rare occurrence?  I don't know if they're that cheaply made or I just got unlucky.  I can't tell you.  My refund was very quick and pain free through Amazon, though.I bought this as I still have a problem buying $200+ android devices.  It seems the more expensive the phone is, the quicker you will wash it in your jean's pockets and destroy it, drop it, loose it, or otherwise destroy and mangle it.Let's see, it's not an android.  The keyboard is extremely hard to get used to.  It *is* a touchscreen but you can only use the touchscreen for very specific functions.  I've had this phone for about 3 weeks now and I am just now figuring out how to send text messages without sliding the keyboard out, typing, sliding it back in, and pressing send.  The buttons and interface are extremely vague.  I guess you DO need to probably read the manual on this, it's just not obvious how even the simplest of tasks are performed.Another super \"awesome\" feature that the programmers and engineers decided to throw into this phone, if your battery is even somewhat low, it completely removes your ability to send text messages.  Thanks LG Engineers, it was sort of critical I send a text message, but your engineers sure did know better that I shouldn't do that for no obvious reason!  Yes, no kidding, if the battery becomes within 2-3 hours of going completely dead, it will not allow you to open the text messaging \"application\".  Or the \"contacts\" application.  So you're left with dialing numbers by memory.Reception?  Well it gets no better reception than any other phone I've used, but possibly worse.Camera? You can take pictures, but what do you expect?  It's not great, but I didn't expect it to be great.The overall usage is very fumbly.  Like I said, I've had it for I believe 3 weeks now, and I still struggle with the even most basic features and tasks.  Send a message?  Let me go through 15 menu's trying to find it.  Who was the last missed call?  3 minutes later, I might have it right.The overall construction is fairly sturdy, except the back that holds the battery in.  It's a piece of plastic about as thin as 4 sheets of paper and every time you drop the phone, even gently onto carpet, the phone will explode into the phone-battery-back-piece combo requiring a quick reassembly.One more annoyance, YES it's one of those annoying phones where you can hang up on people repeatedly by pressing the \"hang up\" button with your cheek.  It's not as awful as some, but I've done it twice in 3 weeks.I was pretty hard on the phone, but for roughly $40, can you REALLY complain?
