{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Excellent Phone", "Author": "S. Terry \"skull\"", "ReviewID": "R2RT0D3DZW01A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent phone but watch out for the build quality.I originally ordered one in mid-October as I was about to leave on an international trip and Verizons Intl roaming rates are ridiculous.  It worked out well a $7 SIM from Claro plus some airtime at 5 cents per minute in country and about 50 cents per minute to USA, no data,  but used the Wi-Fi at the hotel which worked great with this phone.I received it and was very pleased, here is what was most remarkable:1.  The large Super AmoLED display is awesome, blacks are truly black, video looks great, text is very readable, and it does not wash out in sunlight although it is tougher to see and read than in normal light.  I compared it under the same conditions to my iPod Touch 4,  I could not see anything in bright sunlight with the iPod where on this phone when taking a picture I could see the subject well enough.  The display alone alone is reason to buy this phone over other unlocked phones.  You have to go to high end Samsung at >$600 to get this same feature.2.  The Wi-Fi range is excellent and the Wireless signal quality seems quite good.  Tried it with both AT&T; and Claro.3.  Has Android 4.0 which has many more features than Android 2.X which many inexpensive Android phones are still based on.  The web browser with Android 4.0 is much better than the one with Android 2.X.4.  All the misc sensors seem to work well, the accelerometer, the compass, the GPS, and the camera takes excellent picture and video although a bit noisy when it is a dark scene which is common for phone cameras.  Did have a problem here though see below.5.  Fast enough CPU.  It seems responsive in all apps I tried including 3D games.6. Is lightweight and just the right size so you can feel comfortable carrying it in your pocket all day.I did have two problems though with my first unit first the battery seemed to drain quickly and if I took a photo that needed the built-in flash the unit just shutdown.  After this shutdown I had to remove the battery to get it operating again.  This repeated the next time I took a flash photo a few days later while away and this time it was even harder to get back up.  Following this it would just shutdown for no obvious reason every few hours.  Tried full battery charge, airplane mode, etc and still problematic.  After returning from my trip I RMA'ed it as defective and quickly got the same model from Amazon.So far so good it is working great.  I can take flash photos with no problems and the battery drain appears nominal.As far as what you should expect for battery life with both a Wi-Fi signal and a wireless signal it drains the battery in about 2 days even if you only use it minimally.  To extend this disable one or the other radio except when needed and you will probably get 3-4 days.  Using the phone for light activity seems to draw the battery at about 10% per hour.  Talking is about the same.  Playing a 3D game draws the battery at about 20% per hour.  I am not sure if these numbers are good or bad it seems like everyone I know is charging there smart phones daily and this unit is no exception.Most people would remove a star or two for the problem I experienced with the initial phone but as an engineer I am aware that ALL electronic devices are subject to what is known as early failures, typically in the first few days of operation.  This occurs at a rate of 1-5% depending on component and build quality.  Used to be electronics were burned it at the manufacturer but no more it just costs too much to do even for the big (expensive) players.  The phone like most is made in China but to the specs of Blu (supposedly an American company based in Miami) so I think they should work on component and or build quality even if it raises the price by $20.Before I bought the phone I read the other reviews which were also generally positive.  The one reviewer mentioned a continuous repetitive background sound when using headphones, good sound was important to me as I use it as a music player also.  Soon after getting it I tried it with three sets of headphones and no such issue.  Again being an engineer this is typically caused by a bad capacitor in the audio output section allowing internal electrical noise to come though.  To the other reviewer who had this problem just RMA the phone and get a new one.  It is another example of a build quality issue and is not endemic of the phones design.So BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A GREAT PHONE for the price.  If you purchase this phone though try out all the device features, camera with flash, other sensors, and try it with headphones as soon as you get it and if anything does not work right or causes a shutdown or other issues just RMA it and hopefully the next one will be fine.  This is a nice advantage of using Amazon they do not give you hassles about returns or try to convince you a problem is not really a problem.  This is particularly important in light of other reviewers (no personal experience) reporting that Blu has poor customer support.  Hopefully they will improve this.BTW: There is no form fit case at this time for the phone.  To protect it I bought a small thin lightly padded camera case at Sears that fit it well.  Other small camera cases may also work but you have to try them so it makes it hard to order one online, like Shoes.  This case is less convenient as when I get a call as it takes 10 seconds to get it out of the case but is better than nothing.  Hopefully Blu will work with a case vendor or two to create a form fit case in the coming weeks and post on there web site the make and model of the case options.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get yourself a Blu Vivo RIGHT NOW !!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1U8BR7TMSNBLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, many things have been told abour Blu products, however after a LONG wait I've recieved my Vivo 4.3.I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SII, great phone, very useful, but due to business (I travel around the world very often) it's very important to me to have a dual simm phone for not to carry two phones.I looked for chinesse dual simm phones, but the most of them are cr@p, very cheap, but very low quality.Then I looked for a \"branded\" dual simm phone, and I found a Galaxy Y DUOS, good as all the samsung phones, however I needed more \"power\" in processor and a bigger screen, I use a lot the GPS and the screen and the processor of the Galaxy Y DUOS were a little \"awful\". I also use the phone for watching videos while traveling and the 240 x 320 pixels, 3.14 inches screen didn't help a lot.I found Blu company in one travel to Miami, I looked to their phones and I was about to buy the Blu Studio 5.3 but the reviews stoped me from doing that, the processor wasn't good and the screen resolution was not what you would spect from such a big phone.Then I read about the Vivo 4.3 specifications, and I really wanted to have one of them because the super amoled 4.3 480x800 screen, and the 1GHZ dual core processor.I recieved mine two weeks ago, and I'm really really happy with it, when unpacked is about the same size of the Samsung Galaxy SII, but lighter even with the battery installed, when turned on the screen responds fast and run the most of the apps almost inmediatly.I installed a 32 Gbytes micro SD and the phone went to its full potential.I downloaded Waze social navigator and NDrive GPS app and tested both, the response is FAST, just the way it should be when you are driving.Simm 1 carries the 3G, Simm 2 carries 2G only, so when I'm in my country (Mexico) my first simm is the local carrier (Telcel) when I'm abroad I switch the simm for the local carrier, I was in USA last week and used a H20 simm card for data and voice and worked as spected.Next week I'll go to Europe and I will try it with Movistar in Spain and Orange in France, I will let you know how it goes.What I didn't like was the horrible start screen, and the theme that Blu is using in the interface, I found it very anoying. However I installed SPB Mobile Shell and the experience was much much better.I'm strugling with the phone ring tones, but I'm sure I will find how to change them soon.I'm happy with the phone, so far I haven't found any thing that dislike me.My advice..... because of the price and the performance.... get your Vivo 4.3, you will not regret.,", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blu WIll not stand by warranty in products sold on AMAZON", "Author": "oxexpat_in_la", "ReviewID": "R36A3OPQDFAV27", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please please the letter below regarding issues I had with a 4 month old warranted but failed BLU phoneGood Afternoon,Thank you for contacting BLU Products.

Ok, the battery life is not great, but if you are looking for that in a phone, you probably should go with the new razors.  Another thing is that I can't find accessories to fit this phone.  I have searched Amazon and also called the company that delivered the phone and they said that they don't deal with accessories.  I was hoping to get another battery since the life on this one is not great but what are you going to do?  The battery for me lasts all day, but I'm not streaming or checking facebook a million times a day.  The battery life can be extended by having the auto brightness enabled.  The phone is responsive and works well with the StraightTalk plan I purchased.  I did have to tweak the internet settings to get picture messaging to work but after that no problems.  This phone is good for a general phone user, not one who is a electronic genius.  I am not worried about the UI or putting code into the phone or rooting it.  I browse the internet, make calls, and texts and I have had no problems with that when I got everything set up for my phone account.BOTTOM LINE:IF you are a general user you will like the phone and what is has to offer for the price.IF you are a tech savy person, you will have a new phone in 3 weeks anyway so don't bother getting this one.Great phone for the price and like it alot except for the the two things I mentioned earlier.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect dual-SIM", "Author": "Dave BH", "ReviewID": "R2HNBM0XPTL7YU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I often need dual-SIM for travels and it saves me from carrying two phones around.Before this model, dual-SIMs were only quite simplified phones with budget specs, but here we see implementation of two SIMs working simultaneously plus iPhone level of functionality. Actually, I planned to buy dual Sims phone + iPhone 5, but surprisingly found that is not necessary.Android platform is mature already and hardware of Blu works as expected. All necessary software for practical life (text and excel editors) is there, lot of applications are available online (and free of charge). I've spent 1000 $ for iPad applications and can't see real advantages of that over similar applications on Android. As always, some specialized software might be better on other platform, but I don't use smartphone for that.This is a hell lot of smartphone packed in black elegant exterior and don't worry, it is not inferior product, I'm happy to put it against any competitor.Finally, something I've searched for years and it would be excellent buy even at double price.Verdict: must have for people who don't accept compromise and don't buy into marketing hypes (I'm satisfied to be in non iPhone campus at moment).", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone and works perfect on Straight Talk.....", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R26OCLZ3JVSII7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this phone and so far so great........I am using it on Straight Talk (it uses the normal size SIM card) and all I did was snap in my SIM card and it worked great....I just had to change a few settings on the internet menu (which is explained on the Start Talk site) and presto!  Works great.Many features, the only thing I wish it had was an LED indicator to flash when there was a missed call, email or text.....and I did download the free \"Juice Defender\" battery saver program which works great.....it basically shuts down all un-needed apps when the screen goes out....thus saving the battery life. The AMOLED screen is FANTASTIC and rivals the Samsung S-3.Any full-screen Android phone is going to be battery hungry, but since this one is a 3-G model and has the Juice Defender program installed, it seems to be holding a charge well, even with moderate use. I think it's a good deal for the $$$.**Now that I have had this phone for a while, I have to say I am VERY happy with it.

It is sophisticated, having some very desirable features.  The Android 4.0 is a big improvement.  The pull down controls are super handy.  It allows for some quick changes like turning on/off wifi, data, screen brightness, rotation and some others.  I like that a lot.  The large screen is bright, clear and sharp.  Touch response is excellent.  Buttons controls are solid and the camera is excellent.The down side.Sound jack: Does not work with any quality headphones.  The sound is tinny and distant. Use a low end stereo headset without mic and it sounds fine.  Also, the primary reason for me to switch from a dumb phone to smart was the use of the Square card reader.  Total disappointment because it will not work.  My readers, both, will work on my iPad.Set up.  Being not tied to any carrier, the data/mms setting were all wrong.  When I first plugged my sim card in, phone worked but no data, no mms.  Searched online for APN setting and it took a little while to find the correct ones.  (Don't bother asking AT&T; for help, they either don't know or they're playing dumb.Ending on a happy note: The simple tethering/mobile wifi setup.  No need to pay for high end data plans that's required for tethering.  I use a minimum prepaid plan for data and I am able to tether my iPad to my phone.  Nice!It's worth it.

I am a previous blackberry owner, but I don't think I ever want to own a Blackberry again after having such a great phone, even my friends who owns samsung s2 were really impressed, even though it probably does not cut close, which means Blu is finally doing something good, wish they will upgrade this phone to Jelly bean....

The phone is great for a phone with some smartphone capabilities, but as a smartphone, it has some annoyances.Firstly, the system doesn't use a stock ICS interface, but rather uses the GO Launcher with a Blu Theme. Not too much of a problem, except the lock screen.  (I have a Galaxy Nexus and the lock screen displays the time and date.)  On this phone, the time and date are relegated to the obnoxious wallpaper.  The image you see is the  WP Clock Live wallpaper (check out your favorite app store to try it out).  If you change the wallpaper, you lose the clock on the lockscreen.  The wallpaper is obnoxious because it's so bold and takes up HALF of the icon real estate on ALL of the screens.  I couldn't find a way to rectify the situation.  I use my phone for a clock too (in lieu of wearing a watch) - it's a bit of an annoyance but limits the customization of the interface which Android is known for being better than the competition.A slight nuisance is also that the system comes pre-installed with Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp.  There is no way to uninstall it. I don't use any of those apps (a G+ person) and the Play Store notifies me (at least every day if not more) that there are updates for Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp.The audio on the speaker out is pretty decent, but plug in the headphones and things sound horrible.  For some reason, the audio sounds very distant and echoey with the headphones.  On top of that, there is a recurrent pulsing that occurs in the headset, you can hear it during music or listening to nothing.  Not sure if there is some crosstalk occurring with the internal hardware, but it drives me nuts to the point where I cant use the headphones.For the price, you get a decent dual SIM phone.  It seems really light in one's hand and the battery seems to drain faster than my other dual SIM GSM phone, I'm not too sure what's happening there.  The 4GB of storage are on the pre-installed micro SD card, so if you want more memory you'll have to replace that card.Anyway, caveat emptor.  It's an okay phone, but it's not going to be on par with the quality you'd expect like a Nexus, a Galaxy S, or HTC One type phone.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for TMOBILE", "Author": "Venkataharish Kotta", "ReviewID": "RGYN33P7ZC299", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It does not work on T-Mobile 3g.

It seems fairly well built, fast, and the screen is great. However ... I was pretty disappointed to find out, that it only has 1GB of internal memory, and not 4GB as advertised.

Impressive specifications and a huge step up from the non-smartphones we are used to.  We are using it on a T-mobile voice/text plan and will probably not exploit many of the features that ICS has up it sleeves. Not big on music, so can't confirm the issues mentioned in one of the other reviews.The screen is very nice, camera works well for both stills and video (nice to have the LED flash).  Wifi worked very well - no hanging - even when pulling up videos.A couple of disappointments that hopefully can be sorted out.  First, the microphone volume is quite low - making it difficult for someone on the other end of the call to hear the entire conversation.  And I know it is early yet, but the battery life doesn't seem that it will come anywhere close to the standby time that was represented.  There is a nice feature with ICS that allows you to turn the phone off and on again - such as when you are sleeping so that you can save some battery.Give 4 Stars right now - we'll see if it sticks after some more time with the phone.Nov 9th UpdateBattery life with light use is a few days when implemented battery saving strategies that turn off wifi when not in use, automatic screen brightness, etc. - definitely acceptable.Mic volume has not been resolved.

On the plus side the screen display is AWESOME.  The picture is bright and the colors are crisp and clear.  It takes great pictures outside, but like most phone cameras, is poor in low light conditions.  The size and thickness of the phone are great.However, there are some low points.  When I first got the phone, it wouldn't text pictures to others (MMS).  I played with the APN settings, had AT&T; play with the APN settings, then contacted BLU support.  They eventually had me reset the phone to factory settings and install a new version of Android on the phone.  The install went fine, but the APN settings were now worse and I couldn't get ANY data.  AT&T; was no help (can't blame them since I didn't get the phone from them).  BLU support was zero help on this.  I had to search quite a few forums on the internet to find APN settings that completely worked.  I probably had about 7-8 hours into solving this problem.  Also, as others have mentioned, the battery life stinks.  One day is all you are going to get out of the phone, even with a good app killer.  One really odd problem I have is feedback.  When I use the phone to actually to talk to someone I hear an echo of my own voice.  It's annoying.  Finally, the GPS is horrible.  Not only is it slow to connect to satellites (several minutes), the accuracy is WAY off.  You can't use the phone for geocaching.  I wouldn't use it to locate a business.

The Vivo 4.3 was a big mistake.  We bought this from Amazon.com in mid-January 2013Its first minor use was in Syracuse, NY in mid-March.  It has really only been significantly used (or, should we say, attempted use) for a week at the end of June Albany/Schenectady, NY and in the Los Angeles/Hollywood area this past week.

Rowland", "ReviewID": "R3KG5UP8POOBG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After growing tired of waiting for Google to get in another batch of their Nexus 4, I decided to look for other phones in a similar price range. Found the Vivo 4.3 and thought I'd give it a try. Here are the pros and cons of the phone is the default format. I know you can download themes, widgets, etc to change some of this stuff, but keep in mind I haven't done anything yet.Pros:- The screen is awesome. The color is great, the blacks are super dark, there are zero issues with viewing angles.- The phone is sturdy feeling despite feeling very light in the hand. I don't notice it in my pocket.- The speaker on the back is plenty loud. If you sit it flat on the back, it'll muffle the sound, but just lean it against something or hold it in your hand and you are good to go.- The phone boots up super fast and runs very smoothly. I haven't ran anything to intensive on the phone yet, but so far so good. AnTuTu benchmark scores it at 6467, if that matters to anyone. The performance for the money is more than fair with this phone.- Works with Straight TalkCons:- Screen resolution is tiny @ 480x728. Would like to see a few more pixels.- Speaking of screen space, the buttons are on the screen. This cuts off a little of the usable space on the screen. I would like to see dedicated keys below the screen because of the low resolution.- The power button is on the right side across from the volume keys. More often then not I'll hit them both when trying to shut the screen off. Pretty much every other phone I've used had the power button on the top right.- The home screen is on the far left of the 5 available screens. I would rather have the screen in the middle to cut back on scrolling since you can't scroll around to the left either.As mentioned earlier, the cons are very minimal for me. I can't really say how long the battery lasts because I keep a charger handy at both work and home.

Denny", "ReviewID": "R100Y7LC5LY4DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in February to replace an iPhone 3G which fell and got the screen broken. It is my first Android device, but there were a few things that really sold me on this phone. First the dual sim feature was the most important for me. I travel a lot and hate to have to carry two phones. Second was the size, 4.3 inches is much bigger than the iPhone but not as big as the Galaxy 3 which is 5 inches and I was not too fond of that size. Having the super amoled screen was the third thing and having Android 4.0 and now 4.1 sealed the deal for me. When I received the phone I was so surprised by how thin and light it was. When I turned it on I was blown away by how great the screen looked especially the blacks. I popped in a SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. I love the live wallpaper (wp clock) with the extra large clock display. Unlike how it is shown here the default background is black. It is very cool to me and I can see the time easily. I was changing various home screens and changed it by mistake but an email to BLU customer service was answered immediately. I asked them for the pdf manual which was not available on their website and they sent it for me also. Great response from them. Setting up the accounts such as gmail, whatsapp, magicjack and netflix plus facebook was easy. Typing is a breeze and I got all of the apps I was using on my iPhone from the play store and amazon app store for android. I live in Barbados and I did not want to review this phone until I had a chance to use it for the main feature for which I bought it ... The dual sim feature. I was in Vegas in April and the phone worked flawless. I had the LIME Barbados sim in the 3G slot and my AT&T; sim in the 2G slot. I Have a T-Mobile 4G hotspot T-Mobile 4G Hotspot (T-Mobile) so I only need my AT&T; for phone calls. When I arrived in the US, the AT&T; service on sim 2 connected immediately. I had to make the phone manually search for a roaming network for the Barbados sim to connect to. It did not do this automatically like my iPhone so it had me there for a few minutes. It connected fine and you can set the phone to ask you which sim you want to use for each call. This worked fine and I just set it to use the AT&T; by default. Next was the gps and google maps. I had my Garmin 1390T Garmin n\u00fcvi 1390/1390T 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Traffic with me as well and the BLU was just as accurate as the Garmin plus you have voice search with the BLU. Call quality is great and loud and I changed the ringtone to one of my favorite songs. You have a ton of alert options and tones. I am an audio engineer and music is my life so the next thing I have to comment on is the audio of the phone. I bought Poweramp player because of the equalizer and the preamp functions. I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50 Audio-Technica ATH-M50S Professional Studio Monitor Headphones headphones which my iPhone powered ok, but the BLU did not work well with these headphones. The BLU did drive my JVC Flats JVC HAS160B FLATS Lightweight Headband Headphones (Black) ok though. Definitely an impedance issue. My solution to this (serious problem for me) was the FiiO E07 FiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier, Black headphone amp and usb dac. This thing will knock the stuffing out of most headphones. Back to the phone. The good thing about Poweraamp is that when I was streaming my music via bluetooth to the stereo in my rental you have the 10 band eq and stereo width control to fine tune the sound. With bluetooth, wireless, both sims and the gps antennae on all of the time, the 1600 mah battery does not last all day. With wifi on only and medium or auto brightness, the battery gives me about seven and a half hours with normal use. I have a galaxy tab 2, 7 inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) and with everything on the battery lasts forever. I have a PowerGen PGMPP12000 12000mAh External Battery Pack PowerGen PGMPP12000 12000mAh External Battery Pack High Capacity Power Bank Charger Triple USB 3Amps output for Apple iPhone 5 4s 4 3Gs 3G, iPod Touch, iPad 1 2 3 4, The New iPad 3/ HTC sensation, XE, XL, One X S V, Thunderbolt, Inspire 4G , EVO 3D, EVO... which keeps the BLU charged when on the go in a mall for example. For me, the battery life could be a bit better but for the money, this phone rocks. I have not had a problem with this phone that was not app related. For example, with the magicjack app installed and launched if you try to use voice search it will give you an audio error message. Just end the magicjack using a task killer (I use Android Task Killer) and the voice search will work again. I am just saying this because I read some of the other reviews and it may be operator error or lack of experience with the operating system, features of the phone and apps installed that may cause problems. Thousands of apps means thousands of software combinations which will cause the same device to operate differently for each user. Again I will say that this phone is terrific. I have purchased two more of these phones for my friends who have seen my phone and they are happy with them as well. A couple more things to mention. I am not a fan of phone cases but this is one of the biggest issues with the BLU VIVO 4.3 . There is no case available for the phone right now and this might be a big problem for some people who want to purchase the phone. BLU needs to work on this immediately. There must be some company that can make a case for it. When I plugged the phone into my mac, I see under system information that this device's vendor shows up as HTC. So the BLU is probably built for them by HTC which is a great thing. And yes, I purchase most of my stuff from Amazon.Update May 30th, 2013.I contacted BLU by phone and they emailed me the links for the Android 4.1.1 update for both the D910a and the D910i model of the phone. I followed the included instructions, backing up my user data first which took me about 10 minutes. I copied the file (update_BLU-D910a-V07-GENERIC_T8134.zip) to my SD card, rebooted into the utility mode and performed the update. When finished, make sure you do the factory reset as indicated in the instructions. I did not at first because I was not paying attention and the phone rebooted by itself. Everything worked except for my caller id which was really annoying. I checked with my friend that has a D910a and his update worked fine. So I rebooted into utility mode and did the factory reset. Of course you have to now re-link you accounts and setup stuff again. I actually chose not to restore my data. After owning the phone for a few months I wanted a few less apps, so I downloaded what I wanted again and re-linked my accounts and everything is working fine, including the caller id. Moral of the story, follow the makers instructions. I now also have Google Now and it is cool to ask the phone something and have it tell you the answer like Siri on the iPhone. Battery life has improved a bit as well. I hope they let us go to Android 4.2.x which will be the last version of the software to run on (non rooted) dual core devices so I heard.

Sounds much better than the new iphone 5's I hear in the break room at work.  The touchscreen is well designed.  My clumsy fingers normally have a hard time with these smartphones, but this one was a breeze to adapt to.I've read the other reviews of people complaining about the battery life.  Once fully charged, and completely drained twice, the battery life seems seems outstanding.  If you sit on the phone and use it constantly, sure, your going to have to keep the charger in tow.  No different than any other smartphone out there.As others have mentioned, so far there is no aftermarket cases or screen protectors modeled for this specific phone.  I'm sure however that one designed for another phone would work for this one.  I just haven't found which one that is yet.In my opinion, to buy a phone that would outperform this one, you would have to spend several hundred dollars more.  That or get locked into a contract and have to settle with only getting a new phone every two years.

I've had this phone for just over a week now. Since I've owned a samsung galaxy tab 7.7 for just under a year, I'm quite familiar with high end android products and the super Amoled screen. Lets take my experience with the CONS other reviewers have mentioned. Voice quality:  Not a problem. I'm sure there are phones with better voice quality out there, but I don't believe I've encountered many. If you say something clearly (without shouting), the other person will hear you. fullstop. Thats all I really need to make and receive calls effectively.  Slippery surface:  Rubbish. The plastic back has a quality feel to it but is by no means shiny or slippery.  No cases sold for it:  That's definitely a problem for most. I just use one of those belt clipped cases, but I have no protective sleeve or case for the instrument itself.  Screen:  Colours are gorgeous. But screen resolution is not as good as the high-end Samsung Galaxy SIII or iphone 4s and up.  Volume rocker position:  it is on the left, right across from the standby/on button. NOt a problem for me. It depends on what one is used to, and how adaptable one is. Battery life:  Good. IF you remove the obnoxious live wall paper that it comes with and you put an app killer program on it. Don't forget to adjust the backlighting to either low, or automatic.

Been using it in Venezuela from a month now.For phone calls it works with any carrier because of 4-band supponrt.

Read this excelent explanation on the subject [...] This model is d910a, only supports frecuency bands 2100 and 1900Mhz for HDSPA. If you plan to use with Digitel carrier in Venezuela, ask the vendor or find on Amazon the d910i model or use other phone.This phone supports 2 SIM cards: the primary supports 3G data, secondary for 2G phone calls and text messages only. I am using Movistar on the primary 3G with a data and voice plan, Digitel on the secondary for voice only.I was using Movilnet for 3G but changed to Movistar after 3 weeks because it has better HDSPA coverage at this time (2012-2013). At first I had to reboot the phone twice to take HDSPA signal with Movistar.Put a 32GB microSD card and worked fine from the start. The phone comes with a 4GB microSD card inserted, so no need to buy extra card.

I suspected first from the official Facebook app (changed to other) and latter from the fabric installed 'GO Launcher EX'. I changed the launcher, it is easy and safe, you can always return to the fabric installed 'GO Launcher EX'; first tried 'Lightning' launcher, then tried and stayed with Zeam Launcher and seems better, no crashes.

I read about it in another review but went ahead to purchase it anyway.  i thought that reviewer might have a defective one, or his head phone was defective, or he put it in incorrectly.  but i guess he was right.  when i put in my klipsch headphones it sounds like crap.  when i put in my sony headphones it sounds like crap.  even with a standard headset from a verizon phone sounds like crap.  It only sounds normal when you plug in a very low quality headphones such as the one provided by blu.  I don't know how to describe how bad it sounds, but trust me, you don't want to put it in your ears.  i found a workaround by using a bluetooth-to- 3.5mm adapter, which turn a wire headphones into wireless through bluetooth.  then the headphones work perfectly well.  but this work around is becoming a pain because you have to connect to bluetooth everytime you listen to music, and it sips more battery on the phone (the bluetooth adapter requires battery too).  i eventually turned to my company's iphone for mujsic listening, but i really hate transferring music using that freaking itunes.  will be looking for another android phone for my music listening, probably a Sammy, and keep this one as a back up.  if you are going to use this phone as your primary music device, look somewhere else.  if you are not going to listen to music on your phone, this is a great smart phone to get.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ok phone but not good enough", "Author": "Jodi Schulze", "ReviewID": "R39WNQAVRZF4JJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the design of the phone and it does take pretty great pictures.

Comes with handful of onboard games. Not a gamer even occasional so cannot say about games and associated speed. Had it for few days. Although the price is very attractive, losing the screen size because of soft navigation icons is a deal breaker. The effective screen size then is no longer 4.3 inches (except for watching videos). Web browser crashes frequently. Not sure why. Bought 32GB micro card separately. Came with only 4GB micro SD.

Thats because ATT needs 850/1900/2100. Depending on where you are you may not get 3G. But I said it should at least get Edge/2G data, it did not, which was a big minus. The phone also comes with what i consider too much BLU baggage, there is something that loads time, date and other things on the top of the screen and one cannot get rid of it! At least I could not.

The screen is huge and the keyboard is very good. The only reason I'll give this phone 4 stars is the touchscreen responsiveness, I know it sounds weird but the phone does not recognize my left index finger if the phone is lying flat on a surface no matter how hard I try. It is so weird but the ipod touch recognizes even the faintest touch so I don't know what's up.  I recommend the phone if you're willing to take some time to configure your android settings. The amount of functions and options the OS gives you can be a little overwhelming but that's good because you have control over most of your phone's capabilities.UPDATE: RETURNED THE PHONE BECAUSE OF TERRIBLE MICROPHONE.
