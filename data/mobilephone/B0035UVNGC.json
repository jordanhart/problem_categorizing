{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fair Plan for BlackBerry", "Author": "Nathan M. Smith \"Nathan Smith\"", "ReviewID": "R2GSUOHT2355S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Boost Unlimited Blackberry plan at $60/month is the best value in any BlackBerry plan offered in the U.S. at the moment and with no contract it was a sweet deal that I couldn't pass up. My contract with Sprint ended, and I decided to switch.I previously had an HTC Snap Smartphone. I asked the sales representative who sold the Boost BlackBerry Curve to me, \"Why on earth would Sprint (who owns Boost) offer this plan for $40-$50 less on Boost then on Sprint?\" I figured out the caveats on my own.Here's the scoop: Sprint stepped down the speed from EVDO Rev.0 to EVDO Rev.A, which means although technically it's \"3G\", It's much slower than using a BlackBerry Curve 3300 with Sprint on a contract. The browser is noticeably more slow then what I was used to. Secondly, the Boost Mobile version will not roam on other CDMA carriers (Verizon Wireless) which significantly cuts down the coverage areas, especially rural areas.Boost Mobile was also unable to port my phone number from Sprint. Strange since they run on the same Sprint CDMA network. The customer service rep chalked it up to a systems limitation. I gently reminded him of the FCC mandate that all wireless carriers must comply with porting requests. He seemed to be unconcerned. So I have a new phone number.I also wish Boost Mobile would have other BlackBerry plans - like a 1000 minute/unlimited data plan for $40, since I don't talk on the phone that much and don't really need unlimited minutes.Overall, the BlackBerry Curve 3300 device itself is great. It's intuitive, great for messaging, and easy to type with. The battery life is excellent. The $60/month plan is fair despite Boost Mobile (Sprint) crippling bandwidth and roaming capabilities.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Slow and hard to use", "Author": "Dave Capper", "ReviewID": "R1ZWTSGGU4ZQZC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this phone within two days of ordering it ... hard to get it activated ... had to call provider to show me a back end way to activate it. Took three attempts to \"provision\" it to work.Added a few apps and now it says memory is too low delete some of the apps. Browser is very slow.I thought of the Blackberry because of the apps but apparently cannot use them. I now pay 10 bucks a month MORE for service because it is a Blackberry, only to find I could have used a cheaper plan and been more happy.I would not recommend this phone.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Customer Service", "Author": "Robert \"RPB\"", "ReviewID": "R3H2FXVUGJVNAW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great phone, but Boost Mobile customer service lacks.

I owned several touch-screen phones in the past, but none of them compared to the Blackberry! It is reliable and dependable! make sure you get a memory card with it though, so you can save your pics and such. The only issue I had, which isn't a huge issue, is that there is no timer on the camera for taking pictures. My other phones had a timer and I could take my own pics by setting up the phone to 30 seconds and having it snap them. But I absolutely love this phone.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "it is what it is", "Author": "willm", "ReviewID": "R2VX8X3NSOU1R3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its a good phone for its purpose, it has an excellent keyboard, the battery life isnt bad as long as you arent running a thousand things, and the screen quality is good for its age, in my opinion the web browser is a little slower, but really its not unbearably slow it works decently quick, of course you also have to consider how well sprints signal is in your area, but with this phone you are going to end up spending more each month for a phone service thats not as capable as a newer android phone (which you can find cheaper now in some instances) i do like the shape and feel of the phone its built well, i think the track ball is cool its like a mouse in the web browser, i have heard of people having trouble with the track ball, my track ball has worked well, they do have replacement track ball kits available that are easy to install, all in all its a nice little phone", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice blackberry i just got from amazon", "Author": "J.

So I am not using it unless I am going to be in an area with service for a while (which works fantastic!). This BB is wonderful with or without service. It is very good quality and robust :D I have dropped it maybe 20x since I bought this last August and there is not one scratch or glitch!! It came with everything I need for it and even a 1GB sd card in it :) takes amazing pictures & holds a lot of ringtones, songs, pics and vids.Just remember that this is a cdma phone so look at the cdma coverage map, if you get service buy this phone immediately.

No bars at all for a month, I couldn't even call 911 if I wanted to, after that month I switched carriers. The customer service was totally unhelpful. I had emailed and called them more than once and they could not explain to me why I was not getting any service and they didn't refund my money back for that month. I went on facebook and a ton of other people were having the same experience. I went to their website several times and on their coverage map it showed that I had service even though I didn't. I feel sorry for people who order an expensive phone through Boost Mobile, thinking that their coverage map is accurate only to find out that they don't have and service.
