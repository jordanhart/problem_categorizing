Tipton", "ReviewID": "R2O0GGGNWC6GDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone else pointed out...no speed dial...which is hideously surprising in this day and age of high tech gadgets.Other than that its a great phone. I didnt even realize for a long time that it comes with GPS, I use the free version which doesnt have all the fancy features, but lets me know where I am and how to get to where Im going along with a yellow pages function so you can find just about any business you can think of close to wherever you are currently. Its helped us keep from getting lost a few times.The phone has lost maybe 2 calls in close to a year that Ive been using this model. The only thing I'd make sure of us having a compatible charger. I ruined (my own fault for not understanding the issue) two batteries because I was using a car USB port for my cig lighter that kept right on charging even after the battery was fully charged.Bought a compatible charger instead and now it works great in the car.Battery life seems to be excellent. I can let it set for a couple days then make a few hours worth of calls before I get the low battery warning.5 Stars for what it is...just dont expect it to be a smart phone...it isnt.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, it has 3G and GPS!", "Author": "NP Dubs \"Nunya Business\"", "ReviewID": "RABPPIBQCJ0C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast web browsing with 3G, if you have AT&T;, this is the phone for you, easy, lightweight, fast and loud!I love it, especially the 3MP Camera and video recording!", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "works", "Author": "Sue B", "ReviewID": "R8HUQKD70J0XQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i like it for basic use... the camera is slow, other than that is perfect for AT&T.; i use it as back up.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone does what I need", "Author": "Max", "ReviewID": "R2146S0V2T7WSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having owned this model for a long time, I wanted to replace it when the battery wore out.  I can't speak to all the features of the phone, because I just need one to make calls and send a very few texts.  This phone does that for me, without having to sign on to an expensive data plan.  And the phone IS a workhorse -- no dropped calls, and I could barely tell the difference between the old phone and the new one when it arrived.  It is VERY sturdily built.  That said, the replacement phone ordered from Amazon was unlocked and worked great.  I just popped in my old SIM card, charged her up, and was up and running.  Just be sure to allow plenty of time for the initial charging of the new battery.  It took all of overnight, with the phone turned off, to get the full initial charge.  After that, long-lasting and perfect.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "L.
