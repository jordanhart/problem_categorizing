I've been wanting to try a touch screen phone for the longest time. I was tempted to buy the iphone several times but the iphone always seemed so overrated for me. I also almost bought the Samsung Memoir from tmobile but I did not like how thick it was. So, I waited a couple more months to see if any of the companies would release more touchscreen phones that would meet my wants and needs. Finally I found the Samsung Jet.I decided to go with an unlocked phone because I do not want to be contracted into a mandatory 30 dollars a month data plan for 2 years. If I got a decent plan (around 50 bucks a month) plus the 30 dollar data plan, it would cost me around 2000 bucks(720for data plan and 1200regular bill) in 2 years just on cell phone bills!!! I do not live in an area that requires me to occupy/entertain myself while I'm out and about. I'm either at home or work, which has computers, driving or out with friends. None of my daily activities require me to surf the internet on my cell phone. Thats what computers are for!Anywho, I bought this phone from a reputable dealer that I found online. I called them to make sure that the phone would work in the US with a sim card from AT&T; or TMOBILE.I've had this phone for about a week now and everything is working great. The amoled screen is amazingly bright and clear. The haptic feedback feature is amazing too. Every time I use my screen, it vibrates back meaning that its recognizing my touch. Great simple applications in the phone also. Speakers work great, the FM radio works great, sound quality is great, the Photos are great and also has a good video recording function.This is NOT A SMART PHONE, but anybody who wants a touchscreen phone with all the great functions and qualities like me will love and enjoy the Samsung Jet.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone that Definitly exceeds expectations", "Author": "Victor Lo Monaco \"Italiano\"", "ReviewID": "R36AGLO8OQ9N1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, this is the best phone i have ever had. I have used Iphones before and I think they are really great, being their only problem it's size. This is way more carry friendly. It is a tall phone, but it is also really thin, so you can put in your pocket and barely notice it. Here is a list of the things i like and i don't like about it.Pros:  - Small size (considering all the stuff it can do). Way better than any competing smart phone  - Video player: WOW, really amazing. The amoled screen really makes the videos look spectacular. I put my sony laptop side by side running the same video as my phone and it looks way better on the phone. And the best part is that the videos run flawlessly, no slowdowns nor hiccups at all (this is the only part were you really appreciate the fast processor on this phone)  - No Need to convert videos. YES, finally you don't have to dedicate a hole day converting videos to put on your phone. Any AVI videos you like on your phone? Just connect USB and freely transfer them to your phone  - Screen is really responsive. It's different than an Iphone screen, but really no complaints  - Excellent, really excellent in call quality.  - WiFi and Bluetooh connections are very easy to access and to turn on and off as desired (In other phones this are usually buried in the menus)  - Pictures look amazing (again for the great screen)  - Camera quality is good for a phone. The quality of this camera is on par with that of the iphone 3GS, but this phone has added bonuses that makes it one of the must fun to use camera-phones. The smile shutter works how it is supposed to, there is a panoramic mode, were you move the phone around in one direction and it takes really wide photos (you can take amazing 200 degrees pictures). Great great flash  - Really good internet browser. It is fast, specially over wifi, second only to the iphone (amazing browser the iphone has). But it has a huge plus, that is the ability to play flash  - I really like the convenience of the widgets and the 3 desktops to play with. I set myself an entertaining desktop (with music player and video player), a web desktop (with youtube, google and weather report) and my third desktop is a connections desktops with Wifi and BluetoohCONS:  Not much to say here except this:  - I still can't make real GPS work. There is google maps ant it works great, but i mean the real GPS. The GPS software is not pre-installed on the phone and you have to look for yourself how to install it.  - The email works really good (Shame on free yahoo mail service that doesn't provide POP nor IMAP to use on clients, so i had to change to gmail). But there is one only thing. If you, phone, every 30 min check my email and see that there is not any new mail, i don't need a message every 30 min telling me that i don't have new mails. Please tell me only when I have new mails!  - The screen on landscape mode is a pain to use. That's because my fingers are too big to those small rectangles. I mean, the screen is really sensitive, and is really easy to touch the letters next to the one you intended. I did a test and i wrote almost twice as fast with keyboard on vertical stance and the dictionary on (as opposed to landscape)  In conclusion, I really recommend this phone. Extremely happy with my purchase.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "user opinion", "Author": "ws", "ReviewID": "R3CQOIF2BIH0IB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this phone is quite responsive and pocketable. The interface reacts quickly despite being a resistive type touch screen. Also is a great video and mp3 player. However, on the software side it falls short. The pc software does not recognize the phone when you try to back it up, and the firmware cannot be updated as well-also, when you watch a video and turn the phone to its side for landscape viewing it is okay, but when turn it to its other landscape side the video is displayed upside down. I found that the browser also has trouble rendering some popular websites correctly. Finally, the phone can only record video and voice using the amr codec which results in very disappointing low quality sound recordings. Worldwide, this phone sells for about 450-500usd as of 7/09.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very cool phone", "Author": "SirStinky", "ReviewID": "R2N8KO19RI9ZH2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I had to replace my Pixon, I looked into another one, but wanted WiFi, which it didn't have. The Pixon 12 was too much money, but the Jet looked good and offered a lot of features for a low price.This is an unlocked GSM phone that will work with T-Mobile, AT&T;, and other GSM carriers, but since it's from Europe, Asia, or Australia, you'll need to configure it to receive and send MMS messages or use your carrier's WAP services.The jet is compact and light-weight and feels good in the hand. It's light and is made of very shiny plastic (no aluminum battery cover), which could be a durability issue but cuts down on the weight, and the battery cover has a really cool hologram effect on it. Plus there's the \"cube\" button which launches the main menu or applications.It's got a 3.1 inch AMOLED touch screen with 480x800 pixels and 16 million colors, which are way more than you'll find in phones in this price range. It is by far the best-looking screen I've seen so far. It's bright, chrisp, and makes images look great, but it completely washes out in sunlight.The heart of this phone is the user interface, which is very easy to use and has revisions from the older versions found in the Behold, Eternity, 1st gen. Omnias, and F480. It's got the widgets, and you can run multiple applications at one time. There's an 800 mzh processor inside, which is faster than most phones in this class so there's little lagging when using apps. The phone has 2 GB internal memory, but you can add a 16 GB with MicroSD card to expand it. It has Wifi and the browser is pretty good, but you'll find yourself squinting to read text.The media player is great and has lots of features, along with the 5 megapixel camera which has auto focus, smile/blink detection, GPS tagging, shooting modes, and lots of other features. The camera takes pretty decent pictures. It's not like the Pixon, but it's good enough for most everyone.So, the good:AMOLED displayVery cool stylingWiFi800 mhz processorGood UIGood cameraLots of media featuresHigh-qualitySmall and lightweightAnd the bad:Screen could be a little biggerVirtual QWERTY keyboard keys could be biggerGlossy finish slips out of your hand easily and is a finger print magnetScreen washes out in sunlightIncluded New PC Studio software is uselessPeople have had troubles with the included New PC Studio software, and it's a problem with Windows...it won't work with Windows Vista or 7, but there are solutions to it, check online.Other than that, this is a very cool phone and is a good choice if you can't afford an Omnia II, HD, or Pixon 12.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Be Aware - Sumsung Jet has Many Shortcomings", "Author": "Mark E. Hallman", "ReviewID": "RAJ120G8MXU2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do your web-homework before buying the Samsung Jet.  Decide what the phone main functions are in which you have interest and search out USER reviews for them on the Samsung Jet.  If all you care about is style, this is an outstanding phone (and style earns it a one star rating).Do you want to sync with MS Outlook/Exchange?  Continuing comments in Samsung Jet forums and newsgrops seem to indicate that many problems persist in doing so.  I continue to experience most of them, to the point of only using my Samsung Jet as a dumb phone and carrying around an old PDA that can actually sync with Outlook reliably and correctly.ActivSync (to Outlook/Exchange) does not work with this phone.  PC Studio is Samsung's proprietary app for syncing PC (and/or Exchange/Outlook) to phone and it is not user friendly, not intuitive and not reliable.  It is very slow.The phone plays music well and has a wonderful display for pictures (once you get the music and pictures onto it through PC Studio).  Too bad it doesn't do other things as well.Are you expecting free GPS navigation? Do your homework.This phone had potential that was never realized or supported by Samsung, so you must be willing to spend hours trying to get info and set up apps that should have been functional right out of the box.Bottom Buying Line - Do your homework first.  --- Meh", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as good as expected; in fact....", "Author": "Enio Shinohara", "ReviewID": "R1BV3T5LQP50B2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "....much worse than I thought.Bought the Jet to replace my Nokia E61i and read few evaluations here and in specialized magazines before opting for the Jet instead of iPhone.On the positive side: its screen is really good and it's smaller and thinner than iPhone and my previous phone. It also has a \"block\" button on the right side, which proved to be very handy.Now, on the negatives:- the phone is not user-friendly. A quick example: there is a toolbar on the left side that you can slide and where there are shortcuts to the most used functions, very similar to the Windowns toolbar in a desktop. But, once you use any of the funcionts, say the \"Profile\" function, the icon of that same function moves automatically to the main screen and stays there! In other words, every time you use any of those icons, you have to move it back to the left bar. Needless to say, for someone not used to the screen, it's really a pain, extremely annoying. When I was testing my phone for the first time and haven't realized about this feature, I ended up with tons of icons in my main screen and had to move them to the left bar, one by one....- the software to perform the interface between your PC and Jet (PC Studio) is extremely UNfriendly. Unlike the previous software that I used with my Nokia (where I could, for instance, transfer files from/and to my mobile very easily), the Samsung software is full of coloured icons but it's extremely complicated to use- the manual and different wizards aren't much helpful. I needed to get the IMEI and PIN codes of my device to set up my email and I had to check on the Internet to figure out how to get those codes in my phone (in Nokia, for example, I could easily check those in the Internet/email menus).All in all, I'm very dissastified with the phone, even being only 2 days that I bought it.

I never rated any product as a 1 star before.  If there was a zero rating, that would have been my preference for rating this product.  After 2 months the phone started mal-functioning, after 4 months it got worse,and after 6 months, it stopped working altogether.  The configuration went completely hay-wire and nothing worked.  When I contacted the seller, they referred me to Samsung, since the product carried a no warranty notice.  I don't think I am up for the run around, so may just count my losses.  In future, I have to re-think any purchases with the no warranty notice.  We all learn from experience.  Only because I trusted Amazon, and never had problems before did I make this purchase.  I guess the no warranty notice is there for a reason!  Once you see 'NO WARRANTY' don't buy.  Dissatisfied to say the least.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "User unfriendly", "Author": "M. Skipworth", "ReviewID": "R3NZAMDXA9Q7D6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wow, I'm pretty sure I've never rated anything as a 1 star before this... Yeah, I really do hate my Samsung Jet.If you read the other 1 star reviews you'll get the same idea I want to say except for a few other details...1). I have never had a faulty phone before the Jet, yet my Jet and also my wife's Jet have both been required to get sent back to the manufacturer's for repairs. (My wife's phone has had to be sent back 3 times now and we have both had them for 2 years). Both our phones died (the first time) within the first year, so at least we were able to get them fixed under warranty.2). The PC software is so unfriendly that I haven't even been able to get it working consistently. I currently have a memory card that I'm saving my photos to, so I will eventually be able to retrieve them.3). Touch screen is really unresponsive- I can get sore fingers from having to press so hard sometimes.4). This one is a real killer... When you are writing a text, the screen's sensitivity doesn't extend to the edges of the screen. It means that once you have typed a letter or 2, you can't then press at the start of the line to insert another word etc. You pretty much have to delete the word itself and re-start typing... Very frustrating!!!5). The phone book arrangement is unchangeable and not typical- (sorry, weird working... I'll explain). For all of my previous phones, my phonebook list has worked smoothly- even though I don't have everyone's full name in the appropriate entries. The Jet only lets you see your names and numbers in it's own (reverse) order. (Surname/ First name). I haven't been able to change the order, so it has just added a number to most of my contacts so they'll 'fit'. I have spent ages fixing up my 'mistakes' even though every other phone I have owned has not had a problem with it!6). The 'games' on it are rubbish. The only thing remotely interesting is the rolling dice 'game'. You guessed it- you shake the phone and some simulated dice roll. :)7). Nothing displays on the screen when idle. I loved my last phone because I could just look at it in idle and see the time/ date. The Jet shows nothing so you have to unlock it first, then look for the time.Having said all this, I did like the size of the screen and I really liked that I can have 3 wallpapers/ main screens running at all times. I guess the SAR on this is also pretty low...Please, don't get this phone.

Got T-Mobile for it and I use it every day. It's been through alot and still works like the day I got it, but with quite a few nicks, scratches, and even dents on the sides. Most of which were my friends fault for taking my phone and messing with it. I'd suggest getting a case for it. Just incase you have crazy friends that like to take your phone like me. The screen get's lots of finger prints and grease on it but what phone doesn't? If you get water or in many of my cases sweat on the screen it'll wack out or just stop working until it's cleaned and dried. Hasn't ever been a big problem for me but there could be times when you stuck in the rain, need to call for a ride, and the screen won't work because one too many droplets got on it. The camera and video camera are great, can take really good pictures and video aslong as you don't use zoom or shake it too much, the phone looks cool, has good sound, and has served me well.
