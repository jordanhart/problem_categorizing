It's been a great phone! This phone has been used for basic callingand text messaging. It has \"Media Net\" capabilities, though I've never used that feature.It is incredibly durable.  It's been dropped more times than I care to think about.  It's still using the originalbattery!  This battery still holds a charge for an entire day.  After 5 years of use, I'm not complaining that Ineed to charge it every night.The small window on the front is easy to read even without my glasses when a call is coming in or if there is amessage or a missed call.The volume key is located in a natural place on the upper part of the phone....no need to look at or take the phonefrom your ear to raise or lower the volume during a call.The back cover is made of a non slip type of material- nice because it doesn't tend to slip as many others.It has a very basic camera that shoots at less than 1mp. It can take 10sec video clips as well.I've traveled all over the country and never had a problem with reception or dropped calls.I'll be sad when this one has to be replaced.  If I find another at a good price I'm gonna grab it!One additional note: The V557 that I have has been used on the AT&T; network. It is not unlocked.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "good purchase", "Author": "ms camacho", "ReviewID": "R3K2Q7I77D6DTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone i purchased for my son was in excellent condition.

Then they told me to call the company of motorala to see if they carry it they said that they no longer carry that battery for that phone. that's when i decided to go on line to see if i could find the battery but i notice the same phone on amazon. that's when i decided to purchased the phone and surprise him. he's enjoying his phone he didn't want another phone. i guess i made a good choice.if i need a unlock phone i would go back to amazon.com", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT OLD PHONE", "Author": "TEABAG", "ReviewID": "ROT2K6BTONCE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE MOTOROLA V557 IS A GOOD PHONE AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF STARTING ALL OVER WITH (2) HANDSFREE DEVICES IN MY CARS.

My previous old Motorola phones (V400 & V551) were durable but adequate. I purchased a LG Prime Smart phone for internet capability, but that didn't work at all. My most important consideration was a phone that works and this does the job.  The charger that was included did not charge the phone, but luckily, the chargers that I had with my previous phones worked for this one. The other negative is not having a manual for reference of this phone's additional features.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola V557 flip phone", "Author": "Charles Hardin Holley", "ReviewID": "R1NJJSG65SGU44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I've ever had. I've went through 3 V557's in the last 10 years or so. My last one finally got worn out, so I thought I'd go to a smart phone everyone says is so great. My family purchased 3 new Samsung Galaxy 111's, and I hate mine. I'm going to go down to AT&T; and see if I can transfer my account to a V557, and get ride of the Samsung. If I can, I'm going to buy the V557.

The phone mechanically was ok but the case was damaged.  I looked online at all of the new flip phones and read the reviews.  I was shocked to find nothing but bad reviews.  I knew the old phone I had had been a good one.  I luckily found one like I had damaged on Amazon.  I purchased it and took it to the local AT&T; store for transferring my phone numbers and pictures to it from my old phone.  I had limited success there so I phoned AT&T;'s tech support.
