I don't mean to smear the rating of the seller, but this just isn't what I expected by paying $30... totally not worth it at all. I even discovered some technical difficulties with the thing. I really can't be sure if I can be fully satisfied with this phone and if there's a real option of returning it and getting either my money's worth or getting it back. For now, I'm just managing it and seeing what will happen next.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "great phone! for the price!", "Author": "monira ardell \"monica.ardell\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y9W5QLJIMIVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bough this phone and canceled verizon to go with boost because of  the amazing $50.00 everything plan + my sister other family members have walkie talkie so i wanted to walkie talkie with them overal  the phones are expensive and so cute but i really like this phone i meam its a phone it does not have camera but gets the internet ass any  other phone as well ass the text walkie talkie is great a lil hard to get used to it but once u get  the hang of it ull love it the best thing would probably be the speakerphone it is very loud and clear and u could set the phone and do laundry and the person on the other end of the line will have no problems hearing you! it is great phone overall  very basic so if u are expecting nice features like other phones well this is not for you it does not have a camera but u could receive pic's does not have many other features either but it does what it sais it does unlimited talk unlimited text unlimited data  and unlimited walkie talkie that's what it adverstises and thats what it does. i like the simple phone could be better but im happy", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001T9CSYW"}}
