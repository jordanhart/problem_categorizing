Operating system is stale, it only has frozen 4 or 5 times in 8 months. The only problem with it is quality!!!! After using is for 6 months, treating it like a pearl, no drops no scratches or nothing.... the center bottom fell off, then the circle around it. It seemed to be glued, not attached in any other way. I guess with the heat the phone produces, glue just gave in.Mi cousin has the same exact phone and but it same week I did, and when I saw him last week. Surprise, same buttons where missing from his phone. Went to the dealer, and they said, when the buttons go off, we give it no guarantee!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Peeps \"Laura\"", "ReviewID": "R2HI5ZFM5I7PS2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have never reviewed any item I have bought, but am so disgusted with this phone that I feel like I need to warn people about its quality.  The first phone I had of this kind literally started falling apart.  The center button fell off because it is just glued on.  I live in a humid climate that seems to make it not want to stick.  Also, many of the buttons on the phone work only when they want to.  My phone also randomly calls people in my phonebook.  I am now on my second phone because Motorola did honor the original warranty.  Apparently these problems are very common in this phone.  I am on my second one, and the same problems are starting to happen again.  This is a very good phone for about 2 months.  After that, it falls apart.  DO NOT BUY!!", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a good phone", "Author": "J.

Shortly after I got this phone it went funny, and I have had the same center buttons fall off. It went from being slow once, then more, and now every time I try to do something I end up waiting several seconds. It may not seem like a lot, but when it takes you several minutes to type a single text message it gets old. Also, it will not play music any longer. I would not recommend this phone to anybody simply because there are so many better phones that actually work.", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is a great phone I ever have!", "Author": "L.

A few months ago, I bought a Z6m and now hate not just the phone, but Motorola. (The Z6m is the CDMA variant; I've observed that all sorts of GSM phones regularly cause interference, violating US FCC rules part 15, and therefore unlawful to operate.)The first thing that infuriated me was the speakerphone. It isn't loud enough to use in a moving car, even when holding it near my head. (Under the same conditions, my old Nokia worked just fine, allowing me to keep both hands on the steering wheel.) The MP3 player can play plenty loud through the same speaker, indicating to me that it's not the fault of the speaker, but an intentional shortcoming designed to sell Motorola's hands-free car kit.Even while using all the power-saving options, I still can't get a second day's use out of the phone before recharging, and that's with a brand-new battery. My Nokia gave me a week.The phone supports adding a memory card only up to 2GiB because it uses FAT16 and not FAT32. It would be nice to offer a non-Microsoft file system, if only Motorola could get the disk interface right.Plug in a USB cable to a computer and it charges the phone, and allows access to the memory (card if installed or main if not) or the modem.See something you want to take a picture of? Hold down the button and wait. It launches the camera application, so wait some more. The moment is long gone.I went somewhere with no service and quickly learned that I couldn't even set the clock to the right time.Want to browse the Web? Forget it.The designs of many parts of this thing were outsourced and clearly not managed competently.This is the last Motorola product I buy. I feel ripped off, and hope to soon replace the phone and punch any of its designers in the nose.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works well!", "Author": "Ponger", "ReviewID": "R3GQBX5B7GRG51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has delivered as promised.

My z6 is currently scratched, beat up, old, never had a case on it. This phone has been through hell and back and has never let me know. Id recommend it to anyone.

It would shut off when I was talking to someone or even just sitting on the counter. So I took it in to the phone company who I bought it from and they told me that it was shutting off because there were new updates that I needed installed on the phone (it was a brand new phone...shouldn't everything on it be up to date?), so I took it to have them \"update\" the phone which took almost an hour. Yeah, it didn't help. So I've had it for about 2 years now and the buttons have fallen off, the phone freezes, every once in a while some of the keys decide they don't want to work and it still randomly shuts off. But all of these things started happening within the first month or so of when I bought it. I've kept it because it was such an expensive phone and the stupid phone company pretty much told me to deal with it. So, it gets 1 star because it does still work after two years, but only on its own terms.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "R.
