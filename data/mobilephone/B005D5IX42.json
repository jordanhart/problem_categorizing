Love the interaction, clear calling, qwerty pad, slide function, display, camera, etc. However, I have owned 3 of these bad boys and ALL 3 (the last one decided to malfunction this past week) start to malfunction and/or die within a years time. Must be a chip implanted on the circuit board that has a 'self-destruct' mode built in. When they DID work - they are the best! Great phones. Reasonably prices and look nice.

Auyeung", "ReviewID": "R28K6CICMOS2N6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really miss the days when phones could last for more than a year or so.  I had a Samsung phone that lasted over 3 years back in the day.  I bought this one in May 2011, and it stopped working today (Sept. 2012).  It's quite frustrating that most people upgrade their phones every year or so, and the manufacturers no longer seem to build things to last.  I really don't want a phone that is also a GPS, music player, web surfing device, game console, dog trainer, etc.  I just want a phone that can make phone calls and last for more than a year or so.  This is not that phone.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Screen went blank", "Author": "AL pat", "ReviewID": "RGSF48T1B00HR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this because of the reviews.

I don't need a complicated phone. T-Mobile stopped making these and mine broke so I purchased it from Amazon.  The phone was a new phone and so far, so good.. I'm sure one day I will dare to come into the 21st century and get a smart phone but for now, this phone serves my purpose.  The delivery was quick and the person I bought it from was very helpful because I had to make sure the serial numbers were compatible with T Mobile and they were.  I think it was a little pricy for this kind of phone, but it was a lot less than a smart phone.  I'll use it till it no longer works!!!!!
