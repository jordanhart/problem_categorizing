The 1-star rating is for the seller - WIREOVIAI bought this in March 2012, seeing that it was \"Factory Unlocked by Apple, Never Opened\" and \"New In Shrink-Wrap and Original Packaging\".Just yesterday, a little over 2 months of having the phone, the speaker stopped working so I bring it into Apple, thinking it would be covered under warranty.The apple employee informs me that the iphone was owned and registered in September 2010 - 17 months before I bought this \"new\" iphone.Do not buy ANYTHING from this vendor - WIREOVIA - as you cannot trust the authenticity of what they're selling!  What you buy would also not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty if it's older than you think it is. You will just end up with a useless, piece of junk and less several hundred dollars.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Touch Screen is insensitive/dead at some spots", "Author": "Niladri", "ReviewID": "R3RBYUSURVWIJX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone looked good when I opened it but once I started using it I felt that some part of the touch screen is not recognizing the taps. I tried several tests to ensure the problem and finally I went to apple website and follow the resolution but for no improvement. But when I tried to enter the serial no and seek help from Apple specialists system denied saying 'Service coverage expired' where as I am supposed to get 1 yr warranty as per the seller commitment.I looks like although this is claimed as New, it is a replaced/refurbished phone. I felt very sad and need to return it.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Seller", "Author": "Techbuyer", "ReviewID": "R15DPJCGY4ICV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed.

I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again.

The next day the charger wasn't working, no big deal chargers are easy to replace. A week to the day I received the product it quit working completely.  I notified the seller immediately!!  He replied within 2 hours, explaining he worked in the week and would get back to me over the weekend with options of how to go about fixing the problem. Which in turn ended up in me sending a second email of which he informed me that he would not give me a refund, and offered $40 maximum... I BARLEY HAD THE PHONE A WEEK!!!!! THE PHONE WAS NOT IN WORKING CONDITIONS, AND I SPENT ALMOST $400 IN THE PRODUCT AND SHIPPING FOR A BROKEN PHONE THAT THE SELLER BELIEVES IS NOW ONLY WORTH $40!!! I AM BEYOND UPSET AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE MAKE A PURCHASE FROM CAM-O-RAMA WITH OUT HAVING A LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK FOR LOOP HOLES IN THE REFUNDING DEPARTMENT! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OFF OF AMAZON KNOWING THAT THERE IS REALLY PEOPLE LIKE THIS OUT HERE!! I read almost all the reviews and ratings before buying from this seller, as well as other sellers before making my purchase. I am now out of $400 dollars, and have a black screened iphone to show for it! THANK YOU CAM-O-RAMA!! FOR NOTHING!\"Since I can only provide DOA (dead on arrival) guarantee and because the phone wasdelivered as in described condition (used but fully functional), Iwon't be able to take a full return for it.

The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear \"pops\" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the \"Face Proximity Sensor\" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not \"Very good\" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "Olga Bernhard", "ReviewID": "RQTG1YPRIZHBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Iphone that I bought is broken ( the round button in the middle) and locked. - I read in my order - Factory unlocked - and I don't understand.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work properly", "Author": "MooreW01", "ReviewID": "RGXMOLA4VV8ED", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the phone and it is in good condition but when I call someone or someone calls me I cannot hear them.
