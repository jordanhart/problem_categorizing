{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is NOT a Samsung Phone", "Author": "BTL", "ReviewID": "R2NENQUKJKT953", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer be aware...  this is a Chinese made knock-off of the Note II.  (Samsung's are made in Korea)  We ordered this thinking it was a Samsung for use in Colombia.  Once we got it we saw it was not a Samsung phone but looked nearly identical to one.  It does not have a S Pen  but it does have dual sim card slots and is very nice looking phone.  \"Android\" is written all over the phone as if that is the name (The Android people may not like this).  The box and instruction have NO warranty information so I assume there is no support, In addition there is No manufacture and supplier name anywhere on the phone the box or the manual that comes with it.  Note that the box states it is a Quad core, the ad says it is dual core.I did set it up and tried it to see if it worked ok,  The WiFi would connect to my 2 different WiFi Signals (I have a \"n\" and a \"b/g\" router) but would not open any pages (except Bing for some reason).  After installing a T-Mobile sim card (Had to change slots as it did not recognize the sim in slot #2 if slot #1 was empty). I could call out but had to try dialing about 8 times.  Each time I dialed the wrong numbers would appear on the screen. If you dial 678 then 660 would appear.  Once I finally got the correct number to show it did connect and worked ok as a phone.  In addition we tried a Straight Talk Sim and it also worked ok.I would recommend this phone to someone who  buys a new phone every 4-6 months, I would not  recommend if you want something to last longer than that.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Maria J.", "ReviewID": "R1UVIR10BU0VXD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone 2 Fridays ago and received it this past Friday which only took one week to be delivered. I must say it is a great phone. I ordered it bases on the size, megapixel of the camera and also because it has Google play. Everything so far is wonderful with the exception of the camera. I don't believe it is 8 megapixel because my previous phone was 5 megapixel which has way better picture quality and also the flash is very poor. Other than that its a great phone so far. I'm still playing with it for now. Also I had no problem getting services from T-Mobile's family mobile through Walmart. I would've given it a five if it wasnt for the camera but I am satisfied. You can't beat the price.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone EVER!", "Author": "CNC", "ReviewID": "R3IDAEAK5FUVIM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do NOT buy this phone.

I have trouble with my eyes with the normal sized cell phones, but with the Galaxy Note 2 I could see everything. The only issue I had with this phone is that it is really touchy when it is on. It got so that it was aggravating. Plus, since it is originally with Verizon other service providers are not compatible with an unlocked phone from another service provider. I have AT&T; and some of the functions are not working properly...like the wifi and the data connection...it literally eats up the data plan when I am not inside my home or near my wifi connection. The cell phone connection is also iffy...sometimes I can get a call and talk normal other times it will be broken and other times I can answer the phone and it will drop the call...my cell provider told me that because it was not an AT&T; marked phone that is the reason for the connection and the inability to use certain functions on the phone.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C79UNHW"}}
