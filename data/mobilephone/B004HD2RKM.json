Advice: Ask questions.)This phone from Alpha 1 Sales appears to be a refurb, not new. Check these details.# Version 4.2 or most recent version# Fully \"restored\", includes all original applications# \"Original\" packaging# All \"new\" earbuds, USB Cable, and AC AdapterApple does not advertise original packaging, or fully restored products with new accessories.Also this Amazon listing includes a photo of a white \"conversion kit.\" Not cool. Also you needto check the customer feedback, there are complaints about used phones being passed off as new.Amazon needs to do a better job of policing these type listings, especially since they areproviding the fulfillment services. Bad form.

This phone requries Gevey SIM to use and requires a couple of steps each time I start the phone or power off and on back. Although the steps are simple and straight forward but cannot complete or successful in 1 or 2 attemps. Sometime you need to go 4 or 5 times redo the steps. Time to detect and enable the phone to use also very long. you also have to enable the data roaming option on all the time and this consume the battery - last you 1 day only. Be carefull as this is actually an AT&T; locked phone and use Gevey SIM to unlock.Other than that, the phone is new and good.Sundar", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"Great Device, Terrible Phone\"", "Author": "Unknown", "ReviewID": "R820LLY9RB68E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: The mulitmedia software, camera, battery, screen, sturdy buildCons: Phone reception, carrier and alleged build defect, \"multitasking\"Summary: I think this is an amazing device. The OS is leaps and bounds better than any other phone currently on the market. The problem and hence the poor rating is that as a phone it's simply terrible. I switched carriers and have owned this product for a couple months now. Bottom line it drops an UNUSUAL amount of calls. I can understand the occasional droped call, but it's constant. Where do I live you ask? Austin TX, a major city where I do believe ATT is the no.1 carrier. That being said, in my opinion there is certainly a defect in the phone and perhaps even network problems with ATT. But I know many people with the 3G & 3G S models, who do not have the drop call issues. So it must be the phone. Yes I do have a case on it, it helped some, but still have a lot of dropped calls. If they fix this issue, which I am sure they are working for the next model already, I would easily give this a much better rating.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": ":)", "Author": "Vepsey Rivas", "ReviewID": "R2OUC23GDGRGXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My brother loves his new gift.
