Right out of the box I still have not had a single problem out of it. It's very sleek and in my opinion not the least bit dated in it's looks. Very sharp looking phone. If you want a high end stylish Blackberry but don't necessarily need the internet much or the use of camera, this is an awesome choice. Others have mentioned that it didn't seem brand new but mine was indeed new sealed in the package and everything. VERY PLEASED.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "B.

I then disregarded the message thinking it was because it was unlocked when I got it. but later I have had nothing but problems, it is extremely slow. doesn't have internet or a camera.... what blackberry doesn't have one. I got it for e mail because I run a business. it freezes and resets all the time. i do not recommend this phone to anyone. it is not worth the price and I bought it new and it had contacts already in it.... that weren't mine!!! if  can't you want a cheep phone that you can only do messaging and calling people than this is the phone for you. some other things is you can't buy ring tones, send or receive multimedia messages or anything that is media oriented. one good thing is that because of these down sets the phone does last me a week with out turning it off and talking and texting all the time.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "it is good for the money", "Author": "Bea", "ReviewID": "R1EZEWIJRFFT8X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used it out of the country and it did not disappoint me.
