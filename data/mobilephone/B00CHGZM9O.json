The watch looks great.  Texting is difficult and would better be suited with a stylus.  Desperately needs a speaker function that you can turn up and actually hear for driving and so forth, as I said, the blue tooth sucks and broke on the first day.  I would rate this a 5 if I could hear better when not using a blue tooth instead of hold the watch next to my ear!", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Gift for anyone", "Author": "Annie", "ReviewID": "R3116AVKQ3E6QP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my 10 year old son for his birthday! Of course he loves it, what kid wouldn't want his first cell phone on his wrist. It works well and does everything that's expected, calls, text messages etc. However it's a pretty big watch for a small wrist especially a kid, and you might want to consider buying a stylus pen to type with. It's quite difficult to type with any sized finger. Other than that a decent buy for the price.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "soon order a next one", "Author": "Andrew Rhoden", "ReviewID": "R1NKOYXPZ4X4AV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent I think it worth the money  all my friends love it although idid not get the pencil for the touch screen", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "It not last long", "Author": "Roysian", "ReviewID": "R305BAB0YCY5BG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It broke.
