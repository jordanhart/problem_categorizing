{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the best phones 4.8 stars", "Author": "Maximus \"Arulius\"", "ReviewID": "R3EOQZA9U7SRFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung has produced a great little wonder. A small cell phone with a lot of power, feature rich, and great camera.The slide action is what makes the phone very unique. Very smooth and easy to operate. It takes 4 or 5 tries to get used to the slide action.The sound quality as far as calls are concerned is great. Very clear, and loud and very understandable. The reception however is a bit weaker than phones with external antennas. I did not find this to be a phone problem, however, but rather a Network problem. I am basing this review on Cingular service, and where I work. I work in a place where there are a lot of electronic devices, which affects the reception a lot. Once I am out of that enviroment, the reception is great.The buttons on the phone are very small, but managable. Like everything new, you need to adjust to the buttons, and you will. The control buttons are very small and cramped together, that it makes it difficult sometimes to push the right one.The menus are very clear, and easy to get to. You can customize the function buttons to any of the applications available.The Camera on the phone is a 2 Mega Pixel camera, that takes some of the best pictures, and videos, I have seen. You have total control over the camera, just like an expensive Nikon digital camera. You can adust and fix pictures on your phone, but I recommend using a photo editor program instead.The phone has a built in MP3 player. The sound is okay from the phone directly, or you can use the included head set for a much better sound.Interacting with your PC is very easy, after you install the included software, and using the included USB cable. You can control every function from your PC, from your phone book, to adjusting the settings on your camera.The wireless printing is very unique. I have played with it a couple of times, but I will not use it as I upload my pictures on my PC first, then print from there.The phone also connects to your TV to view photos and videos. A very easy set up, basically just hooking up the A/V Cable that came with the phone and you're good to go.Finally, this phone is very highly recommended. I gave the it a 4.8 because there is no perfect cell phone, and there will never be one, IMHO.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I'd hoped", "Author": "Bernard Morey", "ReviewID": "R1MPNK7IRDKMK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using the phone for 12 months and it hasn't been as good as I initially thought. Granted, this was a top of the line phone a year ago and it wouldn't have been possible to get anything much better.Gripes: (1) Voice quality is not that clear. A colleague also complained about this. (2) It randomly re-boots, including in the middle of calls. Something seriously wrong here. (3) Photos are noisy although this is not unexpected in a fixed-focus device. (4) The 'slider' form-factor is a pest. I found my previous clam-shell phone easier to operate.Update - after 12 months this phone has now been 'scrapped'. No one in the family is interested.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "good phone, decent mp3 player", "Author": "D. Sumner", "ReviewID": "RR4M75ZRAGIBI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cost:I was able to purchase this phone for about $290 unlocked so I could use it with my tmobile to go account.  That seems expensive when there are places you can get phones for free.  I don't talk that much on the phone so I don't use a lot of minutes so my total cost each year (I buy a new phone about every 3 years) is only around $175-200.  A plan at $30/month with a free phone would be $360 a year.Features:The camera phone is very detailed; however the lens is in a bad spot--right where you would hold the phone normally would be blocking it.The video works poorly for motion, but works well otherwise.The MP3 player is pretty good.  Storing the files on it is easy, as is setting up your playlists (4 with 30 songs in each).  The speakers are ok sounding for not having the size needed to get decent low end.  It will also play via a bluetooth headset which is cool.  I found the Motorola stereo headset cheap online (paid about $65 versus $140 I just saw it for in a store).  When listening with these, the music sounds very good.  It also came with a USB set of earphones; but these were too uncomfortable and the cord is too short to be practical (I'm not that tall either--5'9\").Another neat feature is the converter.  I thought it would just do currency; but it also does length, weight, volume--very neat if you do a lot of travelling outside the US.As a phone it seems pretty good.  It does not have quite as strong a signal as one with an external antenna; but it is quite good, volume in the earpiece is decent and calls are clear and understandable.The package came with lots of goodies:  A CD-ROM with a file transfer wizard to move files on and off the phone.  USB earphones.  2 batteries, an external charger (handy when using the MP3 for a while--one battery dies, change it with the one on the charger), case to hang phone on belt, USB cable to send files from computer to phone (it will also do it via bluetooth), and the phone came with a couple of long cool videos that I watched, then deleted to free up space on the phone.A very enjoyable experience so far working with this phone.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pros and Cons", "Author": "teon \"Teon\"", "ReviewID": "R2VPEIKKIB1RV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in the islands and I really like it. THe sound quality is GREAT and the size and weight are also easy. Also, I like the way it locks when it is carried. Unlike wth razor or other phones where you have to go through a million changes to lock and unlock your phone so that the settings dont change in your pocket; this one is EASY.THe only thing I dont like about this phone is that the menus are a bit cumbersome. Although they are clear, it takes too many steps to get to where you want to go. Nokia does a better job of this.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
