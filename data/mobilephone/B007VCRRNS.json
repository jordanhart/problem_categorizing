{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung you have made a masterpiece!", "Author": "Raichama", "ReviewID": "R38HJCTP5J5S9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a previous iPhone user, until I switched from the 4 to a Galaxy S2, and I loved it, but there were alot of things wrong with the S2, Samsung has listened to user feedback and used their experience to make this 4.8 inch masterpiece.  Why do I love this phone so much?1) Performance - Scrolling is buttery smooth, gaming is buttery smooth, even throwing NOVA 3 at it will not phase that quad-core Exynos 4212 and the improved Mali-400 beast (oh I mean chip) inside this phone. It blows the Tegra 3 and the Snapdragon S4 clean out of the water, sorry One X owners.2) Audio - The S2 has okay audio quality, it's Yamaha chip was fine for...most people, however it was a bit disappointing compared to even the iPhone's sound quality, so I always used software decoding for listening to music.  The S3 has seen Samsung's return to the Wolfson audio chip, and it is absolutely stunning especially with the new SoundAlive system which allows Bass Boosting, Clarity, and Virtualization out of the box.3) Camera - The S2's camera was good, the S3's camera is even better. It may be a 'measly' 8MP, but Samsung has played around with the software in order to create a camera with zero shutter lag, a definite plus.  Now it can take great looking photos, quickly.4) Battery Life - The GS2 has a notoriously horrible battery life, it was basically essential to root and install custom ROMs because of the battery life.  The GS2 had a 1650 mAh battery, the S3 has a 2100 mAh battery.  It may have even more power than the S2 but the battery life is definitely improved, I just watched over 2 hours straight of 720p video and the battery meerely went from 85% to 70%. If this was my GS2 it would have gone from 85% to 60 or even lower.  Battery life while using data has also been improved, an hour of internet browsing hit my battery only 10% rather than the 20 or 30 that would have been seen on the S25) The feel - The S2 was made out of plastic, very light plastic that felt cheap.  Of course I know better than to judge how \"cheap\" a phone is by lightness, but many other reviewers hated it for this very reason.  Samsung answered by making the S3 out of poly-carbonate, the same material as a One X.  As a result, it feels solid and light in my hand, amazingly it managed to be 5g heavier than the One X while feeling so much lighter.6) The \"new\" TouchWiz - I know TouchWiz has had alot, I mean alot of hate over the years.  I hated TW3 myself, and didn't enjoy the orignal TW4, only enjoying it's lock screen.  The new Touchwiz shipped out with this phone that has a nature feel to it feels great.  The ripple effect on the unlock is very enjoyable and I enjoy the Galaxy Nexus inspired app drawer.  As a plus I am so grateful to Samsung for removing the horrible Social and Media Hubs.Of course however...in everything there are things you don't like, and this is no different.  The HD Super Amoled screen is great, but, I really wish that for this phone they would have created the Plus version.  The Pentile matrix is just inferior to the RBG RBG layout.  The ppi is high enough however to stop the picture from being blurry, so its just a nitpik. The things like SmartStay and S-Voice are frankly gimmicks though, and while they seem to have potential they don't really...work. Frankly Iris is better than S-Voice.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Alex Alexzander", "ReviewID": "R1LWXVRZ1YKIKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is without a doubt the best phone I've ever owned. I dropped the iPhone 4S for this phone. Didn't expect to like it more than the iPhone 4S, but kept an open mind and decided to try it out. Glad I did. The screen on this phone is amazing.I use Google services like email, calendar and docs. I wanted a more integrated phone and that's what I got. I switched from iTunes to Google Music, which is fantastic. I'm deep in the cloud now and I love it.Android is freedom. I am using the Swift 3 keyboard. I have a thing for great keyboards and I love how Android lets us choose the keyboards we want.Next, I went with GoSMS rather than stock SMS. Much better. Using TweetCaster Pro as my twitter client. Using Google Currents, Google Reader and Pocket for daily news. For notes I am using EverNote. For tasks, I went with GTasks to sync with my Google tasks.Using GMail, and Chrome for Android for email and browser. Google Music for music, BeyondPod as my Podcasting client, and Audible's own client for my Audible books. Google Play Movies for movies and TV shows, Google Books and Magazines for books and magazines.Google Maps and Places turn by turn directions and finding common places like coffee shops and so on. Facebook and Google plus for social along with the twitter client.There are tons of games. Cut the Rope, Amazing Alex, Angry Birds, Defender, FieldRunners and so many others. I have about 20 games on this phone. QuickOffice for office documents which ties into Google Docs and DropBox.There is nothing this phone can't do. And you get an amazing screen that makes my iPhone screen look like a postage stamp. With Apple, I got tired of the same design, same screen, same icons in much the same way. Hello widgets! I have HD Widgets and they are beautiful. My clock / weather widget is big, bold and beautiful. I can even adjust the color of the font!!All my banks are supported, and Mint is available as well.Lot's of GPS apps for running. FitBit, Loseit and so on to keep tabs on food intake and calories burned.I also found this super cool package tracking app called ShipRack. You email a tracking number and they add it to your phones Shiprack tracking app.Samsung gave me white headphones which have pause / play and forward reverse buttons. So I can control my music from the headphones. I also picked up a pair of UrBeats from the AT&T; store, plus a BlueTooth sports headphones for when I run.This is a great phone for business and personal uses. It's stylish and fast. You won't feel lag and you add more storage capacity for about $30 for 32 more GBs.Soooo much better than my iPhone. At least I think so. If for no other reason than the email client. So easy to email anything. We have a full file system which makes attachments a breeze.

It is a perfect complement to my Windows 7 computer. In a Iphone, all transfer must be done using Itunes, and it is very limited and frustrating-One of the best uses I can do is using this phone to download movies, music, and youtube videos, then when I am back home, transfer the files back to my Windows PC using simple drag and drop with windows explorer. Amazing! You cannot do it with Iphone, no way! You have no limitations using Galaxy 3.Android is based on Linux, and Linus is based on Unix, its power is astounding and amazing in the Galaxy S3. I tried and ran the old DOS Foxplus and Microsoft Foxpro database program in it, using a DOS emulator, and they ran perfectly, no problems! Better if you download a transparent keyboard in the play store. Amazing!Sometimes I wonder why Microsoft does not allow us to run in fullscreen our DOS programs  in Windows 7 and 8 like the Samsung Galaxy does. In this way, the universe of programs you can run increase dramatically. You can have both worlds, Unix( Anroid) and Microsoft DOS.Almost all the apps in the Play store are free, you can download the ones to suit your need. The selection of apps are comparable to IPhone IOS appstore. However, there are fewer games for the kids. But for adults, there are more, because adult apps are allowed. I spent more than a $1000 for apps for my IOS devices, and $0 for my Galaxy S3. There are many outstanding apps, including an amazing app for downloading Youtube videos at a speed faster than downloading a mp3 in a desktop PC, incredible!There are more beautiful apps for music and streaming using the Galaxy S3 than Iphone, because they are allowed and legal, and not allowed in the Itunes environment.Apple also made money from you by storage upgrade. In S3, upgrade using a 32 g. SDcard is just about 20-30 dollar, you have to pay more than $200 for a 64 g. Iphone.The processing speed of the CPU is faster than Iphone 4S, my Flipboard program run faster in S3. Most apps from the same vendors run better in Galaxy S3 than Iphone 4S, noticeably movie and music live streaming apps. I used this phone in America to streaming live tv program from China and Hong Kong, watch live soccer games from Spain and Europe, and streaming and downloading musics from other countries. Downloading a song of 4 mega is less than 10 seconds, faster than a desktop computer.However, I am a computer/math professional. From my point of view, Iphone is better for the majority of people for its easier user interface, Iphone just plug and play, need to learn nothing, Apple has done it fantastically to the mass with almost zero learning curve. Galaxy S3 is better for the professional who knows and understands computers and programming to exploit its resources. I spent some times exploring and learning my S3 interface and capabilities, at the beginning I was confused and lost!", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "As per Samsung no support and no US warranty...", "Author": "James A.

I tried to put a review up on the US version, but Amazon wouldn't let me. So hopefully this helps out people deciding to get the US version of the phone. In case people are wondering this is for the Sprint network.The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network. Other networks such at AT&T; and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far...

I had the opportunity to handle an iphone for quite some time and I really don't get why people like it that much, this phone is way better, has a lot of functions and a real screen. I absolutely recommend it.

The phone is awesome. I was scared at first when my old SIM car would not fit but thanks to the help of youtube you can cut down your SIM card into a micro SIM card (no guarantees) but luckily it did work.I contacted the seller and within 10 minutes I got a response.( I contacted the seller cause I could not get my SIM card in the slot so I thought I got a bad phone but then I realised that is how the phone is made, just like the  Iphone 4s it requires a micro SIM card which you should be able to get from your service provider.)So if you ever doubt ordering something so expensive. This review is for youIt came neatly packed, with headphones, charger, manual and the phone of course.So far the phones performance has been spectacular, the S voice is incredibly amazing and much more improved from the galaxy S 2.

I simply hated my EVO 3D, dropping calls... Keep rebooting all the time, and not built in great materials.So, I canceled my plan with SPRINT (terrible signal in San Diego), and I decide that I needed to have a great phone for the next couple years.Samsung Galaxy S3 seemed the right choice. I have to tell to you I have no regret about buying these handset for $699... Good point is unlocked... So you are free.The S3 is fast with Exynos 4212 Quad (CPU Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A9) plus the great camera... Also, the GT-I9300 doesn't have bloatware from the carriers, which you can't uninstall but only if you root.I have T-MOBILE now, valued plan.

T-mobile wouldn't spend a penny... at that time they were going to use the At&t; system.So, now T-mobile doesn't want to stay behind by the rivals. Which is great.

Let's be honest, years worth of iHype had convinced me that the iPhone was where it's at, and I needed to \"get with the times\".Typically, I'll keep a phone for at least a year before I decide to upgrade. I believe it's preposterous to constantly waste hard-earned money for the sake of technological acclivity. But, over four months after my initiation into \"Team Apple\", I couldn't possibly handle any more. I just couldn't.The Samsung Galaxy S3 is wonderful in all definitions of the term. What I, personally, enjoy most is the ability to customize nearly anything and everything. Hate the default font? You could change it. Tired of the standard SMS theme? You could change it. And... brace yourself... you don't need to jailbreak it in order to tweak it to your liking. If you can't customize the phone as much as you'd like by changing the settings, there are many apps that can assist you... apps that the \"App Store\" fails to offer.Overall, the phone is very smooth. From the ease of navigating the touch screen (which is proven difficult with several phones) to the availability of awesome features and apps, Samsung hit it out of the park. Whether you've been a \"lifelong\" Android fan or if you've never even held a smartphone aside from the iFail, the Galaxy s3 is for you. At this point, I'll never turn back.EDIT (12/19/12):I've owned this phone for a little over three months now. Unfortunately, I was forced to demote this product  from a 5 star technological masterpiece to a 1 star piece of junk. This is the PV2 of cellphones. After about two months of owning the phone, the battery life gradually became shorter and shorter. Mind you, I have never downloaded more than 5 outside applications on this phone. I have never stored more than 50 pictures. I have never even dropped this device. I basically use the phone for calling/text messages only.Even if I applied the \"power saving\" option and kept the phone in my handbag for the majority of the day, the battery would only last 5 hours tops. Then when I went to charge it, it would take 8-10 hours to obtain a full (100%) charge. Are you serious, Samsung? My iPhone takes 30 minutes to charge. Last night, I left my phone on the charger (I have about 5 chargers, so it's not the USB itself) overnight and woke up to an 80% charge.I was a bit unimpressed with the frequent crashes, also. It seemed as if this phone would crash at least once or twice per week.With all said, I was becoming angry at how this phone functioned. I ended up calling Verizon and switching back to the iPhone 4, which now seems like a work of art compared to the S3.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone in the world!", "Author": "Jimm", "ReviewID": "R137ST83PAJ9SS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 5/03/2013: Just read a post elsewhere where someone said Android was only good for web,email, and stupid games. I chuckled to myself and replied...Seriously? I'm not saying Android can do everything, but in the last three hours (while doing other stuff) I used my S3 to look up the current exchange rate for USD to GBP, updated an associate's excel spreadsheet to use the current exchange rate in several formulas, edited a professional four track audio file to delete an unneeded intro and shorten the song to the desired length and moved the key up two semitones and mixed it down to 2track stereo, then used it to drive from one part of Caracas to another using real time traffic updates to avoid the fabled traffic jams, here. If all one wants to do is web, email and games, why buy an Android product?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The unlocked international version that Yapper provides is just what I was looking for. I'll talk first about the not-so-obvious reasons why this phone is the best in the world. I love traveling and can't imagine being stuck with a stupid US model that only works with one US provider. This phone works great with TMobile and ATT in the US, and all of the GSM providers that the rest of the world uses... no roaming! Battery life is way better than my iphone, but even better is the peace of mind you get with being able to swap out the battery with a fresh one if you can't get a charge for a couple of days. (Yes, I can get a couple of days from the battery while the iphone can't even get one day!) The same USB cable you use to charge with is also the data cable that plugs right into the USB port of any computer (or tablet), allowing you to share files with the phone's memory or sd card. You can't do that with an iphone. Of course, you can also swap out the sd card, giving you yet another way to share files with others or simply add storage... can't do that with an iphone, either. I've only had this phone since mid June, but already I've helped out others several times by turning on the wifi hotspot feature that let them see my phone as a wifi hotspot and use my cell data connection for their laptops and tablets. These are a few of the not-so-obvious things this phone can do that others can't. The obvious things that make this phone the best include the big, beautiful screen, incredibly light weight and thinness, speed, buttery smoothness, availability of apps and no need for a computer or itunes! Finally, a real life example. We were driving near Seattle, trying to make three appointments in scattered locations that involved two ferry crossings (not realizing what that means in summer on a Friday!!)  While I was driving, she was using the the GS3 to check the web for ferry schedules at different locations, get upates on wait times, comparing alternative drive times, making calls, finding the nearest gas, and getting driving directions to three places we had never been before. As Friday traffic closed in around us (can you imagine how much traffic on a beautiful summer Friday in the Puget Sound?) we were able to avoid overloaded ferries, drive our way into reverse commutes avoiding miles-long backups, circumnavigated Puget Sound and made all three appointments. At the end of the day as we rode the last ferry across Puget Sound, she looked at her unused iphone, put it in the glove compartment and said, \"Wow! That was amazing to use the GS3. I can't go back to using an iphone, now... I couldn't have done all that in time.\" After a beat she chuckled and added, \"Just all the pinching and zooming would have driven me nuts!\"", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Kyle Christensen", "ReviewID": "R1KA0671RVBF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is fantastic.

The bootloader is factory unlocked and works without issue on multiple SIMs on USA AT&T.; It is important to note, however, that the quad-core exynos chip will not support US LTE bands so beware before you buy.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S3 surprise & update", "Author": "QNof Vertine", "ReviewID": "RIGCI0OGFB5XA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nov 1, 2012 Update on my phone. When it worked, it was great & I loved it. Now AT&T; & myself can't get it to work, even with new SIM cards. Won't recognize AT&T; data signals. So my $600.00 smart phone is now DUMB & I hate that it doesn't work! I can ONLY make & receive calls (maybe). AT&T; is unable to get my phone to work properly, 4 calls to customer service & 2 times at AT&T; store with no resolution. Samsung US will not help because it's international phone. I did not want an international phone, just an unlocked phone. So buyer beware, you may have problems with the unlocked international phone on AT&T; or T-Mobile.Oct 4, 2012 I'm being asked to review the Galaxy S3 GT-19300 international version Pebble Blue (which is ultimately what I received in the mail). HOWEVER... What I PURCHASED from Amazon (looking at my printed order as I type this) was, \"Samsung Galaxy S3 Unlocked GSM Smart Phone (Pebble Blue). Sold by TRD-Trading GmbH.\" There was NOTHING in the title or the product description/details to indicate this was an unlocked international phone. SURPRISE ON DELIVERY... The package arrived on 9/5/12 after the stated delivery date of 8/31/2012. When I opened the package from GLOBAL MOBILES, I found European charger, US adaptor, German & English language instructions booklets, German apps, German voice recognition, and some typed instructions on how to get phone to work on US cell service. Well I'm not a techno geek, so this was a little puzzling for me to figure out quickly & easily.I have purchased many items through Amazon and have always been satisfied. However, I was disappointed in the representation of this product. I would have wanted to know before my purchase that I was purchasing an international unlocked phone. Buyer beware, a little more truth in advertising.It took myself & the AT&T; rep almost an hour to get the phone working correctly & remove German language issues for the voice recognition. I was finally able to remove the pre-installed German apps after several days of attempts (they kept coming back), I think they are finally gone.  The ONE big drawback so far (aside from the initial stuff) the battery life is not so great & I have it on battery saving mode. I have to recharge every day. My old Samsung Capitvate went for days before needing a charge. Is there a solution for this battery issue? Otherwise, this IS a great phone. I'll take Android any day. Another BIG plus, I'm not locked into a contract & don't have all the bloatware that cell providers think you need & want.So far, I'm happy with the phone & when I figure out all it can do, I'll love it. I also think the unlocked international version is probably the better version.  Also, I have been unable to find the user manual for the GT-19300. The Samsung site does not show one & Google searches have not come up with any. Has anyone found the user manual for the Galaxy S3 GT-19300?", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent device; some comparison with the iPhone 5", "Author": "Sidehop", "ReviewID": "RMFPAQOTPQXA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will be long but for those trying to decide whether or not to get this between the iPhone 5 then hopefully you'll find the information useful.  My wife and I bought the phones together with GSIII for me and iPhone 5 for her.Overall impression after six months of use there are many good things to say about the GSIII.Galaxy SIII Pro's:- Gorgeous large AMOLED screen- The thin & curved design feels very nice holding it- Very fast with dual core (USA version)- Crisp videos* and photos that rival good point & shoot cameras- Customization is endless- Removable battery & expandable memory up to 64GB- Google products work flawlessly syncing- Lots of free apps compared to AppleGalaxy SIII Con's:- Battery life- The large screen may not be easy to one hand type or operate for a small hand- Not as stable as iPhone sometimes- microUSB is great but not as good as the iPhone's design- Home button is really in an awkward locationiPhone 5 Pro's:- Beautiful screen- Slim and easy to operate with one hand- Solid O/S and functions smoothly- The new connector is great with its flip flop design & secure- Tons of appsiPhone 5 Con's:- Too small for big hands and easy to fat finger when typing- Customization is very much limited unless you jailbreak- Many free apps on Android is generally charged for Apple- It feels a bit plain and boring after awhile playing with GSIII- Apple's own map app we all know was a complete failureWho should get the GSIII or the iPhone 5?  Galaxy SIII I feel is the phone for someone who wants to multi-task, do more than Facebook, watch videos and of course ADD like me who want to spice up the phone.  iPhone on the other hand would be great for someone looking for hassle free phone that's compact, solid performer and overall doesn't disappoint when it comes to getting the job done.More details on Galaxy SIII is below!AMOLED screen at 4.8\" is THE screen to watch movies; not with the iPhone that seems a bit outdated when it comes to screen size.  Sometimes bigger IS better for watching YouTube, Netflix and other movie apps.  No argument there that GSIII is a great entertainment phone.  I've been a photographer for over 15 years and I find myself pleased with taking quick photos with the phone that don't need editing or fancy results.  It gets the job done, crisp and the videos in 1080p is gorgeous.  Sure it's not 60fps and the max 30fps isn't ideal for fast moving videos but unless you're very picky, again, it gets the job done.microUSB vs Apple's new connector has no argument.  Apple wins here.  microUSB is somewhat universal now with their phone and is great but it's not as secure and great design compared to Apple's that have a flip flop design.  I still find myself double checking at night or in a hurry to see which side is up or down with microUSB chargers.I'm currently running Android 4.1.2 and is rooted.  4.1.2 did give me few more options and 'seems' like it's stable compared to the 4.1.1 where sometimes it would freeze once a week or so depending on the app.  Don't get me wrong here, iPhone 5 does have lockup issues as I've seen it with my wife's couple times.  But that's the thing, 'couple times' out of six plus months we've owned the phones.Where do I begin about customization.  I frequently change wallpapers, icons and themes using \"Go Launcher EX\".  There are others including \"ADW Launcher\" and few I cannot remember but these launchers transform your phone into something much better than what comes with the phone.  It's rather boring without using custom themes on your Android device.  I've always said right out of box, iPhone/iPod Touch always had nice app icons that the whole world eventually started to copy including the Android.  Android on the other hand isn't like a fortress that limit you from changing things like Apple does with their product.  And often times apps are free if not cheaper so you get more bang for your buck.Customizing keyboard is one of the greatest option if you text, FB post and write emails often.  Swype is great but so are the aftermarket keyboard apps that give you more options in what works best.  This is where of course Apple fails and I don't like the iPhone's small keyboard as I have large hands.  It's right between large & XL for glove size so trying to type with two hands is a bit claustrophobic.  Holding it by one hand is better with the iPhone 5 of course; sometimes I cannot hold it with one hand try to complete a task with typing on the GSIII due to its size.Apps have grown tremendously and of course with the dual core processor, I can run the latest edition for Need for Speed on full graphics just fine.  I didn't think one day a phone could handle something that was limited to PC's and consoles years ago.  It's a blast honestly.  There's just too many reasons why we're glued to our phones and these little computers don't help the addiction either.Now let's talk battery life.  I always have it on power saving mode which does help but also I can recommend using apps like JuiceDefender Ultimate and if you're more tech savvy then Tasker would automate things you thought wasn't possible without an app.  For my use I generally have the phone tethered with USB using Klink (best tethering app that use carrier's DNS, not free DNS with other apps) so the charging isn't a problem.  But if I play Need for Speed, watch movies or do heavy multi-tasking, I can easily drain 30% of battery life in less than an hour.  Sat idle with some phone calls, the phone will last all day long without any worries.  It doesn't eat up a lot of battery even if you're on the phone for an hour.  It's known to drain more battery while browsing the net and like mentioned above, watching movies and doing something that requires the processor to work harder.No problem with heat issues; it does get pretty warm playing games, recording videos for long periods (20+ minutes) and watching movies.  But as long as you're not in a hot climate and beating the crap out of the phone you shouldn't have any overheating issues.  I've yet to encounter an incident where the phone shutdown other than a charging warning when I had the heat turned on during winter in the car and it was making my phone warm near the vent.If you're a Google product user like myself Android is godsend.  I practically use the calendar everyday, Gmail sync'd including Google maps favorites and sometimes use the voice feature.  Galaxy S-Voice is okay but nothing spectacular so I won't do much review there.  The technology is somewhat still limited and I do find Google's own voice recognition does much better in identifying what you're saying.Speaking of failed maps attempted by Apple, Google Maps is very solid on GSIII and using it with navigation.  GPS is very quick in the car and of course you have the offline option so download areas you drive often on Wifi and if for any reason you lose connection or in areas that have spotty service it'll come in handy.  I also use Waze and is very smooth.  In fact I have the phone setup to use a dash cam to sometimes which I forgot to mention; with the Anti-Shake mode on video you can record a very smooth video without the vibration from the car.  It'll help when you're shooting a video outside and get that annoying shake even though you think you're holding it steady, the option helps out a ton.And buy a 32GB microSD flash card if not larger memory card if you shoot a lot of videos and photos.  20 minutes of 720p video will easily run you close to 2GB of data.  If you're parents like myself definitely get a bigger card and back up those data.  But it's a great tool to capture quick moments of your little ones on the fly without having to take out a camcorder or a giant DSLR with lenses and flash.I'm done yet!  Flash...oh my.  The light on this thing is POWERFUL.  It'll blind you if you kept staring at it.  I have the free flashlight app and can light up an area better than most expensive LED flashlights.  I've ran it for 15 minutes straight without an issue.Of course there are tons of aftermarket accessories, screen protectors, cases, etc.  The options are unlimited.  On my car, I use Mountek MT5000 mount which secures the phone on the CD slot which works perfect.If there's one major complaint then it would be the home button.  Not sure why it's located so low to the screen; if it was moved 1/8\" up it would make a huge difference.  I feel like I need to curve my thumb quite a bit just to hit home.  Maybe some may not find this a big deal.  Battery life is always going to be an issue with slimmer phones but it's not a deal breaker for me personally.  Overall design is breathtaking coming from HTC and other older phones.  Samsung did a great job there.It's a very fun device compared to the iPhone 5.  It can do A LOT more than what the iPhone offers.  Again if customization, multi-tasking and hoping to do a lot more for your phone then the GSIII is for you.  But if you're a casual or FB/email/text/browser user and don't care for all the fancy bells & whistles then iPhone 5 might be the ticket.

I have had the phone since June of 2012 and in terms of performance the phone has more than met my expectations with one major flaw - this is the most fragile screen I have ever seen on a phone!In November of 2012 while in Norway on business trip I dropped the S3 phone from my pants pocket onto the floor of a bus. The distance of the fall was about two feet (distance from the seat of the bus to the floor) and the phone at the time had a screen protector. Regardless, this short fall led to the screen shattering in numerous places. Fine... My fault right, I dropped the phone. I called Samsung Norway and was told to take the phone into a repair center and repair the screen at my expense... Done.The phone was quickly repaired (entire screen and digitizer assembly were replaced) and the phone functioned well for a few months albeit I was much more careful with the phone which had in addition garnered the protection of a sturdy case (this takes away from the glamour of having such a thin phone but hey it was worth it to not have to deal with another broken screen).In January of this year, despite my increased care, the phone again slipped out of my pocket, this time falling a distance of about three feet while exiting a vehicle to land on snow covered concrete. Despite the new coat of armor, again the fall resulted in the screen shattering in numerous places. (As an aside, when this screen shatters the phone becomes very unusable as it results jagged pieces of glass being exposed, definitely not finger friendly).Once again, and with slightly more frustration, I called Samsung although this time from the US. I'm sorry to say that they were extremely unhelpful. As I have the international version of the phone they could not recommend a service center, and instead continuously referred me to the international long distance phone numbers for Samsung China and Samsung Hong Kong as they do not make or service the international device (far be it from me to think that when I call Samsung they would service their own products or at least have the ability to transfer me to someone that could).Now I am left again with a phone with a broken screen contemplating paying hundreds more of my own money to have the screen repaired. I have been a loyal Samsung customer for years (this is my fourth Galaxy Phone and I recently purchased the Note II) and while I will be the first to admit I do not treat my phones like fine China, I have never before experienced a phone with such limited durability (the Note II in contrast has demonstrated phenomenal durability). Google Galaxy S3 broken screen and you will find hundreds of similar stories! This is terrible and is clearly a design flaw inherent in the phone.All in all, this is a great phone as long as you treat it like fine China and don't expect it to survive real world conditions (and if you break it don't count on Samsung helping you out, at least in my experience)... I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this phone even though I love everything else about it.Thank you for reading my review and please comment if you've had similar experiences.

Some have worked with Samsung in the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, and numerous other destinations. Many other customers, knowing that they were purchasing an international version of the item, purchased third party warranties through Square Trade, Geek Squad, and other such companies in the industry to make sure that they were covered in the US. We cannot take responsibility for an item purchased so long ago as we do not get anything to uphold other companies' warranties. If the company decides to void their own warranty, for whatever reason, that is not something that we are able to uphold. A Motorola phone that I owned stopped working one day and when it was sent to them, they stated that the phone was water damaged. There was no water damage when the phone left my possession but that was their reason to void the warranty. So, I do understand your frustration and there is a manufacturer that backs us to uphold their warranties but, unfortunately, Samsung does not.

I was sickto death of the restrictive iOS and iTunes, so after demo'ing this S3 it was a no brainer.At first I found Google Ice Cream Sandwich a little frustrating, but I was complicating a verysimple straightforward operating system. Once I stopped thinking so much I found it veryintuitive. And its a joy to be able to connect your phone to your laptop and have Windowsread it just like any other hard drive while its charging. My only complaint about the OS areall the apps that start automatically and are eating resources in the background, they haveto be turned off manually, there is no free app that will accommodate an auto-lock of theseapps unfortunately. But with 2G of memory you can live with it.The screen is astonishingly crisp at 720p, and the color balance is perfect. Its well suitedfor playing games or watching movies in your down time, and there is zero lag. The Zeitlupemedia player app makes this a real treat when watching your favorite entertainment.The resident TouchWiz launcher is terrific, its easy to learn and use, and is very smooth whenopening folders and apps.

The iPhone is attractive and has high-quality hardware and feel, but I really do think the Android software is better AS LONG AS you mind taking the time to get it set up -- and this will require you to be something of a sleuth to uncover all the apps and user forums that will enable you to get things running just as YOU want them to.  Once done however, that's the big draw (to me) of having an Android phone -- it will run the way YOU want it to,.  iPhones just do as Apple tells them and if you want something different, well, tough toenails!A few pros and cons about this phone:-- Setup and syncing are not perfect with an iPhone either.  You'd think that would be true, but it's not.  Having said that, like I said already, you will have to put a LOT of effort into getting an Android phone the way you want it.  Especially if you are technologically challenged like me.  I'm at two months and counting.....-- You can get an app that will back up your text messages to \"conversation view\" in Gmail.  This is great if you ever have important information in there that you need to look up via computer or if you have to change phones.  There is no way to do this from an iPhone.-- Ease of use, for example the \"back\" button is hard-wired into the phone so in any app it's in the same place.  You can also organize all the icons on your home screens any way you want them (iPhone snaps them all back in place on the grid so this cannot be done).-- Contacts' pictures show up next to text messages, when calls come in and in my phone address book.  (It's the little things, but still!)-- The size of the phone is really quite ridiculous.  It's not any heavier than the iPhone and although it's skinner, the length and width are so big that a number of accessories can't accommodate it (so far I have had that experience with car stereo hookup devices and non-armband pockets/holders for the gym).  This is due in part to my keeping it in a water-resistant Ballistic case, but let's face it, at $300+ you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to it so I don't feel like I have any choice.  At least you will always be able to find it in a purse, but just be aware that your iPhone friends will pick on you for dragging half a laptop computer around!-- By far my biggest problem with this phone has been how freaking difficult it has been to get music transferred from my mac computer/iTunes to the phone!!!!!!  I finally got iSync to work, but on some forums they claim that it is a known issue that the Galaxies unmount micro SD cards all by themselves and then the data on the cards is lost forever.  Yes, I can tell you that it took several hours to sync music to my phone and most maddening, when that was finally done everything would disappear if for any reason I had to restart the phone.  Also, some playlists would not sync so I would end up with about half the music I had originally wanted.  Then upon trying to actually play them, I would get an error message saying  that the file type I was trying to play was not supported, which is interesting because I converted all of the songs to MPEG Audio format before I put them on my phone, just to be safe.  Thank goodness I finally realized that all of these problems are probably stemming from the manufacturer, not by my phone itself, so now I can try to get things resolved through the seller of the $20 SD card instead of the seller of the $300+ phone.-- The phone supposedly has a known issue with some exFAT external ED cards unmounting themselves; it is not clear what, if anything, Samsung plans to do to fix this.  >:(-- The Siri equivalent doesn't work too well (runs through Google), although I never could get Siri herself to do much either so I suppose this should be counted as a tie between the two.-- The battery seems to die a lot quicker, even from a full charge.I apologize for this review being so long and mostly pointing out the benefits and drawbacks only of Android vs. iOS.  However, I have never owned a smart phone before so I wouldn't be able to make a similarly detailed comparison between them.  I do know that the Galaxy and the HTC One are probably the top most popular choices and I'm thinking there must be some pretty good reasons for that!

Filippelli", "ReviewID": "R2P0640IUAG8BY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Samsung Galaxy S3 on the Verizon Network was my 3rd smartphone I've used and I chose this over 2 other competitors phones and I regret it. On the surface, professional reviews and many personal reviews don't cover this phones shortfalls. I'm sure you can read all the gush and glory elsewhere so I'll just get to my issues with the GS3 that I've used for 6 months now.1. Erratic notification sounds. You think all is normal but oops, you got a message and did not get a sound notification. Happens all the time with this phone. I use the one, basic, general notification tone for all my notifications, nothing complicated but you just can't trust that you'll get that sound every time.2. DTMF tones are a joke. Ever have to do phone banking or place an order, maybe call customer service and push buttons to answer questions before you talk to a person? This is also hit or miss with the GS3. I even called samsung customer service once for another product and their own IVR would not recognize the  poor quality tones produced by this phone. Wondering what was going on one day, I called my home phone from the GS3 and typed in a few numbers and there it was, the sound quality of the tones are very poor - like a worn out cassette tape recording from the 70s, really. Talk about a massive failure of such a basic phone function is really just not excusable.3. Lock screen behavior. I use the pattern lock screen for some basic security but what a hassle. Get a call, the screen locks, go to hang up, the screen locks, go to hit a button for input, the screen locks, I mean, don't you think if there is ANYTHING going on with a call that the lock screen would be, like, disabled? Noooooooo, it's gonna pop up when you least expect it to really make your life miserable. Now I'm using the Samsung lock screen and have checked and adjusted all the possible settings to keep this behavior from happening but it still does.4. Automatic Network switching. may sound complicated but it's a basic smartphone function to minimize data charges, the phone will use wireless networks within range for data transfer. Problem is, this phone won't let go of a poor wireless data connection in favor of a 3G or 4G connection. Samsung keeps saying they're gonna fix it but it's been about a year now and it's still an issue that slows or stops data transfer and literally leaves you hanging.5. Kies and car mode. I read reviews how great these are but in reality, they just don't work or require more work than the benefit. Kies is Samsung file transfer. It's not intuitive and complicated to set up. Car mode worked once where it read a text message after I tinkered with it (while driving), Thank Samsung for making driving safer! Just turning it on/off doesn't do it.6. Samsung Techtiles, These are little Near Field Communication stickers (that you can actually purchase anywhere for a much lower price) that manipulate many settings on the phone. yeah, in theory it's a nice idea but in practice, half the time it doesn't read the tile, sometimes it miss-reads a tile. A prime example of technology that just doesn't work properly. While we're on the NFC topic, the commercial showing that you can \"bump\" two phones together and transfer data is outright misleading. In short, that bump is at least 2 seconds and then it can take upward of a minute or more to get the file transferred.7. Battery life. Yeah, I'm going there! I'm not a heavy game player but I do use the calendar function often. That big fancy screen and whatever else is drawing the juice, puts the battery in the red zone certainly by the end of the work day.The GS3 does have a really nice camera.That's it, if you can live with these shortcomings, great, if you think you can't then I would say don't take my word for it, go test it out for yourself and see what I'm talking about. Good luck!", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite toy", "Author": "Gaynetta McClain \"mamamctribe\"", "ReviewID": "RMV0ANC1CUV6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my phone through \"Open Group Wireless\" fulfilled by Amazon. I have an Amazon store card and with that comes interest free payments on certain monetary amounts. I believe (not looking) that for anything over $300.00, there is a one year interest free payment plan on that item, or that particular purchase. If you purchase other items post, that transaction, they will not be included in your previous interest free deal, so keep that in mind if you choose to use the Store card and make sure to double check card conditions with Amazon on purchases over a certain amount.On big ticket items, I only buy from a vendor that Amazon backs, because returns are less of an issue and I believe the company is safer and more legitimate when fulfilled by Amazon. I once bought a sheet set from a vendor not fulfilled through amazon and everything stated about sheets online was a lie. The actual packaging said \"LIKE- 800 count Egyptian cotton\" but the vendor neglected to put \"like\" in the description and when I wrote a \"buyer beware\" review, I received lots of nasty gram emails demanding that I remove my unflattering review. I believe someone even called me and was nasty to me. I now choose very carefully,who I do business with on Amazon. They cannot police every company or individual who wants to sell, but the ones they do back, I have never had a problem with. I have read reviews about Galaxy 3 phones (not backed by amazon) having been opened, seal broken, because seller stated they needed to put the unlock code on the phone. This is not true, if the phone is a legitimate International Unlocked cell no one needs to \"add the code\", and avoid these sellers if you read anything about them needing to \"add unlock code\". I've purchased 3 unlocked Samsungs and never has there been a seal broken. The phones are unlocked, brand new, never used, from factory and only reason someone would open phone to \"add\" unlock code, is because it is a used phone that is specific to a particular company. For example, If the phone was an ATT phone and you want to use Tmobile, Tmobile needs the ATT code in order to provide service to that phone. All of the non contracted start ups allow for customers to bring their own phones and in the instructions it states that the unlock code from the previous phone company is needed. That is why a seller is putting the unlock code on the phone.OPEN GROUP WIRELESS has true, unlocked International, warrantied, phones and when you are paying more than $500.00 for a cell phone, that is exactly what you want. I read reviews about bad batteries, movie data already loaded on the phone (that means it was someone else's phone before you got it), batteries that were not even factory issue, bad chargers, inability to switch language, advertised as an International unlocked, but was not, and a plethora of other issues. If you receive the phone and seal is broken, taped over, don't do anything to it, except return it, because you will have an issue with that phone, it is NOT brand new, and it is not what it was advertised to be. If you go with the companies that Amazon backs, you will be fine. I paid a little more for that security and I have no regrets. My phone arrived by the date it was promised, It was not opened, box was completely factory sealed and changing language from German to English was as easy as instructions stated.I have purchased unlocked International cell phones before, so I knew that they were adaptable to contract and non contracted services and I've used them on both plans. After researching and reading that others went the Straight Talk route with the Galaxy 3, that was my plan.The cool thing about non contracted services is that you pay around $50.00 for a month of unlimited, everything service, and if one company does not serve well, pay another $50.00 to check out another company, until you find the one that provides best service to your area- it is still cheaper than being stuck in a contract.In the Straight Talk start up kit, there are 3 sim cards, a larger one, then ATT and Tmobile . ATT (as I was told by rep), has a mini sim  for the Galaxy 3, but  having already read that others trimmed the card down that came in the kit,  I did same and have no problems. I put both ATT and Tmobile sim cards in my phone and should have went with the Tmobile because I get better service in my home, but when I was speaking with the rep, I could not get the sim card to stop popping out. She said it may need trimmed some more. She also said if I was able to get it to stay, all I needed to do was call them back, switch sim serial numbers and then go through the process of APNs, in order to get data. Here is where some aggravation may come in. There are not enough categories on the Straight Talk APN webpage for the Galaxy 3 to get internet working, so I had to call for help, this could require patience. No matter what time of day I called, or that I tried again the following day, it took me half a day to finally be able to leave a call back. Just about every time I called, the recording said,  \"there was an unusually large volume of calls\" and they could not take mine, then click. When I did get through, the recording said  call back was 30 minutes, it was nearly 2 hours, but when I finally got a warm body around 8:30 PM, she stayed on the phone with me until I had internet. It took some trial and error to finally get it. I complained to her, that the website was not well equipped and about the long time in which it took to speak with someone, and she apologized. She said that the company was aware and they were taking steps to improve customer service.  The one thing I wish I had, that didn't come with phone, but which is downloadable, is a users guide. A quick start, manual was included in phone packaging, with details on how to access owners guide and I will take the time to do that, for I am not savvy in the smart phone world to know the full capabilities of this phone.The phone uses like a tablet, so I am familiar with how to obtain apps etc.. I love the large screen, the options, and the camera takes great pics. The one thing to remember is that if there are apps continuously running in the background, that will suck battery incredibly fast (learned that in one day). As for factory issued battery- I text for a couple of hours in the evenings, post pics, text off and on during the day, access internet, and check my email. At end of  an average day I can be anywhere from 67%-40% available battery usage. I charge it every night. The better battery will be a future investment.The key to a happy phone experience, is to buy from the right vendor first and foremost. What I discovered about the reviews, is that they are all grouped together and it is difficult to know which vendor a review is about, unless author mentions it. One can click on vendor, be directed to their page and then see reviews specific to them. That can take a very long time. There are also vendors who operate under more than one company name. BEWARE of these vendors. Amazon is my favorite place to shop and I do a lot of business with them. I may not be a savvy smart phone user, but I am a savvy, well informed shopper and do not jump for the cheapest price on amazon. Do the research, know what an unlocked International cell is supposed be before you buy. Contact seller to see if they need to add an \"unlock code\" to the phone you are considering to purchase. I wrote a vendor to ask why they operated under more than one (at least 3) company name. No reply. It is as simple as this, International unlocked under warranty, does exist. I have one, love my galaxy 3, got exactly what I was told I was getting- a brand new, straight from the factory cell phone. I got it from Open group wireless, fulfilled by amazon.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product got the Sudden Death Syndrome!", "Author": "Miguel Cervera", "ReviewID": "R2WT5WT1P13P7E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My SGS3 was very good, but all of sudden I got the Sudden death syndrome, I'm having problems with the warranty, since I live in Mexico and Samsung wont help because I don't have a receipt with the IMEI on it.Dont buy this product because the warranty dont works", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far, so good", "Author": "macxtc \"macxtc\"", "ReviewID": "R25I7VRALY66VP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone I purchased works perfectly with the carrier I intended to use it on.

Here's what I thought about the GS3: The screen is bigger, it already can operate on 4G networks, the operating system was just as fast (if not faster) as iOS and the camera took great quality pictures.  The Android system sticks with Google Maps, which Apple decided to abandon this time around, and you see where that got them.

When using S-voice the phone's data plan needs to be enabled or you must be connected to wifi.  I'm not sure why this is necessary as some of the voice commanded functionality does not require Google.  For example, 'Send message to Steve: Why doesn't S-voice work when I'm not connected to the internet?'

I will say however, there are some things that could use some improvement. Overall, awesome phone and would encourage all to buy it. Here are a few things I like, and a few that I don't:Battery Life (4 Stars) Just need to learn how to adjust your settings to maximize.When I received my shiny new phone three months ago after signing up with Sprint, I was a little disappointed with the battery life right off the bat. When I get a new phone, I spend way too many hours learning the new device, trying out all its cool new features and downloading countless apps. It didn't take long before I realized I was doing something wrong when my battery wouldn't last me through the day. The S3 advertised better battery life and talk time than any other smartphone on the market. This was one of the main reasons I bought the thing, so it was very frustrating to have it dying on me so quickly. Luckily, the S3 has a handy feature that allows you to easily look at what apps are draining your battery life. I found that my charge was draining before my very eyes because I had my personal and work email accounts syncing way too frequently. Now I set it up so that refreshes at specific times, which change depending on time of day and day of the week.Android Version (4 Stars) Outdated, but so is every other phone on the market.In my opinion one of the biggest fall backs of them all is that the machine is still running Ice Cream Sandwich (v. 4.0.2). If the S3 really is the phone of the future, why isn't every phone company jumping at the chance to get Jelly Bean (v. 4.1/4.2) on this device. It is important to note that there is a very small percentage of Android users currently using Jelly Bean, so it is not old news just yet.Text Identification (3 Stars) Inaccurate and causes errors, latest update helped some.The text identification features are not what I would expect from a phone like this. My 1st generation touch screen phone did this better than the S3. Things like capitalizing the letter \"I\" when it stands alone seem obvious, but the automatic changes do not take place on this phone. Other examples include auto punctuation of conjunctions and capitalization of proper nouns. The auto correct is shotty and does not catch much of anything worth while. The latest update has helped some, but still much room for improvement here. It would be nice if they had an easy way to put in punctuation without switching back and forth between alphabet and numerical text entry screens all the time.Talk-to-Text (4 Stars) Awesome feature but struggles at first, betters with age.The talk-to-text feature is incredibly helpful for texting on the go. You can use this feature anywhere you would type text. It is a little difficult at first, and it may not always pick up your words, but it will get better with time and practice. The machine just needs to learn your speech patterns and it will get better at learning how you talk as time goes on.S Voice (5 Stars) Galaxy could kick Siri's butt any day of the week.Just hit the home button twice, and up pops S Voice, Google's retort to the Siri function on iphones. Her name is Galaxy and she is just as good as Siri, if not better. Ask her to do anything from setting an alarm for you to citing the capital of Michigan. Just visit one of the helpful forums that give a lot of tips and tricks.Motions & Gestures (5 Stars) Cool new ways to easily complete tasksMake sure you check out all the cool motions and gestures that you can do to easily navigate and complete tasks. They found an innovative way to make shortcuts with ever dwindling buttons. The tutorials when you first get your phone do an excellent job of introducing you to these nice shortcuts.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great smartphone... so far.", "Author": "Deyvi Rivas", "ReviewID": "R1TXVOKANC13O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very light and great performance.

Operating system is fast; if you have previously owned an iphone you will find it quite easy to shift toward an android platform.3. Headphones have a good sound to them as long as you are standing still. If you're a jogger, you will find that the cable transmit EVERY little tapping sound right back to your inner ear. Solution? yes, run the cable underneath your clothes.4. On screen keyboard is not always accurate.5. Excellent camera: takes beautiful pictures and comes with several different shutter modes, including a panorama software.6. Many of the apps are free on the google play store.7.

The photos come out great and anything I view looks clear and bright. One let down was that they kept advertizing that you can minimize your video and txt, email, browse, while continuing to watch.

The GT-I9300 has a Quad Core 1.4 GHz processor. The specs on this page says it has a dual core 1.5 GHz. This is probably the Galaxy SIII I747 or the Galaxy S3 T999 that comes with a 1.5GHz dual core snapdragon processor.Know your stuff people!Update: August 15, 2013So she decided to try her luck and purchased it. I don't know what's going on with this seller and the specs he posted on this page, as well as the many bad reviews that this product has been getting. Way too many people complaining about phone being Chinese version, or not being the i9300 galaxy siii...or even saying the product is used, or the cables won't work etc....but she is having none of those issues.I inspected the phone thoroughly when she got it, made sure everything was okay. Turns out she actually received the international one, with the quad core processor and everything. Seemed brand spanking new, all seals were unbroken and it came with all the accessories needed for use. The phone came packed with Jelly Bean 4.1.2 and everything that it should have. The phone also has no branding on it(no T-Mobile sticker or anything).The only thing that alarmed me a little was that the phone, when turned on for the first time, came up in French. It was a simple work around though, I just changed the language in the language and input settings.

With a recent international release and a US launch right around the corner, we took some time to get acquainted with the Samsung Galaxy S III and put it through its paces.The US version of the phone, which for the first time is identical on all major carriers including Verizon, AT&T;, Sprint, and T-Mobile, differs slightly from its international counterpart in the hardware department, featuring a dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor as opposed to a quad-core Exynos chipset, but despite the CPU swap, the phone benefits from 2GB of RAM and LTE/HSPA+ 42 (depending on carrier) connectivity.HARDWARE:If you are looking for top-notch hardware, look no further than the Samsung Galaxy S III. Its spec sheet puts it on par with recent heavy weights like the HTC One X and easily place it amongst the most powerful devices on the market. The phone's hardware is built up around two cornerstones: a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor and a gorgeous 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display. Throw in 2GB of RAM and you are dealing with just about the smoothest Android 4.0 experience on the market.DESIGN:The Galaxy S III keeps things relatively simple. An 8.6mm profile appears all the thinner thanks to some well-place curves while a metallic bezel breaks up any sharp lines (the Pebble Blue color scheme seems apply named as the phone gives off the appearance that it has been gently shaped by nature, much like a rock at the bottom of a riverbed). You won't find many ports, only a microUSB connection for charging. With available adaptors it can also act as an HD video output. A power on/off/standby button and volume rocker are the only two physical keys aside from the standard Galaxy S III home button.Yes, the Galaxy S III home button is back, which means Samsung has opted to not go with Android Ice Cream Sandwich's software navigation keys.  The physical home button is flanked by two capacitive buttons, one that will call up the \"Menu\" functions and the other operating as the \"Back\" key. These keys are backlit and light up only when touched (the time-out can be adjusted or set to always on). We'll get to how Samsung has handled Android 4.0\u2032s multi-tasking function in the `Software' section.An 8MP camera handles picture and video, which can be recorded in full 1080p HD. The rear sensor is equipped with a flash and auto-focus capabilities and supplemented by a front-facing camera for vanity shots and video calls.As benchmarks will attest to, the average person won't notice much of a difference between the quad-core and dual-core versions of the GS3. In fact, owners of the dual-core version get a few added bonuses in the form of an additional gig of RAM and the ability to utilize the latest 4G networks. Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T;'s versions of the phone are equipped with LTE while T-Mobile operates on HSPA+ 42, meaning data speeds will be top-notch no matter what network the phone is activated on. Quality may be influenced by the particular carrier, but the phone's hardware provides solid, clear audio during calls.SOFTWARESamsung has not only gone to great lengths to offer one of the most impressive pieces of Android hardware we have ever seen, but also to add a level or richness to the Android operating system itself. Based around Ice Cream Sandwich, a new generation of Samsung's TouchWiz interface has been enhanced with human interaction in mind. Not only are we introduced to new gestures such as the ability to place the phone to your ear while viewing a text message to initiate a call or to pan between homescreens by moving the phone left or right, but Samsung has also made using the smartphone a more social experience with some new sharing features.NFC is utilized to both network devices for sharing photos and video, but also to take advantage of new Samsung's new TecTiles, which we have covered previously. Group sharing allows one user to stream a presentation, video, or photo to multiple handsets, while AllShare lets users send content to a television set or share files between a PC and their phone. Sharing even extends into the phone's camera.If that's not enough, Samsung has also included the new S Voice application, which allows users to command their phone using only their voice. The service offers plenty of functionality and is right up there with Apple's popular Siri in terms of usefulness. S Voice can call up a weather report, perform a Google search, get direction, or compose a text message with ease.Add in a customizable launcher bar, lockscreen shortcuts, and toggle switches in the notifications pane to control WiFi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode and more, and Samsung has just about covered anything. Well, except for multi-tasking, which, for whatever reason, is now accessed by long-pressing the physical home key. We can understand why Samsung might want to strive for consistency and keep the phone's trademark home button, but why they decided to forego Android 4.0\u2032s new set of navigation buttons (back, home, and multi-tasking), has me scratching my head. Multi-tasking still functions as it should, but as one of the central features of Ice Cream Sandwich it is a bit surprise that Samsung has placed it on the back burner, so to say.CAMERA:You want great pictures and even better features from your smartphone camera? Again, the Galaxy S III has you covered. The 8MP camera provides excellent photo and video, while an new capabilities make taking and sharing the results even easier than ever.While I was impressed with the results, things like Share Shot and Buddy Photo Share seal the deal. With Share Shot a group of Galaxy S III handsets can be linked over a wireless network to automatically share photos between devices as they are taken. Buddy Photo Share uses facial recognition to tag people from your contacts list in your photos automatically, allowing you to easily share pictures with your friends in them.Video mode has a few cool new features, including the ability to seamlessly snap photos while taking video (something we first same in HTC Sense 4.0) and a focus lock mode that keeps the camera trained to a certain focal point no matter where you move it, bringing professional level control over the final result.CONCLUSION:Consider me impressed. Even with a bit of apprehension about previous incarnations of the TouchWiz interface, Samsung still managed to deliver an intuitive and natural Android experience on top of hardware that really has no comparison (other than perhaps the HTC One X).", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Went back to my S2...which says something", "Author": "R Rated \"Keeping it real\"", "ReviewID": "RORXG8WHKWRME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the S3 for business calls, separate from my old S2 (personal use) which I've had for the past year without any problems and singing its (the S2) praises in the interim.  The S3 is 'touchy', meaning, I had to handle it far more delicately than the reliable S2.  Often the main screen would lock up requiring a re-boot which got to be annoying.  I failed to see much difference in speed in various movements either.  The equally annoying pop-up advisories on the S3 telling of what I could do with tilting the phone and other procedures was not something I was wanting so they kept coming in spite of my telling them ENOUGH!Making a long boring story more palatable, I returned the S3 within a couple of days and have decided to get another S2 for business calls.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:  I do want to be fair.  In thinking about it, the S3 has some features I failed to explore like the view-video while checking emails & other activities.  That may be important to many users but not me.  Also, the transferring of data by keying in the S feature to transfer data while simply backing the phone to another S3 unit.  Again, I don't know anyone else having an S3 so that was not used either.  I wonder how many others have that issue?  Maybe many, maybe few?Also, the S3 eliminated two electronic movement keys:  The S3 replaces the electronic up arrow to go to the home screen with a button to push.  All well and good but I found the button on the S3 unreliable on the first push, reguiring two or three pushes to get back and then finding multiple screens to deal with about half the time to sort out and get the outcome desired.  I like the electronic S2 up arrow which works every time.  Also, NO search electronic (microscope glass icon) on the S3, unlike on the S2.  No big deal except you have to sacrifice a space on your home screen for the S3.I think the S3 has many advantages over the S2 in terms of its internal software ICS or JB over GB but as a user?  I will readily admit to not being skilled enough to know the difference or able to test the added expertise to the point of seeing a meaningful difference.  So, if that's you, then go with the S2 and be happy.  If it's not?  Leave the old folk in the weeds and go boldy forward with the new technolgy and enjoy.

It's 3G, and I'm due for an upgrade on Verizon, so I thought maybe it's time for an iPhone.  Disappointed with the iPhone 5 features (and hype), I decided to go with the Galaxy S3 4G LTE on Verizon.  I LOVED it....for about 3 days.  I now hate it and am bringing it back for either a 4G incredible or the iPhone after all. Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm not going to try another one because my final criticism cannot be overcome (size).  So here's the issues in the FIRST WEEK:Heat:  The phone gets absurdly hot and at the same time drains the battery in minutes.  I'll pull it out of my back pocket, and despite being locked, there is some app running that wasn't running when I locked it, the phone is really hot, and the battery is low/dead.Mail:  Gmail pushes sometimes, doesn't others.  Might be a setting, but a frigging Google device should have seamless gmail.  And yes, of course I made sure I was on the network, etc.  I'm good with droidsVolume keys:  The keys are far too sensitive, seems like every time I barely tap them, the phone is on mute and I miss calls.Phone DIES:  On the 4th day I had it... *poof*...phone died.  Had to pull the battery and do a re-set.  Yes, this happened with my Incredible a few times, but maybe twice in two years..not on the FOURTH DAY.Screen Freezes:  Screen has frozen up on me about 15 times in this first week, if I'm on a webpage, the links do nothing; or in an application the buttons do nothing...then 5 minutes later it works again.Brightness adjustment has a mind of its own: Even when I set brightness to manual and turn it all the way up, the phone will decide to go dim on me so I can hardly see it.  If this is because the +/- buttons are being inadvertently pushed, I don't care...it's happening.RADIO:  This phone does NOT have an internal FM radio.  I researched it, and the European versions do.  I'm NOT talking about iHeart or another streaming product, those use data.  I'm talking about a regular built-in radio. My Incredible has one.  The headphones work as an antenna.  It works even if the phone isn't connected to a wireless network.  This phone doesn't, and that's lame.TOO BIG: The one problem I can't get past is the size.  I'm a pretty big guy, so I figured I'd get used to the size.  After a week....I haven't.  I pick up my old Incredible and miss it.  Yes, the screen on the Galaxy is amazing, but it barely fits in my front pocket.  Also, I like to run with my phone so I can listen to the radio (that this phone doesn't have...had to use iHeart), but this one is so big I can't ever get it to feel right and I KNOW I'm going to drop it too often.  This one is a deal killer.  Think REALLY hard before getting one of these \"phablets\"; to me the trade off isn't worth it.Bottom line:  The Galaxy screen is amazing.  The phone is wicked fast, and I love all the widgets I'm used to. Web surfing is amazing (when it's not frozen), and I'm sure the camera is great (I've only taken a few pictures), but for me,  this phone has WAY too many quirks. If I'm looking at my screen thinking \"now what?\" half the time...then I have no use for the thing.I am within my 14 days and am going to bring this phone back.And before you Galaxy 3 nuts flame me and tell me everything I did wrong, please understand:  I am an experienced droid user who REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this phone. And if you need to go through a list of \"fixes\" that could make all these issues go away, then the phone obviously has major design flaws.If I could get past the size, I'd probably try another one (there's no way these are common problems, is there?), but it's too darned big so I'm moving on.Now the problem is what to get.  The iPhone 5 supposedly has horrible maps and that stupid new charger or I'd probably just give up and go that route, but I'm thinking trying another droid....maybe the Razr or another Incredible.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Weak signal, light touch turns phone on or changes volume", "Author": "PLA \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R1MLO9ZR8JMMWW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got the Galaxy S3, I really liked it.

I went with the S3 over other phones primarily because I had a large music collection that I wanted to be able to put on my phone. So imagine my dismay when I spend $50 on a 64GB microSD card, only to find that the phone will recognize the card about 10% of the time. 90% of the time the phone either doesn't register that a card has been inserted, or thinks the card is empty when it is not, or recognizes that the card has music on it but will give me an error every time I try to play a song. It's incredibly frustrating, and from reading forums online I can tell I'm not the only one who's had this issue.That I can stomach though. What kills me about this phone is that it doesn't even do normal phone stuff right. For example, when prompted to update my Android OS to 4.30 I said \"yes\" and the next thing I knew my phone was literally unusable. I couldn't receive calls, every time I sent a text my phone would freeze up, and my battery would only last a few hours.

The phone is currently working well but when it was removed form the FedEx box and then from the original UPS box it was noted that the original Factory seal was broken and inventory labels placed over the broken seal, making it appear to the novice that the box still had unbroken factory seals.  Once inside found the items not well packed (i.e. they where rummaged through) and the headset was replaced by a non factory fake.

I was moderately upset at first that my carrier did not offer the iPhone, but I quickly began to overlook that as this little (but really no so little) phone began to amaze me.It can do essentially everything an iPhone can do and more! The operating system is user friendly, intuitive, easy to navigate. There were so many different things you could do with it, open app market and all. I had no difficulty learning how to use it to its fullest potential. Even my boyfriend, who had an iPhone 4S became jealous and seriously considered switching to android when his phone kaputs. My only qualm was that the screen was a touch too over-saturated - and the greens were much too harsh. Still, not too bad, and samsung screens are typically very excellent. The glass protecting the phone was excellent, Gorilla Glass. Very sturdy, and even after a complete year, only light surface scratches were visible.Fast forward to March 2013, and everything began to slow down on my S3. It still functioned, but it was no where near as zippy as before. Come April, it constantly crashed, it couldn't manage basic functions, such as texting and calling.I became very frustrated and questioned some employees at my carrier about it. I was informed that a lot of the S3 devices were slowing down, and apparently that's normal for Android phones. After doing some research, this isn't some anomaly either. S3s out of the box were just as slow. Conveniently the employees reminded me that the S4 was coming out and was faster than ever. Yes, of course, it comes out a month after my phone essentially became unusable.Considering that after all expenses were met, I paid over $600.00 for this device, and it only has a life of less than a year, I don't feel it's worth the investment. Yes, the operating system, app store, and overall customizability of the phone is excellent, and I would wager that it surpasses what Apple has to offer, however, does it really compensate for a device that lasts only one year?Sadly, you can't have it all. Come August my phone completely broke down, and I had to purchase another one. Despite the pressure from the employees to purchase the Galaxy S4, I went with the iPhone 5. Less friendly operating system, app store, and impossible to customize, but I feel that trade off might actually be worth it, if the device lasts over a year. My boyfriend's iPhone 4S is reaching two years old, and functioning essentially as it always has right out of the box, hopefully the 5 will do the same.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sumsung GS3  good product", "Author": "Garth George", "ReviewID": "R301UM02JN7HRR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had no problems with this smartphone after 3 weeks of use, It works really well, met my expectations in terms of battery life camera functionality, size, fit etc. The phone was delivered as was promised  .

My apps are pretty basic, including pdf reader, document reader etc.The problems:1. the phone restarts automatically without a warning.  My wife has the same problem, yes I was so impressed with the advertising that I had got her one at the same time.2. the phone takes time to respond.  If I want to make a phone call, I press the \"Contacts\" or the \"Phone\" icon, and then wait up to 5 seconds for the phone to respond.  Irritating.3. the phone goes to sleep and doesn't respond.  Just now, the screen went dark (it was fully charged so that so battery was not an issue), and the phone refused to wake up.  So out of curiosity I dialed my own number on my office land-line.  The call went through, and my land-line indicated that the S3 was ringing, but it wasn't ringing in my hand, the screen remained dark.  Then I took the battery out and restarted the S3.  This is not the first time that the screen went dark and I had to restart the phone to get it to work again.The battery life sucks, but that is entirely another matter.  This device just doesn't function as a phone.I know most people are happy with it, but I don't like it, and my wife is disgusted with it, as are a few of my friends.Now I am thinking of moving to the iPhone, I hear it is much more reliable, even though it is more expensive.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "All memory lost after 9 monthes.

You will be able to find apps that will accomplish what you need.The biggest draw back to this phone is that it is SLIPPERY!

I liked the ease of using the iphone but didn't like the fact that I didn't have flexibility in terms of adding memory or replacing battery. I didn't want to pay 100$ for 16Gb of memory when I can get it for $20. Also, the only problem I had with my iPhone was deteriorating battery life but there was no way of changing it expect paying the high charges. The intent of review is not to bash apple but as I have been an user I will compare the 2 phones. I have used the iPhone 4S, so can make a more recent comparison.- ease of useI think apple is still ahead in the area but not by much, There is a bit of learning curve with Android and it took me a couple of days to get used to it. Having said that, my 1 year old can unlock iphone but can't do the same with galaxy. Also, answering the phone is more intuitive on iPhone. However, one of the best features of galaxy is the drop down notification bar. I love that I can switch to the airplane mode or disable wifi w/o pressing 4 buttons. Also, iPhone fits better in smaller hands but for me galaxy is not a problem.- typingIf you have a smartphone, you will type and for me Samsung wins. The best feature is that it doesn't force auto-complete down your throat. It gives you word choices including what you are tying. I am bi-lingual and this is a great feature when I am using my mother tongue. Also, in the swype mode galaxy does a pretty good job of providing context based suggestions.- display and soundI don't care for retina display, galaxy is the winner for me. same for sound- battery lifethis is a tie. My wife's iPhone lasts longer even though she is a more heavy user but I can change mine :)- memory: samsung (read intro)- appsthis is a tie for me. I get most apps on both platforms and to be honest I am not a very app intensive person. I have about 25 apps in all- softwareiTunes wins, this isn't even a contest. Kies is pretty hopeless- photos:iPhone does a better job with stills and galaxy does a better job with movies. Galaxy really suffers when taking shots in the dark.

Which is the best? I've had the iphone since the 3G and had become some what bored with the slow pace of Apple incremental changes. Frustrated with Apple locking the user out of everything, forcing the use of itunes with no alternatives and hitting my pocket every chance they could, I broke down and bought the S3. It was love at first sight with the big screen, the many choices, the eye candy and many options. It is really more fun than the Iphone I thought. However, I must admit that the overall experience felt strange and a little confusing to me. I guess one could write it off as just being used to iphones. But I am computer savvy. After a couple of days I realized I was struggling with the extra size of the S3. I have fairly large hands and made more errors when texting and generally had to use two hands to navigate it most of the times. I did love the expansion sd card slot and removable battery, unlike iphones. Viewing movies  on the S3 is a breeze and you can download mp3s and movies through various apps. Android  is more open source for apps and some of those apps reminded me of viruses on Windows. Crazy popups and redirects. I had to download Norton just to get one stubborn little app to leave. I have to say that I feel much safer with Apple when it comes to security.I soon missed getting podcasts or using the dreaded itunes I loathed but have become familiar. I really missed using my iphone as a remote for Apple TV, which also allows easy viewing of my photos and videos wirelessly to my big screen television. Google play offered a few remote tv android apps for the S3  but they were subpar. One thing that really stood out to me was the fact that though I was disappointed with the iphone 5s very small screen stretch, I missed how natural the size felt in my hand. The iphone is much easier to navigate one handed, the S3 is top heavy imo, and tends to want to topple out when using one hand. Then it hit me. There really is not a clear winner between the iphone 5 and the S3. I purchased the S3 for $149 with a two year contract extension and saw it 3 days later at another store for $99 plus a $50 google play gift card. I figured the S4 may be released in a couple of months so I brought the S3 back to where I had bought it. I'm back to my iphone 4 and not obligated to At&t;  anymore. And am quite content. I will be watching out for the S4 release and the iphone price drop and may get back on the merry go round. Really like both phones actually, but would clearly have to say that the iphone is much simpler for the user. The S3 may be a bit much for those who eschew learning curves, but has much more wow factor.

Which means the standard MHL connector you would use on any device will not work with the S3.  So you buy a fancy S3 phone that has MHL and you buy a MHL adapter for it.  Then you plug it into your TV and you do not get a working TV.I am going to guess the reason why they did this is to force S3 owners to buy MHL connectors only from Samsung.  That way they could charge a higher price and make a larger profit from the larger margin.  In short they want to charge you more and give you nothing in return.  I did some quick searches on MHL adapters on amazon.  The Samsung adapters for the S3 cost over twice the amount of MHL adapters for standard phones.  That means they are making well over double the profit.You can read a sight that talks about this here: [...]Samsung's only defense for their parasitic behavior is that they are adding capabilities to the connector by running the high def and usb over different pins.  But that doesn't stop them from using the standard connector.  The current manufacturers are running the high def connection over the same 5 pins of the usb connector.  Samsung just as easily could have made their connector work with both the standard MHL and their proprietary MHL.  That way if you buy a standard MHL connector it would work with the S3, but if you bought Samsung's improved MHL connector you would get more capabilities and therefor have reason for spending more.But they want to gut their customers, so they didn't.  Instead they made their connector proprietary and charged double for it.  It also seems they even chased competitors out of the market of producing a economically competitive version of their own connector.  Look at [...]  It would allow you to use a standard MHL connector with your proprietary S3 device for a low rate of $3.57.  That sure beats Samsung's markup of 100%.  But even this you can't have, it is \"discontinued\".  Samsung probably legally intimidated the manufacturer out of the market.  So buy a S3 and reward parasitic behavior, or shop another brand until Samsung comes to its senses...  I say shop another brand.  As for me, I didn't have a choice.

I suggested manufacturers defect etc, but you never know.. maybe I didn't handle it delicately enough? Maybe I should have carried the phone around wrapped in Bubble Wrap? Not sure.. But I can tell you my wife's Iphone 4s has been through drop after drop after drop and hey... it works perfectly..And of course I have a Case surrounding my Galaxy 3 that was recommended by the Sprint Store representative to essentially keep the phone from having a cracked Screen.. But, of course it broke.By the way, did you know that when you buy a Smartphone, the ONLY warranty from your Carrier or Insurance Company only covers the Electronics and Software?  So, if you buy the phone, walk out of the store and the screen cracks, it's Not Covered unless you send it to the Manufacturer for 3 weeks for a decision from them on replacement.. And while you're waiting, Sprint doesn't offer you a Loaner or Replacement.. Thus, they Con you into using the Insurance they charge $8 a month for..Now, yet again, my Assurion Replacement phone cracked in front of my VERY eyes this morning. I pushed the HOME button at the bottom of the screen and guess what happened.. It cracked. Take a look at it.. It's awesome... Maybe I'm not supposed to push the ONE button on the Front Screen? Is it there for decoration? Maybe I should have had the phone in the Google Voice mode where you talk to it and never touch the front of the screen? Don't know.. but I do know one this so far.. Spoke to 3 Sprint representatives and they told me to go fly a Kite.. They are not standing behind the Products they are distributing.. Then I said to each Sprint Rep including a Team Leader and a Supervisor in location B56 by the name of Jason, that I googled my device model and found numerous complaints around the same issue. Guess what Sprint.. there are a lot of people out there with the same problem.. Stand behind the products you are distributing or don't sell them. I'm going to keep the links off this post for now.. Maybe Sprint will read my post and consider standing behind this.. if Not, I'm going to copy at least 3 of the links that show this problem happens a lot and that the screen is breaking/cracking essentially all by itslef because the users (me included) are not carrying around our Galaxy S3 in bubble wrap..

To unlock the phone via this method you need not only root but also an app that actually removes the region-lock. At the moment when I bough the phone there is no such a thing for this particular model, it does exist a hack for the Galaxy Note, but not for the G3-I9300.Nevertheless I rooted the phone and tried to unlock it with the Galaxy Note method without luck.After this unsuccessful attempts I contacted the seller again to return the phone, 2 weeks later they have not yet replied.Luckily enough there was an European friend who kindly lent me his SIM card and we did a 5 minute call and the phone was unlocked. But care must be takes as Samsung says it can re-enable the lock after certain time.So unless you plan to use the cellphone in Europe, or have an european SIM Card that can use to do a call, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE as it will NOT WORK.The Seller SHOULD INFORM this to the users!", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Lucdani", "ReviewID": "RLC2WXT3TQ58U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It Works perfectly!

However, how the company operates affects the product, hence this is a review of the product and the problems I have with it.This review was originally posted 10.02.12.Review Title: NOT FACTORY UNLOCKED\"The phone is unlocked, but ironically enough, it is not factory unlocked, although this is the only thing they chose to write in capital letters. When I turn on my phone I see the logo \"Yes! Optus!\", an Australian phone company[...] and this is also the case when I turn the phone off. I haven't fully explored this phone yet, but as this is signs of the phone not being completely wiped down and ready for unlocked use. I'm expecting problems down the way and when I do, I'll try to update this review. The price was a bit lower then everywhere else, so I was a bit suspicious. Received the phone in due time, so no troubles with shipment.UPDATE 02.28.13Since I chose to write a negative review of the company as well, I've was contacted by them. Their offers have been $40-$60 dollar gift card on amazon, and when i proposed that I deliver my phone to someone that could break it free or contacted yes optus, and have them do it on hasslefreecells bill, they did not respond to me.The logo itself is a minor issue. The main problem is that the phone is extremely slow. I've compared to my friends and the time it takes to access contact is around 2-3 seconds longer on my phone, although we have about the same number of contacts. This goes for any action on the phone. It might not sound as that much, but this is supposed feel like a great phone, not a slow old computer, that little by little waste away your time. Another issues is that is has aps from optus that keeps reinstalling themselves every time I get an update for my phone operative system. Some of them cannot be deleted.I've read some of the other reviews, which are quite positive. This only means that some of the jail-breakers they have know their job. However the phones are def. not factory unlocked and to pay 654.35 USD (this is what I paid) for jail-breaked SGS3, where some of them is really poorly jail-breaked, is an outrage! You might as well buy a locked one for next to nothing and then have someone else jail-break it, if that is what you wanted. That would have been one third of this price and it would be done properly.Do Not Buy this phone or any product from Hasslefreecell, they are not to be trusted.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Lie From Samsung", "Author": "SamsungLie", "ReviewID": "R3C6KRIVI71IUD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so excited when I received my Samsung Galaxy S3, I had been waiting patiently for it to come out. Having had a previous Samsung phone I had really high expectations for the new phone. Now if you are just a below average user I can see this phone being a great one, but if you like apps (like me) then it's a really bad choice.The moment I received it I started setting it up, all excited. But, it wasn't long before I realized that you are unable to move any apps over to your SD card. When I contacted Samsung about the issue, the \"customer service\" agent said that it's not a Samsung problem but the app makers are at fault and that all the apps are not made compatible with the Galaxy S3 because they were created before the S3's release.Which is a load of bull !I have had Motorola's, Iphone's, LG's, Nokia's, and previous Samsung phones and have never had issues with moving apps to the SD cards. Plus, three of the apps that were movable that I was trying to put on the SD card only came out a few days ago. LIARS ... that it is an issue with the apps and not their phone!The agent then went on to try to pacify me by saying he is a consumer too, and owns a S3 and he doesn't see an issue with Samsung not notifying the public that their phone is not up to par. If I had been told or read something from Samsung, when looking for a new phone, and found out that I was going to be unable to move any apps to the new 32GB SD card I just purchased, then I would have purchased a different phone.Another issue I encountered with my S3, is that my phone is supposed to be 16GB internal memory, but it's not ... it's only 12GB. Already hurting for space, I really needed those 4GB's. So with two movies and apps for work, school, weather, and personal enjoyment it's pretty much completely full. At least I can move my music and pictures over, but it's not that much help. In my head I keep hearing this repeating sentence, \"What a waste of time and money !\"When I requested a refund or even just a different phone as a replacement the agent told me that Samsung is unable to do so, and that I'm s*** out of luck. In their minds they don't see anything that they have done as wrong and believe their phone to be perfect ! In my mind if you don't inform someone of a flaw and don't do anything on your end when they do discover that flaw ... then you have purposely deceived, committed fraud, and lied to that individual(s).Now if you just need a basic phone and don't have a lot of apps then this phone I'm sure would be a perfect fit for you. But, if you are like me and love your apps, movies, and other items then you either need to purchase the 32GB internal memory Galaxy S3 phone or move on to something else.Best of Luck to all you App lovers !", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheaply made phone", "Author": "bramsey2016", "ReviewID": "R2GO0HEJD98GAO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a horribly made phone.

Before buying this phone I read many reviews and was afraid to buy one.  So many reviews were critical of vendors with statements like \"got a refurbished phone\", \"received a Chinese knockoff\", \"phone would not work right out of the box\", \"no warranty\", etc.  I emailed Straight Trading with a few questions and they answered me within minutes, all to my satisfaction, so I ordered from them.  The phone arrived very quickly and was everything Straight Trading said it would be.  It's a brand new phone in an unopened box with 1 year warranty.  I am very pleased with their service and their honesty.Now about the phone...  I have been using it without a SIM card for a week now just to get used to all of its features.  I'm very impressed.  I was able to transfer all of my contact and calendar info from a different phone brand easily.  It does much more than I imagined and the software has not faltered - no crashes or restarts.  My only issue so far is GPS navigation.  Samsung says you can navigate without an internet connection using only GPS, a feature I am most interested in.  You basically store the map area of interest in cache and from there on it's supposed to work using just GPS.  I have been unable to do this unless I have an internet connection at the beginning of my route to select the destination.  After the destination is selected and a route is plotted, you can then disconnect from the internet and all works well.  But, you must initially HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION in order to select the destination.  Without a connection the map works and it shows your location and nearby points of interest accurately, but you can't select a destination and navigate a route.  I still have hopes that this can be resolved but after two attempts with Samsung Online Chat, I've gotten nowhere.I'm about to install a SIM card and go on the AT&T; network.  If I have any earth shattering news I may come back and amend this review but other than the navigation issue, everything else has been working just fine.  Very satisfied with my purchase.2014 Apr 06.  UPDATE.  I have been using the phone now for several weeks and am very pleased with its performance.  Other than the GPS issue described above, all has been working flawlessly...no crashes or unintended restarts.  It's absolutely amazing what this phone can do.  It will take several more weeks to discover and try all of its features.  Battery life has been excellent; just don't turn Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other power hungry features on when you are not using them.

Btw the phone is very light, even lighter than then smaller Exhibit II. For those who complained about its \"cheap plastic cover\", I don't think that is cheap plastic, I think the material is chosen for its low weight.

When I had the Samsung Brightside battery life was pretty where the battery lasted for 2 days.  I have to charge this phone everyday and all day which is a bummer.  The battery  life on this phone is very weak.This is my second Samsung phone that I own.  Samsung makes great phones IMO.  I have never had a problem with them.  At first I had the Samsung Brightside with a slide out keyboard but decided to switch up to a complete touchscreen with no keyboard.  This phone is quite large and the screen is nice.  It is very wide and clear.When I first got this phone I was kind of surprised at how thin it was (it felt paper thin).  The phone is very flat and slim but the beautiful touch screen makes up for it.  I would recommend a phone cover to support its' slim weight.  The phone also came with headphones which was nice.The home screen displays the time day, date and the weather in your current city.  I really like that feature.  Other than that the phone has your typical features, such as youtube, internet, you can download games and music, camera, video, etc.The graphics is really clear on the screen.  If you look at videos on this phone such as youtube it is a little fuzzy but not bad.  Another feature I like on the phone is the lock screen.  When you touch it, it is like it is incased with water.  The camera is good also.  The picture quality is clear.The keyboard is excellent on this phone.  Every time you type on it, it has a water drop effect.  The touch screen and keyboard feels very nice.Overall this is a good phone.  I really like it and it is worth the money.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hi Galaxy!", "Author": "Cougar Alex", "ReviewID": "R3BWKWXFAF4WDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are considering purchasing this phone do it! I have gone through more phones since my sophomore of high school, when I got my first \"smart phone\", than many people go through and some of their lifetime. That being said I've had all kinds of phones. I started with my iPhone 3G, that phone was like my baby, which is until it fell a measly two feet and shattered. After that I moved onto an HTC. I'm sure you can guess that one broke too. I know have the Samsung Galaxy S3. I believe that this phones is one of the best phones I have ever personally owned and operated, ever. I have found that the software my phone uses is easy to navigate and is pretty much dummy proof Since having this phone I have definitely formed a Samsung product biased opinion. The operating system that runs my phone is easy to use, fun to use, and gives many interesting and cool options for my phone. One of my favorite features on this device currently is the new split screen feature that the phone got with the newest software upgrade. It allows me to use two apps at once. I can be waiting for an important email on one half of my screen and on the other half I can be texting or surfing my twitter feed. Next thing about this feature I enjoy is being able to listen to songs on YouTube while texting people, tweeting, or going on Facebook. I can do any of the two features offered at one time. This comes in handy when I am waiting for an important email or message and still want to be surfing through my social media. Another feature on this phone that comes in handy is that it is compatible to SD cards. This comes in handy in the situation that if my phone ever decides to give out and shut down I can have everything backed up into a SD card to have all my photos and other personal items from my phone stored to something. Many iPhone users will clamed \"I have iCloud\" or \"My photos are backed up into my computer\" but there is always that underlying issue of your computer failing you or your iCloud not being one hundred percent. With the SD card compatibility and you can simply upload them anywhere you please with the SD card. Another aspect that that iPhone users tend to argue is \"well I have siri\" or \"my phone is better because it talks to me\", well think again, this phone talks to you! Double click your center button and say \"Hi Galaxy\" and she will wake right up to answer all your questions, desires, wants, and needs. Don't be fooled by the iPhone illusion. There is much better things out there, like the galaxy S3 Next the camera, front and back, are great! The camera, front and back, are high definition and very useful. . The front screen camera comes in handy for apps like Snapchat and Instagram. It also is very helpful in easing the necessity of the infamous selfie. The back camera comes with a super bright flash and it also takes awesome pictures. The phone itself comes with some cool filters installed into the phone and it has a phenomenal zoom! The bright flash also comes in handy very much if you ever get trapped in the woods for some weird reason or if you can't seem to find something in the dark. Another cool thing about this phone is that the battery has a fairly moderate battery life. I find that I can have a full battery in the morning and still have battery left at the end of the day. Also the screen is very large. What is good is that it isn't so large that it is like carrying around an iPad but it's big enough to have with you every day. You can also find some really cute cases for this phone on amazon for cheap. Also for all those people that think this phone is just the new fad for the new generation and there technology, you are wrong! This phone is very user friendly and high speed for a smart phone.  This phone comes with a fantastic internal and external speaker. This comes in handy if you do in fact have impaired hearing or if you just like to hear everything very loudly. Overall I give this phone five stars! It's easy to operate and handy to have. If you're having second thoughts, think no more. The choice is clear buy this phone to keep you busy for the next two years. All you have to do is say, \"Hi Galaxy\".", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Yonatan", "ReviewID": "RNO5P7XO8MN4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a great cell phone, great pictures, i recomen to anyone, its easy to use. you can expand the memory", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Smart Phone", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R1SXB5P74BCWO7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I love the phone.

But - if/when/where service might be needed - well, that's another matter.  I contacted Samsung with detailed info on the phone and where I was located - they shuttled me from South Africa to Hong Kong to USA both phone and websites and no one took responsibility for who do you send the phone to for service if/when needed.  I contacted the seller who - so far - has failed to answer the two simple questions of (1) in what country did they buy the phone (2) when did they buy the phone. This is Samsung's request, not mine.  I contacted Amazon - so far three times.  They are working diligently and so far doing a good job to contact the seller asking them to provide answers to these two questions. I believe Amazon has gone up the organizational chart a notch or two to help resolve this issue.  So far, this is not resolved.  I will update my review when I have more definitive results.  Until I update my review I urge prospective buyers to find out where they should send the phone for service (if/when needed) before purchase.  UPDATE 18 July 2013 - Surge Telecom replied they purchased the product in the USA from Samsung directly.  But the warranty is for Samsung Latin America.

I am biased toward Android phones. Actually, I briefly thought about getting an iPhone solely because of the number of options you have as far as software, accessories, etc. However, I have always HATED the small screen of an iPhone. When I heard the 5 was going to have a larger screen, I was interested. When I saw what they actually did with the 5's screen, I was sorely disappointed, and knew I was sticking with Android. I used to love HTC as my last 3 phones were from them (starting with HTC touch). I felt like they lost their touch, no pun intended.So I went to this phone. I believe it is better to purchase a \"mainstream\" phone as more popular devices receive better ongoing support. Coming from the Thunderbolt, I was never even going to see an ICS update, let alone Jelly Bean. Anyways, to keep it short and simple, this feels like a real phone to me. It is zippy (especially with the JB update), has a large, beautiful screen that is easy to read, has 4g, and has a pretty decent camera to me (although I am no authority on cameras). The only downside is battery life isn't what I expected. It's definitely an improvement to what I had on the Thunderbolt, but this is where they need to continue to focus on improving. All in all, I don't know how you can not like this phone?

Of all my phone upgrades, this one is my favorite - from galaxy s2 to Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue).There is a huge improvement in wait time at boot up and that includes comparison with other phones that don't have carrier software/bloatware.  Overall, my expectations have been more than exceeded in the areas of:speedresponsegorgeous screen giving better google navigation experience as well as movies, etc.better size and shapefeels more durable and less like plasticimproved intuitivenessI let google and amazon backups restore/install to my new phone and everything was seamless except for one thing.  Where oh where did the microphone key go on the keyboard?  I love to dictate just about everything!  oh no!  It took me 30 minutes to find the answer.  Hold down the settings key, until you see the microphone key.  Select the microphone key and now the microphone key is where it is supposed to be on the keyboard and one must remember that if you want to change keyboard settings, you must hold down the microphone key until you see the settings icon key to select.This phone requires a micro SIM and I let a friend with a micro SIM cutter cut it rather than following the YouTube videos on how to cut yours with a knife or scissors.  The micro SIM cutter looks like a hold bunch and really makes sure everything goes well.  Amazon sells them as well Noosy [2nd Generation] Micro SIM Cutter, with 2 SIM adapters (Color: Black or Silver) and/or iCoolkit New iPhone Nano SIM Card to Micro /Stander/ full SIM card Tray Adapter Holder which I think is well worth the money if you don't have a friend that already purchased one.I just adore how I can customize and optimize phone to my usage and preferences.With all my other upgrades, I have held the phone and asked myself \"is this worth the $$$ to upgrade to this phone?\" and after careful consideration I decide yes but just barely.

It is the first smart phone I have had, I haven't even figured out how to do the touch sharing thing that they advertise the phone with. It's a pretty awesome phone but it does have some problemsFirst off, the screen freezes. It doesn't happen very often, maybe once a month since I've owned it. I don't know if that is something that happens with all smart phones, but apparently, it needs to be restarted every once in awhile. It doesn't seem to make a difference if I have the phone off for a few hours every day, since I turn it off while I'm at work or in class. I've talked to other s3 owners and the same thing happens to them as well.I don't know if this is the phone or the provider (T-Mobile) but sometimes my phone won't receive service. This happens more often than the screen freezing, restarting the device seems to fix this problem as well-which leads me to believe that it's more the phone than the provider. This one annoys me more than the screen freezing because I've missed several important calls due to this problem. Technology is making it possible to do all kinds of amazing things, but we shouldn't be moving backwards. A phone should still have the ability to make and receive phone calls.They break REALLY easy. Mine hasn't broken but I have a cover and screen protector on it. I have two friends with s3s that they were using without covers and both of them have cracked the screen. One of them cracked while it was in my friend's pocket. He doesn't know how it happened. So if you're going to buy this phone, I strongly recommend a cover and screen protector.Overall, I like the phone and what it is capable of doing but with that kind of drawbacks, I think I'd rather go back to having a simple phone.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "not usa friendly", "Author": "moparviper", "ReviewID": "RBXDBPDATSO27", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and paid for one day shipping.

I have had it for about a month and a half now and it is a great phone.The Camera is phenomenal. It takes pictures quickly and the quality of the photos is amazing. I had the HTC EVO before and that also had an 8 megapixel camera, but the s3 camera is just so much better. the evo camera hesitated, but this one focuses so quickly and takes the picture the second you press the button. Also, there is a burst shot option so you can take action shots. I think its a great feature. I have used it once (i haven't really had many action shot opportunities), but i did enjoy having it as an option and i thought it worked really well.Some people complain about the phone's size, but it doesn't bother me at all. Compared to the HTC EVO, the screen itself is bigger, but the phone is only a tiny bit taller, and about the same width. the s3 is also significantly lighter than the evo and easier to hold because of the rounded sides. The design is really chic and modern. I love the look of it.The graphics on the s3 are also gorgeous. The screen is so clear and the graphics are really defined which really enhances the experience of using the phone.I like the battery life as well. It lasts more than a full day, however you probably couldn't go two full days without charging it. The evo had terrible battery life. I would leave my phone in my backpack at school all day and barely even check it and i would get home with 20%-30% battery. With the s3, i do the same and come home with 90% battery. The battery actually lasts surprisingly well when i play games and am constantly checking twitter or texts, while on the evo, playing one game for a short time practically drained the battery.Overall, the Galaxy S3 is a great phone. It is easy to use and figure out and has some great features. I really like the widgets it comes with, and if you pull down the bar on the top, you can see your messages, emails, updates, etc, but you also have the major settings there. You can easily access the wi-fi, bluetooth, gps, sound, screen rotation, airplane mode, and even power saving mode. I love this feature because with the evo i had to go into settings and find the right category to turn certain things on and off. I especially love being able to access screen rotation so easily because i generally leave it off, but i like it on if i'm looking through pictures. I definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a new smartphone.

The first thing I notice was how thin and fragile feeling it was, which immediately set up a red flag in my mind. As a result, I paid close attention to how I handled the phone and made plans to get a cover the very next day. I activated the phone and fell in love with it instantly. The next day, I pulled the phone out of my pocket as I walked into the wireless store to buy a cover and found the screen had broken while in my pocket. I had not bumped into anything, I had nothing else in my pocket. Additionally, the pants were not tight, so the phone moved around easily in said pocket. My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void. I would LOVE to be writing a glowing review of this phone, but instead I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth regarding this so-called \"warranty\". I will likely steer as far away from Samsung as possible in the future. I had an LG that fell from a 6 foot high railing onto a concrete patio and the only thing that happened was the battery falling out. This fragile hunk of plastic broke in my pocket.

I had to wait until Wednesday for the mini to micro SIM cutter to arrive before I was able to use the phone on T-mobile network.  I have purchased Apple phones since iPhone 3G was introduced but changed to Samsung Android phone last year.  I have purchased both Palm products and various Windows mobile variants prior to Apple OS.  I have purchased at least one, sometimes 2 phones every year since the early 90's both in USA and Japan.  I have purchased 8 smart phones since 2006.  This is the first time purchasing a mobile phone from Amazon.Pros:I agree with most of the posted positive reviews so I will not repeat the great features of this phone.Cons:1.  Data speed on T-mobile network is EDGE, same speed as iPhone 2G (2.5G technology; 200 kbps download and 100 kbps upload).  If I use Samsung phones sold in USA by T-mobile I can get >8 mbps download and >1 mbps upload at same locations.2.  Gorilla Glass 2 easily cracks.  I have multiple cracks across the entire screen after dropping the phone from approximately 3 feet, less than a week old.  Touch screen and LCD is working fine but I must deal with very visible cracks.  Unfortunately the glass is fused to the display, and the display to the Galaxy S III's frame.  I must purchase the entire display module including the glass, LCD, backlight, touch screen and the metal frame.  The cost of this module is $300 plus shipping.  I have dropped my previous phones many times (iPhones and smaller size Samsung phone) and never damaged the screen in the past.  I may consider paying $7-$11 per month for insurance even with a $200 deductible for my next phone.  I will most likely purchase a new phone from Amazon with a contract (Less than $150) and use my international unlocked phone with many cracks when I travel outside USA.3.

I mean I've always wanted a bigger screen and I'm a chick so keeping something in my pocket doesn't matter to me - so when the e-mail came from BB that my pre-ordered iPhone 5 would not be arriving I decided this is God's way of telling me to get the Galaxy S3 :)Drove to BB on \"iPhone 5\" day and picked up my brand spankin' new S3 and then straight to the mall to get ripped off of $40 by Zagg because I just can't get those darned shields/skins to go on right myself.Turned on the phone and was floored by the big pretty screen although I have to say I must really be spoiled by the Retina screen because while everyone talks about the great screen the only thing great about it is it's big.Battery life was initially terrible until I downloaded this battery juice app and while it improved it I still have to charge the phone everyday (unlike the iPhone 4)Now while I'm a long time Mac user (I'd estimate since about '98) I always thought the whole Apple love fest was a little over wrought UNTIL I would try to go back to Windows (last time I made that mistake was over 8 years ago) and then I'd remember that I just really appreciate the whole Apple aesthetic.The same goes for the whole \"Apple just more intuitive\" meme - but I guess I've finally learned that (for me at least) it's true and darn it the apps are just \"prettier\".  You can actually Google why are Android apps so ugly and get lots of hits.Little quirks that are specific to me but may also matter to you:I prefer the way the home screen on the iPhone alerts you to missed calls.I like my push notifications.For some reason my Optimum app (cable company) finds both of my DVRs but the Android version only finds one and the iPhone version lets me watch TV on my Phone and the Android version does not.The only thing I prefer about the Android is the widgets.Bottom line is I paid $199 for this phone with no sales tax in New Hampshire - now I am home in NY and I am going to pay $218 for the iPhone 5 and flush the $40 I paid to Zagg down the toilet and pay another $40 to get my iPhone 5 wrapped - so I'm essentially going to shell out and/or lose almost 100 bucks because that is how much I just cannot stomach this phone in comparison to the iPhone.Now I wrote this review because a lot of the reviews I read about people who switched from the iPhone to the Galaxy were overwhelming positive and really gave me the final push and I wanted to add a disenting voice to balance those reviews out.

Eveyone I talked to said that this phone had the next best camera to the iPhone and that is pretty much the only reason that I didn't go with the Motorolla Droid Maxx HD (which does have gorilla glass).What I do like about this phone: the talk to text for text messaging and email is awesome! You dictate the message, including the punctuation, which has saved me so much time.  The swipe to type is okay but not great (the talk to text is better).  The camera and videos are nice.  The phone is fast and has a nice, large screen.Now, for what I don't like: the screen broke from a fall of only 3 feet!!  I practically threw my old Motorola Droid (first edition) and dropped it from multiple heights onto tile, concrete and macadam and the screen NEVER broke or scratched!  My Husband has the Droid three and same story, dropped many times without problems.  I also don't like that this phone doesn't always auto rotate.  When I have it in the car mount, the home screen does not orient to horizontal but most of the apps will when they are open.  The phone doesn't have a \"driving mode\" like the Motorola and does not \"play\" as well with all the Google functions as my old phone.  when you are in the text mode, if you turn the phone horizontally you can barely see the a single line of the text message that you are trying to replay to.  The email app that comes on the phone, sucks and even the wireless guy said \"don't bother\".

It has so many awesome features, the screen is incredible, the camera is top notch for a phone camera, and the software... while sometimes a little laggy... is easy to use. I'm not going into specifics about all the cool stuff you can do with the S3 because there are tons of reviews here that do it for me. I agree with them! All of them.MY issue with the S3 is something I wish I had been told before I purchased the phone. Had I been told, I probably would have opted for something different... aka the I5. (Even though I freaking hate all things Apple... they make repairs affordable and easy!) My S3 made it less than a month before I shattered the screen. Typically this would be a time where I bemoan my timing (my otterbox came in the mail about two days after this incident) and curse my clumsy nature BUT the fact that I was sitting in a fully carpeted room (it's actually extra padded carpet because it's a classroom designed for toddlers under two year of age) in a chair designed for a preschooler... it might not even be 12 inches off the ground (not very comfortable but HEY! I needed to sit down to paint with the kiddo's!)...the fact that the screen was completely shattered from top to bottom after taking a tumble of maybe 14 inches onto a padded carpet... WELL! I mean what do you say? The salesperson at Verizon told me about this \"gorilla glass\" stuff and made it seem like the designers of the S3 had taken the fact that screens break all the time into account. I just want to know what kind of gorillas Samsung is basing their strength tests off of. I mean honestly?So anyways, I didnt have insurance (yeah I know.. boo and hiss to me for not being prepared) but I didnt have insurance because I A. Treated the thing like it was a newborn baby B. expected to have it protected by the big bad otter box and C. I haven't ever dropped/broke a phone so I didnt even think about it when I was researching which phone to upgrade to. So I call Verizon and they're pretty much like \"Sorry, you're SOL.\" I call all around the Atlanta area looking for an independent repair shop... every quote I get is over $300... for a SCREEN! When I dropped it, I was upset, but I figured since the touch screen still worked that it was just the surface glass that needed repair and it wouldnt cost much at all. Wrong. Samsung has made it incredibly easy to replace the screen of this phone by selling the LCD/glass/digitizer as a pre-attached piece. Aka... even though just the glass broke, you can't replace JUST the glass. I mean maybe some super hi-tech adrenaline junkie could do it with some super fancy tools... but no professional would. Being friends with a few tech savvy people I think to myself \"I'll just go buy this silly hi-tech screen part and have someone smart fix it! Parts are always cheap, right?\" Wrong. Amazon, ebay, ect ect... every screen replacement part was either a blatant rip off or cost over $250. SO I finally call Samsung (I waited to call them last because I figured their repair would take forever and it would be super expensive... it ended up being $180 so not SO bad but still...) and I get the order processed and all goes well. The repair is awesome and everything is just like new. However, I feel like this phone was made to make Samsung's repair technicians jobs easier and they didn't take the customer into account at all. Surely a screen breaking is the most common issue with all cell phones so I dont understand why any company who has the consumer in mind would make it so expensive to do what should be a simple repair. It kind of blows my mind.Not a week later, a friend of mine also broke her phone. Only she had it in a case! And it broke IN her pocket. She had insurance and had to pay $90 (not including tax or shipping)to get a whole new phone. Sigh...I don't know. I just feel like they either should've made some gorilla glass that lives up to the name or they should have made repairs more cost effective for their customers.End of story, awesome technology... but I'm not sure if it's worth it for the super flimsy nature of the phone! I shall be wrapping this newly fixed phone in bubble wrap in addition to the otter box and praying that the next time I'm due for an upgrade that they have made bullet proof/shatter proof glass screens.

While the phone is stylish and filled with lots of new technology, my experience was disappointing to say the least.  The phone was unconfortable to hold for longer phone calls, too thin along the edges to grip comfortably for me.  The screen was beautiful, put in spite of contantly killing tasks and shutting off wireless, bluetooth and GPS the battery would drain extremely fast.  I was constanly looking for the charger to plug it back in to top the battery off.  Just seemed to be too energy hungry.  Then to top it off it kept locking up and after repeated trips to the cellphone carrier, rebooting it, reactivating it and resetting it to start over from scatch again - 15 minutes later it was locked up once again.  Finally the store ran a diagnostic test and decided to give me another phone to try.  Connectivity on this one seemed to be a bit sub par for both the network and for wireless, maybe it was just my bad luck, but I gave up and got a Motorola Razr Maxx. So far I have been very pleased for all things that smart phones are supposed to be able to do.  The battery life too of this phone is phenominal compared to the Samsung Galaxy S III doing the same things that were draining the Samsung right down.  It is a bit bulkier, but I like the feel, it feels sturdier and with the thicker edge it is easier to hold even though it is a bit heavier with the more powerful battery onboard.  Maybe the looks are not as sleek, but I do not feel like it is going to slip out of my hand as easlily either.

Now that is not ok because lets be honest who has that much time to keep the phone on charger. I also noticed that the phone sometimes get stuck at specific % for an hour or more. I looked up the issue on the web and apparently I wasn't the only person complaining about this problem. So many people are having the same issue with charging time.Samsung has done a good job with the big screen and phone shape and weight including functionality. But when it comes down to practicality they failed in my department. I honestly can't wait to go back to BB when the new BB10 is released sometimes next year.I'm surprised this phone is being praised so highly on amazon.

I had a blackberry with the raised keyboard but thought it was time to upgrade. I use my blackberry for everything. My to do lists, memos, calendar, contacts-personal and my business contacts and some pictures. The only thing I have been able to transfer over were my contacts-which are now copied twice and my pictures. All my calendar info did not copy over. I went on line with the goggle calendar & wasn't able to sync my outlook calendar that was perfectly on my blackberry & desk top. I have tried 3 times. My calendar included my yearly to do list, birthdays, household maintance tasks -like recycling. My memo list had wines I liked, books I want to read, books I read, business ideas, info on clients. The verizon store person told me I have to re-enter the info by hand. Someone else told me to try Radio shack & they might be able to transfer the info... I just need to find the time. The picture quality is good but I have 2 great cameras so I really don't care about the camera. The size is much bigger that the balck berry and I realize I prefer the smaller lighter black berry. Also the key pad had the automatic speller- it took me one week to decide to change that setting to off. I do NOT like the touch key pad, I spend more time retyping the entire sentence in order to correct one letter of a mispelled word. I can't get the cursor to go in the position I want. I had someone tell me this phone can open my garage door-that's what I have a garage door opener for. Just give me back my calender and memo's that made my life run smoother.  I am seriously considering getting a different phone. For me it doesn't match my needs. So my advice to others is think about your needs before purchasing this phone.

I made a mistake of buying a Galaxy S3 phone a few months ago and I regret that decision ever since.Here are SOME of the problems I've been having with this phone:1) the battery has a very short life. If I don't use the phone by the afternoon it is low battery and by the evening it is dead. And it takes a LONG time to charge the battery. It is a very slow process.  And have to charge the battery all night long and any time I get a chance during the day.2) The screen is nearly impossible to see when out side in daylight. I have set the brightness to the maximum, and have disabled all auto adjust, it is still very dark gray background in the day light and I Just can't see the screen. It is very frustrating.3) The silent mode, it is very hard to set, but it sometimes goes on silent or comes out of silent mode by itself.4) Almost ALL the apps on this phone don't work.. for example the phone app gets stuck sometimes and does not receive any new mail, but it does not gives you any indication that something is wrong.  It may be hours or days before you know something is wrong. And the solution (according to the at&t; representative) is to remove the mail software and reinstall it.4) Most of the GPS apps don't work properly. I use an app when I go hiking that keeps track I where I have been and how far I have walked, but most often it takes 45 minutes to get the GPS signal, By them I'm I my way back and it is of very little use to me.5) the on/off button and the sound +/- are set in opposite side of the phone and in front of each other , as a result when I want to turn the unit off it also changes the sound. So the sound may go down to silent without noticing it.6) The ear piece has a rubbery piece around it that makes it sounds like you are hearing things under water. I finally got fed-up and took the rubbery piece off, bow it just scratchy and uncomfortable.7) Every once in a while the internet app, comes up with an ADD page that I have not found any way to get rid of it. The only thing that works is to close that page and start a new one, hoping that another add does not show up.8) LAST but not least is the sound quality. Unfortunately, we have our contract with AT&T; and the sound quality and OK at best. Most often is  very very poor.  But this is the AT&T; problem, We have complained before and they blamed it on the phone and wanted us to get a new phone, well, here is a new phone and the sound quality is not any better.Do yourself a favor and don't get a Samsung galaxy type phone.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hodgepodge of poorly functioning features", "Author": "Ari S", "ReviewID": "R1XAY0FBYP25I0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used this phone for over year.

This phone goes from 100% to 50% battery charge in a heartbeat and then the power saving kicks in, and it seems to work more efficiently but you've already lost half of your charge.  It's confusing to the point of madness and Android is filled with bugs too numerous to list. I have had all kinds of strange issues and Google offers no support whatsoever.

Prices will go up as sales decline, and so will taxes thanks to the elected big government advocates and those who keep them in office. I simply have nothing to benefit from Amazon's business anymore.Worldwide Distributors is a Marketplace vendor for Amazon and is also a good reason to find another source for your cell phone needs. They claim to be a California based company and so charged me tax on this order before the Amazon September 15 deadline. California based companies typically have my packages delivered to me within two days. However, there was no  indication that this product was going to be shipped from Florida. Now a week later it is still in transit.For some reason it takes four days for this company to prepare its shipments when bigger companies often have my orders shipped out on the very same day. I then asked them to send my package with USPS since both FedEx and UPS have a record of losing my packages, but some companies have no concern for your needs despite the little statement they send out saying:\"Our goal is for you to be completely satisfied with this transaction\".Uh, well, this is the curt reply I received back to my request:\"We do not ship this item via USPS, it will be shipped FEDEX for international and UPS for states thank you.\"Yep, that is a real attempt to satisfy a customer.  No?So now I have to wait for nearly two weeks for this item to arrive after its excursion across the US because Worldwide Distributors is too cheap to take a couple of dollars of the huge profit they are making off this sale and provide overnight or second day service as they would do for their friends. Now under the care of UPS, the chances of this high interest item getting lost are tripled when it passes through the notoriously evil downtown LA distribution center. Ever wondered why your UPS packages look so beat up when delivered?So, Worldwide Distributors, don't ever expect to get any favorable review from me.The Samsung Galaxy S3 is second in popularity to the Apple iPhone. It is highly praised for its abilities, many of which are better than what the iPhone is capable of, and covered to a greater extent by real experts. So you won't really benefit from a review of this item by me, and I will only update if UPS loses my phone, or if the phone Worldwide Distributors sends me turns out to be a real piece of useless trash.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad", "Author": "aaa", "ReviewID": "R3FNJA74UK86DO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "very bad and slow the lg optimus t is a lot better and cheaper. one drop on carpet and screen cracks", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R1R91YFCPPIVUM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I nicely ask them if i can get the product before xxx date and without asking me they canceled my order.What a terrible customer relationship.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "buying question", "Author": "kira", "ReviewID": "R1DUEHL8F3QZ0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "do i get the phone only or do i get the full box with the battery and everything else?

Which is exactly what is deserves.  I hate Apple with a passion for it's canned, forced nearly communistic package.  But i should have never have switched from the iPhone to this junk.  One grace of the S3 is its screen.  Big, crisp, good resolution.  That is where the positive ends.  Texting - By default you have to turn off 3 'built in' apps just to get it to act like a normal phone.  And even after that you still cant stop the 'slide'  on most phones if you hit a button that is what the phone takes as the input.  On the Galaxy S3 it doesnt take the input until your finger leaves the surface.  You can slide all day long and it wont choose a character till you let go.  Secondly if you turn the phone horizontally, you cant see any of the previous messages.  So if you are replying you wont be able to see what was said before.  Calls - Yes it is the 7th used function of a cell phone yet it is probably one of the S3's worst functions.  Call clarity is sub-standard, currently my S3 wont answer until someone calls me twice.  the first time goes right to voicemail.  when i call out half the time it rings once and then disconnects.  Verizon Wireless says it has to be some software as the network is operating properly.  If you want to use the keypad after a call connects you have it on speaker or use a headset or the phone goes blank (dark) after one key.DO NOT BUY THE GALAXY S3.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung SIII", "Author": "ebusemih", "ReviewID": "RB6EKCGMTK2O4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Samsung SIII received, but I'm not satisfied with the product quality is not enough, the material is quite simple, I do not recommend.

The SK model(s) will be tomorrow. I bought the marble white N.A. model and it's crap. Let me tell you why:* You HAVE to buy this from a carrier on a contract favoured to the carrier without 100% insurance. If your credit is not on par then you will have trouble.* IF you buy this somehow from a reseller without a contract, read the fine print regarding their return policy.* The N.A. version is dumbed down, period. This phone is for dummies if not on contract. Why? It is over-valued as price and risk of loss are higher than over-all value.* If you drop this thing and it breaks, GAME OVER. You will have lost your money and then have to spend more to replace it.THIS THING IS PLASTIC and GLASS. THE PRICE IS HYPED AND OVER-VALUED!!! I cannot stress this enough.Now, if we lived in a World where You and/or I could buy this phone anywhere, anytime for any provider AND easily purchase rock-solid insurance at a very reasonable price, then I'd agree that this is a keeper. BUT IT ISN'T. Sure go buy an Otterbox brick-sized case for more money just to protect it. Not from water though, nor from loss/damage or being stolen.If this thing was backed by Samsung with these sort of common-sense, simple, cradle to grave considerations, or at least a map to where this exists, then they could be very consumer-friendly, BUT they're not so don't be a dummy and get sucked into the hype before you truly THINK about how your earnings are help putting who out of business.I support Android, but these handset makers easily detach themselves from product responsibility when crazed cellphone consumers see tunnel-vision.Look for a company that insures any cellular phone with rock-solid fine print and commitment to consumer justice.
