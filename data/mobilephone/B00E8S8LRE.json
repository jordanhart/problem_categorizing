Money was no issue in acquiring the best 7\" phone on the market, but if it was I would be golden! And so can you!Anyone reading this is likely interested in a one-device solution and more specifically a true phone of a tablet. Now some of the other reviewers 'issues' are more strengths than they may realize. I will explain how these \"problems\" are actually the selling points for myself and perhaps you as well.~~~RESOLUTION~~~1024 x 720 resolution is same as the Ipad 2, but squeezed into a 7\" screen = not bad at all, I'd say very good even and it has that Samsung *pop* with the colors, I have no complaints. Is it as good as full HD, or even 1280x800, not quite, but there is a reason for this resolution as I see it and that's 8-10 hours of battery life - a true all day battery! If you had the choice would you choose 4 hour battery life for full HD? I would not, the battery life is the main selling point aside from the screen real-estate. And in any event, 1024x720 is the best resolution you will find an any device with full phone capabilities, that's just the hard facts folks.~~~IS IT WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY JUST FOR ADDED (FULL) PHONE CAPABILITIES?~~~Yesssssssssss! Yes, yes, yes it is. Here is why: (1) With an actual assigned IMEI# you can get SMART PHONE PLANS, even the TMobile TRULY UNLIMITED plan for $30/mo!I have tried this with the Nexus 7 2012 and 2013 FHD LTE and it is just not possible. The AT&T; model (Tab 3) is faster and  also has 3g/LTE, but you cannot use a smart phone plan with it because it is not a PHONE - the 211 is! (2) $30/mo. for TRULY unlimited T-Mobile, vs $91/mo capped at 4.5GB with AT&T; (and having to use Google Voice exclusively for calls/texts which in theory worked, but in practice, it SUCKED!). You will earn 300% ROI on the price difference in a year of ownership. (3) It's a Samsung Galaxy! The sexiness alone blows away any other 7\" PHONE solution. Where aluminum can shame plasticy devices in most cases, in this case the Samsung plastic is somehow hypnotic and truly is beautiful. You know what I mean!~~~Downfalls I do agree with~~~ *Internal memory, the 5.3 usuable GB is fine for me, but most people will have a hard time with this. Keep in mind this is just for apps and movies, songs, video & pictures can all be stored on a removable SD card - I recommend the 64GB Sandisk Ultra! I would personally fork over a hundred extra dollars for 32GB of internal storage and many others would to, but companies tend to not enjoy competing with their selves though this is Samsung now...haha. *No IR Blaster on the 211 model, that was a real shame to find out!CONCLUSION:We are LUCKY to even get our hands on this in the USA - this version was not meant to sneak in here and allow us a true phablet for $280, but it did, so enjoy it.I challenge anyone to find a better 7\" PHONE - the Tab 2 is the only competitor but it is too bulky with the larger bezels. And yes I am aware of the specs and the capabilities of the Tab 3 8.0 PHONE (311 model) and I would grab for that over this on my bed or couch any time, but for on the go, the 7.0 is the obvious choice. With the slimmer bezels I have not really even got any 'looks', or rolling eyes as with the original Note when it came out - a few \"wows\", \"I want ones\" and mistaken it for a Note 3, but not a single negative comment or look - even when I forgot my ear piece and held it to my head in public. Everyone wants one for themselves!I also have a Galaxy Mega 6.3 but could not bring myself to return the Tab 3-211 and over time grew more attached and now here I am writing a review about the lower resolution being a good thing, but I did at once bash it, stating never me.... You just need to realize that 1024x720 is the best resolution of any 7\" phone and you will realize that it is actually really perfectly acceptable, especially when watching a movie or Netflix when you completely forget it is not full HD.Bottom line:This is the best 7\" PHONE money can buy and it doesn't take a lot of it to buy a Tab3-211!The battery life is absolutely an acceptable trade-off for the perfectly acceptable resolution.Using GV exclusively to call/text over 3g/LTE is a nightmare and will cost you more, ironically enough - the phone capabilities are absolutely worth the extra money in the same way an S4 or Mega is better than a Nexus 7 2013, if you need a PHONE!It's a (uber sexy) Samsung Galaxy!GET IT AND JUST TRY TO SEND IT BACK! ;)", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Samsung Combo PHONE and TABLET works wonderfully as a LARGE phone and as mini tablet! A detailed review!", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RWJNIQ82H4HBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is just what I was searching for as it is a tablet and an 100 percent GSM UNLOCKED phone! I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have so many overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this phone/tablet out to great lengths and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this amazing device. *This is a excellent choice in an ALL IN ONE device. For me, I use it as my primary phone with no contract plan that includes minutes and a small data plan. (Most of the time, I am on WiFi for the internet but I need my minutes to make and receive phone calls etc).Also I want to state that the phone accepts a MICRO Sim card, not a regular full sized Sim. Since I had an old Samsung Tab 2 3g with a regular Sim, I just removed my old Sim Card from the older tablet phone and cut the Sim with a Micro Sim cutter, placed it into my Tab 3 phone/tablet and my data was there, my minutes were there, worked great!Also this tablet installed an update to the OS from December 2013 and this tablet phone runs so fast now!If you are looking for: a lightweight combo phone and tablet that is very easy to hold in one hand comfortably and you want a basic and easy to use tablet, then consider this tablet. While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies. And as a bonus, if you request it, I will share with you how to get Archived Flash so you can watch online videos on the tablet. And I encourage you to ask me questions in the comments (should you have a question) about this tablet and I will answer all questions. Here are the Pros and the Cons below.PROS:1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is good in most places I tested. And I received a STRONG WiFi signal on this device.2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB.3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily.4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port.5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages.6- I had a Tab 3 7.0 WiFi only and sold it to a friend, bought this one and find that it is a much better tablet.CONS:- Low internal storage - this tablet comes with 8GB internal storage (advertised). Because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage. This is not good because when you install an app from the Playstore, it goes onto your internal storage not on the External SD card. (The external SD card is meant for personal files such as your music, photos, home movies,etc).**The GOOD NEWS IS: If you do not install a lot of huge games onto this tablet, you will probably do just fine with this storage.- Heat \u2013 Under normal conditions (when not running intense games or downloading files etc), this tablet runs very cool. It did get up to 102 degrees ONCE when I downloaded lots of apps from the Playstore, but then it went back to a low 80 degrees after that. This is normal though for this particular tablet, not a cause for any alarm.Bottom line and Summary:Would I buy this phone tablet all over again? Yes in a heartbeat! If you are looking to buy a LARGE PHONE that you can use as a MINI TABLET, this is the one that I recommend to you as I love mine!Since I am a techie, you can ask me any questions in the comments under this review.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good tab/phone for the price", "Author": "Juan Flores", "ReviewID": "R7Q0GSPNEEWG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice tab/phone.

The speaker phone isnice and loud the way I like it and it has an extra volume feature wich is cool too. The head piece is loud too.I watched a movie on it and the speakers are plenty loud.  The tablet has real good battery life all day  moderate use. The 3g internet is not bad could be a bit faster but for the price of the phablet its acceptable. Uses a micro sd sim and has an sd card storage to ad a card if needed.Review update!Had to add that my tablet has been freezing on me its too bad . I really like it but Its also lagging on me wich I latter found are a common issues for this model. The info about this T211 I found was on gsm arena. I guess Samsung dropped the ball on this model. I suspect its because of the poor cpu and gpu used plus slightly outdated android OS which Samsung hasn't bothered to update.I recently contacted Samsung Hong Kong about the freezing issue and they told me to do a factory restore that didn't fix the issue it still freezes at least once a day. This is typical for Samsung they deliberately brush off the customer when there is an issue with there product. Instead of doing something about it and releasing an android os update and fix they simply ignore the customer.

I found some minor imperfections in the bezel and the SIM flap would not close, but \"Voltage Converters\" retailer reassured me it was not refurbished so I kept it, hoping I don't have a bum battery.  A pricey Otterbox Defender cover has been great and I am just starting to use the phone function now using T-Mobile Pay by the day.  For my smaller hands the 7\" form factor is ideal.  Internationally it might not be practical since it is not the standard SIM card.The other reviewers were spot on and I should have headed the immense amount of Samsung bloatware takes the 8 GB down to 4 GB.
