{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nokia Lumia 620 not your average phoner", "Author": "barbie nemeth", "ReviewID": "R3SL0H4KPBBOA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Think about a Nokia Lumia and the first thing that comes to mind is a `Windows' Phone, lack of apps and no popularity.Let me bust this myth for you. As a user of the brilliant Nokia Lumia 620, I will say that this phone is an absolute gem.I have been using this phone for over 4 months now and will rate its performance and value for money above both its android and Apple counterparts.I mainly use this phone for making calls, instant messaging/messaging, internet, music and maps.Let me breakdown the review for you to construe the the analysis conveniently --Design: The 620 has a screen size of 3.7 inches which is perfect for a phone, as it gives you the liberty of manoeuvring on the whole screen with the help of just one thumb, something which a Samsung Note won't give you.The display is great and crisp for a phone of this price.The 3.5 mm jack and USB outlet is pretty standard.The UI is fantastic, intuitive, interactive and absolutely classy. THe live tiles means you don't always have to launch the App. Also, it is different from the standard menu systems that other OS's offer. The tile design gives you the freedom to prioritize your applications by resizing them and ordering them, in quite an easy manner. Plus it is simple, colourful and so easy to use. The transitions are fluid and unlike any other OS out there.The phone's built is solid with a thick back cover and a strong glass. I have dropped the phone at least 10 times during my experience and not once has it needed fixing. It is rugged, compact and quite heavy duty.Performance: The phone works like clockwork 97% of the time, which is a lot, if you compare it to the lags and errors you encounter in Android or even the fabled iOS.The whole OS is integrated with the hardware giving seamless perrformance for a 1Ghz processor. The RAM of 512 mb is more than sufficient and handles many tasks without any issues. I have simultaneously used maps, whatsapp, music, internet applications and it has worked just fine.The networking of the phone is very good too, with the internet working smoothly and messages being delivered instantly.The phone has not hung once in my experience, and while it has undergone a bit of lag, just press the side button, and the whole system will revitalise without losing any running tasks or apps.Battery: With 1350 mah worth of battery, you would think it is quite less, but that is not so.As I mentioned earlier, the whole system is integrated tightly and this means that the battery life is more than good for the performance it delivers.I mainly listen to music constantly, surf the internet periodically, use whatsapp every 10 minutes and use maps for directions. The battery easily lasts for a whole day. Enable battery saver and you will see that the battery life increases 3 folds.Still, the usage of 3G affects the battery life, and that is true for every phone. However regular usage with 3G will last you a day easily.Camera: The 5 mp shooter is the best you can get in this price range. It gives you crystal clear clarity, and is quite better than many point and shoot cameras out there.Morevoer you can adjust the ISO, Exposure a and such technical details too. Also it gives 720p HD video shooting.Apps: The main aspect of this phone is the Apps. It is widespread that Windows store does not sport many apps. True, it does not have as many apps as its counterparts, but it has all the essential and regular apps under its belt, and that too comes with a better quality.While the likes of Android store is riddled with crappy apps that are no good, Windows store is much more streamlined. It offers you good quality apps with a uniform UI base, which means you don't need a tutorial for using them.All the regular games like Temple Run, Angry Birds, Jetpack Joyride, Where's my water, Cut the rope etc are covered by the app market.The absence of Instagram is not really an issue since Windows store has Instagram clients like Instance and much more.IM/Messaging apps like Whatsapp, VIber, Skype are present too.The HERE maps/drive/citylens feature is terrific and gives you all you need on the go.The utility section is also covered with all the essentials.The apps can be downloaded from the phone directly or from your PC/Mac/Laptop and can be installed in the phone without any additional suite or hassles.Pros:- Best phone in it's price range; - Great, tough build+Design; - Great App store; - Seamless integration; - Excellent Camera; - Good Battery life.Cons:- Not many to mention, but the default music player has a shortcoming i.e. difficulty in creating a playlistAll in all, a superb phone at this cost, a clear winner and a memorable device to have.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exeeds every expectation", "Author": "Manuel Garc\u00eda de Paredes", "ReviewID": "R1MXFE4TQ3EXX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best value for your buck.

Roddie \"croddie\"", "ReviewID": "R2VNA4H2MG2H5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Software:These days there are three choices of operating system: Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and Microsoft's Windows Phone 8. Apple phones are overpriced so the competition for this phone should be Android. Windows Phone 8 is a very good system for some people, but not for everyone.Pros: Slick and attractive interface, very easy to use, maintains good performance, stable, zero maintenance. Microsoft Office included.Cons: Missing features that professionals and power users would appreciate. Not as many apps as Android and iOS although this it's not a big difference any more.WP8 is tightly managed compared to Android. It is much easier to understand and navigate, and runs much more smoothly, but is less customizable and versatile. Microsoft went too far with locking the system down and it's basically not possible to manage local user files on WP8 (same as iOS).Overall I would say that WP is the best choice unless you are 1. a power user, or 2. just need to have all the apps your twitter friends are twittering about. I personally use Android as a power user, but put the rest of my family on WP (Nokia 620) and it was the right choice.Nokia provides some software for free that you can get from the Windows Phone store. This includes good mapping software with downloadable maps, good for travelling.Hardware:The Nokia 620 is an excellent combination of hardware at this budget. The hardware is a very complete, balanced combination. It has a good processor and RAM without being excessive, front camera for video calls (e.g. Skype), NFC for future proofing, a microSD card slot. I found that GPS was very fast, much faster than any other phone or even dedicated GPS devices I have tried. Very good hardware for this budget which does not waste cost or power consumption on extraneous features. (Such as the current marketing gimmick of putting quad core processors in phones.)The screen while not high end (it's a 480p non-IPS LCD screen) still looks good, and is sharp partly due to the screen size and partly due to Microsoft's subpixel font rendering. At a higher budget the main thing you can get in terms of hardware is a better screen (IPS or OLED, 720p on larger screens). It's a 3.8\" screen, good for some, too small for others.The phone is comfortable to hold and feels well built. My dad managed to dislodge the internal power button on his but it was fixed for free and he was probably pressing too hard.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellente device.", "Author": "Jeickson Mendoza", "ReviewID": "R112SB8E8NBPF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great Smartphone.

Once I got through that then I had no issues and I like the phone. Some people say that it looks like a cheap phone but I don't agree to it and I am happy with the overall experience.One issue I would like to bring to notice is sometimes when a call is coming and I try to answer it the answer button on the screen does not respond.

Finally I managed to buy this phone because my old Nokia phone's USB port died. I have used this phone to its extent, including nokia drive. I have to admit that this is a great phone for the phone. I do have one problem with this phone though. I do not like the way I have to insert microSD card. I wish they have paid some attention. I came know that 820 and 920 have proper slot for microSD card. however, this is a great phone. Having said that I can not comment on apps because I do not use many apps.

It needs micro sim, so I cut mine with scissors. I tested it in Argentina with Claro and everything works greats (3G network, internet, facebook, Skype, etc.)It comes with 8MB for install applications, you can move pictures, music and videos to SD Card. Memory card is not integrated at OS as before versions, so you can remove this card without format your phone and you can read it in your pc. I preferred memory card integrated with OS because it give more security (In windows phone 7.8  if you lost your phone with code protected if someone removed sd card it cant be easy to read in a pc).The UI in the new windows phone 8 version is not different from 7.8, some features are missing (as before versions).

Normally I would go for the high end devices but this time decided to go low end when I saw this phone become available.  It has a replaceable battery (definitely a plus-plus for me) and supports an micro SD memory card up toe 64GB. Tmobile replaced my HD2 sim with a micro sim for free. The 620 works fine with Tmobile frequencies in my Portland, OR area.  The Bluetooth paired up well with my accessories.  I was afraid the 8GB flash memory was going to be too small for storing Spotify tracks offline.  I am able to store about 400-500 tracks and maps of the West Coast and still have about 1GB free.  Eventually it is hoped Spotify will support app storage in SD Card but for now only works in the device memory.

Even though the screen is on the small side, the PPI is high enough to give the screen a clear, crisp look when compared to some larger screens.The overall style of the phone is pleasing to the eye with its rounded corners. The small size makes it easy to carry around in my pocket.The operating system functions very smoothly on the relatively low-end hardware. I like how the power, camera and volume buttons are all on the same side.Nokia provides a fair number of their own apps that can be useful. I am using the phone with an AT&T; GoPhone sim card and it works perfectly. I get very good data speeds out here in Las Vegas via AT&T;'s \"H+\" network.Fairly cheap for a current generation, unlocked phone. Despite the low price, it has all the features of a costlier phone, like mobile hotspot and a micro SD card slot.Cons:Sometimes when I try to press and hold tiles, the phone thinks I tapped it. The screen feels a little cheap when compared to some high-end phones, but at this price I suppose it's to be expected. The difference is subtle, but noticeable.While listening to podcasts, the audio skips sometimes. I ran into this same issue on a Lumia 820, so it's probably a problem with the operating system.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "R3AQ9SOXWJK2HF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Switched over from an HTC desire to the 620 on Telus.  A liked my Desire but was showing it's age w/ Android 2.2.  I wanted a good smartphone with a similar sized screen - I find the >4 inch screens too big.  This one is 3.8 inches. Just wanted a good phone with calendar, contacts, mail, messaging, light browsing mainly, show off some pics of family. Text on screen seems more crisp than my old phone.  Web pages load much faster. The interface is simple which I find preferable to Android.  Skydrive works well. Calendar app is basic but very functional.  Only 2 screens - tile and apps, hold down the back key to get a view of all running apps, hold down home for voice access.  Windows phone 8 has enough apps for me.  Works great and was inexpensive.  Build is solid. No complaints - would buy again.GUpdate:  Had it for over a month.  Enjoying the size of this and is well built.  Finding a lot of useful apps in the windows phone store (tune in radio, level, compass, flahslight, weather network, my note, scanner, skymap...).  Bought another calendar (chronos) which has a better month view and a lot of customizability.  Drag and drop from my computers (windows 8) is easy.  There are limited folders so you can't lose files within the OS.  Office files open without any problem.  Camera takes better pics than my last phone and video is 720P.

Previously i was a Symbian user and i tested other OS (BB, IOS, Android) and i feel uncomfortable with them although i feel better with android, similar in several ways to Symbian. However, because i have been buying Nokia phones across the years i decide to buy Lumia. The seller was Wireless Everything, the package arrived on time and it sent the charger adapter (European to American). It's really an unlocked phone and international version (RM-846 CV MY) and i choose the language when i turn on the phone at the first time (English default but you can choose between a lot of them - Portuguese, spanish, english, german, chinese, etc.). The phone is what i expected to a Nokia phone, well constructed, comfortable in the hands, good display. In spite of i previously used a Nokia phone (E75) with steel and plastic material, this plastic phone don't shock me because the sensation in my hands was very good, totally different to the Lumia 710 (with a cheap plastic feeling). The Lumia 620 with the matte finish is much better than its predecessor. To remove the cover is some embarrasing but isn't too bad, pushing the flash camera and pulling the cover out, to access the battery and the microsd and microsim slots. The display is really gorgeous, with high contrast and readable exposed directly to sunlight. This phone is powered with Windows phone 8, a different mobile OS concept, with the famous tiles in start screen to access the apps and settings. The OS run very smooth in the phone and like other OS it has strong and weak things. My phone has the GDR2 update and the Lumia Amber update by Nokia that adds a lot of features absent in the WP8 phones from other brands. It has a very good call quality and the messages function is very good. I transferred the contacts from my older phone via bluetooth in less than one minute (300 contacts). The battery life is what i expected in a smartphone with touchscreen. The main cons that i found in the OS are the following:1) You cannot customize the sms and mail tones with your own sounds (It will be fixed by the GDR3 update in early 2014).2) The volume button change the level in the whole phone (if you change the call volume also change the ringtone volume). The volume buttons don't work like a zoom buttons in the camera app.3) It doesn't has a file manager.4) The glance screen doesn't show notifications although they are in the locked screen (It will be fixed by Lumia Black update in early 2014).5) It doesn't has a battery sound notification when it is in low level or the battery is fully charged.6) The maps app (Here maps) don't let access to the location data to the favorite saved places.7) In symbian i can set all the data access in manual mode, in spite of the priority connection is wifi, the only way you avoid the automatic access to your data plan is turn off or on the data access in the settings menu.The users claim for more apps but to my profile, windows phone store satisfied my needs now. I'm not a gamer (It's bore to me gaming in a phone) and i don't like hear music in the phone.The main pros i found in the phone:1) Far from user's opinions, i feel the OS very intuitive.2) The tiles is a single way to avoid a large list of icons. If you want the list, swipe to left in the main screen and you can see the apps in your phone in alphabetical order.3) The Nokia camera apps are great and the camera lenses concept is strong and it let upload or editing photos from the camera in a very fast way.4) Like other Nokia phones, the camera is strong.5) The Here drive app is amazing and this phone have Here Drive+ with global license. Nokia city lens is very good and accurate app.6) Data sense app is an excellent way to check your data plan consumption.7) You can manage your e-mail accounts in one place.8) Your sms interactions can be stored like a chat conversations.9) The voice command and recognizing voice service to send messages or e-mail are great (you need network access to this feature).10) The office suite is very similar to PC version.11) The network access (3G or wifi) is very fast.12) The bluetooth pairing is very fast. Send or recieve files is fast.13) The GPS access is very fast.Undoubtly Windows phone 8 is evolving and the user experience in my opinion is very good.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------El tel\u00e9fono es muy bueno, como tradicionalmente son los tel\u00e9fonos de NOkia y el sistema operativo es sencillamente diferente, el cual debe ser visto sin ideas preconcebidas. Para alguien que desea niveles de personalizaci\u00f3n extremos (fondos de pantalla, sonidos, etc.) se sentir\u00e1 sumamente frustrado pero si s\u00f3lo se desea modificar elementos siguiendo los lineamientos del sistema operativo (color de fondo, volumen general, tonos de llamada) ser\u00e1 suficiente. Para mi gusto, rescatar\u00eda algunas funciones presentes en Symbian como son, el acceso manual a la red, puesto que al abrir una aplicaci\u00f3n que necesita acceso a la red autom\u00e1ticamente accede a ella aunque si existe una red WIFI cercana y configurada siempre la usar\u00e1 en lugar de la red de datos. No existe un administrador de archivos y la forma de acceder a los archivos se hace siempre a trav\u00e9s de una aplicaci\u00f3n. Nokia le da un extra al tel\u00e9fono que no se encuentra en las otras marcas que usan WP8, particularmente las aplicaciones de la c\u00e1mara son excelentes. La aplicaci\u00f3n de mapas es excelente y el GPS del tel\u00e9fono se conecta sumamente r\u00e1pido. La notificaci\u00f3n de sonido tanto de bater\u00eda descargada como cargada hace falta, as\u00ed como las notificaciones en la pantalla de espera (glance) que si est\u00e1n presentes en la pantalla de bloqueo. Estas ser\u00e1n agregadas en la actualizaci\u00f3n Lumia Black a la par de GDR3 a principios de 2014. Para quienes deseen comprar el tel\u00e9fono desde Venezuela, lo adquir\u00ed a trav\u00e9s de Wireless Everything, lleg\u00f3 perfecto incluso le agregaron el adaptador del cargador (la conexi\u00f3n viene con el sistema Europeo). El tel\u00e9fono es realmente una versi\u00f3n internacional, viene desbloqueado de f\u00e1brica, la versi\u00f3n de firmware es la RM-846 CV MY y al encenderlo hay una cantidad de opciones de idiomas que incluye espa\u00f1ol.

I ordered this for my sister in-law and set it up for her. It's working just fine and if you like the Windows Phone 8 OS, you will probably like this phone. Putting in the Micro SD card is a little bit tricky at first, and the SIM card door was somewhat unusual for me, but of course it worked well.The only issue I had with it is the Taiwanese ROM it came with, so it started up (without a SIM card first) in Chinese and although I figured it out and got to the point where I could select English for the system, I seriously hope my sis in-law doesn't need to hard reset the phone when I'm not around to help her out. Maybe, just maybe if I had a SIM card in it when I turned it on first, it would have selected English based on the SIM card, but I somewhat doubt it.

My second was a Samsung Nexus S 4G.  My third phone was a iPhone 4S.  My fourth was a Nokia Lumia 900.  And now that my Lumia 900 was stolen, and I'm in the middle of my contract, I didn't have a whole lot of options and decided to go with the Lumia 620.  Luckily?  I made the right choice.This really is a phenomenal phone for the price.  Runs very smooth (like all Windows phones), has solid battery life, feels great in the hand, looks very nice, has a decent camera, and a plethora of solid apps (thank you Nokia!).  It also has a nice screen, a removable battery, and good speakers.The only real downsides I can find, and I hesitate to even put these on a sub-$200 phone off-contract, are as follows:1)  App selection is slightly limited2)  Camera is mediocre (once again, very solid for the price though)3)  Screen is small4)  A little bit thick5)  Battery not as good as my Lumia 9006)  No LTEThat's really all I can come up with.  Like I said, at sub-$200 this thing is a bargain.Full disclosure though, if you're like me (in the middle of your contract) and need a new phone, I would also consider the Google Nexus 4.  It's $100 more than this phone, but depending on your preference, it may be worth it (bigger screen, more apps, slightly better camera).  My wife has it, and it really is a nice phone for the price.  Other than the Nexus 4, there really are NO comparisons at this price point for someone that doesn't get a 2-year commitment discount.EDIT: I updated this review from 5-stars to 4-stars.

I love the fact that I can download maps for most parts of the world as and when needed. With a caveat though, while most major cities are mapped you may need a map when going into rural areas going by my experience, I should add US maps are the most comprehensive.I miss having a radio, not sure why Nokia has not enabled this feature regardless of WP8 not enabling FM radio's, many websites have reported that the 620 will not have this feature enabled. Deal breaker? probably! I listen to FM often enough that I may have foregone this model though I do have older portable media players that do support FM now I have to now carry two items on walks/jogs!!! This sucks Nokia!I like Nokia music and the fact that you can download a set to your phone for offline listening but haven't used it much since I have to carry my PMP anyway so I end up using that instead since I switch between FM & music!!! Kind of defeats the purpose of the MP on the phone!!!! Nokia are you listening?The size of the phone is perfect (for me at least) since I do not watch movies/tv shows. on it, podcasts yes, for which the screen is large enough. WP8 has all the free apps I need for my use so no complaints there. Nokia has a bunch of various free utilities that will serve most needs.Overall a very nice phone for the price.

This phone has a lower CPU than the Ativ, 820 and 920 and the performance drop is noticeably. All that to say the phone can be quite annoying because of the sluggish app performance. Don't be fooled by the reviewers scrolling up and down in the app list and in browser. Those are only places it is fast.Other notes:The battery cover is very hard to remove and the process requires pushing on the camera so the camera glass will always have finger smudges.The hotspot only worked with my Samsung Galaxy Tab and iPad. Didn't work with my Laptop or Playbook.If you have music already on your PC then music syncing is broken in Windows Phone 8 right now so everything must be copied and managed on the phone itself. This can be a nightmare if you use playlists.Music quality is not the best but apparently all windows phones sound cheap; HTCs sounds great with headphones but poor over Bluetooth.All sound goes through Bluetooth when active so you may get some nasty surprises if you get an alert while blasting your music.Camera quality is average and the app is not very flexible. Point and shoot and hope for the best.Not too many lock ups but enough to show that the cover design was not clever.Great for buying music, very intelligent and smooth experience in the music app.It does gapless playback which is great for playing mixes.Calling, chatting and email are excellent on the phone. Signal reception is very good, which is typical of Nokia.Contact management is a bit more tedious than other devices but ok once you get use to it.Keyboard is very good, a bit small for me but still quite accurate with decent auto-correction.

The phones rounded corners save it from the clunky look of the 520.Although reasonably sturdy, the plastic back cover is cheap and nasty and available in gaudy colours even a crack-whore would baulk at. The cover can be removed by pressing on the camera - not sure how long that will last before it breaks something. The micro-sim card is under the battery and had a silly, convoluted access mechanism.  The micro-SD card is more easily accessed, but still under the back cover.Screen quality is good and the colours are crisp. Video rendering is smooth, although who would want to watch video on a small screen?Generally, the hardware is reasonable.  The Windows Phone 8 (WP8) software, however, is dreadful. The only positive thing is the home screen tiles which are resizable.WP8 forces you to link to a Microsoft account, which cannot be changed without a hard reset. Secondly, WP8 no longer supports a direct link between the phone and a computer. You have to use an online account. Let me repeat that: you CANNOT sync your phone via USB. If you were used to synchronising your Outlook contacts, calendar, OneNote, tasks, etc; too bad. There is some third party software available, but it is extremely clunky, unintuitive, poorly written and only syncs calendar and contacts.You cannot access your sim card or save contacts on your sim card. This means all contacts have to be in your main contact list. You cannot separate contacts on the sim card. Contacts (now called People) can only be listed in surname or forename order, no company or other order (a step back from CE, etc).While WP8 had an intuitive interface, the retarded functionality and inability to sync with Outlook/OneNote directly makes this an operating system to miss. Get a phone with Android or Apple. Microsoft has lost its way and not longer cares about customer needs. It designs with an inward looking myopia.Unfortunately, Nokia has hitched it wagon to Microsoft and will pay the price for this poor decision making.Avoid this phone, not because Nokia had made a bad product, but because the operating system is useless..", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Basfrommobay", "ReviewID": "R10GJWP3J1A1I3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered a Nokia 620 from Amazon on June and it was delivered Saturday June 22. Thanks Amazon for \"free\" Saturday delivery.Now for my concerns. The phones is available in several colors so I ordered a traditional black phone.(1) Something was shaking inside the phone.(2) The manual came in what appears to be Chinese so I could not figure out how to get the phone cover off to insert and charge the battery.(3) After a search on the Internet, I found a review that showed a very unusual and crazy process to remove the back cover.(4) After opening the back, the item that was shaking inside was a small metal item that had a label name SIM. What is it for? Could it be something that broke off during transit?(5) I could not figure out where to insert the SIM. Incidentally, this phone uses a Micro SIM. Not the standard Mini SIM. Be forewarned.Maybe if the manual was printed in English I would be more forgiving. But, given all the unconventional mechanical features, this phone will be returned to Amazon on Monday even before I setup the phone to test the features. I am not a novice. I have owned and have been using \"cellphones\" for almost 20 years since they  were so big and heavy they had shoulder straps.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective and Deficient", "Author": "Mr. Timothy L. Davis \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "R1M67AD5AKR9NU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "That particular new phone was DEFECTIVE because:(1) The worst problem with this cell phone was POOR CALL QUALITY.  During a call, I heard a loud \"click\" every few seconds, and could not accurately hear what was being said to me.  There seemed also to be radio interference when the phone was near other electronics, such as my computer.  If I was sitting at my computer talking on the phone, I heard a background buzz like an old FM radio too close to the television (for those of you old enough to remember) and the \"CLICK\" was amplified (much louder).(2) I used a SIM card for T-Mobile's network.  The particular networks I was trying to use were 2G and 3G bands 850 and 1900.  When I configured the APN pursuant to my carrier's requirements, I could NOT use MMS (in other words, I couldn't send and receive photos in text messages).  I used my carrier's technical support to ensure that I did it right, and after walking me through APN settings for the T-Mobile network, I found out there were two ways to configure it - and I had tried both before.  We (tech support and I) tried them a few times just in case, and we tried various work-around attempts, but this Windows Phone 8 would not permit MMS.Other bad stuff:(1)  There was a general lack of Apps.  Worse, the native Nokia Navigation App was awful.  It tried to send me to a Home Depot that was 23 miles away.  I live in the middle of the City of San Diego and there are at least four Home Depot stores that are much closer, one is 2.3 miles away, another less than 5 miles away, and the other two within 15 miles.  I don't even know if there WAS a Home Depot 23 miles away where it tried to take me because I was testing the App and didn't actually drive to a Home Depot, though I was driving around when I set it up.  There were other Navigation Apps available in the Windows Phone 8 App store, but each cost a few bucks, none were familiar, so a user would have to buy the App and test it, and if it didn't work, I don't know how the user would address that issue.  I could see pages of paid Navigation Apps - you could spend another $50 or $100 or more buying Navigation Apps until you found one that worked, unless you got lucky and bought one for $1.99 and it works as well as the one that comes on my Android or my buddy's iPhone both which are included (and I have two free ones that came installed on my Android, both which work very well).(2)  Battery life was awful, BUT it is a removable battery so that wasn't a deal killer.  If the quality of the calls would have been even decent; if it would have sent and received MMS; and if it would have had basic apps available that worked well; a user could buy an extra battery and charge it separately and always have power - I've always had phones with removable batteries so I don't find myself out of juice.Good stuff:(1)  After properly configuring the APN, the Internet worked very, very well.  Pages came up in a blink of an eye whether I was connected to Wi-Fi or whether I used data from the T-Mobile network.(2)  Transferring the content from my phone (contacts and photos) was very easy and very fast.(3)  Syncing my phone with my Windows Live account was a breeze and it was also very easy to also connect and sync with Google to add to contacts.(4)  The phone LOOKS great and feels good in my hands.(5)  Navigating the menus and using the Windows 8 Phone software was easy and intuitive.  Even finding APN settings and editing them was straightforward even if it took me a little bit of time to find them - but that's like any smart phone - there are a lot of categories to look through in the phone's settings menus.In Summary, I was flabbergasted that both Nokia and Microsoft rolled out such a deficient product.  Given that the Internet worked so very well and that the phone had a lot of power to quickly load beautiful web pages, I can't believe that the people who engineered this hardware and software even use cell phones.  I can guarantee that no one of any upper corporate status owns or uses this or any other cell phone because if they did, they would have demanded a useful set of native, installed, working apps.  They would know that us \"regular people\" use MMS, it's important to us even if for nothing but fun (but also, that's useful for work - to send photos of \"stuff\" back to the office for immediate response).  They would know that anyone whose owned a smart phone for a few years requires voice Navigation that works.  They could have used GOOGLE maps and written a good App for WinPhone8.  But they didn't.  They released a phone (and I read the reviews on the other Nokia Lumia Windows 8 Phone - none of them had good Apps and many people had difficulty getting MMS service) which I guess they feel they can repair over time with software push updates, or maybe not.  I returned this phone and sold my stock in both Nokia and Microsoft.  This product and the whole Lumia line looks like a losing bet made by lazy, incompetent, rich fools who aren't hungry enough and too arrogant to make sure the product they release works in the manners that people are known to use it.  They are both far out of touch with reality if they think people will enjoy using these devices.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$369.99", "Features": "Cellular Band - Quad-Band 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 Mhz\nCellular Band 3G - 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 Mhz", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 620 Black Factory Unlocked Smartphone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Hy%2BJtjyQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B9Q56WQ"}}
