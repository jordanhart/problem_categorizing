I like the color and lightweight phone.  No intructions and the pamphlet included is not english. Speaker and camera quality is horrible. I hate to go through the hassel of clearing phone to send back. It seems like a late model phone. Will use for a couple of months then put it down once I purchase a straight talk phone. Overall I am not satisfied in the least.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better product", "Author": "atta", "ReviewID": "RG0WSZYSWJRW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the best phone i have owned since buying phones.

Instructions were minimal and confusing. It was impossible to answer the phone quickly, resulting in many lost calls. Other features , such as contacts, were difficult to establish. The \"keyboard\" was difficult to access and use. Overall, I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "good~", "Author": "Yvonne Konig", "ReviewID": "R3JTNN53W2KK1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the best phone i have owned since buying phones.

Item came finally, though I had delivery issues, system seems to work fine, android 4, and maybe camara doesn't have a flash but its pretty decent. I own a Galaxy Ace, much more expensive, but have to say this is a lot times better. Huawei phone are the best, has everything you need for a phone! decent internal space (it said 4GB, but only 0.88 available for apps, for basic use should be enough), and card slot to add memory.Definitely recommend this to anyone! and the seller was amazing! super fast shipping and good item, hope it doesn't fails! :)Ideal for someone who wants to use apps & phone, with a budget. This covers basically all that you need on a smartphone, no need to spend more money!will order more!", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "very simple phone", "Author": "Cesar", "ReviewID": "R28PGGDZSED9BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very simple phone, but is good interface and fast too. perfect size to my hand.And international use too. 7/10", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Huawei Y300", "Author": "Rafael Lezama", "ReviewID": "R2J7BR4SJC8ZT3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good phone for a teenager who starts.
