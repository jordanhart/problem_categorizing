The description clearly states this phone is UNLOCKED. It is not. It is locked and you need to purchase an unlock code to use the phone. To describe the phone as unlocked and then list at&t; and t-mobile as carriers this phone will automatically work with is a flat LIE. Amazon should not let OEM shop sell this with that description.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY, IT IS NOT UNLOCKED!!!  Didn't work with T-Mobile, even though it said it would in the ad!", "Author": "BB703", "ReviewID": "RMQ9V1IQBQQKH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you read the ad for this item, it says in both the headline and description that it is \"Unlocked\".  Then if you read on, it says that it is unlocked and will work with AT&T; and T-Mobile.  I figured this was the perfect solution, since I wanted an Android phone, to ride out the remaining 4 months on my T-Mobile contract.  The phone arrived, i put in my sim card, put in the battery, turned it on, and immediately it said \"Network Locked\" on the screen.  This means the phone is not \"Unlocked\" as advertised, and requires an unlock code to be purchased from a website.  Those codes ranged anywhere from $25-40 on the sites I checked.  Then after you purchase the code, most sites take an additional 36-48 hours to email you the code.  If the phone is advertised as unlocked, you shouldn't have to pay an additional cost just to make it work with a carrier listed as ok for this phone.  In fact, this is a definite euro phone.  The charger for the phone as a euro end on it, which has to be plugged into a US converter, and then into the wall.  Again, just annoying.  Don't waste your time or money on this phone, it will just irritate you.  I sent mine back within an hour of getting it from UPS.  Spend the extra 25-40 bucks it will cost you to unlock it, and get a better phone.  I'd give this negative stars if it would let me.

Not a deal breaker.Unfortunately, it's LG and difficult to get an update to Android 2.1 while in States, so 1.6 will have to do for most of us....LG has yet to work out all the red-tape kinks, and the phone isn't technically supported in USA. So US residents will have a hard time figuring out how to use the USB cable for anything other than charging, like getting a PC computer to communicate with the SD card (Maybe Linux and Apple users are having an easier time with it?) And it didn't come with a CD or even link to download software for syncing it to your computer...If only LG would realize that their products are being sold in US and lobby a bit harder for allowing full support, regardless of the networks and software developers...Also, because it's only OS 1.6 (Donut), you aren't permitted to use the SD card for executable apps (i.e. expand your phones internal memory), and can only use it for storage and playback, and file/app backups.Note that I've quickly discovered that an internal 200 MB doesn't get you very far...but that was my shortsightedness -- I hadn't planned on overloading it with apps.RECOMMENDATION? The phone itself works great. However, some of the smart device tasks that should be easy (OS updating, accessing SD card, transferring files to and from) might be a bit challenging for most, especially if live LG support is missing. I'd suggest going to the LG website first and seeing if you can select the model in your country's list of available/supported phones...if so, chances are you'll have access to all the tools and fewer problems. If it isn't, then I suggest finding a model that is supported.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "CAUTION!

Call conections: great so far. I've been using it for a month now.Reception, great.

Sometimes it is even necessary to restart it to get it to work faster. Hopefully that problem was solved by LG for its other Optimus phone.Apart from that, it is a good purchase.

The phone I bought was shipped by 'Best N Price' and adhered exactly to the description.I was able to slip my SIM card right into the phone, it charged right up, and it functioned properly. So, to be clear, it's fully unlocked and working on the AT&T; network as I type. On Android, I was able to upgrade the OS to 2.1 without much trouble -- the updater did the thing where it stops at 4%, which happens with LG phones sometimes, but I was able to restart it without wrecking the phone. The phone is unquestionably durable as well, because I dropped it onto a wood floor the second day I had it and it didn't break. There was no data loss or cracked screen, and the phone worked like normal when I powered it back on.When you're buying this phone, bear a few things in mind; It's a European phone, so it's probably not going to give you a 3G signal -- and, according to some, it may arrive in a Continental language (although I received a UK version). It's also a couple years old, so it's going to have Android 1.6, and the hardware isn't going to be able to handle more than 2.1. Another reviewer here listed the steps to upgrade it to 2.3, but I'm not risking turning it into a paperweight.All in all, you're getting what you pay for with an Android phone in this price range. It was $89.99 when I ordered it, but it looks like the price has shot up. In any case, it's a great deal for that price, but you have no business expecting it to be as capable as a brand new Galaxy or something. In addition, it's a foreign model like many other unlocked phones being sold online, so you ought to be prepared for that eventuality and understand that's part of the reason it's inexpensive.One more thing: have a microSDHC card for the phone, preferably Class 4. It takes up to 32GB (and not microSDXC; too new), and the memory card is needed for many features like downloads and pictures because the phone has very little internal memory. Almost everybody has a microSD card lying around, but be prepared if you don't -- or have a Class 2, since that'll probably be too slow -- because there are plenty of good deals for the high capacity Class 4s on this site.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone of 2011, Simply Amazing!!!!!", "Author": "Phone Reviewer \"Cell Phone Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3QPIIDU9Y8BZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, this is a very intuitive phone.

Koziol", "ReviewID": "R1AYQXPHRSQB9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi. I have a review from Sept. 16th on the other GT540 seller link that details step by step how to upgrade this phone to Gingerbread 2.3.7. It's helped out a few people. But I would like to inform all others who are about to buy this phone to not buy it from Wireless Experts. Mid-September, I bought this phone for $119 + shipping. Shortly after, I wrote a review on how to upgrade this phone to Gingerbread 2.3.7 and after my guide/review on how to update it, it went from $119 to $150, to $199, and now it's $249. That is INSANE and I want the seller (Wireless Experts) who is gouging on this phone to stop as it is unethical. You can buy this phone unlocked elsewhere but I ask you boycott Wireless Experts for gouging on this phone. For $250, you can get a better phone than the GT540. I want this seller (Wireless Experts) to know they are scumbags for doing this. You can get this phone elsewhere (ahem...a certain auction site). Thanks.By the way, I am on AT&T; and this phone works fine for me but it doesn't support 3G if that matters to you. AT&T;'s band is 1900. I popped in my SIM card and AT&T; came right up without fuss. I don't use a data plan and that's why I bought this phone, so I could use WiFi for free. Other T-Mobile people have had success with this phone too. Read all the T-Mobile reviews for this model (Titanium Silver, 26+ reviews) and the Black model with 85+ reviews.UPDATE: Wow, no more than a few days after posting this, the phone has *magically* dropped back down to $139.If you want to MOD you phone to run Gingerbread 2.3.7, use my guide below. It's FREE, and unlike Wireless Experts, I won't gouge you for it.(For Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7)I did this procedure to my unlocked GT540 with Android 2.1-update1. There is no undo button. Once you mod (update) up your phone, you can't go back. Trust me, you won't want to. It is best to do this on a new phone as you will lose *all* your stuff (pics, vids, numbers, texts, etc). Back up your phone numbers or installed apps if you have a backup program. Do not restore default apps from Android 2.1 to Android 2.3 or you'll screw up your apps / phone and have to redo the mod process. Just reinstall the apps you had from scratch.Let's begin:-Make sure USB DEBUGGING MODE is turned ON. Go to Settings > Applications > Development and turn on USB Debugging Mode.-Make sure MASS STORAGE mode is turned OFF. Go to Settings > SD Card & Phone Storage and turn OFF Mass Storage Mode.1. Do a search for \"KDZ Updater Europe Open\", you'll likely get a link to it on Mediafire. It's a 144.87MB file. Download it.2. Do a search for the file: Android237GT540_02-Nov-ENG.exe (or Android237GT540_06-OctoberENG.exe if you can't find Android237GT540_02-Nov-ENG.exe). You'll likely get a link to it on FileServe. It's a 107.69MB file. Download it.3. Do a search for FastbootDrivers_LG_GT540.zip, you'll likely get a link to it on Mediafire. It's a 1.33MB file. You may or may not need these but download it all the same.4. After getting the above three files, unzip KDZ Updater Europe Open.zip and FastbootDrivers_LG_GT540.zip to a folder.5. In the KDZ Updater Europe Open folder, make sure there are 4 files: 1) Europe Open+Fastboot.kdz, 2) LGAndroidDriver_WHQL_ML_Ver_1.0_All_Win7.exe, 3) msxml.msi, 4) z4root.1.3.0.apk.6. Install the phone drivers: LGAndroidDriver_WHQL_ML_Ver_1.0_All_Win7.exe. If it asks you to reboot, reboot.7. If you don't have the Microsoft XML 4.0 SP3 Parser (check your Add / Remove Programs for MSXML 4.0 SP3 Parser), install msxml.msi.8. Install and use the z4root tool to your phone to *permanently* root your phone. It will run, do a song and dance, and reboot your phone if successful.9. Although the update did not mess with my microSD card, you can unmount (Settings > Phone and SD Storage > Unmount SD) and take out your microSD card if you want.10. Power off your phone, take out the battery, put the battery back in.11. With the phone powered OFF, hold down the Volume Down button and press and hold down the Power button.12. You should see Download Mode appear on the screen. If not, repeat step 12.13. Plug in the USB cable to the side of the phone and plug the other end of the USB cable to your computer. Windows will find the phone and install the drivers and it should *not* complain about \"unable to install drivers.\" It may ask you to reboot. If so, reboot. Leave the phone in Download Mode.14. In the KDZ Updater Europe Open folder, find KDZ_FW_UPD.exe and run it.15. Set Type to \"3GQCT\" and Phone Mode to \"DIAG.\"16. For KDZ file, choose Europe Open+Fastboot.kdz from the KDZ Updater Europe Open folder.17. Click Launch Software Update. It should take roughly 5 minutes to complete if you are using USB 2.0 speed. It will reboot your phone automatically (the Download Mode screen will disappear).18. Be ready to do the following step quickly: When you phone reboots, hold down the Camera button until the LG logo disappears and the screen is black and nothing further continues to happen. You are now in what is called Fastboot Mode. If you were too slow and the phone is booting up, pull the battery out, unplug the USB cable from your computer, put the battery back in and try again by holding down the Camera button and pressing the Power button until the LG logo disappears. Plug the USB cable back into your computer.19. Windows may now say it found a new ADB Device (or some similar thing) and needs the driver. If so, point it to the folder where you unzipped the FastbootDrivers_LG_GT540 files. If not, proceed to the next step.20. Find Android237GT540_02-Nov-ENG.exe (or Android237GT540_06-OctoberENG.exe if you can't find Android237GT540_02-Nov-ENG.exe) and run it. Read the directions and info (slightly broken English). It will unzip all the Gingerbread update files to a folder called C:\\GT540. Since you have Android 2.1, you will be choosing to do an INSTALL, *NOT* an Update.21. Once you click INSTALL, you will see a DOS command window open (the instructions tell you this) and this is where the magic is happening. After about 5 minutes, it will complete and close and your phone should reboot. Do not stop the INSTALL process or you might brick your phone in which case you start all over again.22. After reboot, it will take around 5 minutes for Gingerbread to rebuild itself on the phone and load up. Unplug the USB cable from the phone. You'll see LG GT540  SwiftDroid appear and then a blue Android on a skateboard zoom by and then a blue Android screen with a spinning arrow with the words Cyanogen Mod 7. If you see that, you are good to go. Just wait patiently until it finishes loading everything. Have fun! Also, please sign the petition to get the Cyanogen team to work on the GT540. Google the phrase \"LG GT540 Official Cyanogenmod Support Petition\" and also donate to the CyanogenMod / SwiftDroid team as they make this all possible. Make sure you let them know it was a GT540!Note: One of the nice benefits of the SwiftDroid / Cyanogen mod is the ability to overclock your CPU. However, many forums out there warn to NOT go past 800MHz as you are almost guaranteed to have issues. Mine is running happily at 672MHz. By default, it underclocks your CPU to 245Mhz when idle to save battery power. Drop down to 122Mhz to save even more battery!
