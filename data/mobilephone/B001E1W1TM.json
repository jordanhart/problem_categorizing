{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is the first phone I've really loved", "Author": "Corky", "ReviewID": "R1BGUKI1FPC38F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I basically use a phone for calling people. I don't surf the web or text people so I don't care about those functions. First off the phone is a nice size around the width of a razor but a little longer and it is a little thicker. when you open the phone up you notice how big the keypad is and it has separate nice size buttons with big numbers instead of a cheap one piece printed board with small keys like the Motorola's do. the inside screen is large it is bigger than a Razor. What I like about this LG is that it feels like a quality phone, It's solid the interface is easy to use and figure out. Their phones seem to be well thought out. The only thing that I don't like is that there is one key on the top that is used for information on different types of wines, they should of used it for a link to voice mail or calls received. Other than that it's an excellent phone.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for Anyone", "Author": "J C", "ReviewID": "R2VJKRWBEF79WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice phone. Large Keypad, good looking screen and easy to follow user interfaces are strong points for this phone. No wonder this phone won 'good phone design' or something like that when it first came out at South Korea.
