The phone worked for a few days with no problem and I was happy but then the text messages started appearing with overlapped letters and sometimes the first letter of the line would appear at the end of the line. Example:  onday, June 17, 2013  M. So I took the phone to sprint to see if the phone was worth fixing. They told me there was something wrong with the screen and it would need replaced. I had noticed that when I got the phone the white sticker on the phone was partially red and asked sprint about it ( since my original phone battery sticker was white) he told me that was an indicator that the battery had been wet at some point.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006H65M5Y"}}
