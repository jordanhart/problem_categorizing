{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It rocks!", "Author": "Kaushik Lodh", "ReviewID": "R1KT22QGF0CDI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,I am surprised to read the other reviews of this great product.Firstly, let me attest, this is a new Blackberry curve 8330 in mint working condition.Yes, when it came it did not have a lot of features etc on it, like apps, ability to set up multiple emails, etc. I had to just call Verizon to set it up, and they made me update the software on it, and everything was all set in seconds. It had ability to set up several emails, had a browser, camera, video recorder, media player, voice memo recorder, some basic games, blackberry messenger, memo pad, alarm clock, ability to set my own ring tone (which I cant do on my iPhone), etc.1) Myths from reviews:- Yes it is a CDMA phone, not a GSM phone. So to the spanish writer's comments, if you cant read english, then thats not the product's or the seller's problem. It clearly states in the description \"Verizon Smart phone\" and Verizon is CDMA>- It doesnt have a browser! LOL. yes it does have a browser! It's browser is Blackberry browser for smart phones, nothing like what you can expect in a Motorola Droid or an Apple iPhone, but it does have a working browser. I checked it, went to google, amazon and a host of other sites.2) What it doesnt have:- Facebook app-Youtube app-Fancy schmancy apps.-SD card slot-GSM card slot3) Who is it for:-For a person who wants a functional smart phone with robust email capabilities, good quality voice quality on phone calls.4) My personal take:For $35 you are getting one hell of a deal here. It is a Verizon Blackberry Curve 8330. If you want to see real reviews, look up the grey colored 8330 curve which has 4.5 stars in 50 reviews.The reviews here (till Nov 6th 2011) have been by 3 non-english speakers and one questionable source. Sadly all of them are bogus and ill-informed.You get a discounted price on this one because the color is pink. But apart from the color, it is one hell of a phone that I actually prefer over my iPhone 4 which I have from work.I have a tendency to lose phones, and this phone was meant for being a work horse, no worries phone that I wouldnt care too much if I lost. Dare I say, it meets / exceeds my expectations!All in all, dont worry, purchase with confidence.Thanks,Kaushik.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "This can be a good phone if ordered from the right people.", "Author": "Raina", "ReviewID": "R3KXUQ773FETUE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've read over a lot of reviews, and spent about three days trying to decide if I wanted to purchase this phone or not. Eventually, I did, and it's a pretty good little phone. I've noticed a lot of negative reviews are from those that ordered this that live outside of the country (CDMA doesn't work there), those that don't understand that this phone doesn't come with a slot for an SD card, or don't understand that this is a VERIZON phone and that the company doesn't use a \"sim\" card.Also, anytime you purchase anything from a seller on Amazon, you really need to check out the reviews for that business. My rule of thumb for electronics is that I rarely, if ever, buy anything used, and the seller that I choose has to have a 97%-100% positive rating. 95/96% is pushing it, but sometimes if there are no other options, such as with this item, I'll select one with these ratings. Also, never ever EVER buy a cell phone or other electronic device refurbished or used from these business on amazon; it's too much of a risk.I ordered this phone \"new\" from a company that had a 96% rating, with over 17,000 reviews. It sounds like some people have either bought used or refurbished phones, phones that aren't from a company with a 95-100 satisfaction rating, or a combination of both.I've had this phone for about a month now with no issues. I had a Droid Incredible that was knocked out of my hand, cracking the screen and causing it to \"act up\" some. Not wanting to risk being phoneless, I ordered this one to hold me off until my contract is up next year.  So far, it's a good phone. Takes a little getting used to, but it's good.1- it DOES have internet; once you activate it, it should update itself within an hour or two. Or at least mine did2- the fact that it's CDMA and a VERIZON phone is clearly stated in the description, shouldn't give something a bad rating for your mistake3. \"New\" may actually mean \"New, but someone has usedit before very, very briefly\". Someone who lived in South America (go figure!) must have ordered this one and returned it, as one contact and a \"verizon welcome\" was still in the inbox when I first turned it on. Either way, the phone looks VERY new with no scratches.4. If you're coming from 2010-2012 smart phones, this will take some getting used to. However, I swear you'll fall in love with the qwerty keyboard. I forgot how much I loved having it.5- the smallness of the phone will also take some getting used to.6- it's not the sellers responsibility to tell you that you need a data plan for this, it's Verizon's. If you are switching from a basic phone to this smartphone, you HAVE to have or add a data package. period. If you already have a smart phone, than you won't have to add anything; this phone is still allowed on smartphone plans.7- If you're a clutz like me, buy a case. They're cheap now because this phone has been out for so longBottom Line:This is a VERY good phone for how much it costs. Shell out the extra money to pay full price for it (45-50 dollars) versus the cheap way out and paying for a used or refurbished one. In my experience used/refurbished means \"Will only work well for up to an hour or two weeks\". I expect this to last me till next year as long as I don't do anything to physically to harm it, but I will update this if something does end up going awry with the phone that's not my fault. If it's a year from now and you're reading this, and I haven't  added a negative comment, than know that this phone still works. Because I'm QUICK to hop on Amazon and update a review if a product doesn't do what it's supposed to.cheers*update* 3-23-12It's not been two months since I've had the phone. It still works great, however, I want to caution those who want to buy it about getting different backgrounds for this device. In experimenting with the phone, Ive found that downloading different backgrounds causes this phone to slow down SIGNIFICANTLY. Therefore, I don't use them anymore.Another little thing I've noticed about this phone is that it's help to limit my previous excessive internet use. With my android, I was constantly on Facebook, surfing the web, and uploading pictures to various social networks. Now that it's a bit more tedious to search for things on the blackberry browser, I find myself paying more attention in my classes and completing my work on time. I have a laptop, but it's a bulky mac. Not gonna bring that to class everyday!So in conclusion, phone still works great, be leery of backgrounds.*update* 12-9-12I received an early upgrade and was able to purchase a new phone in november. But guess what? that blackberry  was/is STILL functional...and I dropped it a billion times over the past nine months.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone for the price!!!", "Author": "Irish_19", "ReviewID": "R3PB21QSJ41R7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never owned a BlackBerry and I am extremely impressed with this phone.

I LOVE THE QWERTY KEYBOARD!  The BBerry Bold I gave away because it was longer & thinner and, with a hand deformity, I could not really use it as well as the 8330. And, the 8300 fits so well in your pocket- unlike the larger smart phones which are so prevalent now.I do not understand why the 8330 series was replaced & is so hard to find.  They are small enough, chunky enough, for me to hold & type, take pictures, text, etc. with one hand while walking my dog.  The Touch Screen keyboards are absolutely awful and every blog I have looked at has people wishing they still had their Qwerty keyboard.  Why is it that a bunch of techno geeks, using multi-media, are able to influence the entire smart phone industry?Not everyone wants multiple apps, not everyone wants a cell phone that is large enough to be a netbook, not everyone wants a smartphone that takes 2 hands to use.The majority of people want a smartphone that they can use to talk, text, & receive eMails as well as take pictures.  Since I love to take pics on my hikes and nature walks, I purchased a 32 Gig micro disk which I haven't begun to fill up.The move toward larger, slimmer, touch phones is OK for those people, particularly young people, who have nothing better to do than stay on the phone, on Facebook, texting, trying out the lastest apps, etc.  For real people, aka adults, the practicality of the 8330 is unbeatable! And- contrary to some of the reviews- it most definitely does video!", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Listen to me", "Author": "BrokeCollegeKid", "ReviewID": "R2EFC9W8FJ7BEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I bought the phone because my droid eris with verizon suddenly stopped working (not gunna lie i am a clutz & dropped it a million times but thats besides the point) so it was a bit of a downgrade...HOWEVER this little thing is mighty powerful.It does require a data package not a SIM card CDMS w/e...I've had it for about a week and have already dropped it twice and it worrks might fine :) Deffinitely worth buying it came brand new in the box with just a charger no scratches or anything. I will post a review later on with regards to how it is doing. ALSO it DOES HAVE A WEB BROWSER the thing is you need to go to the blackberry market and install it. I have a browser and a bing application. You can download games and such the only thing that is somewhat of a bummer is that i don't get emotion-cons. If anyone knows how to get them please let me know.  I did do some shopping around and was very skeptical about buying a phone off amazon...i went to ebay, and other reputable sites but amazon deffinitely offers a great price and fast shipping. I mostly use it to text and i love the QWERTY keyboard because i am a fast typer. works great, no complaints to date!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Now we're talking!", "Author": "netfirst", "ReviewID": "R2TP9RGMDI1W5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am 100% satisfied with the seller - DigiCellRepair - and with the phone!The phone arrived - battery, back cover, wallchager, and headset included.Call Quality - Excellent!Size, usablity, weight - Excellent!The micro-sd slot is under the battery.This phone is a powerhouse! It is my first smartphone and I can't wait to learn to use all the time-saving features it holds.The voice quality is excellent on the handheld, and very good on a bluetooth headset.  As with any phone, it takes time to learn how to use it - that is to be expected.This is a Verizon smartphone. For anyone looking at this phone - back-up your contacts from the phone you are replacing to Back-up Assistant PRIOR to activating this phone! Transferring contacts to this phone is very simple IF they are on Back-up Assistant when the new phone is activated. I spent hours trying to transfer from a Pantech Jest via Bluetooth, via the BlackBerry Desk Software, and via a micro-sd card! All to no avail. I had to reactivate my Jest, back-up the contacts, reactivate the BlackBerry, empty the Contacts. and then run Back-up Assistant to populate the BlackBerry Contacts.

This came really quick and seemed fairly new. Upon opening, I was excited but quickly disappointed (sort of). The phone acts weird when it wants to, shuts off periodically, get java script error (even when I haven't touched it in hours). But this is what you get for a cheap phone. My original phone broke, this is replacement until my contract is up.It's true - phone does NOT come with browser or apps (despite one reviewer saying it DOES come with a browser and third party apps-WRONG!). What it DOES is come with the basics. Once you get it connected to your service provider (in this case, Verizon) it took about 30 minutes on phone with rep to get it set-up and they have to PUSH the apps out to your phone. If you bought it new, this you wouldn't have to do.So far phone is doing basics I need it to do, but it's annoying at times, if I don't use it for hours, then try to use it, it just shuts off.

When I first moved into my new apartment, I decided to get a new cell phone. I looked at phones and different cell phone companies. I was looking for a phone that was advanced, cute, pink, affordable,and NOT TOUCHSCREEN. I don't know why, but I have always hated touchscreen phones. In the end my choice was narrowed to the blackberry curve 8330 for verizon or the blackberry curve 8310 for ATT/Tmobile. I decided to go with the Blackberry 8330 for verizon because the phone itself was cheaper. I got it on ebay for like 45.00, where the phone for ATT/Tmobile was like 140.00. I am now glad I did too. With Verizon, you get unlimited internet access. My mom pays the same price I do for her cell phone but she has a limit to how much data she can use. Mine is unlimited for the exact same price. I love the color and style of the phone. It has a keyboard, which makes texting much easier than on a flip phone or a touchscreen. It is also very simple to find stuff on the phone. That is the main problem I have always had with touchscreen phones. They are too complex and confusing. It's hard to find anything, and to use the phone itself you have to go through a billion screens just to find the dial pad. With this phone, it has a number pad on the keyboard so you can dial the number and talk instead of looking for the lousy dialing pad screen. The internet works well and is pretty quick. I get service pretty much anywhere, even in the middle of nowhere. The camera is pretty good. The pictures come out clear and look good. The only complaint I would have would be trying to watch videos, like on youtube. It takes forever to load a video. It's not a big deal for me because I watch most videos on my labtop and mainly use my phone for going on facebook, checking e-mail, ect.

First off, you can no longer get the same features on the Blackberry 8330, because [according to my service provider] Blackberry forces you to upgrade by limited the services that used to be available on the phone.  I was highly irritated that I can no longer access picture messaging & access the internet via my Blackberry.  I was disgusted by this, because this is the exact phone I had before I had to order another phone.  The rollerball is a huge problem; In hindsight, if we've graduated from roller-ball computer mouses (Mice?)- We should have never considered this option.  It's way too sensitive to collecting dust (just as a roller-ball computer mouse is).  My particular refurbished phone also has issues with lighting.  The backlight flickers from dim to bright randomly.  My previous water-damaged phone still had better lighting after I revived it myself.  If it were never for the rollerbal getting stuck & breaking- and had I known the disappointments I would have with this phone, i would've just bitten the bullet & upgraded to something else, which I eventually had to do.  If you're looking for a temporary phone to get you through, until you can purchase a more updated phone or for a younger kid (where you want restrictions on certain things like picture messaging or internet access), this may be your best option, but don't expect it to do anything by the bare minimum.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Pink Blackberry", "Author": "Glenda F.

I did decide to go with a smart phone, which knowingly would cost me an addt'l $20 on my Verizon bill...what I didn't know was that the BlackBerry Curve I chose was approx 5 yrs old and a email based phone. Good for just receiving / sending email. The browser for internet is very limited to results...you may get if your lucky 3 results for anything you search. The applications are another big disappointment. The applications that are installed such as FB, My Space, and some of the other social networks - or even the non social networks (games, blackberry application, and so forth) state that upon when you try to use them that unfortunately this particular phone is not able to acquire these applications that you need to upgrade to a different phone or hey just pay another $30/ mth and they would be happy to get them working for you. What does all this mean...I am paying my cell carrier $20/mth extra to only get my emails that I couldn't get before and yes a lil bit of internet (I mean a little bit--of internet browsing--to the point of whats the use if you get 2 results and thats it). The applications are useless, you can't use them- not even the blackberry apps unless you pay for different phone or upgrade and pay them -Blackberry- an addt'l $30 a mth (I had expected to have a smart phone that had working email, applications, and a internet that showed results for the $20 I have to pay my Verizon carrier; I shouldn't be liable for another $30/ mth to Blackberry to get the phone to work properly- I paid for a smart phone but really its a phone good for just for calling, texting, emailing, pretty to look at....if you want anything else forget it- this is not the phone for you and is definately not worth the extra on your carrier plan for a smart phone). I will never purchase another cell phone from Amazon that is certain- I feel I am either due a new phone that will work up to my expectations (a smart phone that has the ability to surf internet, text, email, call, and have working applications) at no addt'l cost to me or refund me the $60 total  ($20/mth- 3 mths left w my carrier equals $60) for the phone not performing as company stated. My advice to anyone buying a phone...go to the carrier first...look at the phones and ask lots of questions of what the phone can do and so forth - some will even let you take the phone for a day and try it out; make sure you choose the phone that is right for you...get the correct name of the phone and all that good stuff then maybe just maybe consider buying from online. Look at me for example...tried to save some money and found this cute pink blkberry curve smart phone at a heck of a deal and thought wow I can even afford to have the extra $20 extra on my bill at that price for the smart phone (paying the internet price for those who don't know) and got suckered by the company. They gave me the cute phone, new in box, but if I wanted more I have to pay more and thats bad business--can't use the internet for nothing pretty much, apps are no good unless ya pay more, and just plain disappointed). Nothing said anywhere that hey if you buy this phone from us that you will have to give us more money to enjoy better internet, to get the apps to work, and so forth. Crooks! As for the cell phone cover I purchased, other than the length of time to receive it- it was new in box and worth price and would recommend buying cell phone covers, just not the phones...if the company however contacts me and makes this situation right I will update my review.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap, and it works", "Author": "A.
