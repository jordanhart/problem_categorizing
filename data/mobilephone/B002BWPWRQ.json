Francu", "ReviewID": "R1D3Z248RL2UHC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nobody seems to mention several important things. I'm not sure if all the products are the same, or if the one I bought from this particular seller had these problems, but mine had two major shortcomings.1) It only comes with a Southeast-Asia plug adapter (which I believe is the same as they use in the UK). So out of the box, there is no way to charge it in the US, other than via USB. At some point you will probably want to buy a converter plug.2) There is no Market application installed on it. Therefore, you cannot, with conventional means, install any other applications on this phone. The Android OS that comes with this particular phone is crippled. I managed to root the phone and install a much better Android version on it, but it took me about 6 hours of trial and error and it put me at risk of ruining the phone (drop me a message if you need help rooting your own Hero; I saved my notes from the process).After fixing number (2) above, yes, the phone is great and it works as expected. There are plenty of reviews out there and I agree with what they say -- the good and the bad. But it takes hours of effort and you must take serious chances to restore this phone to its un-crippled state. That is why I'm giving it only two stars.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "A very useful, desirable, usable mobile device.", "Author": "RST10", "ReviewID": "R6PRC37RLV2M1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an iPhone lover, so my review is solely from that perspective. I have also owned & used a Blackberry storm and various other smartphones, Windows Mobile 6.5, etc.1.  The plastic is very unique... seems solid like original mac or a medical device. Seems very thick/durable/dense without being heavy.2.  Angled curve (\"chin\" as people call it) at the bottom good for holding with one hand. This is definitely an advantage over the iPhone, but only comes on the EU versions as of late.3.  Given the placement of the buttons on the chin, this seems like a right handed person's phone.4.  The touch screen has good sensitivity & appearance. Quality is very high, but is a little smaller than iPhone.5.  The phone is smaller than expected.6.  I can see where users' don't want to open in a screen of \"just the apps, ma'am\". The widgets add a dimension that iPhone doesn't have. \"already open & displaying your data\" etc.7.  Setup intuitive & easy.8.  No exchange push. It only seems to poll my work exchange account while the iPhone gets push.9.  No timer setting for screen lock options, but unique locking options. I like having a timer on the screen lock & password options.10. Tactile typing feedback is awesome. iPhone would love this option immediately.11. In the dark, you have to know which button to press on the chin to bring the phone alive. The lights don't come on under the buttons by pressing any of them.12. Doesn't display excel made grids in email as well as iPhone13. Fold  (\"chin\") at the bottom keeps the screen from hitting the desk flat when you lay it on its front.14. Switching between browser windows on Android 1.5 is more OSX dock than the iPhone!15. Keeps losing connection to my WIFI access point. Can't figure out why...16. App installs are a perfect balance between iPhone's \"no questions asked\" and BB's ask every security. It gives you a review of what components or feature/data use each app requires.17. Android does widgets. iPhone does no widgets. That's a flat difference that differentiates.18. Light multitasking-- submit a tweet, move on, a pop up tells you on home screen that it was sent successfully. A nice feature that iPhone doesn't have.19. Zoom in & out on webpages is a little slow, and no double tap to zoom a column :(20. Moving icons is easier for the novice than iPhone. Press/hold/where you can move is bright, everything else dims.CommentsApps on Iphone are still richer, but the interface feels \"stitched together\" after the seamless Android HTC experience.First phone to keep my interest as long as it has, even after having it in hand.When both upright, the slightly wider keyboard on iPhone makes a big difference. I can type faster on iPhone even though I really like the haptic feedback on the Hero.App offerings for Android will only get richer, while we don't really know what's going to happen with iPhone's interface or the forethought of something \"widget-like\".  In many ways, Android does apple better than Apple does, or more true/similar to the OS X interface.My world is basically an iPhone world these days, so any concern I have for a mobile device focuses around \"is it better or at least equal in usefulness/desirability\". In this case, I can conclude \"YES!\" It is of equal usefulness & desirability as iPhone.

The Hero Sense UI runs smooth and there is lots of Eye Candy.  There are lots of Widgets that makes the UI looks so cool.The call quality is much better than the G1 or MyTouch.  My wife says that I sound much better on the Hero.The build quality is also top notch.  I find that the G1 and the MyTouch feels a little too cheap.I also like the fact that there is a standard 3.5 headphone jack.  On the G1 and MyTouch you still have to use an adapter.All in all I am happy with this phone.  The only downside is the heavy price tag and the 3G does not work on AT&T.;  The only US version available is the Sprint CDMA.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "An Android phone so good I've named him Data", "Author": "L. R. Richardson", "ReviewID": "R32SUO6YDMKIJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Caveat: This is not a tech-savvy review. So if you're an average user, this is how I, a fellow average user, found the phone.This is my first time having a phone that isn't ghetto. I got this through Orange the day before it was due to come out in the US, which made me feel quite spiffy. It's meant to be an alternative to the iPhone, and I think it works quite well. I must say, Google has yet to steer me wrong; I'm digging the Android system.The Hero is very adaptable. For example, I have a variety of home screens set up on my phone. There is the main home screen that has the time, weather, and the main settings like on the picture above. I also have screens that show: my e-mail, text messages, more detailed weather information, one that has main widgets like Google Talk, one for music, and one that has additional widgets I downloaded for free. There are a wide variety of widgets that can be downloaded--I got useful ones like a currency coverter, MSN, Skype, etc, but I also downloaded a lightsabre that makes awesome swishy noises and a Star Trek soundboard, so now whenever I get it a text Worf says \"Captain, incoming message.\"There are a couple of annoyances and quirks I've found, but I'm not sure if it's due to the phone or the fact that I haven't figured out how to make it easier on myself. It automatically adds EVERYONE to my contact list. A person I e-mailed once about a job? On my phone. Forever.  It's annoying. Also, because my contact list is now large and a bit unwieldy, I have to view contact groups, and it takes far too many presses of a button to get to it. Perhaps there is a way to install a shortcut, but I haven't figured it out. Also, sometimes the e-mail screen isn't completely up to date and lags.Otherwise, though, I've had very little trouble with it and I've learned to use it quickly and easily. It gets great reception and I was able to chat with my friend as I was riding through the countryside. The map function is good as well. It's an excellent phone. However; I would never spend so much money on it; I'd get it with a contract, definitely.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't go wrong with the hero", "Author": "Joe Romeo \"TechMinds IT Strategy and Consulting\"", "ReviewID": "R3C2IT19UBPKQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the owner of a small IT consulting business I jumped at the chance to test out the HTC Hero for a few weeks.  The capacitive touch screen is easily as responsive as the big competitors out there (Apple iPhone, BlackBerry Storm) and the Android operating system is very intuitive and easy to use.  The lag which you may have seen reported has long since been fixed by an update from HTC, and this is easily one of the best smartphones I have ever reviewed.  I do a lot of training for iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android, Blackberry and Symbian smartphone operating systems, so when I say HTC hit a home run with this phone it carries a little bit of weight.  Unfortunately for Americans your only options are to purchase on Sprint (and I would heartily recommend this over a Palm Pre), or buy the unlocked international version which will work on the slower Edge speeds for AT&T; and T-Mobile.  Honestly, most people probably wouldn't notice the difference between Edge and 3G for web browsing and checking your email.  In any case, I loved testing this phone out and am hopeful we'll see a GSM version for AT&T; or T-Mobile in the future.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "3G does not work in US.

Its a decent phone overall but yes it is little laggy. Be very carefully and aware of the fact that this handset does not work on the 3G networks. It is 3G compatible and a world phone, but GSM US carriers like T Mobile or ATT use a different frequency for data which is the GSM 1700 mhz band I think. Whatever the Freq, its not compatible for 3G data in US. Europe and Asia it will work fine on 3G but not in the US. Otherwise overall very well equiped, but not worth 600 dollars when the iPhone with 16GB unlocked can be got for about 400-500 and 32 GB for 500-600 unlocked.Many apps are available for the phone, great interface, very user friendly, shoots good pics and decent video, can use mp3s as ringtones which is fantastic.
