All my research indicated it had all of the bells and whistles and was the best phone currently in the market.  Well, after struggling to figure out how to use the phone over the last three weeks, I now regret my decision to replace the HTC 8X with the Samsung S4: better is not always the best option.My biggest gripe is that I got used to the very simple ease of use in making phone calls, responding to email, sending text messages, taking photos, and recording videos on the Windows based HTC 8X.For example, on the 8X, I only had to hold the button on the side of the \"locked\" phone to snap a picture while on the S4 I have to unlock the phone, find the camera app, open it, and the snap the - now long gone - picture.Emails on the 8x were simple - I just opened up the individual active account and read the email while on the S4 all of the emails are combined, making it difficult to manage.  I note that I have been forced to find another email app to use.Finding contacts to call, on the 8X,I simply did a simple search for the contact, pushed a button and the phone made the call. On the S4, it takes many button presses before I can find the contact.  I note that this is the difference between how Google responds to local searches versus how Bing responds to local searches. I am generally not a fan of Bing, but I did like the fact that I could simply obtain a business' address and phone number using only a voice search while on the S4 Android phone I had to refine the voice search using my fingers.The S4 is bigger, and even though I have large hands, I feared that I would drop it if I used one hand to dial the numbers.  I also accidentally find that holding the phone next to my face causes the accidental pressing of the buttons.I could continue, but overall, the Android operating system on the S4 takes more effort and is less user friendly to use than the Windows operating system on the HTC 8X.Note though, the 8X is not without its share of problems.  It was so thin that I could not easily grip the phone. There was a problem with access to YouTube. It did not have expandable storage. I could not swap batteries. It did not have the wide variety of apps which Android users enjoy.  You were also forced to use Zune to backup or move data compared to simply transferring data to the micro SD card and then removing the card.Overall, for business use, I preferred the Windows operating system of the HTC 8X. For personal use I would select the Android.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *UPDATE:  After not getting adequate assistance on how to get the S4 to function better at T-mobile (they really did try but just were not well trained on the non-Samsung apps), I went to the Samsung Booth inside the local Best Buy store for help with the problems and functionality I experienced with the phone. The Samsung rep and I worked on my S4 for hours trying to get it to work correctly. He eventually backed everything up to my micro SD card and then did a hard reset of the phone to erase all of the software. He explained that he discovered that my phone had received an incremental update from T-mobile and that Samsung incremental updates are known to cause problems. He recommended we do a complete factory reset and reload the new factory software. Contrary to my belief, not all of the apps were automatically backed up and reloaded after the hard reset from the Google servers. Once I reinstalled my apps, the Samsung Rep proceeded to disable the Samsung apps which he knew created problems. It turns out that Google Now and third party apps such as Quicpic, ES File Explorer, K-9 Mail, MuPDF, and Assistant (I prefer this over Google Now, but use both) work much better than the basic Samsung apps I had been using. Pity that Samsung didn't get their equivalent apps right the first time. Regardless, the phone began to function more efficiently, but continued to experience issues.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *UPDATE 2: October 7, 2013 - Still trying to resolve the software issues and get the phone to function properly. I spoke to a second tier S4 tech support specialist at T-Mobile. She stated the problems I experienced with the S4 were Samsung related and referred me to Samsung tech support. I then spoke to a S4 tech support specialist at Samsung. The Samsung specialist stated that the problems I experienced are related to the Android operating system which they don't support! They referred me to Google support at www(dot)Google(dot)com/supportI also note that I am not trying to knock the phone but sincerely trying to get the phone to function properly in a secure business environment which apparently pushes the phone to it's limits. My client's demand privacy and I have had the local Samsung rep (not T-Mobile) configure the phone to protect my client's privacy both in use and in the event the phone is lost.  I don't believe that all of the readers of this review are fairly reviewing this review in the context of business users who seek privacy.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.99", "Features": "Internal Memory: 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM.
