{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buy one! You can't buy better for the money!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RYH7V50JSJQAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying and paying and paying... and paying for my subsidized AT&T; Galaxy S4 I decided to look around when buying for a phone for my wife. I knew I didn't want to be trapped in a contract so I went with the Nexus 5 and off contract Straight Talk service. This was and still is an excellent purchase. (Both highly recommended)But when it came to getting a phone for may 9 year old daughter $400+ was not in the cards. After tons of looking I found this great looking Blu Studio 5.0S II and immediately ordered it. Smaller, thinner, and faster with a quad core and full 1 gig of ram than the $130 Studio 5 II. It also has the better 8Mp cam on the back and 1.6 Mp cam on the front. (Works great, HD? for Skype) The phone has a great bright IPS screen that looks good from all angles. (See my uploaded pics for examples... also rear cam example) Oh and it does NOT have the problem some of the Blu 5.3\" and 5.5\" have as far as the screen dimming every 5 seconds.The 4.2 android is very fluid and the phone is very responsive. I hear Blu will be rolling out Kit Kat at the beginning of May.The phone as far as size is the same width as my Galaxy S4, same thickness and only a 1/4\"\" taller as measured.The speaker is very loud and clear (much better than my Galaxy S4 and wife's Nexus 5)The phone call on both ends is about average quality. (I don't have a sim card yet I just used the magic Jack free calls app)The phone comes with cheap headphones, 1 amp charger, micro usb wire, clear rubber phone cover, and one screen protector. I would recommend getting more screen protectors as this phone does not have gorilla glass from what I understand.The rubber cover is great it fits well but I would not expect that to save the phone Falling more than a few feet. I hope more cases become available for this phone. I went ahead and ordered the Square Trade $30 1-year replacement in case my daughter breaks the screen.As far as the screen quality goes it looks nice and bright from all angles.... and I really can't tell much of a difference between the Galaxy S4 or Nexus  5 when it comes to pictures or video. It plays Netflix and YouTube very well.As has been said before the one major issue with this phone is the lack of internal storage space. It only comes with 4 gigabytes only of which 2 are available because of the operating system. Only 780 megabytes are available to install apps like any Google apps that require to be installed on the phones internal memory. I would suggest moving as many apps as you can to an external SD card and also set the cameras default save location: to the external SD card. For only about $15 you can add a nice high speed 16 gigabyte card to this phone. Something the Nexus 5 and IPhone can't do.The battery isn't great but lasts about a day under normal usage.So in summary I would definitely buy this phone if my Galaxy A4 broke and use it with T-mobile $30 unlimited text and data plan. ( I would use the magic jack Free Calls app to make phone calls over the data)Added 4/13/14 2 yr cost comparisons:Galaxy S4$3456 total cost with phone for 2 years on-contract with insurance. 4G LTE 6 gigs data a month.Nexus 5$1800 Total cost with phone after 2 years with accident protection through Square Trade. $45 Staight talk 4G LTE no contract. Unlimited talk, text, data. (Throttled after 2.5 gigs)Blu Studio 5.0 S II$1195 Total cost with phone after 2 years with accident protection through Square Trade. $30 a month T-Mobile 4G unlimited text and Data. (Throttled after 5 gigs) 2 years of Magic Jack Voip service (use the \"magicApp\" app by MagicJack to make phone calls over the data connection)Hope this helps,Charles Smith", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Blu!", "Author": "PettS", "ReviewID": "R198MFRNFJ0YQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK its exactly as shown wait it think its even better it a 8 megapixels rear camera and 2 mp front facing has a 1080 p video,quad core  very nice slim yet will made  very fast and responsive definitely will be buying more blu products.Also comes with a screen protector  plus a extra one in the box has the clear case and charger,ear buds too.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "As good as I hoped it would be", "Author": "Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R49FUDVY1B6SG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It got here fast, on time, well packaged.Contents in box: Phone, Case, Ear buds, Charger, Extra screen protector (comes with one already applied to screen), User manuals.First Impression: This phone both looks and feels like something you'd easily pay over $400 for without contract. Its very thin, sleek, and responsive. All buttons are easy to use; even with the silicone case on.Screen: Not too big not too small (had the note 3 and Titan 2 before this). It looks great. Could be a little brighter but not at all dim or unsaturated. Very Crisp colors. Some where in between the Iphone 5 and gs4 overall.Camera: Says 8mp on the phone itself but settings only go up to 6mp. It takes beautiful pics and videos. Front facing cam is the best ive seen on any android; even in very low light.Things to mention: The capacitive keys on the front only turn on when you touch then. Im not sure if that can be changed but its a little pesky til you get the hang of where they are. It got a little warn when i tried to use it while charging so i would be careful.Bottom Line: The design, materials and software (possible Kit Kat update in May) put into the Studio 5.0S II are a steal at this price. Not to mention that it comes with high quality accessories that most manufacturers dont bother to include with phones at this price range. Not to be compared in any way with the cheap ANDROID clones that have been popping up everywhere.Update:Ive put my studio s2 through lots of testing(calls, video calls, netflix, youtube, games, social media, pictures, recording software, etc and I am pleasantly surprised at how well it has been functioning. The battery really lasts, the data speeds are very fast with this phone. Ive already ordered another one for my sister! After reading some other peoples reviews I've noticed that people have issue with the camera. the camera is great with good features, the pictures and videos it takes are wonderful. also the zoom capability is a pinch to zoom, also it has a dedicated camerabutton (volume rocker) how awesome is that!BUY ONE!", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone, wish it supported more frequencies", "Author": "Eric Gross", "ReviewID": "R3BY7W2F2H9LZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first, this phone is in fact the BLU Studio 5.0 S II even though BLU has not advertised or released any information on the device themselves - this confused me when I was trying to research the specs and confirm some of the information given by the seller about the phone - not sure what BLU is waiting for to release info and add it to their website because this is a great phone at a great price point.OK, on to my only real complaint. Although its advertised as working on 3g on Tmobile, att, and other GSM carriers this phone doesn't support the 1700 or 2100 frequencies, which for most people(anyone not living in one of the 20 largest cities/markets) will reduce their Tmobile speeds to 2g/edge. I've noticed that Tmobile is taking their sweet time refarming their towers to expand their 3g/4g support to the 850 or 1900 frequency or whatever that they said they were going to do. This will definitely make me drop Tmobile and head over to Net10 to allow me to hop back on to att's network to get those faster speeds.Finally, the long list of pros. This phone is a great phone at a great price. One of the first things I did was run the AnTuTu benchmark and it did a pretty good job scoring roughly 17000, which is almost exactly as good as the Galaxy S3 score. In the benchmark this phone significantly outperforms the S3 in all categories but GPU (and screen quality). So unless you are playing the new 3D/GPU intensive games this phone will do a great job for 99% of what most people need/want a smartphone to do. It runs a pretty vanilla version of Android 4.2 - the only real UI difference is a spin by BLU on the look and feel of the phone settings menu.The build quality feels very nice and I found nothing that made it look or feel cheap. I have a galaxy S3, and the Studio 5.0 S II weighs about the same and is just as thin and wide as the S3 and is about 1/2 inch taller due to the 5 inch screen. The screen is qHD and has about 220 dpi which isn't bad - movies and photos look pretty good on it. The camera seems to take good photos and has very little shutter lag when actually snapping a photo. It only has 4gb of internal phone memory (about half of which is used up by the system) - a 8 or 16 gb external SD card will help ensure those last 2 free gb can be used for any apps you might want, which 2gb for apps should be enough for most of us budget minded buyers.I've only had the phone for a day now, but so far its been pretty impressive for a $150 smartphone. I'll post updates if I find anything with the phone that warrants an update - perhaps more time will reveal more pros or more cons.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good phone for the price.", "Author": "Cole Cash", "ReviewID": "R3RHZDYMPA6DM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using the phone for about a week, I've decided to write a review since I was very hesitant when buying this Blu Studio phone.  I can now say I would recommend this phone to anybody who doesn't need/want the higher end phones and is satisfied with a very good phone that gets the job done.  Out of the box is a nice little bundle; you get the phone, charger, clear gel case, head set, and screen protector (one already put on, and some extra ones I believe).  I use straight talk service and at first couldn't get the phone to receive picture messages.  After chatting with straight talk, they sent a link to google play store for apn settings setup app.  Followed the instructions and it now works perfectly.  The camera advertised says 8mp, but the settings says 6mp (I don't know why that is or why they do that). The quality is very average.  Not bad, but not good either.  Day shots were good, night shots produced some noise.  The phone is very light, thin, and with the 5\" screen its the perfect size in my opinion.  I personally like how the phone looks with the white back and bottom.  The plastic back doesn't feel too premium but I guess it's to keep costs down, but with the gel case it's fine.  Be sure to have at least an 8gb memory card for pictures, apps, and music.  Video playback was decent if you're just watching a few minutes clip.  HD video on youtube was grainy but that's the display not being full HD I think.  I haven't recorded video so no comment there.  I like vanilla android and not some UI that the major companies put (samsung, LG, motorola, etc).  There is no bloatware and with stock android, the phone moves without noticeable lag.  The hspa+ service is okay, I must just be used to LTE but there is a noticeable difference is speeds, but this also aids in keeping battery life extended.  I got a day and half off of full charge, though I don't use much data.  The IPS display is sharp enough, not the greatest display but not awful either.  The only hiccup I've had is, when texting someone who I haven't already texted (therefore no conversation bubbles yet), their phone number for whatever reason gets cut off and the text says its sent but people have not received them. To be sure that the text message is properly sent out, I have to look at the text bubble and be sure the phone number is the full 11 numbers (including the 1, again because the phone will leave out the area code sometimes) according to a test I did.  This is NOT all the time though and was a very small number of times, I believe it was because of the number 1 not being there for the contact. Very weird but not much of an annoyance to me. All in all, very good phone, it's not top of the line, but gets the job done at an above average rating to me.  Hope this helps those considering buying one, I recommend it.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love this phone it works well. and its big i can do anything.", "Author": "kareen sinclair", "ReviewID": "R1WZ0E0BYIKFM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm using this phone for about a mth now and it work well I love it I can do anything with it take nice pictures, it came on lock I'm in Jamaica and it work very.

I have not found a bad thing about this phone yet.

I bought it to replace my Blu Studio 5.5 when my screen got wet. Overall, this phone is fantastic. The screen isn't as big (of course) but it is still huge. I have an SD card and am able to put all of my apps, pictures, etc., on it. I am able to use songs on my phone as my ringtones, except under alarms. The cameras are both absolutely great! The rear camera has an automatic focus so my pictures come out very clear (for a phone at least). The front camera is high quality compared to most front cell phone cameras which is great for Skyping my grandparents with my constantly moving 2 year old! The only complaints I have are that the cover does not quite cover the phone. It fits snugly which leaves the edges of the screen susceptible (I have already chiped the edge of it!). Also, the data connection is very slow regardless of whether I use wifi or my network. I didn't have this problem with my Blu Studio 5.5, so I'm not sure what is going on. The quad core processor is supposed to be the same, but I have trouble opening more than a couple of apps at a time so I have to constantly go back and close out of everything in order to be able to load anything.

The battery even though it's only 2000mah it lasts a long time I also have an HTC One M7 and the battery on this Blu studio last longer must be because of the lower resolution of the display but the battery last alot longer than my HTC One, Bluetooth connection is good also no issues or problems with that.Now for the bad l the screen at time gets unresponsive have to press very hard so it will register the action I want sometimes it happens while unlocking the screen I don't know if its only my device and I have a defective one but too much issue to send it back and find out, keyboard is bad I installed the google keyboard trying to see if that would do any better and it is better than the stock but every know in then for some reason the screen won't register the letter I'm pressing and won't type the letter for some reason the screen gets unresponsive while typing don't know if it has to do also with the prior issue it might be part of that same problem doesn't happen every time but now and then I have gotten that problem, now the earphones you can only use the earphone's that come with the device they sound good but not great, I have some skullcandy earphones that sound awesome with my HTC one and for some reason with this phone the music sounds lousy you can barely hear the person sing so there is an issue with that and I have tried two more earphones and also headphones and same issue only the earphone's that come with device seem to work properly like I stated before, and know for the the thing that bothers me the most and that I have the most issue with is that the gps is very bad, sometimes can't lock on to a satellite and it will say searching for satellite and if your lucky it might lock on and you'll get the route for a while then once you reach a different area where the signal isn't that good it will stop and not work and sometimes try to re-route you because the satellite can't properly get your location and one time it couldn't even look up the address I needed, and luckily I had my other phone and put the same sim I was using on this device on to the other and it found the address with no problem so there is a lot of issues with the gps so if you depend on gps don't get this phone unless for some reason my device is defective if it weren't for that main issue I would probably give 4 stars, hope this review is helpful.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "the 3g doenst work in Angola", "Author": "Alex Cust\u00f3dio", "ReviewID": "R1ZKE2ND2MBN8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm giving 1 star I could easily give 5 stars. This cell is amazing for the price, god everything. The only problem that I face is that the 3g and or 4g from BLU smartphones doesn't work here in Angola. In 2012 I bought one BLU vivo 4.3 and I noticed this, now bought 2 (this one and the Life one X), unfortunately the internet only works with 2g (edge GPRS). This is really bad, very bad.
