{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone, but has a few issues.", "Author": "MagnoliaSouth \"As soon go kindle fire with sn...", "ReviewID": "R2SE5YLILDI1XK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought mine through a special offer at Best Buy. This is now considered an older model (at present the S4 is the current model) and I couldn't see paying hundreds for an old model so I found a deal elsewhere.That said, it's really a great phone but there are a few things I wish I had known about up front. Maybe they'll help you.I wish I had known that...... not all S2s are alike. As the product title indicates, this is specifically a SGH-T989 and this model is designed especially for T-Mobile.... when you're searching for a case, be sure to search for one that works with the SGH-T989 instead of just an S2 because the cases will fit differently.... smart phone batteries never last very long, especially if you stay signed in to everything. It's not a bad idea to purchase extra batteries (again, designed for the SGH-T989). I bought three of these but I can't really comment further on them because I've not received them yet. Look for my review there though, because after I use them I WILL review them.Now for the pros and cons.I like that...... it's fast and has good resolution, though I cannot compare it to much else.... it's fairly easy to use.... the camera is amazing and has a flash (but on the back only).... it has a front facing camera, but see what I don't like below too.... the video looks great.... it has voice search.... it has Google services integrated, to include backup and restore.I don't like that...... for some oddball reason, Android (the operating system this phone has) insists on installing apps on the phone, rather than a removable microSD card. I cannot fathom why this is the case. Granted, that's an OS issue, but it still affects the phone.... the front facing camera doesn't have a flash.... mine (not all, because this doesn't happen to my son's nor my daughter's) does not shut off, ever. I don't know what has caused this, but mine began all of a sudden. The reason I add it here is because NO app should ever power it back on immediately. Clearly there is a serious security flaw here. I plan on resetting it today, which I dread.Apps that make it even better are...... Swiftkey (paid, but there is a free version too, but paid is much better). I don't like Android's native keyboard and this one is great for predictive text.... Go SMS Pro (free) because for some inexplicable reason, Android does not let you customize the notification tone for each contact's incoming text message. That is, if I want a certain tone for my daughter, I cannot make hers different from everyone else's and I've no idea why Android does this, either. With this app, I can do that, but it only works if its still running.... Juice Defender Ultimate (paid; there is non-Ultimate free version too).All in all, for a smart phone I'm very pleased.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "mixed feelings", "Author": "kiimon34", "ReviewID": "R3HH6D9AWCP577", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When the phone was sent to me the charging.

The only problem I have with this phone is it seems I have to reset it daily or it operates a little strange sometimes like I do not receive calls of voice messages.

Liked that one, but wanted a couple extra features it didn't have. Wasn't going to consider the S3 or S4, as way too expensive.  The on off button on the S2 t989 isn't recessed like the S1, so you can feel it without looking for it.  The screen is larger than the S1.  It have a custom choice of what to pick to powersave, which the S1 didn't.  The graphics are better and easy for my old eyes to see.  Yep, I think most of the galaxy models have battery drain like the some iphones, but a big extended battery with cover is available. I got mine on ebay. That way you don't have to worry much of batt drain.  I'm on tmobile, and all I had to do was remove the sim and micro sd card from the S1, and put in in the S2, and was up and running. Virtually no complaints about my new/used S2.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "NYC", "Author": "K. kady", "ReviewID": "R3JITNHF6JMXRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone did not come in an original tmobile box, but new.

In my analysis, I should have asked myself in which phone the battery was used if the phone itself was not used, but trusted the seller for it. However, if the phone came with 115 contacts' numbers on it, besides text messages and various call logs, then I am at a loss as to what the seller's BRAND NEW description meant. Was it my mind that was playing games on me, or it was the seller?This is utter dishonesty, mischievous, totally unacceptable, against all business ethics, and need to be condemned in no uncertain terms.'DISHONESTY' ON THE PART OF ONE OR THE OTHER IS THE ATTITUDE THAT HAS BROUGHT THE WORLD TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY - TOTAL CHAOS, INSTABILITY, WAR, DISORDER, BEING AT EACH OTHERS THROAT. ETC. ETC.Personally I believe it is best to always tell the truth -TRUTH ALWAYS PREVAILS - and have one's peace, rather than telling lies and sitting on thorns. To this seller, my advice is not to go by this route again, for the next victim may not be as kind, sympathetic, and considerate as I am, and may want to demand his/her pound of flesh.Sorry if I appear to be too hard on you, madam.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have always been an apple gal but...", "Author": "Erica J.", "ReviewID": "R2W4UWAHROBARI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has completely changed my mind. Yes, apple has some great products-ones that i still will use daily.But this samsung Galaxy tops the iphone. I like the playstore more than the Itunes, or appstore. The phone screen seems bigger and it feels amazing in my hand, i fell in love instantly. This phone has many motion activated actions that improve its quality like turning it over to mute it.
