I'm glad I bought it because now I'm using it like crazy. There are only about 2 cons.1- no micro usb card. You'll have to buy your own.2- There's something wrong with my text messages. When people text me, it says that they sent it february 17th 2047 at 8:01pm. Weird. I'm going to get that checked out soon. I think it can be fixed.Overall, good phone for the price. It's no Iphone, but I'll get used to it.
