I bought a Samsung Galaxy S3, as described in the product's title, but when the product arrived, I realize this isn't the product I purchased, I received an Android GT A7100, which is the S3's CHINESE version !!This is an outrage. I have talked to the seller and they insist that they sent the right cellphone and the problem lies with the courier, something everyone here in Costa Rica knows it's practically impossible. Aeropost, my courier, does not touch the contents of the packages that are sent and they are not open until it is delivered.It's not possible that out of 35 negative reviews, most of them deal with the same problem. Today, March 20th, 2013, history repeats itself with this seller. I'm disgusted and I believe Amazon should do something with this seller quickly and find a way to avoid this type of repeated mistakes.As of right now, nothing has been solved.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the wait, believe the hype!  Great phone!", "Author": "Tammy E. Hoeck \"fairylore\"", "ReviewID": "RFDYFB0ZINT58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been using the Samsung Galaxy S2 for a couple of months before I got the S3 and while I was really not pleased with the price, this is an outstanding phone.  I have a sister and a niece that have the I-Phone and they both swear by it, but switching my carrier was not an option for me.  My husband is in the computer business and is always researching (and sometimes getting) the newest devices, he actually does programming of android apps so I trust his opinion.  He is actually the reason that I got the Samsung Galaxy S2 and I literally fell in love with that phone.  It was the first phone that my husband had gotten for me that I actually used for more than just making/receiving calls!  I found myself checking my emails at work, searching the web for things that co-workers were talking about, and actually playing games on my phone!  I gave my S2 to my daughter so that I could justify me getting the S3, and as of today, I have not regretted that move not once.First off, let me tell you that the S3 (just like the S2) has gorilla-glass and this is the number 1 reason to get this phone, especially if you have children or are prone to drop things.  Trust me, when you pay up to $500 for a phone (or anything else for that matter) then you want to at least know that in the event that you accidentally drop it, that it is not the end of the line for your purchase.  The gorilla-glass makes the front of the phone virtually unbreakable, I mean you are not going to be able to scratch the screen or crack it unless you literally take a nail and a hammer and work at it!Now, for the S3, let me tell you...Siri has finally gotten some competition!  S-Voice is amazing!  And I love to tell her thank you because she always responds with \"my pleasure\" or \"your welcome\".  She makes finding places, checking on the weather, checking the traffic or just looking for the best time/place to see a movie so much easier than before.  I was going to ask for a tablet but no more, why bother?I have heard people complain that the phone is too large.  But honestly, the day after I got this phone and brought it into the office, people were arguing with me because they thought I didn't really have the S3 because they thought it was a lot bigger than it was.  It fits in my hand perfectly and yet has a screen that is large enough for me to check out the web w/out feeling like I am losing something by not looking things up on a standard PC.All the buttons are user friendly, you just have to get used to where they are and what all they do.  Hey, when you buy a car and learn that the volume control is also located on the steering wheel, do you not get the car?  Do you not use the option offered to you?  No, you change with innovation and with the S3 all the changes are worth it!Bottom line, I would recommend this phone to everyone that I know that can appreciate a quality android phone.  There is a reason that this phone has been in such big demand.  If you get the chance...get it...you will not regret your purchase.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPhone or Galaxy S3? no way!!", "Author": "Luca Cascianini", "ReviewID": "R2ZXI7ORUD7YQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the S3 yesterday, since I owned a iPhone 4S here the comparison:DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users.

However, here is what you need to know:My Mobile Provider advised that my existing (normal) SIM Card (2009 vintage - 25mm x 16mm) was not sized to cut to the MicroSIM size (15mm x 11mm) as the chip was too close to the latter dimension.For $3.49 they sold me the new style normal SIM Card (25mm x 16 mm) with the chip being much smaller than before (12mm x 9mm). The new SIM Card was 'activated' with my existing number and  then cut with a cutter (like the  Clearmax Micro SIM Cutter from Amazon).

I have had the phone since June of 2012 and in terms of performance the phone has more than met my expectations with one major flaw - this is the most fragile screen I have ever seen on a phone!In November of 2012 while in Norway on business trip I dropped the S3 phone from my pants pocket onto the floor of a bus. The distance of the fall was about two feet (distance from the seat of the bus to the floor) and the phone at the time had a screen protector. Regardless, this short fall led to the screen shattering in numerous places. Fine... My fault right, I dropped the phone. I called Samsung Norway and was told to take the phone into a repair center and repair the screen at my expense... Done.The phone was quickly repaired (entire screen and digitizer assembly were replaced) and the phone functioned well for a few months albeit I was much more careful with the phone which had in addition garnered the protection of a sturdy case (this takes away from the glamour of having such a thin phone but hey it was worth it to not have to deal with another broken screen).In January of this year, despite my increased care, the phone again slipped out of my pocket, this time falling a distance of about three feet while exiting a vehicle to land on snow covered concrete. Despite the new coat of armor, again the fall resulted in the screen shattering in numerous places. (As an aside, when this screen shatters the phone becomes very unusable as it results jagged pieces of glass being exposed, definitely not finger friendly).Once again, and with slightly more frustration, I called Samsung although this time from the US. I'm sorry to say that they were extremely unhelpful. As I have the international version of the phone they could not recommend a service center, and instead continuously referred me to the international long distance phone numbers for Samsung China and Samsung Hong Kong as they do not make or service the international device (far be it from me to think that when I call Samsung they would service their own products or at least have the ability to transfer me to someone that could).Now I am left again with a phone with a broken screen contemplating paying hundreds more of my own money to have the screen repaired. I have been a loyal Samsung customer for years (this is my fourth Galaxy Phone and I recently purchased the Note II) and while I will be the first to admit I do not treat my phones like fine China, I have never before experienced a phone with such limited durability (the Note II in contrast has demonstrated phenomenal durability). Google Galaxy S3 broken screen and you will find hundreds of similar stories! This is terrible and is clearly a design flaw inherent in the phone.All in all, this is a great phone as long as you treat it like fine China and don't expect it to survive real world conditions (and if you break it don't count on Samsung helping you out, at least in my experience)... I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this phone even though I love everything else about it.Thank you for reading my review and please comment if you've had similar experiences.

Now i'm not saying that all the galaxy S3's have these issues but it's kind of hit or miss. i was very weary on buying a phone outside of my local att store primarily due to warranty issues like i'm having now. My advice is make sure you get an extended warranty with your phone and make sure the people that have these extended warranties have many good reviews saying that they honor those warranties. Because nobody wants to be told like i just was that because it's been almost 2 months since i bought my phone that if i send it back that i might only get a partial refund that was faulty in the first place. I hope that amazon tries to help me without making me go without a phone.UPDATE: I was told by amazon that they would (One Time Only) offer me a full refund which is pretty awesome but i have to first call samsung and see if they can help me with this issue.

I purchased this phone from a vendor that was fulfilled by Amazon, thinking I should be able to trust that vendor.  Not so.  Mobile Brothers advertised it as an unlocked international with a quad core processor.  The protective sticker on the screen even said quad core.  However, it was the AT&T; dual core version.  As always, Amazon was great.  Knowing I need a phone, they issued a refund and gave me 30 days to send the crap I bought back.  I then did some research, and found a vendor who had an actual telephone number and had a chat with them.  Their offering was not prime eligible but after speaking to the gentleman, and being assured that what I was getting was advertised, I took a chance.  Phone arrived in 4 days, and one of those days was Thanksgiving.  I opened the box, fired it up and it is indeed, the international version with quad core and FM radio feature.  Neither one of these are available for the US models.  Only dual core and no radio.  If you are considering purchasing this phone, ThePowerSellers will not rip you off.  Great vendor!Now the phone.

Even better, as the international version has more features than the US version.  It boots up in 22 seconds. (I just timed it)  Has more features than I've even discovered yet.  S-Voice is a great tool.  You can control most of the phone's features, make calls, and send text messages by voice.  There is a whole slew of gestures you can enable.  The camera is amazing for a phone camera.I can't say a lot more as I haven't had it long enough to explore all the features myself.  This is a great phone so far.  I don't know what the longevity will be, but then you don't really know that with any electronic device, so only time will tell there.**UPDATE 12/4/2013  I have received an email from Mobile Brothers stating that they did not sell the wrong item intentionally.  They seem pretty sincere and due to a couple facts I believe them.  The box was factory sealed, as best as I can tell.  The protective sticker, as I stated before said Quad Core.  It also states quad core on the back of the box.  It would almost seem that the fault lies with Samnsung itself.  While I know that some vendors are dishonest, I would like to think the majority of them ARE honest. So I will change the feedback I left for Mobile Brothers accordingly.  And my apologies for any trouble I might have caused them as it would seem they sold the item in good faith.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera issues", "Author": "Juan Gil", "ReviewID": "R2KASWZCVP4X3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for a friend, and he really like the phone, but he has had issues with the camera.

My first impressions were dominated by it's bigger size, compared with its predecessors - it's 4.8 inches compared with the S2's 4.3 - and as you swipe up to wake the device up, it has a beautiful screen. I loved the watery sound and the ripples that signal Samsung's nature theme for this phone. So much, in fact, that I must admit I kept turning the phone on and off a good many times just to see the animation again and again. The ripples are also an immediate demonstration of how fluid and fast the phone is, and this you can see immediately as you begin to navigate around. Stuff happens so fast when you touch something that you've actually got to start being savvy about how it behaves to avoid accidental touches. This is Android on steroids.The specs on this device make it the fastest powerhouse in the smartphone world right now. Samsung's own Exymos quad-core processor (at least on the device I reviewed) and 1GB of RAM make everything you do on this phone fast. Browsing, videos, (sorry but I hate games), multi-tasking etc is supersonic. The S3's camera is said to be the same one as on the iPhone 4s. In daylight, you get great pictures. I didn't fare so well with low light conditions, but that's the case with most smartphone cameras. This phone has a few tricks up its sleeve which I at first was most excited about because it signified a direction in enhancing the user's experience. Not all of these worked as well as they should though. There's the S-Voice, the Siri clone, which didn't necessarily understand me or be very helpful. I asked it what I could take for a headache and it said it really couldn't help with that. Another personal assistant app, Iris, although mostly into sassy answers, told me what over-the-counter medicine to try. But the S Voice goes off to search for stuff I wanted coming back with instant results unlike Iris who tells me to go do a search on my own. She also sometimes tells me I can take what I like for a headache! The S Voice function is supposed to wake the phone up and that's where I had the most frustration. Similarly with opening up various apps on the phone.Another trick, Smart Stay, is supposed to keep the screen lit up while you're looking at it. This is achieved with the front-facing camera, of course. But it just doesn't work in low-ish indoor lighting. The one reason it gets a rating of 4 is because these features weren't taken to their fullest flawless extent when the company's line is \"Designed for humans.\" But other tricks such as the S Beam to share files and All Share Play to stream music and other media, work well. The S2 sold wildly -- now it remains to be sen whether the S3 will be as stellar.My phone was a review unit from Samsung and is now back with them.

I bought this phone to give to a relative,outside the USA, as a gift for when I visit. I read some reviews about fake S3 International being sold by vendors on Amazon. But I hope that being fullfill by Amazon I would get real one. If I got a fake I would just return it before my trip and get my relative another phone in her country. When I got the phone, I open the box and everything look brand new and said S3 International I9300 including the label on the back of the phone where the battery would go. I thought great and took it on my trip. When I powered it up for my relative and check the phone the boot screen showed I9300. I check about phone in the settings and it showed the Device was I9300. But I notice that superuser was install so it was already rooted, which was unexpected as it was a brand new phone. It was only when I was trying to install a custom recovery to install a custom rom and fonts, that I realize it was fake. When I was in Download mode to install the custom recovery, it should have also said I9300, but it said it was I747 which an S3 but not the international one. I google it and others seem to have this problem. It seems to be that someone remove the internal motherboad of the I9300 and replace it with the I747 variant, but keeping the external case of the I9300. Then that person rooted it and install a custom rom that deceived the user into thinking it is a I9300 in the setting. My trip was about a month, so it is too late to return it. The custom recoverys for  I9300 failed to install properly, But the custom recovery for the other S3 variants which includes I747 worked. I didn't want to risk bricking the phone so I left installed rom alone. On top of that the battery was faulty and had to be replaced. It is her first smart phone so my relative kept it anyways and seem to like it. Just be aware of fakes. If it is already rooted when you get it, it is probably fake. Reboot into download mode.

The first thing I notice was how thin and fragile feeling it was, which immediately sent up a red flag in my mind. As a result, I paid close attention to how I handled the phone and made plans to get a cover the very next day. I activated the phone and fell in love with it instantly. The next day, I pulled the phone out of my pocket as I walked into the wireless store to buy a cover and found the screen had broken while in my pocket. I had not bumped into anything, I had nothing else in my pocket. Additionally, the pants were not tight, so the phone moved around easily in said pocket. My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void.

Nevermind autocorrect prediction, that's no better or worse than others and actually picks up your habits reasonably well.  The absence of a real keypad is a problem, too, but I have no reason to think this touchscreen is worse than others.  Among other problems, if you delete back to use autocorrect, every word you have typed is deleted except for the first word and the new one.  That strikes me as inexcusable, no-one would ever want that to happen.

They promised me, though, that they would keep my voice and text plan the same.  I asked twice and was promised twice.  I found out though, that they added a large surcharge for text messages and raised my price in general. Now I have been battling them now for two months to resolve the matter.  This far from my first bad experience with Verizon. I know I should have known better, but such is my loss.  My advice is to make you life better by going with another carrier.

I tried to put a review up on the US version, but Amazon wouldn't let me. So hopefully this helps out people deciding to get the US version of the phone. In case people are wondering this is for the Sprint network.The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network. Other networks such at AT&T; and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this phone", "Author": "smartbob", "ReviewID": "R1ZKZO92YH3G62", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone in June, the first day I had it I plugged it in to the charge.

It had a 12 hour battery life with all features on (bluetooth, gps, etc.), virtually glitch free, lightning fast performance. I couldn't have asked for a better phone. However, all that was good about this phone was ruined when Samsung released the 4.3 update a few months back. Since the update, battery life has been slashed DRAMATICALLY from 12 hours to about 5. Oh, and that's with power save mode on, low screen brightness, and all other background features and apps turned off. Not only did the battery life get ruined, but the phone started lagging BAD. Now, it takes as much as 25 seconds to wake the lockscreen. I called samsung about both these issues and all they did was give me the usual corporate runaround and tell me to do basic troubleshooting that I had already did plenty of times. I clear the RAM every 5 minutes and the performance is still sluggish. Also, this phone, along with all other samsung phones, is known for killing SD cards. I had a 32gb sandisk that had hundreds of photos and music on it and now the card is unreadable and rendered useless because of careless engineering. After doing some research, I found out that many other people have had this same problem happen to them. Some people have said they had gone through as many as 6 SD cards (Look it up...). This is due to the fact that the SD card slot is located directly above the processor where the most heat is released (Like I said, careless engineering). I'm angry because I have always been a fan of Samsung products but with the faulty android 4.3 release and the poorly located SD card slot, it is obvious to me that this company does not care about the quality of their products. It is obvious that they didn't bother to properly beta test this phone or the 4.3 software for bugs before releasing it to the public. I will never buy a Samsung product ever again and will most likely be switching to the iPhone when I get the money.Oh I almost forgot!

Here is a brief summary of my experience with it.The first few month with it was good.  Everything loaded fast, and the battery lasted exactly my day's worth.  But even then I noticed poor integration of software and hardware.  The Samsung exclusive Touchwhiz apps were gimmicky at best.  Smart-Stay and other motion tracking features Samsung brought were not polished at all.  They would work 50% of the time at best.  Worst of all, the Chrome app was extremely bad at recognizing scrolling and pinch-in and pinch-out zooming touch inputs.Ok, fast forward 6 month into the Samsung experience.  Everything, and I mean every single app lags.  Start up and shutdown times have increased dramatically. There is a significant loading time for common applications like Chrome and the Messaging App.  The power button and the volume rockers were starting to lose their integrity and could easily be inadvertently pressed(probably due to its poor plastic construction!)One year of using the Galaxy S3 has made me realize a couple of things.  1. A lot of features companies like Samsung tries to sell to you via advertising are simply gimmicks that are half-baked.  2. Samsung phones have a horrendous quality issue and will not even last a year of regular usage.  3. When buying a phone, buy the phone that is well made and competent enough to stand use for at least half a year, not the one with the useless huge screen sizes and gimmicking features and poor reliability.Sorry about the length of my rant, but I had to do it to inform potential buyers of the absolute piece of rubbish this phone is.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT BUY INTERNATIONAL VER / NO WARRANTY", "Author": "David Buen Abad", "ReviewID": "R2L8SI7N894Z8A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this unlocked international phone and it was dead within seven months.

Moon \"ESLBruce\"", "ReviewID": "R3MR76J2WT6ENZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered a refurbished phone from Ephonics with some fear and trepidation. The reviews for refurbished phones include many that are apparently not as advertised, including purported Chinese clones, US branded phones labeled as international, and phones with flaws that the seller will not replace or repair.The phone I received appeared to be new (it was refurbished) with all new accessories, as advertised. It was indeed an international phone, recognized as such by Samsung and Google when I connected to them on the web. It includes an FM radio, something missing from US branded phones. When I went to the TMobile store to get my SIM card cut for the phone, the phone worked right away.I had an S3 for eight months, but it was stolen just before Christmas. I was afraid that I might be buying someone else's stolen phone if I bought another one on EBay or Craigslist. The condition that the phone I bought was much better than the one that was stolen (I am hard on phones...) and I am fairly confident that this phone was refurbished as advertised.While I have only owned my particular phone I am reviewing for a few hours, I can say a few things about the Galaxy based on my ownership of one for more than a half year.-the camera is superb. Video and panoramas are especially good. I love having it with me when outside at sunset to capture brilliant skies (the colors seem a bit more vibrant than real life, but that saves \"photoshopping\"-It does consume batteries when you use it as a smart phone. If you have a desktop you can plug it into during the day or wall plug you can plug it into during the day, that solves the problem, as does having an extra battery or two. After market batteries are very inexpensive and work well. You can swap batteries in a couple of minutes. They charge in a couple of hours or less.-voice recognition works well in English and even in Mandarin as a second language. I imagine this is true with other languages as well-The size works OK as a reader. I have a couple of Bible apps with dozens of versions, as well as the Kindle Reader. It's convenient to have when I don't have my Kindle with me.- I like being able to use Google Pinyin for Chinese input. Switching from English to Chinese is done with just one click.-There are hundreds of apps for Android that you can customize your phone with to meet your needs- The build quality is solid and the phone has held up well. I haven't abused it, but I also haven't pampered it either.I bought a book for the phone, but have only looked at it for about 30 minutes or less. The interface seems fairly intuitive; I have been able to do all I have wanted to do.I wouldn't want the experiences that other reviewers who have panned this phone and/or its suppliers have had. For me, it looks like the Samsung Galaxy SIII phone I bought from Ephonics is a winner. Good luck! Oh, btw, the phone I owned before I bought from a trusted friend who liked to have the latest and greatest phone and sold his unlocked TMobile Galaxy SIII after only six months when the new HTC One came out. I didn't have another trusted phone with an unlocked phone to sell, so I bought mine from an Amazon Prime reseller.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Microphone does not work and have to use headset all the time", "Author": "tim dawson", "ReviewID": "R19T5K2DJKQM8H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Once I got to work and installed sim card the microphone is not working and I am in Indonesia for several more months", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't listen to those who 'got the wrong product'", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RU7ISYHSVE9JB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is exactly as advertised.

You can do email, maps, Facebook, Twitter and browsing (which is what I use it for 90% of the time). The multi window option is good. I can have a review going in the upper pane and directions in the lower one.I would buy from this vendor again. I don't know how they can sell it so cheap but I just got mine.

I already was an existing T-Mobile customer, and hence, the Smartphones represented an upgrade. Unfortunately, as recently as this past April, we were charged $579.00/per phone. The price has dropped considerably since that time (by over $200.00), since the Samsung Galaxy S4 came onto the market, shortly thereafter. However, to its credit, T-Mobile let us finance the purchase of those Smartphones, in interest free increments, over the next twenty four months. Regarding the Galaxy S3, it is essentially a mini-computer. I've been operating computers since the late 1980's; however, the operation of the Galaxy S3 was very challenging. It would not have been as difficult had we been provided with better technical support from Samsung. Samsung was very anxious for us to register our product, online. However, once you are registered, that is where their \"support\" ends. Essentially, if I had a question with the Galaxy S-3, Samsung either told me to contact T-Mobile, or it didn't respond at all. For example, I asked Samsung to send me an instructional manual for the S-3. They stated that they would \"have to special order one, and that it would take 6-8 weeks\". Several months went by, and I finally called Samsung back. They told me that no manual would be forthcoming, as they didn't provide one to T-Mobile customers! To its credit, T-Mobile's technical support staff was very patient in explaining the various components of the S-3. However, I had to buy two instructional manuals, which I found in a bookstore, to learn about that product. Even those manuals didn't include everything, so I had to go on the Internet to learn the different functions. Essentially, it took months to learn to use most of the systems. My biggest complaint with the Galaxy S-3, is that the keyboard is very small, and hence, it is very difficult to type information onto the screen. Also, at times, the information on the screen is too small, and it rotates unexpectedly from vertical to horizontal. There is a very good feature of the Galaxy S-3, which I'd like to expound upon. Namely, there is a call reject feature, which will prevent telemarketers, and bill collectors from bothering you. Many times, collection agencies have the wrong cell number, and they will continuously hound you, even when they are apprised that they have called the wrong number. We also like the still camera, and the video camera on the Galaxy S-3, as well as the digital tape recorder. Last, the quality of the voice on the Android system is far superior, to our prior experience, with a non-Android cell phone. All in all, I'm going to rate the Galaxy S-3 fours stars out of five.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung?

It really is. It's powerful, it looks and feels good, and it is relatively durable if you treat it right. It runs smoothly on Ice Cream Sandwich and not-quite-as-smoth-but-well-enough on Jelly Bean. It's a nice upgrade from the Galaxy S2 for sure. There are many cool features I like about it, such as the smart Look, motion controls, lock screen shortcuts, S Voice and more.It is also full of nasty, inexcusable flaws. The S3 has earned a bad rep of suffering from \"Sudden Death Syndrome\", constant freezes and resets and other nasty issues like charging ports going bad. These don't start happening right away.. they usually start showing up after a few months of use.I don't know if all S3s are faulty. I've read a lot about these issues, I've heard the feedback... most of the people that I know that had S3s have had issues with it, and myself as well. For such an expensive device, for it to get bricked out of nowhere is just not acceptable by any means. It is true that all electronics are subject to break like that, but when you see a trend happening then that's no isolated case.The issue seems to be related to faulty internal memories on the 16GB model. This is just the conclusion I've settled with after a bunch of reading on this issue. Fortunately if you have a little patience and if you remain under warranty, you could probably still get your phone fixed. But otherwise if you can't count on being covered like that I'm afraid to say I wouldn't recommend anyone to invest on this phone.It's a shame though, cause otherwise it IS a great device.

I love the phone. I've told everyone who asked me \"iPhone or Droid\" that the Droid was superior and an amazing phone. And it WAS, it did everything I wanted and more. I swore by it and converted a lot of my friends to buy it with me who also love it. Against my wishes, when my next upgrade is available, I will be shifting my loyalty and buying an Apple iPhone.Again, this isn't because the product is poor. I will reiterate: The product is excellent. I just can't deal with the ridiculous ridiculous short battery life, how can you release something like this? I am currently using the Galaxy SIII. With the GPS off, the Bluetooth off, WiFi search off, and power saving ON- It STILL dies before I even leave work. I have a steady connection in my office. Sure, I text a lot during the day and use the GroupMe chat pretty liberally, but isn't that the reason I have the phone--To USE it? No exaggeration, even on days when I am NOT texting liberally, my phone does not last longer then 8 hours which is my usual workday. That's with barely texting! I need to strategically pick and choose 3-4 hours a day where I keep my phone on airplane mode just so that it has a sliver of battery life by the time I get home and to my charger.\"Just buy a charger for work dude!\"I did.I originally had a 2nd charger that I was using. I broke it by sitting on it(my fault). I was forced to buy a 3rd charger because of my negligence. $30. And this new charger broke after THREE WEEKS. It just bent and stopped charging randomly, no physical damage. Just stopped working. I REFUSE to spend more money and buy another one out of principle because of that. I spend $30 to just keep your product functioning, and the charger is a flimsy piece of crap that bent plugging into my phone and no longer works. It's like you're trying to extort money from me by giving me a fantastic product with the worst possible battery life and terrible accessories to temporarily fix the pathetic battery life at horribly expensive prices. What kind of business model is that? Not sustainable, that's for sure.The pathetic life of your battery in conjunction with the ridiculous price for additional chargers that BREAK after a month of use is leading me away from the phone I love and have told everyone that I recommend over any other phone on the market. I am a loyal and long-time Droid/Samsung user who will now be giving my business to Apple and the iPhone when my upgrade is available in a couple of months. Not because of a bad product. But because I feel like I am being robbed by the company who made a product with terrible battery life purposely to extort every last $ out of me to buy chargers just to keep the phone alive.Hopefully Apple can deliver where you couldn't.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "user friendly model", "Author": "Santu Saha", "ReviewID": "R8PNSAZ09WF5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I am first time user of the Android phone , I research a lot before buying this set , I think I am right with the reveiws guided me well . the phone is working very well. it is very user friendly and guide me all the time to the proper way. but the only problem is the battery that burn out within one day . otherwise the phone is alright.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R374YP3HB2GCVR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "s3 great phone, bought it used. got phone went to activate it, could not still activated, somewhere!

Boy was I wrong. Now, to be fair, I'm sure if you S3 actually works, it would be a fantastic phone. But if it doesn't, then you're in for a terrible experience. My S3 is slowly dying and Samsung refuses to do anything about it because there's a crack on the screen. I get that it's out of warranty, I really do, but the crack is minuscule and in the bottom right corner. Its so small that I didn't even notice that it was there after I dropped it so there is no way that it affects the hardware or the software inside the phone. And if it does, let's be honest, that is a major drawback on the part of Samsung and their flawed design. To make matters worse, I dropped it when it was in a case, maybe from a foot off the ground (I was in one of those Ikea chairs that bends when you sit in it). A PHONE SHOULDN'T BREAK THAT EASILY! But I had problems from long before that and I was sure they would understand and fix it, seeing as so many large corporations like Amazon, Apple, or Netflix are working hard to improve their customer relations. Not Samsung. This has been the worst customer service experience of my life, and I am honestly not exaggerating. I called them twice, the first time they said that I should try returning it to factory settings using a SAMSUNG App built SPECIFICALLY for SAMSUNG phones. The app doesn't recognize my phone though, so I can't even return it to factory settings without losing my info; that should definitely reflect on the state of my phone. So I decide to call them back and tell them that their own app doesn't recognize the phone, and that the problems have actually gotten worse. They still said that I have to pay $178 to fix a phone that started falling apart weeks after I bought it, and has continued to deteriorate ever since. My old Droid X was better than this thing is now, and that's really saying something. I tried moving up the chain of command so that I could talk to somebody who would have the power to waive the fee, seeing as my problems were prevalent before the crack appeared. Found the guy (he was the supervisor on the floor, named Dan) and he was absolutely useless. Zero help, and he refused to waive the fee, saying that my crack ended the warranty. I attempted to make him understand that the problems were happening long before the crack appeared, but apparently that doesn't matter. Regardless of the fact that they had sold me a broken and deficient product, they wouldn't fix it. I even tried to convince them that I didn't even want them to fix the screen, I pleaded with him to just fix the insides, leave the crack where it is. All I wanted was a phone that works and does what it is advertised to do. Still no luck, and now I'm stuck with a broken phone for a year and a half. Save yourself the trouble and buy from a different company. I have a grudge against Apple and refuse to buy their ridiculously overpriced products, but seriously, I wish I had succumbed to peer pressure and bought an iPhone.

If you are looking for a tough phone without bulkiness this is it! I have put this phone through hell and back, it will not quit. On the less impressive side is the battery. I have to charge it about 3 times a day even when I turn off my data, GPS, and turn my screen brightness to the lowest possible level. The camera is pretty good, nothing to complain about. Sound quality is average in my opinion. I do love how vivid the screen is compared to others released at its time. The design in general gets boring fairly fast. The messaging system isn't the greatest, but the phone is set up to be very convenient. All in all this phone was pretty amazing when first released but with all shiny new things it's fading pretty fast and easily forgettable. Would I recommend this phone? Yeah, its sturdy and decent enough.But  If you can not access a phone charger at least two times a day you may want to look in a different direction.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R384BGJBIL105C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is wonderful, so useful, so nice, you can do everything what you want. internet is so fast, there are a lot of applications", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone overall", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1DKWE2JQXEYSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The galaxy S3 is a beautiful phone with a sleek design.

Keep rebooting itself randomly for no reason when playing music thru bluetooth3. Music player don't know how to pause the song, so if the phone reboot, it replay the song from beginning again, or if you drive inside a mall to stop by different shops, you will have to listen to that same song over and over again4. Music player will play all the sound files in the phone including ring tone, audio files from whatsapp (need to create playlist, not easy if you have thousands of song need to sort)5. Phone will freeze randomly and no respond while pressing the home or lock key (could end up rebooting or need to wait for awhile to respond)6. Build in keyboard lagging, always delay for over a second7. Overheat!!!!! the bottom of the phone can become extremely hot while using the phone8. Phone call log showing all the calls and messages, need to fliter it every time9. Not supporting multi language coding, if you select Chinese as the phone language, phone will not display Japanese characters or other language (English is fine) in songs; if select English as system language, you won't able to read any other language characters10. International version not including Chinese system language (It happen on the Galaxy Note, not sure about S3, but I think is the same)11. Customer service is bad, online chatting agent give me a respond said they are not train for phone that is not US version, told me to contact Hong Kong customer service, but gave me a China number instead... When I email Hong Kong customer service, they said I had to bring the phone to the service department in Hong Kong12. Memory usage is also extremely high, every time I open the RAM control, it used up 90% (still use over 50% if you clear the memory...)I had been using my iphone 4 for years without any of these issues... regrating paying almost $800 for the phone, now just wish the new iphone will come out soon so I can leave this hell...Looks like I'm not the \"human\" that Samsung is designed for...", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Phone does not work on T-Mobile", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "R1GOL8LFHV7TY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So much for being unlocked and 'International' ( not sure how this would work in Germany since TMobile is huge there, and the seller was German!! )The frequencies that this phone provides are different from that of TMobile.So, if you intend to use this on the TMobile network, you need to buy a different Galaxy S3 which has a different Model number - This is what the person at the TMobile store said.If thats the case, i dont see the point in calling it unlocked, since the only big provider you have left is AT&T;!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone sucks", "Author": "Jenny Lynn Dunn", "ReviewID": "RA1FCZ6EUS7SU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not like this phone,actually the htc evo 3D is an older phone but it is better than this one.

PriceSamsung achieved top position in mobile world due to best hardware at aggressive pricing but HTC ONE-X is quad core too clocked at 1.5 GHz and available at lesser price.2. ResolutionResolution of 720 x 1280 Pixels is very promising and produces a realistic display quality with high contrast and sharp looking images.3. ScreenAccording to a consumer survey 4 inch screens are most appropriate for single hand use whereas screens like 5.3 of Note and 4.8 of S3 have reduced the mobility comfort in mobiles. People end up using both hands to operate such large screens. Not to mention the increased risk of screen cracking due to inevitable rough usage. Otherwise AMOLED screen quality is phenomenal.4. BatteryBattery (2100 mAH) is quite impressive and works beyond expectations on heavy duty of such large screen and quad core processor.5. Build QualityPeople might like rounded corners and plastic finish but personally I feel the cheap looking plastic design is toy like and doesn't gives a premium look. Its a matter of individual taste.6. CameraCamera is 8mp same as that of Galaxy S2 with improved interface and color sharpness. courtesy- Android v4 ICS. Front camera is also provided.7. GraphicsGraphics have not been improved, same old Mali-400MP as that of Galaxy S2. But Quad core makes its own contributions.8. Other FeaturesHowever Samsung has always amazed its customers by setting new benchmarks in mobile world. Android Ice-cream sandwich is icing on the cake. S view and S stay though new features but are little unreal in the fast world where we cant wait and press for long, speak to mike, wait for system response and then affirm. Phew !
