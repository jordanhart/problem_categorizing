Because different people need different things from their smartphones, so that title is subjective. Objectively and measurable...for email, text, social networking, etc, there is no device anywhere close to this phone.Not for people who need their phone for Netflix and 3D gaming. Understand, I am not belittling those pastimes, but this won't serve you well if that is what you use your phone for.Anyway. Best keyboard EVER on any device. Wait until you start clicking away at it. The rush of power you will feel as you hit every key as intended, no mistakes, no auto-correction...amazing. Monster battery, I tortured it for 11 hours at work, still over 50% at end of day. Small screen, but brilliant, clear, responsive. The 10.1 update mine came installed with has numerous improvements over BB10 initial release.Perfect weight and feel and size. Snappy, nice camera with HDR now. So much to be excited about.

Finally, i have a phone with a real touchscreen, apps and 4G! Upgrading from a Bold 9930 this phone is like 10x better in every possible way. Web browser that actually works! I can open attachments in seconds with all native apps! I can scroll through thousands of emails and contacts in seconds and they don't take up my entire screen. I can actually do everything the rest of the world has been doing for 5 years plus actually have a REAL KEYBOARD so i can actually respond to emails in seconds without making a million typos and wrong auto-corrects, like all the idiots around me on the bus/train typing like fifth graders with their silly 2 fingers!! (I haven't looked at my fingers to type in 25 years, so no, i will never type on a flat piece of glass and take homosapien evolution back 2 billion years.) You can sideload all the cool Android apps like Google Maps (with navigation, works perfectly!), Amazon, Kindle, OKcupid, Candy Crush Saga, etc. to satisfy and shut up all the stupid Android zombies and iSheep. I have 5,413 contacts as i'm a real estate agent and it breezes through them just like Blackberry always has with the ability to search 1000's of fields in seconds (including Company name, which for some reason half the Android phones still can't do! Android just farts and crashes, and stupid apps like Go SMS/Contacts throw smartphones into epileptic seizures if you try to throw this many contacts or any real data at them). Plus you no longer need BES enterprise, so i can get my Exchange mail and pay $15 less a month on my phone plan, and have a real email instead of Google's gARBAGEmail that looks like email did in 1993!Anyone who actually does WORK on their phone and doesn't just use it as a toy to play games and watch YouTube videos owes it to themselves to buy this phone. Guess what? It's actually a good PHONE,  a good contact manager, a good email device, and a good organizer. Not just a toy/miniature video playback device with a giant screen like everything else on the market. I paid $600 retail for this because i'm still in my plan and my Bold 9930 is going up on eBay. Worth every penny. Finally, i have joined the smartphone world where i can actually get work done AND have an awesome smartphone in one device.

The Curve had been an upgrade from the Pearl.  When the contract was up on the Curve and the battery was really toast it was about the time the Android had made it big and it sounded like writing was on the wall for the Blackberry.  So - first I went with the Droid - hated it!! Next phone was the HTC Incredible, ok but the auto correcting drove me absolutely nuts and I had a really tough time with the keyboard. Hated the calendar.Have had my Blackberry Q10 for 2 weeks now and am extremely happy with it.  It is so nice to type what I want to say and have it actually appear that way on the screen, no more having to closely screen emails and texts before I send them.  Still getting used to the swiping, but it is better everyday.  Love, love, love having the Blackberry calendar back, it is so much easier to use - actually tells me what the date is today and in the future; I did miss that so.....The camera is great, I take a lot of pictures of pets and they never wanted to stay still long enough for the HTC to finally decide to snap the picture - the BBQ10 takes the picture pretty much right away and it is very clear and sharp.I really debated about the size of the Z10 screen vs the Q10 actual keyboard.  Am not sorry in the slightest that I went for the keyboard, I love the feel of it and the ease of moving between numbers and symbols.  The size of the screen is big enough, do kind of miss the sideways feature but I can live without it. Wish call blocking was a little easier on the Blackberry, that was a feature on the android that I haven't been able to locate without going into my Verizon account and entering the number.And finally, the battery life is amazing........ I usually had to plug the HTC in by mid morning and if I wasn't going to be in my car at night was generally concerned about losing power.Not a bit sorry!

I had several more BlackBerries until the iPhone 3G came out and then I was an iPhone user with a 3GS, 4, and 5.  This is an excellent phone and for those of us business users who love the quick typing of a keyboard, this phone is a very nice fit with most of the conveniences of other smart phones.  You have to realize this is basically version 1 of the OS so beware it is not as mature as the competition.  The version on my phone is 10.1.0.2038.  They seem to be coming out with updates regularly so some of my comments may be rendered moot by a future release.Things I don't like:* Android ports don't work as well as native \"Built for BlackBerry\" apps so you might find yourself avoiding many of the apps in BlackBerry World in favor of the few but better native apps.* Only 1 twitter account in the app that comes with the phone (and is tied to the Hub).* Not much choice on the music streaming front yet.  Spotify would make this phone awesome.  I Heart Radio is native and works well.  We can only hope more choice arrives in the future.* Some things functions are not as polished as you would experience with iPhone.  I would expect that to be fixed over time.* I have two friends left on BBM which makes it useless.  It set the standard a long time ago but now they need to get people back on there to make it useful.* The great old professional ringtones are gone.  You can still download and use older BlackBerry tones but this phone comes with a weak offering.  Luckily it is easy enough to fix but surprising considering all my old phones had a better selection.Things I like:* BlackBerry as always is a great tool for communication.* BlackBerry is not tied to a major Internet player.  You are not really making a commitment to an ecosystem like Google, Apple, or Microsoft.* Syncing with Exchange is better than anything currently offered by Apple or Android.  You get everything plus your notes.  I am on Microsoft 365 using their hosted Exchange server and everything syncs perfectly using ActiveSync (no need for BES server)* The Hub really works well.  It can be a little much if you are getting slammed with communications on a particular day but you can toggle off anything that gets in the way of your important stuff.* Accepting invitations, friend requests, and dealing with Linkedin and Twitter through the hub is a joy.  The invitations are really the way it should be on any phone to accept or decline a meeting.  Android and Apple should copy what they have done for this function.  I deal with sending and receiving invitations all day and I live on my calendar.* The battery is as good as any smartphone.  I can go all day on this phone.  To be fair, I could go all day most days on an iPhone as well but the battery should not be a concern.* It is a very well built phone and it feels great in my hand.  It fits perfectly in the front pocket of a dress shirt which is where I keep mine during the day.  I find the huge phones out now to be a weird thing that probably do not appeal to many people who carry a phone on the go for working.  Also  being a heavy text user I benefit from the keyboard but also the size.  I struggle to type on the larger phones to reach keys quickly with my thumbs.* The multimedia and browsing capabilities have improved to acceptable to replace another smart phone.  These features arent great yet but the browser is very good and works well enough that most people will be happy.* I love BlackBerry Travel.  I had it a long time ago and replaced it with TripIt on iPhone but I'm glad to have it back.Over all if you want a phone that does what you need for calling/texting/emailing/social media and you don't depend on your phone as a replacement for your home TV, you might be very happy with the Q10.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "its a great phone,", "Author": "Joseph Schwartz", "ReviewID": "R2NQHTM29K7MEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoy it, takes time to get use to it but it's a great phone, I love it more then then the Iphone,", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Business Oriented Device", "Author": "RWM", "ReviewID": "R31C300LW1EUT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really do love this phone, the keyboard is awesome.  If you use this device mainly for business communications, i.e. email, text, phone, calendar, etc. it can't be beat.  The camera is very good, a big improvement over previous BB models. The browser is very fast and it loads web pages beautifully. I do wish it was easier to edit text (bring back the track pad in a virtual version possibly?) and it does take a little time to learn how to use effectively even for seasoned BB owners.  My company has also not yet adapted the BB10 enterprise, so it is not fully supported like previous BB operating systems (hopefully that will change soon!).The downside, as has been mentioned previously, is that the screen is smaller than its competition; so if you are primarily using this phone for watching video, gaming or general web browsing you might want to consider an iPhone of Samsung galaxy.  It also lacks the app selection, which wasn't a big deal to me, but I was surprised some very popular apps that I used a lot and were available on previous BB 6 or 7, were not available on for BB10 (Pandora, Shazam, Amazon, B of A).  I also have not been able to figure out how to edit pictures names (rename a saved or new picture), it was very easy on my previous BB.  Maybe I just haven't figured it out, but it seems to be missing that capability (if anyone knows how to do this please respond!).All in all an excellent choice for the business oriented mobile user.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Smart Smartphone", "Author": "Byron J McAllister", "ReviewID": "R3PCJBNEN349OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw a review complaining about a small screen and how hard this phone was to use.  I have to disagree completely.  I have had my Q10 for 3 weeks  now and have never complained about the screen size or the ability to swipe the screen.  If you are an ogre with large hands or you do not have an thumb this phone may be hard to use.  Otherwise navigating the Q10 is easy.  It took me 2 days to get used to the new OS.If you want a phone to play games on and watch TV this may not be the phone for you.  I am a grown man though and have a large TV at home.  I don't play the games or watch to many videos on my phone. I send emails, view spreadsheets and check financial information on my Q10 and it has made it easy. The screen is the perfect size for fast navigation.The only flaw I have seen so far is the inability to have individuals tones for SMS contacts, but I imagine that will be addressed in an update. I let it slide on the account of growing pains of a new OS.  I went the touch screen route for a couple of years with the iPhone 4S and regretted my decision for 2 years.

There is simply nothing quite like physical keys for handling true grown folk \"bid-ness\"! In my opinion blackberry has accomplished the daunting task of making a device that can compete with the most modern phones, while still remaining as true to the classics blackberry form as possible. Sure, they have done away with the physical return, menu and phone end keys, but with a little time and patience, the new form within the BB10 software makes perfect sensse. The Q10 is my first experience with BB10 and I am impressed! It does everything I need with many bells and whistles. For a 4G phone with dual core, this has the best battery life I have experienced (note, I have never owned any of the Super MAXXX phones to compare, just other 4G phones with similar specs). With moderate yet consistent use, I can get through an entire day+ on one charge...NO JOKE! Camera and camcorders is great. And let me say...the speaker phone is phenominal (just a small-big deal to me). And I dont even neee to mention the best keyboard in the history of the QWERTY...dont worry, its still the best! Now you're probably asking \"Well dag fanboy, what are the cons?!\" Well, no surprise the app world is anemic, but even there I find most everything I need (plus I have found a real easy way to side load android apps...uh oh!) The real con is the bad wrap blackberry is getting from all the media and the whispers of the company selling off. I mean, sure, they lagged a bit too much and got their lunch ate by apple and android in recent years, but for a company who has reinvented themselves and delivered a high quality product that can compete again, I think they should be commended!

Both this and the Z10 have a sturdy yet light feel to them. Great keyboard to punch out those messages and documents. Psychically the Q10 is a sweet spot and not drastic evolution of BlackBerry. BlackBerry 10 is a very impressive mobile computing platform and the updates it has been receiving are making it even better. There are some little things missing that are already lined up for 10.2 update, so BlackBerry is developing quickly. Don't be discouraged by the gesture based interface, it is not hard at all. There are tutorials right on the Q10 Setup app that will guide you through certain gestures. Take a few hours to learn your way around and you will find how useful and intuitive the gestures are or the whole user experience is overall. The battery life is very good! Yes the screen is small for todays standards of \"it is never big enough\", but that is the whole point and it is good quality 3.1-inch HD AMOLED touchscreen display (720 x 720; 330 ppi). Anyone complaining obviously purchased one blindly and are not after the benefits of a smaller screen. There are too many features to explain here that you can find on other reviews or videos.

This cover has the antenna built-in just like the original Blackberry battery cover. However, the Mugen cover gets better RF reception than the original Blackberry battery cover & antenna. Not sure why, but I did extensive testing measuring the signal strength in -dbm to be sure there was an improvement. It is not a huge difference in RF reception, but enough to make a noticeable difference.PROS* Good RF reception in rural areas ... but not as good as the older generation Blackberry phones I have used.* Battery life is just OK ... Blackberry should offer an extended battery ... but they don't.* Phone call and voice quality is good.* Speakerphone is good.CONSThere are some bugs and glitches in the software interface as follows:* You cannot swipe up from a phone call to get to other screens on the phone .... without hanging up the phone. The work around I came up with is to tap \"NOTES\" and then swipe out of the screen. You can also use tap \"AUDIO\" and then swipe up and out of the call screen. This is the ONLY way to get out of the screen.  I confirmed this with Blackberry ... they tried it on a Q10 and had the same issues I did.* When making a conference call, you cannot un-merge a call or hang-up on the other call. The only way to disconnect the call is to hang up ... which disconnects both calls ... and then call back the party you want to speak with. I confirmed this with Blackberry ... they tried it on a Q10 and had the same issues I did.* Not a bug but a much needed feature. There should be hard buttons for certain features ... like the older Blackberry phones. One I would like to see is the \"ARROW\" button working like a back or home key to bring you out of the phone screen ... or any screen for that matter. It would be nice if this worked as back button for all screens and it would be very nice if it worked as a back button for the browser as well.Bottom Line - Good phone ... but the interface still needs some work and Blackberry needs to improve RF performance to the level of old Blackberry phones.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Should I care if I am not cool with a Blackberry?", "Author": "Sujatha", "ReviewID": "R2MQGHI66GEOAN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a fan of blackberry for a long time and haven't switched to iPhone or android, primarily because I like the convenience of QWERTY Keyboard.The big plus with Q10 is that I get Blackberry 10 features along with the familiar keyboard option.

Here's my take-- this is just big enough and modern enough to let you really enjoy the swiping, wiping and lightning fast full internet browser touch screen that was lagging farther and farther behind the competition until the new Operating System. Very quickly, though, you'll realize the second nature use of the keyboard is still there and makes this a completely utilitarian device, too. The slightly bigger size is not enough to hinder the one hand type input that many BB users can do in their sleep. So, you get a little classic and a little leading edge all in one device. The bells are there as well- high quality camera, voice commands (suspiciously like Siri), video calling, shared device viewing and even the little tap of the phones data sharing.

The battery life is excellent, the browser is fast, and the phone feels good in my hand.  The camera is better than my iPhone's.

I have used the Droids, and the Iphone 3, 4, 5. I had some apprehensions about this phone before I purchased this, but am VERY happy with it. I will list pros and cons below. If you are an Android or Iphone user, and are somewhat familiar with Blackberry (or even not) , this is a great phone!PROS:VOICE: I have never had a cell phone with this clarity of voice. Ever. EVER! I have Verizon, and it is clear, loud, and people often ask if I am on a landline or home phone.TEXTS: Coming from iphone, small adjustment, but not much. Of course, you are probably using a BB for the tactile keys...but it is easy once a thread is started, and nicely done.EMAIL: Great! Super easy to see , type, forward, deleted, etc. Much easier than a pure touch screen.THE HUB! THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THIS!!!! The Hub is command central, with texts, emails ,voice calls, whatever you are doing. Once you learn the SWIPE system and modes, it is easy.CAMERA: Frankly, better than the iphone 5..crisp pics, easy to access Facebook, etc.It is not as intuitive as the iphone, but unless you plan to use this a lot for social media, it is fine for the occasional pics, upload to FB, etc.SOCIAL MEDIA: Easy acccess to Twitter, Facebook, etc.PLEASE NOTE: For anyone who complains this phone is outdated, or you are thinking of a BB from 2009, this is WAY BETTER! BB 10 is a combo of touch screen and tactile keys, so it is well done.SIZE: Wider than an iphone, but had the familiar heft and BB feel. Well made . Doesn't feel cheapNOTIFICAIONS: The hub, as noted, is command central. Also, the traditional blinking red light is there, and sounds and vibrate notifications.BROWSER/WEB:TEN TIMES better than old BB..very fast, especially on Verizon 4G LTEBATTERY: THIS ALONE WOULD BE WORTH BUYING THIS PHONE! NOT ONLY IS IT REMOVABLE, but it lasts me a day and half with heavy, heavy use. It will take several cycles to train the battery, so don't panic at first. I keep a spare charged as needed.OPERATING SYSTEMS OBSERVATIONS: This phone is a very nice combo of touch screen and tactile keys. You CAN use a touchscreen only for phone calls, and texts, and not use the tactile keys for anything but typing, or use the on screen keyboard and dialing pad. I like that is not like the old BB's , with crappy browsers, etc, but very fast, with 4G LTE on Verizon, it blazes!CONS:APPS: As noted, the Apps are limited. However, it has the most used ones...Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Skype, etc. I don't use my phone as a toy, it is a business workhorse.SYSTEM: Takes a while to get system down of swipes/ moving around, but if you are coming from a Android or Apple ecosystem, you learn fast. ONCE YOU LEARN IT (It took me four hours) , you are on!Texting: If you have a longer text, sometimes hard to see whole field without scrolling down, but that is minor, in my view.THIS IS A GREAT PHONE!", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nicest smartphone I've owned to date.", "Author": "JJMRVCLINY \"JimMLINY\"", "ReviewID": "R1HHP1YCMP7LXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went from an HTC Thunderbolt to a Nokia Lumia 822 to this Q10 and there is no looking back.

Eventually I went to the local Verizon store to actually handle both units and that made the decision quite a bit easier.  I\u2019m a keyboard person, so I was very much inclined to the Blackberry.  I\u2019d owned two prior Blackberries, and didn\u2019t feel like learning how to use a different phone.  Actually handling the phone showed me that the Q10 is exactly what I wanted it to be: a miniature computer that I can actually do work on (as opposed to a miniature DVD player that I can fritter away hours with playing games and watching movies).  After handling the two units, I made up my mind to go with the Q10, and ordered one from Amazon because they were $130 cheaper than my local store (I\u2019ll buy local, but you have to be closer than $130 in price).The unit arrived promptly in the mail and I had to go through the process of switching over my account.  This all went relatively easily, but I had a problem getting my contact information on the Q10.  Apparently the Q10 uses an operating system that is incompatible with the Curve 9370 which I had been using.  Eventually I got it to work, but I couldn\u2019t walk you through the process.I decided to wait a week before I wrote a review because I knew I would be frustrated as I got used to the new phone.  That little snafu with the contact list would have dropped my rating a star all in itself.  There are some quirks that you have to work around which take about a week to familiarize yourself with.  Once you get used to it, it\u2019s an effective phone.  Here are some areas that need to be discussed:Keyboard:Let\u2019s face it, this is why we buy a Blackberry.  The Q10 boasts the \u201cbest keyboard available on any smartphone\u201d and after using it I am inclined to agree.  At first, I thought the 9370 had a better keyboard.  The buttons are more rounded and it feels more precise.  But it\u2019s just a matter of getting used to the Q10.  The whole unit is a little bigger and this keyboard works just fine.Touch screen vs track pad:Half the reason I prefer a keyboard is that I seem to have big, fat fingers that don\u2019t access the correct thing on a touch screen EVER!  I always get the item immediately above or below the item I actually wanted.  I had gotten used to the 9370 track pad because it allowed you to make your selections but never forced you to cover up your screen with your finger.  Plus, there are directional buttons on the 9370 that allow for a bit more precision when you\u2019re correcting a text.  However, the Q10 has a feature where you can place a cursor on your text and then slide it to the left and right which is effective for making corrections.  It isn\u2019t quite as good or precise as the directional buttons, but it is effective enough.  I\u2019m getting used to the touch screen and it has some advantages.Constant Swiping:The interface for the Q10 is really where it shows a bit of \u201ciphone envy.\u201d  I don\u2019t know what the deal is in our society today that instills people with an obsessive need to stroke their phone.  Getting the Q10 to do something is the equivalent of petting a cat, and this is probably my biggest gripe with the unit.  With the 9370, for example, you\u2019d see a flashing light that indicated a message, hit the unlock button, and scroll to the text message icon.  Boom!  With the Q10 there are a couple extra steps.  When you see the flashing \u201cmessage\u201d light you have to 1. unlock the unit by pushing the button on the top 2. swipe away the initial screen (bottom to top swipe) 3. go to the hub (or go to the text message icon) 4. open the message.  It doesn\u2019t seem like much, but it\u2019s a couple extra steps that you have to perform every...single...time.  The whole sequence is the type of thing that is convenient for showing off the unit in a show room, but gets annoying during actual use.General Interface Irritations:You have to learn a couple swipes just to make this unit work, swipes that start off screen and then go in various directions.  For example, to close an app you have to do a bottom to top swipe that minimizes the app where you can just close it (ironically, iphone has a BUTTON for performing this same feature).  Inside apps, a top to bottom swipe will open up options menu.  There are also menus that appear from right to left swipes and left to right.  The lack of symmetry kind of irritates me.  You have to think a little bit too much about which direction you have to swipe to get what you want.The Hub:I\u2019m not too excited about the hub.  To get to it you have to swipe all the way to the left to access a vertical menu that connects you with all your social media and email stuff.  However, this tool is a little too rigid in my opinion.  For example, I have 3 different Facebook accounts that I use for various businesses, but there is no option for installing 3 different Facebook accounts onto your phone.  I used to be able to just log in and out with my 9370, but that\u2019s inconvenient on the Q10 because every time you log into Facebook with the app it wants to download all your contact information onto your phone (I don\u2019t want the names of 5000 people I only casually known on my phone).  Sure, all you have to do is disable the \u201cdownload contacts\u201d feature, but it\u2019s annoying to have to do it every...single...time.  This is the kind of thing that drives me nuts about Apple (and why I won\u2019t buy Apple products): the fact that the units are specifically programmed ONLY to be used a certain way.  If I\u2019m going to buy a device it\u2019s MY tool and I want to be able to use it however I want.  Reoccurring automatic prompts for absurd procedures do not help me.  Programmers sitting in little cubicles thousands of miles away cannot conceive of how I want to use my device.  Don\u2019t be so \u201chelpful\u201d just sit there, shut up, and do what you\u2019re told.  If I wanted to be told what to do, I\u2019d buy an Apple product.The Camera:Ok, the thing that annoys me about all cell phones is that the cameras are always mediocre.  When is Olympus or Cannon going to make a camera which is also a cell phone.  To make a good camera you need a big lens!  These tiny little cell phone lenses are terrible.  Also, the lens should be in the middle of the phone for stability, and there should be a button on the edge of the unit for taking a photo.  Also, I\u2019d like a button that instantly called up the camera (the 9370 had this) rather than have to swipe through a dozen redundant screens while the object I was trying to photograph scampers off into the woods.  Get rid of the rear facing lens (you\u2019ll use that twice) and give me a solid camera body with the cell phone functions.  That\u2019s how you get ahead of Apple Blackberry!  Not with a stupid feature that allows you to \u201crewind\u201d a group photo so everyone is smiling.Apps:No kindle app and the .pdf readers are pretty much terrible for what I need them for.  I\u2019ve downloaded a couple, they\u2019re garbage.  However, there are a couple nice camera apps, one even has a tilt shift feature that\u2019s kind of nice.  If only this took real pictures.All that being said, I have started to like this phone.  It is very much a portable office unit, although it still seems a little harder to navigate than the 9370.  Blackberry is on the right track with this, but they need to eliminate the clunky interface and produce a top of the market camera before they can really compete with the other phones on the market.  I think there\u2019s still room for Blackberry out there, but they have to be Blackberry and not succumb to Apple envy.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Rocks!!!", "Author": "Jeffrey C Mers", "ReviewID": "R2Q1SI030NTZSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BB10.1 OS with this new phone is outstanding.

Watching video (albeit on a small screen) is actually very nice.- If you are looking  for a lot of aps to choose from, you may be disappointed.  I was not - this is a work device and email, texting, calendar, and call quality are what I need.  Yes, they have angry birds and some radio aps,, sports scores, poker games, etc. but not nearly as many  as on other operating systems.- The Blackberry 10 OS needs some learning - I recommend finding some YouTube videos like I did.  Once you understand the different gestures and menu structure, the device is fantastic. It reminded me of learning Apple's iOS in that you had to play with the phone and watch someone else do it to get the tricks.- The ability to touch the screen and use the keyboard together is great.  Don't want to pinch the screen to zoom in within the browser?  Simply press \"i\" to zoom in. Great, and one of many like that.  Once you get comfortable with the back and firth between the two input methods, you become very efficient.- sound quality is great and battery life seems decent.I recommend the phone if you want a keyboard and are not looking for a zillion aps.  If you want a big screen media device phone and the most apps, look elsewhere.If you primarily want a keyboard  phone and are happy with the trade-offs, you should strongly consider this phone.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great form factor!

The 10.2.1 Beta software programs that are readily available out there (Crackberry is the best site) provide a glimpse of the future.  I'm running the latest leak.  Blackberry has refined the Android player, added previews, a really cool picture lock home screen tool, priority hub and a ton of other meaningful improvements.  But, its the Android player that needs to be addressed.  This latest OS allows the direct install of many (not all but most) Android programs from a number of third party sites such a 1mobile, Amazon, and others without \"sideloading.\"  The \"App Gap\" has been effectively closed - at least for those of us on this publicly available beta.  I'm running NetFlix, Instagram, Stumbleupon, CVS Drug Store,Starbucks and on and on.  They all now run fast and fairly smooth and we're not even at the final versions yet.  So, the Q10 and the Z10 and Z30 actually now have one of the widest app selections in the world.  The entire BB10 app world and most of the Android world.

Wilson", "ReviewID": "R34CVONANFLFJS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The last Blackberry I had owned prior to this phone was the Curve back in 2008-10. I replaced that with an HTC Incredible, that with a Droid 3 and that with an iPhone 5. I have to say, it's a great phone, it does everything I want it to do. Most of the reviews here have covered how great it is, so a few cons for the phone:-No electrical contacts on the back. I had 2 older BB devices and they both had tiny electrical contacts on the back, so you could buy a cradle from Blackberry for about $10, hook it to your charger and drop the phone right in. WHY HAVE THEY ABANDONED THIS. It was the perfect way to handle charging the phone. It's just aggravating.-The software can be buggy at times. I used a backdoor method to install a few Android apps on mine and they work well enough but it'd be nice to have say, KIK Messenger, run natively on the BB10 OS. Also the newest update causes some weird stuff to happen with the text message program.-Photo quality. I came from an iPhone 5 to this thing. As far as the camera goes, there's no comparison. Apple wins. I understand BB users usually aren't as concerned about picture quality, it's just an honest detraction from the phone.Some people complain about the screen size, but I don't understand that. If you're buying this kind of phone, one with a keyboard that doesn't clumsily slide in and out, you know what you're getting. Complaining about screen size seems a bit goofy.Other than that, it's a great great device. These are the only grumps I have with it. If you want a giant screen, a shiny appliance, a cute thing with cute commercials that everyone else has, to replace once a year, buy a Samsung, an iPhone, an HTC.

By coherent I mean that the OS is really designed around getting things done and essential functions link and work in a smooth and intuitive way.

Note though that the interface is a bit different from Android or iOS so it take a little getting used to (gesture controls is what I'm referring to).It will not have every app the iphone has; however recent OS update vastly improved compatibility with android apps, which can be installed by going to Apitode, or Amazon App Store, or directly from Google Play with Blackberry app called \"Snap\" (which requires a slightly technical workaround to install).
