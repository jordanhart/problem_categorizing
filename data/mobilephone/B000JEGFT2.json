{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Z610I Review", "Author": "Brett A. Haberle", "ReviewID": "R3T6XSNFK8U6BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Z610i is a very hard phone to rate. This phone attracts majority of its viewers because it (obviously) is eyecandy. This phone boasts its sleek look, OLED external screen, and its built in chrome mirror. The downside of this phone is the fact that the External LCD screen is smaller than you think, the 2megapixel camera is a bit weak, no flash,  and the side buttons are hard to press. This phone gives you many great features though, the speakerphone works great, the battery life on this phone is about 7 hours talk time and 2 weeks standby, the bluetooth functionality is great, and there are many addons that this phone can use. If you are ordering this phone, it is not going to be slim like the Razr, Katana, and their competitors but its not too thick either. The phones features are comparible to the A900, A920 by Samsung so don't expect a futuristic phone. On a side note, Sony Ericsson does make a Bluetooth WristWatch that acts as a Caller ID/Music Controller for the phone. In conclusion, the Z610i is sure to attract many peoples eyes and is a perfect phone for those who want to be able to listen to music, and like to talk a long time.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not bad for being an attractive phone", "Author": "Michelle Entezari \"mentezar\"", "ReviewID": "R31SN69WX22QYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good points:-Works well with Cingular sim card/network-People comment on its attractiveness, looks cool when people call and when you first call someoneBad points:-Reception is no better than the free phone I got a year ago when I got my cell phone plan (although admittedly, it just may be I have a problem with Cingular in my area of Seattle)-Defaults on the phone need to be tinkered with, and not all menus are all that intuitive, takes some monkeying to change some features - and the ringtones that come with it are pretty limited-As pointed out, camera doesn't take great pictures, but few cell phones doOverall, I do sometimes get irritated with it, but would probably still get it again, because it really is that attractive of a phone.", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone but problems with T-Mobile.", "Author": "Roy Langley", "ReviewID": "R19CL8ZPR6IR2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone but for some reason it keeps shutting off and then turning back on and says Searching.

I've been hesitating about buying a Sony-Ericsson, because I had a bad experience when the T10 (Ericsson) and T25 (Sony-Ericsson) came out, but this phone is awesome. It comes with a lot of features and besides that, everybody that see my phone gets amazed by its design, it's just BEAUTIFUL and it's so attonishing that everybody likes. Besides that it's not so expensive, I bought it for $300 and I feel it has been a good buying.
