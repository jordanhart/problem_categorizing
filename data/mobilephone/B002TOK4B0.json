Once I got use to navigating the phone it was a breeze. A quality product that my girlfriend even dropped and it still works. I took it to Thailand and popped in a local SIM and all worked as advertised. Only thing I didn't like is it doesn't list incoming calls by name even though they're stored in my contact list; like my other LG phone. All in all, I recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "DON'T PURCHASE THIS PHONE!!! There's a lot of better options for the price!", "Author": "R. Mocan", "ReviewID": "R2IWST4UX5N0Q9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nowadays with cell-phones, the best phone you'll find depends on what you value the most.I was looking for a basic phone but was attracted by the \"green\" side of this one: it's made of recycled materials, including the box, and I also ordered the solar panel battery door separately to reduce my carbon footprint by charging the battery via solar power.Having said that, I strongly encourage you to look elsewhere for a phone and avoid LG altogether. My reasons follow:HARDWARE: SO-SO- The first unit I got didn't work. The speaker was broken and emmited no sound whatsoever. I searched the web, and have found several simmilar cases, so this is not an isolated problem.- The tactile screen is not responsive. As others stated you either have to use a lot of force to register a \"click\" or otherwise the thing starts jumping around.- Other common problems I read about was that the other party has difficulty hearing what the user of this phone is saying, and I can confirm that. It's not that you can't hear the caller, but it's quite low volume.- All the phone exterior is plastic, except for the touch screen. I purchased the solar cell battery cover, which makes the whole phone all the more fragile, having glass on both sides. The solar cell adds about 2mm to the waistline too.- Camera is so-so, because it has no autofocus. Fixed focus means that you can't shoot close-ups of anything (because the pic ends up blurry), including business cards.SOFTWARE: ANGERING- The second phone I received fre-e-e-e-ezes every other day. It starts lagging and responds 3-10 seconds after the input. Battery pull does the trick, but only for a little while.- I tried to update the phone's firmware or operating system and found the software experience on the PC very frustrating. I didn't get anything to work, but even if I had, the programs are slow, half-baked and poorly translated into english. I even got an error screen with half the text in Korean! Running Win7, the best way to make them work is go run with \"Troubleshoot compatibility\" and let Win7 choose which previous op. system to emulate.- The company's web pages are also very slow to load, if they do at all, and getting support is nearly impossible. Good luck trying to download LG's programs from their websites, because I had to resort to 3d party sites to find what I wanted.ECO-FRIENDLY: REALLY?The prospect of eco-friendliness is what made me purchase this phone (being made with recycled materials, soy-ink printed box, etc), but sending a phone back and forth surely beats any benefits to the environment that the phone will produce in it's lifetime.According to the green-tree calculator, it'd require like 5,000 hours charging with the solar cell charger to produce the equivalent of one tree... and to be honest, I doubt the phone will make it that far.Instead, I'll just take my family out and plant a tree.FINAL THOUGHTS:This is my third experience with an LG phone (had a Shine and a useless GD510 before this one), and software and hardware have not yet improved enough. LG Mobile still has some road to go to be on-par with other established companies, even Korean Samsung. And having so many other options out there, why bother?

One other downside is that the receipt was incorrect and even cut in half, it was a receipt to a black remote, and thats not a phone at all!  So I am warning you that if you buy this phone, you may not get what you had expected.

I find just about all phones to be unusable: flip phones and slide phones I can't open; Blackberry style the keys are impossibly small; even most candy bar phones require too much force to work the keypad. I tried the iPhone but found it too big to hold and use easily with one hand, although like the iPad, it has a very responsive touch screen. So maybe the smaller LG GD510 would be the answer. All I can say is: what a huge disappointment. The touch screen is simply unusable. Either, and unpredictably, a large amount of force is needed, or the slightest wisp sets it off. Scrolling is impossible: sliding the finger through the list of name in the address book either does nothing or dials the first number the finger comes near. The scroll bars were equally useless. And it wasn't just me: all the able bodied people I gave the phone to had, if not the same difficulty, then at least some difficulty. If the touch screen hadn't completely defeated me, there are enough other annoyances: the keys lock almost instantly requiring yet more key strokes; using the key pad to search the contact list it seems quite random whether a letter or number appears; a 2.5mm ear piece jack would be easier to use than mini USB; switching between portrait and landscape modes doesn't always work right; and finally, although a 3\" screen seemed nice, it really needs a 10 year old's fingers to use it.
