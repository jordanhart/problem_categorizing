I purchased this in preparation for a sudden and temporary stint overseas whose country runs on a GSM network. Perfect size and great functionality are my primary comments for this phone. Recent Region-locking of newer Samsung units (including the one I received) made me take two stars from what could have been a guilt-free 5-star rating from me. For those assured of a FULLY unlocked model, I will fully recommend this - especially with its dual sim feature. A US Samsung rep confirmed that this Region-locked model needs to be activated in their native region for it to work as intended (Internationally) afterwards. Apparently, \"activated\" or \"first-use\" means to specifically use it for at least a voice call (of >10 minutes in duration). Turning it on with a US prepaid SIM to text and browse the web, even for a week, are NOT enough. Though I may have learned this \"distinction\" the hard way, I'm happy to report that the phone now works as intended internationally (on a GSM network). Adding one more star for its overall performance and service thus far. Would have been 5-stars if it were lte-capable.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Raquel", "ReviewID": "RLIN39G4UNE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like everything about this smartphone.

I upgraded from an S3 mini which I immediately fell in love with. If you're looking for a simple phone that does pretty much everything you need to do at the palm of your hand (internet, email, text, music) then go with the S4 mini. For the price, you can't go wrong (under $400 unlocked). The device is sleek and light weight. Decent processor 1.7GHz. The picture quality is amazing (8MP back camera, 1.9 MP front camera). The MICRO SD slot is expandable up to 64 GBs. Model 9192 is a dual MICRO SIM device so a standard SIM will not fit in the phone.

Also recommend this case for the phone: i-Blason Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini i9190 Armadillo Series 2 Layer Armored Hybrid Cover Case with Inner Soft Case and Hard Outter Shell AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile (Black)EDIT:Well I've used my phone for a while now and there is an issue that I've notice just now and i want to add to my previous review. The phone is overheating sometimes when not in active use, sometimes when in my pocket the screen and the phone all is reaching almost the 50 degrees (Celsius), then in a few minutes it just go cold again and everything is fine. I get that with a 1.7GHz processor it should generate some heat when hard processing task is going on (play, etc.) but just like that when in my pocket? Until now it is just an issue that have no impact in the phone function but I'm worried about the impact in the phone durability with that temperatures. Some research over the internet tell me that is a thing with the S4 Mini line, others users have the same issues with their phones, not only the I9192, also the I9195 and the I9190. Will keep an eye on it and will update my review if there is any changes. For now one star down.EDIT2:I guess that i found the cause of the overheating and now I'm dealing with it with no problems, the thing is that some app when in background do a lot of CPU usage so now I juts close the apps when finish using it, mostly the games and that kind of stuff.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "20days and very good to go", "Author": "W.

"Jason W.", "ReviewID": "RAC2PDVIN3HLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've owned this phone for more than 6 months now... and so far, it has exceeded all my expectations. coming from a $200 phone, this has been a significant improvement in every way.the good :first of all, i find this phone a great size. the screen is about 20% bigger than the phone it is replacing, but the body of the GT-i9192 is slim enough that, even with a case, it is actually more thin than my previous phone. fits in my pocket, and is nice and light.the phone is mostly made of plastics, so the whole thing is a bit slick for my fingers (another reason for the case), but it does seem to be fine quality... there has been no unexpected wear or anything getting loose or showing any signs of coming apart after 6 months of heavy daily use. i've dropped it twice from pocket height, and there has been no apparent damage (i use a Hyperion case http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXMWV1O ).as it says in the description, this is an unlocked GSM phone. i have so-far used it in Russia, Ukraine, Greece, France, the UK, Turkey, and India. all with no problems. i work out of Moscow, so all of these travels have just been using a local carrier (MTC) SIM card. the phone gets very good reception, and i haven't had any issues with dropping calls.the battery life is really impressive. with moderate use, i can expect the phone to last 2 days between charges. with heavier use (including internet and listening to music) the phone easily lasts the entire work day.... from 7am to about 11pm. if i know i won't have power available for a while, the phone can be miserly if you turn off all extra features and only use it for texting.the camera is great. i haven't made any prints, but even on my computer most of the pictures look great. the phone is an easy replacement for a cheap point-and-shoot camera. the flash is somewhat helpful for pictures... i am most impressed that the flash can apparently be adjusted automatically by the phone, so that there's at least some chance of the picture not being washed out. the video recording is also quite good. you can actually turn on the flash, using the \"assistance light\" toggle (what a ridiculous name), and then turn on the video camera.i don't play games on the phone, so i can't vouch for that kind of performance... but it has handled browsing the internet, 3rd party GPS apps, network utilities, viewing .PDF files, and watching movies, all nicely and quickly. i've only had an app crash and reboot the phone once or twice.i have noticed the phone gets quite warm when using it as a WIFI hub for other devices. for several months the GT-i9192 was my only broadband option, i would use the phone as the WIFI hub for my laptop. when i removed the phone from it's rubber case the heat problem was eliminated. if the phone is within 6 feet of connected devices, the internet speed is perfectly acceptable for browsing and email, i cannot say if it would work for streaming videos.the speaker is quite good. i don't use the \"speaker phone\" feature often, but i do use the phone to listen to music quite regularly. at a reasonable volume it sounds fine. you have to have reasonable expectations for a little tiny speaker in a phone, but at a moderate volume, it sounds perfectly OK for a little background music.the bad :up until a software update (automatically pushed by Samsung) i could not get the aGPS to work at ALL on this phone. i downloaded several different utilities and tried all the steps like clearing the cache and downloading new coordinates, etc etc etc. simply put... nothing helped. i was almost to the point of contacting Samsung about returning the phone, after having found plenty of complaints about defective aGPS on this model.last month the update pushed through, and seems to have fixed the aGPS problem. it will still take a long time to grab the satellites if i am inside any kind of building. but if i am outside it will get a fix in under a minute. i do notice that occasionally the phone will refuse to fix any satellites until i use a utility (GPS Status) to clear the cache and then reboot the phone. then it will work fine for several days.the phone wants to be your nanny and it is a chore to turn the volume up when listening to music. i use this phone as an MP3 player at the gym. and any time i want to turn the volume up beyond half way, i have to acknowledge that i might be making myself deaf.the auto-correct is HORRIBLE. to be fair, this may be entirely the fault of android. but coming from my old phone, whatever version of android was around 2 years ago, this auto-correct is the worst thing to have happened. if i want to add a word to the dictionary i have to click the word once, and THEN, click the word AGAIN after hitting space or whatever punctuation mark i wanted to use. i don't know if it's saving the word into two different dictionaries or what. apparently there is no way of actually seeing or controlling what is going on with the dictionaries, either. this sounds like a small complaint, but it still is a really chaffing issue for me. the only thing that is worse than the auto-correct is my spelling when i turn it off.i HATE that this phone has a USB micro-B connector for charging/docking. there's almost no point in complaining against \"progress\" in the USB family, but the mini-B was a far superior connector. as you are most likely familiar, micro-B is the current \"standard\" for android phones, and it offers almost no tactile feedback about orientation until you've fairly well jammed the connector into the phone. at least with the mini-B you could tell right away if you were trying to plug the cable in upside down. every time i try to plug the phone in, in the dark, i have to do it timidly because i don't want to damage the tiny little connector pins inside the mini-B port. everything seems built well enough, but inside the port is a very VERY thin board holding all the connection pins, and i can easily imagine it snapping off. at least it's a standard port, instead of needing any kind of proprietary plug.in conclusion; this phone is great. awesome battery life, awesome camera, the perfect size for my needs, a true dual+active phone. get a case because it's a slippery thing without one, bring back the mini-B USB port!", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title":

Christmas gift for my boyfriend who lives in Australia. The phone was listed as GSM unlocked. This SHOULD mean that it would work on any GSM in the world.

They assured me the box was wrong, it would work anywhere in the world. I mailed it to Australia - and NOPE. DOESN'T WORK. I went back and forth with Nitram-Tech and have a thread of more than 30 emails to show for it. They wanted to see photos of the phone, so I sent them, and didn't hear back for a week. Then I would follow up with them and they would request the same photos again to check the serial numbers, etc. I resent everything again and AGAIN I wouldn't hear back for more than a week. It was such a headache to deal with these people, and to make it worse, they don't speak/write very good English so hardly any of their emails made sense. I thought for sure this was going to be a scam and I would never see my $400 again. Today I finally got an email saying that Amazon is processing the return and the money should be added to my account within a few days. It is now the first week of March and I ordered this early December. Three months of dealing with these people and I am so excited for it to be over with!!

They assured me that it would work \"with any Sim card in the world\" (their words).  The phone was fully unlocked, as promised - right out of the box.

I updated the software with Kies (Samsung software) and all was successful.  It was still fully unlocked.  No problems.I did not have to \"make an initial 5 minute call...\" which others stated is necessary.Note:  The phone menu was in Russian when I first put the Sim cards in the phone.  There's an easy fix for this:Take all Sims out of the phone and power it off.  After turning it on with no Sims, it went through the setup menu.  Choose your language, finish the menus and turn it off.  Put the Sim cards in and you're good to go.  All this took less than 5 minutes.One last note:  Look at the descriptions provided under \"other sellers\".  Email the vendor BEFORE buying if you have ANY doubts.  Ask them specifically if the phone will work with any Sim card in the world.  Get written verification from them!  If they won't specifically verify/provide this, don't buy from them.  Period.

Samsung apparently claims that it is the routers manufactrer's fault but that kind of thing has never happened with any other device in my highly connected house. My router is ZyXEL, in forums I saw that there was other router brand confirmed to have this happen too. It's a shame, it is a great phone but wifi issues of this kind are unnaceptable. The dual sim feature is well implemented and very flexible: you can use one sim for data the other for phone. There's a set of sim icons to choose from for each sim. I didn't like that there must be always a sim icon on the notification bar (very annoying) but nothing that you can't get used to. Unfortunately the wifi issue spoils all this for me.

I carried around a work and personal phone for more than 2 years, and am so glad I bought this phone for myself. The people at my wireless service carrier were astounded that I had this phone and had no idea it even existed. In fact, Samsung USA customer service had no idea it existed. You will need to call Samsung Latin America for help if you need it, but that was not a problem at all. If I need warranty service, that is also where I have to send it. I called the Samsung customer service in Puerto Rico and they were helpful and knowledgeable.
