You got office programs, opera, and the marketplace where you can buy your apps. The most I liked of this phone is the ability to multi-task, have many programs opened and be able to switch between them, although it would consume memory but still useful.One of the things I did quite like is that the sound isn't high and that it doesn't support many video format and the video capturing quality and photo is not the best from all smartphones, but still \"okay\".", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad, very bad", "Author": "Xinia Brenes", "ReviewID": "R1IKEN8US8CFS6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of this item, and receive another model of phone, despite confirming by phone that would receive the correct item.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
