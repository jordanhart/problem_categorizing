I got it for my roaming sim card.. The looks is nice but the touch screen isn't that responsive. Some keys doesn't work right. Oh well, It's a cheap phone and I'm kinda expecting that. I got mine for 30 bucks. Think before you buy so you don't regret after you buy it. Like the other one said, it's traditional keyboard. Good thing I'm not using it for texting I just use it to receive message.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!", "Author": "Jackal", "ReviewID": "R2Q4LFSCK83J5V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.

Construction is poor.  Instructions are in pidgen English without any illustrations.  Would not read any SIM card I placed in it.  Conceptually a nice idea and for the price I paid, it would have been a great bargain.  But it simply does function.  I will try again with a few more SIM cards, but for now it is a time vacuum that does not merit my attention.  I would like to think there is a better dual SIM phone out there, but I do not know.  If you can swing one for about 20 bucks, it might be worth the experiment.  Otherwise, save your money.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "DON'T KNOW YET HOW IT WORK.", "Author": "tess enriquez", "ReviewID": "R1P7OT4BK7TBJJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER.

The phone DOES NOT have a QWERTY keyboard. It has traditional phone keys w/ letters. This makes even brief texting nearly impossible!The touch screen is not nearly as responsive as it should be. Sliding from one screen to the next is not a smooth process and often results in selecting programs that you didn't intend to select just because you are touching it.The ringtones are TERRIBLE. They are annoying and unusually loud. They sound like MIDI files. While we're on the subject of loud and obnoxious ringtones, I might add that changing volume with this phone is quite a task that involves finding the option buried in various other (mostly useless) phone setting options)This phone has basically 2 settings: Make your ears bleed loud or silent. There is no in between option.The space allocation of this phone for you to put your own content is less than 50kb. You will require the use of a MicroSD card if you want to change any of the annoying crap that the SVP Q70 comes with. You cannot delete any of the pre-installed ringtones.Because of the space allocation, you won't be able to use any online programs unless you buy a micro SD card. There is no app store, this phone uses an unknown operating system and is not upgradable to one that we've heard of so what you get with the phone, you're stuck with. You will not be able to download any Apps from an app store or have any fun with this unless you just enjoy using the low budget stuff they've put on there like their outdated Facebook app that doesn't even load without an SD card.The camera is very very low quality, takes grainy pictures at best and is very sensitive to any movement you may make while attempting to take a picture. Don't try taking a picture of anything that's moving. It won't work.I attempted to find information online about this phone and discovered that it's a no name phone with virtually no online support or backing of any kind. I have been unable to find detailed instructions for use. The user sheet (and that's all it was, a piece of paper) that came with this thing was mostly in another language besides English and only featured basic information. No diagrams whatsoever. Online searches provided no additional information. That's why I am rambling on and on about this crappy little el cheapo phone in hope that no one else buys one of these things.
