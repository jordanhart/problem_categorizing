{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Keri", "ReviewID": "R45WBHDPO1J2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as an update of my Xperia Arc which I purchased 2 years ago. At first I considered the Xperia Z but the only drawback was that that phone was too large at 5 inches. The Xperia V had the same features but was a little smaller at 4.3 inches.After using this phone for 2 weeks I find this to be a good upgrade and it still runs smooth and fast. The phone came with Android version 4.0 but when I put it on an upgrade to version 4.1 was automatically received.I puchased the phone from FGS Trading and as with my previous Xperia Arc (which I also purchased from this seller), the phone arrived with a screen protector already on so there was no need to purchase one separately. However, no SD card was included so if you requie one purchase it separately. Although one is not necessary since the Xperia V comes with an 8GB internal memory.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its a . . . good phone . . .", "Author": "Carlos Moreira", "ReviewID": "R7VELY9RH53KP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is great, water resistent, the design is clean and beautifull . . . Works like a charm, is fast and  personaly i like very much the sony android skin . . . On the bad side, this phone hasn't been widely distributed around the world and after 9 or 10 months of use, and a couple of non lethal accidental drops, the earpiece stop working, so i'm looking for a repair . . . when and if i find it, i will update this, to let you know how was it. . .Very good phone, highly recomended for who is looking a mid - high end phone . . .Well, now a days would be more like mid-mid phone . . .", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my phone", "Author": "Jes\u00fas Alvarado", "ReviewID": "R2O40AHT6V747M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone arrived on time, and it's way better than what I thoguth/read about it.Feels good and smooth, great quality build, the camera is really good althougth not so good at night, but still is very nice, I'm using NFC tags with it and I love it, good quality calls, games run very smmothly (i've tried asphalt 8, plant vs zombies2, etc)Waterproof works although i've only tried once, not going to deep it in the tub just for phone only going to use it whenever I need toif necessary not running any chances but so far so good.Headphones and charger that came with the phone are very good, good qualityt build no complains about it.Size is perfect, not too big but not to small to check videos, pictures and messaging/web.This is an amazing phone for its price, with such a good perfomance and camera I wouldnt pay 600$ for other fancy phones like s4, htc one, iphone etc. This got all that I needed.My only complain is the battery, its bad. But its just a matter of getting use to it, I normally charge it once a day with normal usage, if Im constantly playing games checking videos etc I would have to charge it twice, just need to make a routine on which time of the day is the best to charge it. A plus is that the battery is removable so you may have an extra one in case one drains out just switch to an extra, or just buy those portable battery chargers which are pretty good.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BM8NF4M"}}
