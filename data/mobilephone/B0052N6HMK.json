The quality of plastic is good the finishes too, the screen is resistant....so far.I don't understand why this people says:\"when you insert your card you will never be able to open it again\"I have been taking it out and in several times to copy files from and to it and it works excellent.I can do some adjustment to excel and word documents and then copy them to the pc with no problems.I love the gps and it works great.You can open and close the case as much as you want.It's fast enough for me, well some times it takes more to load an image or change screen.This time samsung have my respect.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "The cell phone works great in Argentina and US", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "RC9MPFN5A9NQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this cell phone every day in Argentina and US, it is a good cell phone and the cost-benefits relationship is great, i recommend this product to others.Uso este celular a diario tanto en Argentina como en US, es un buen equipo y la relacion costo-beneficio es muy buena, recomiendo este producto.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "Vanquor \"EQUBE\"", "ReviewID": "R1201F44VLJI3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is one of the best low-end cellphones I ever had.

Cardenas Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R33UNSREVMEK6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Obtained from my telephone carrier in a package ($) of 18 months. I used for an 8 months and have no complains for the phone. Android Froyo 2.2 was upgraded automatically by KIES (Samsung) in two steps. all the functions works well, but the power drain faster. even disabled Wi-fi, GPS, and used an app to keep the battery optimized. Really, 2 days is for most the time with full charge. sensible touchscreen, medium size, used daily. some times you can feel heat in the cover for the continue use. You need to put inside an SD card (16gb class 4)to use for keep photos, videos, music, and other kind of files obtained by internet. I recommend this cell phone, is very useful when it's charged.
