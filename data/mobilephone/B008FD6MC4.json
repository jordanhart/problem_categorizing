The battery life is less than 3 hours and it overheats when charging. I have to fully charge my phone 3-4 times a day and all I use it for is texting and the occasional FB check. Also, while charging, I have had it overheat to the point where it will shut itself down to cool off.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay", "Author": "sefdjilk", "ReviewID": "RWR0KQ2IRQ0V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like a few of the other reviews said, the phone can get a little hot after some use. The battery life could be better, but in my case, I bought a used one so I can't say if it was like this from the start. The only thing that really bothers me is that I have to remove the case to get to the sd slot. Otherwise, I like this phone.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone in perfect condition", "Author": "Matthew D.

For me, if a phone fails at voice quality then it fails as a phone. Period. LG always manages to succeed in this regard and that's why their phones have earned my respect.The Viper, by 2014 standards, is a small phone with just a 4\" screen. The specs won't blow you away and the resolution is just 800 x 480. It does, however, offer an IPS LCD screen, which looks quite good for its size. It's quite clear and bright and offers decent viewing angles, although who looks at the screen from the side anyways? I never understood the viewing angle rating but that's fine.The build quality for a \"green\" phone is actually quite good. It has some heft and feels solid in your hand. I actually like this. The phone offers just 1 GB of RAM and just 2 GB of internal storage. Buy an SD card. I have a 32 GB and it runs smooth as silk. That's another plus for this phone: the dual-core Snapdragon S3 processor runs smooth and fast. Gestures are very fluid. Little to no stuttering at all. The processor is plenty for this size of a phone.The Viper is one of the first Sprint phones to run 4G LTE. This is a great quality and a bad quality of the phone. One of the biggest complaints of the Viper is the poor battery life. This is absolutely true. With the stock settings, you can expect about 4 hours of battery performance, which is unacceptable. This is the reason I did not give the Viper a 5-star rating. At stock settings you will either need to carry your charger, stock up on additional batteries, or buy an extended battery. You can try an app like Juice Defender but you will likely get marginal results. The biggest drain on the battery is the 4G LTE. Trust me on this. The phone defaults to LTE/CDMA in the settings menu. Simply switch the settings to CDMA and you will see your battery life GREATLY improve. Only use LTE when you absolutely need it. Let's face it, most times our phones will connect to Wi-Fi anyways. Take advantage of this. I noticed with the phone set to 4G, even when using Wi-Fi, the signal strength meter showed little to no coverage, yet I was easily able to make voice calls or send text messages. It seems this phone is constantly searching for 4G even when on Wi-Fi, and this is placing an unnecessary strain on the battery. The first thing I did was buy a new battery and condition it. Then, I tested the new battery with stock settings. I got approximately 5 hours battery life. Turning off LTE, not only did my signal strength meter show full coverage, but - as of this writing - I have 5 hours, 5 minutes, 35 seconds on the battery and still have 70% charge. That is VERY acceptable!In conclusion, the LG Viper, when properly tweaked, is an outstanding little phone. I love the form factor and size, the call quality is superb, and it's fast and fluid with a great display. Only use LTE when you absolutely feel you need it and watch your battery life improve greatly. I hope this helps.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sprint lg viper..
