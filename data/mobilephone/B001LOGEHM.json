The touch screen is so bad that sometimes I cannot even dial the phone or read my text messages. I have to wait for few seconds/minutes to use the touch screen. When I use the keypad to write text messages sometimes the cursor moves around by itself so I have to delete/fix the sentences..wasting so much time, or sometimes it hit Back button without me pressing anything. My best friend and I used this phone and both of us truly hate and regret ever getting this phone. Now, we cannot wait until our contract ends and upgrade to a new phone. I never write bad review for any product, but this phone deserves one.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "2 Years With The Samsung Glyde", "Author": "Jake Kells \"Post\"", "ReviewID": "R1H9494E3YVDHT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After using this phone for 2 years, I do not recommend this phone. I bought this phone through Verizon; they deserve blame too for stocking this phone (and Samsung for making this phone).The touch screen might look good at first, but it almost stops working. If you do not lock this phone continuously, it will act randomly, from randomly calling someone in your contacts to opening your phone's internet browser.A second major mistake is that you cannot call anyone without using the touch screen. Since the touch screen malfunctions, you cannot call or send a text message on the first few tries.Lastly, the phone stores text messages on a limited memory space; you cannot store more than 100 text messages.Please do not get this phone...save yourself.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "It was in the shade, now its made!", "Author": "P. deepan", "ReviewID": "RA0URRS2WVC3C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The samsung glyde did have a gimmicky touchscreen at first, but with the BI29 software, this enhanced the touchscreen to make it as great as the iPhone. Also, if you buy this phone with the software update, then you will be able to take better pictures, videos, have better internet connection, and et higher quality music. I highly recommend this to someone who is a teenager, since I am one myself.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "looks good, works bad", "Author": "A. Mellis", "ReviewID": "R1NNQPLDHL5T49", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Glyde as part of my Verizon plan, and at first was quite pleased with it.  It has lots of features in a nice compact body, especially for a phone with a full QWERTY keypad.  However, once starting to use the phone, I found it more and more frustrating.  The features that it does have are difficult to use and the software that it runs is very badly designed.My first Glyde died after about 6 months and Verizon replaced it with another.  The new one, I've now had about another six months and at least once a day the touchscreen either locks up or always registers a \"lower right-hand corner\" touch, regardless of where I touch (or sometimes, even if I have no contact with the screen at all).  Power-cycling the phone usually but not always temporarily halts this.As of Oct 2008, Verizon halted all Glyde sales and pulled this from their stores for an unspecified \"issue\"; it has not been seen since.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Peice of Crap", "Author": "Elisa B.

This was the worst phone Ive ever had, and Ive had alot of phones! This was a peice of worthless shaped metal crap. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! The seconed week I had it the speakers went out, though it was always quiet. The third month I had it, the phone snapped in half the touch and keyboard were disconnected. It still barely worked but I had to tie a rubber band around it. The next week the whole phone fell apart. The keyboard still glows and I hope I didnt lose pictures, videos, recordings and all that. I treat my phones nicely and hated this one. Also there is so little memory I bought a SD card to store things on.

I was not looking for a fancy phone or one that has gadgets galore, just one that works.

I've had it since Christmas, and after Day 3 I figured something was wrong.The touch screen is heat sensitive so god forbid you have it in your pocket and go to use it. It gets so confused. If the phone is warm in any way, any touch on the screen will register as hitting the bottom menu or the back button depending which screen you're at. It's extraordinarily frustrating. And, really, I don't want my phone to beep at me when it's done charging. Of course, I have to charge it often because it won't hold a microsecond of time. My previous phone could hold a charge for six days while this goes for three if I'm lucky and don't bother it. That backlight eats up battery like you wouldn't believe, and it loves to light up.The sound on it is way to quiet even on full blast so I often miss calls even when it's right next to me or in my pocket or purse. Even the vibrate is too soft so I sometimes miss calls despite it being in my pocket.Really, there are two things I like about it: The keyboard and the little hole in the corner where I can hang my dangly cell phone straps.Not worth your time or anyone else's time. No wonder they pulled this junk off the shelf.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Please Do NOT Buy", "Author": "Keith R Nachbar", "ReviewID": "R33H4NHCKFPEYY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone on ebay and it hasn't worked since day one.
