Short on features but durable and reliable.I've owned several of these.  Great battery life and good signal.  Perfect for texting, they have an FM radio that uses standard earplugs.The flashlight is pretty powerful and the phones have been durable.  Yup, I'll buy another one if this one gets lost or stolen.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone but...", "Author": "mr.T", "ReviewID": "R3JDIG28JLLWYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone I recieved while a Nokia 1280 is not the phone depicted. Phone described is black, phone I recieved is \"orchid\" read, \"pink\". Also the charger is not compatible with North America. Luckily I have a spare charger and my wife has the same phone but black so I will be trading with her. Nontheless a practical phone that does what its supposed to do, make and recieve calls with good standby and talk time. We am going to keep this phone because we need it, however I would have looked elsewhere had the description been more accurate.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone with respect to its purpose.", "Author": "S. Asghar", "ReviewID": "RJ95D7ILD4RF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a simple phone that I purchased for short-term temporary use overseas while traveling. If you are looking for something to make and receive calls, a phone you won't have to charge everyday, a phone that gets good reception, something simple and cheap that you don't really care if you drop it, break it, lose it, or if it gets stolen... then I think you found the perfect match.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Network not found---Zero bars", "Author": "Kevin N", "ReviewID": "R3P7K6V2PUTVDK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Didn't work out of the box.  No bars.  Got a Nokia 2320 and it picked up the network right away.  Tried cycling the power, standing outside, driving around, etc.I did like how the buttons felt and the screen was fine, too.  The radio had good reception, too.  I had used a SanDisk MP3 player a while back that had a terrible radio and was braced for the worst.  But the radio worked fine indoors and out.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very late shipment!", "Author": "mykhaledi", "ReviewID": "RVQ7KK7U8A5PL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the above item, I've paid about 40% more for fast delivery (promised to be within 1 working day), the order/payment were done on Sunday (23/Aug) and now we are at the end of 25th and the item still did not arrive!", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003ZFURGE"}}
