This is also the first time I have ever ordered something from Amazon that was not what I expected.The phone does work.  It was also new, as stated.  Works fine.  This does not appear to be a US version though.1.)  The included manual has a table of contents going up to page 100+...  The last page of the manual cuts off at page 80-something.  It also says in the back to contact Motorola-Asia for assistance.  Not a deal breaker, but this may indicate the level of detail of the seller.2.)  I say this does not appear to be a US version because I have two (2) used U.S. Razr v3's in my briefcase right now and this is just not quite the same.  This seems it might be a U.K. version.My 2 previously purchased US versions do NOT have the extra button above the wheel/pad.  This seems to be the only visual distinction...which results in...No such things as \"missed calls\" on this phone.  It is classified as a Received Call, but either has a \"check\" or \"no check\" next to the entry seemingly indicative of it being a missed call or not.Speed dial assignments (1 though 9) are 4 digit values (1001 through 1009).Cannot lock Smart Key on phone exterior.No light illuminated when charging.\"Center\" is spelled \"Centre\"Installed graphics are not even remotely the same.Doesn't seem that time will auto-set.Doesn't even use the same battery part # as my 2 other U.S.-purchased phones.That is why I do not believe this to be a U.S. Version phone as stated.I am not very happy about this.  I am going to seek to get this resolved.  This is why I purchased this from Amazon because I believe they will make this right.End", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this phone", "Author": "D.

The problems began Saturday.  When the phone arrived I inserted my SIM card and the included battery.  It showed @ 2 bars so I began charging with the charger included with the phone.  Within about 2-3 hours I checked the phone and it indicated that the charge was complete so I began using it.  I sent a few txt msgs and was told they arrived.  However, I have tried several times to send and receive mms texts with pictures and am unable to do so.  In addition, I had problems with the volume during a call (sometimes barely audible) despite my having adjusted it to the max (7).  Even during the call the volume decreases to the point it can faintly hear the person but am unable to understand what they are saying.  The volume overall seems better on the \"speaker\" function.  Also, on Saturday and again today I have placed calls, one for my voice mail and another to join into a conference call for work.  On both occasions the phone simply shut off, after several attempts I was able to access the calls.  I spoke to ATT today and they recommended I reboot by removing/replacing the battery.  I have done so but the conf. call issue happened afterwards.  ATT suggested that if the reboot didn't help I should call back tomorrow, from another phone, so they can troubleshoot the phone.  I plan to do so in the AM.  However, given that my previous Razr lasted 3 yrs, without problems, I think I would like to try my luck with a replacement. I believe that the mms issue is a network problem because the clock does not auto reset but as to the other issues I think they are likely phone related.  In balance with the other issues I've described this may seem trivial but the word \"Dialed\" is misspelled in the \"recent calls\" menu as \"Dialled\".  What's up with that?Attached is the second e-mail:I got the phone on the 19 (Saturday) though the USPS site indicated it was here on Friday.  I'm beginning to feel like a pest.  When I got the phone I inserted my SIM card and the new battery.  It was on charge for over 12 hours.  5PM Sat until 5 PM Sun.  When I checked the phone it was still blinking (Brown Battery Symbol) and indicated it was charging.  In an attempt to troubleshoot the issue I inserted the battery in the other phone and it did the same thing.  So I assumed the battery was defective.  I inserted the 1st battery in the new phone and it charged to \"full\" in about 3 hours.  So I began to test the other issues I had.  I was able to send msgs with pictures and regular text msgs.  Then I tested the volume on a call.  I called my voice mail (length 2.5 minutes) and the volume seemed OK.  Approximately 4 hours later (all I had used the phone for was 3 texted msgs & the v-mail) the phone began to beep indicating the battery was low.  I checked & it was.  I figured I hadn't charged it fully so I put it on charge over night.  It came off of charge about 5 AM this morning and went unused expect to check 2 phone #'s in the address book while I was at the office.  As I was heading home about 3PM I left a 1 minute phone msgs for my son and the phone went to 2 bars.  By the time I got home (approx 30 min) it was beeping \"low battery\" again.  What's the problem?  I can live with the misspelled words in the menu's but my last Razr could go for days with a couple phone calls and many texts and not require charging.  I didn't often go that long without a charge but I have.I've grown fond of the Razr, this is my 4th one but, maybe the model is getting so old that need to consider buying something more up to date.I received a replacment that resolved the audio problems but the charging issues continue.  I need to keep the phone on a charger at all times.  At home , in the car and at the office, just to be sure I can have a 1-2 minute call off charger.  When possible I make & receive calls while I'm attached to the charger.  It sort of defeats the purpose of having a cell phone.  Being that tethered with charger cords I may as well have a landline. I replaced the battery at my expense but the problem continues.  Customer service tried to resolve the issue but the phones are junk.  I've had ATT provided Razr's that could go for days without charging during moderate use.  (Tons of text msgs and 3+ hours of talk time)  It appears to be a good company but a bad product.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016JDBYG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy", "Author": "Sheila Lenz", "ReviewID": "RGYL1UJ1BMEQ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone by mistake, thinking it was the V3III version which I love. This is not a good phone. FIRST! This was suppose to be a NEW phone but upon checking out the features I found there are 10 text messages on the phone ( all in Spanish!!) already on the phone. It doesn't save numbers the last number that calls you so you can just call someone back, no you have to look it up in your phonebook if you have it otherwise your tough out of luck. If you do not connect with a call the first time, there is a HIGH percentage that any immediate re-tries will end with \"Call Failed\" message. The back cover has fell off the phone twice in the short amt of time I've had the phone. Buttons on the sides are too easy to hit and there is a spot on the side of the phone somewhere if you touch it, the phone goes blue screen and ask for your simms card inserted! Using the speaker option is somewhat terrible because people complain they hear interfere noises when I use it and there is a delay in talking so when you talk you end up talking over the other person talking.Honestly, I had a GO Phone as a replacement for awhile, while I waited on this one to arrive (which took 2 weeks) and the GO phone was a much better phone and it didn't have the speaker option!!If you want a good phone, don't buy this one.......you will waste your money.

At first they said, as long as it's not bought from eBay, it has regular 1 year warranty. So, as asked, I sent in phone, along with the purchase order paper. A few days later, it was returned and problem was not resolved; a paper stated \"out of warranty\". I called again and explained, and was asked to ship it back, which I did, again with order receipt. A few days layer, same thing - returned, not repaired with a paper saying \"out of warranty\". Called again and was told the phone had fluid damage and cannot be repaired, which I swear was not true! After escalating to talk with a supervisor, their story changed; they said it's out of warranty. I provided order receipt, which I did two times already and then, story changed again: the supervisor said the receipt cannot prove I am the first owner.

I'll get my money back on that one since there was tracking and PayPal involved with a failure to actually ship.  (Ebay/Paypal refunded 6/2010)Anyway, you have an idea of what phone I am used to and now I have this one.I received it in two days, I used UPS Second Day service.  I was getting pretty desperate since the eBay phone never came and I was in get something, anything mode.As far as I can tell, the phone is new.  It didn't smell like smoke or have bagged items that looked like they had been opened.Sim slot seemed flimsy but is making a good connection.  Powered up and worked.  That is pretty darn important!Branded Cingular on back, symbol for T-Mobile on wall paper.Reception quality is less than my Sony Erricson Z520, bluetooth doesn't seem to let me get to photos on the phone, I can connect but not to files I know are on the phone.  I ordered Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 last night, maybe the view will improve.  I hope I can revise a review as I have more time with it.  I *hope* this isn't one of those crippled locked down phones the blood suckers (cell companies) try to turn into a profit center on ringtones and picture up/down loading.Ringer and speaker phone are not very loud.  Memory is 5MB, the Sony had 16MB.The longer I write the lower my opinion is getting.  Oh, the battery doesn't seem to hold charge worth a darn.  Like down to a bar after one day w/o talking on it more than a minute.  I ordered another battery.I have a USB car charger for my ancient Palm TE, it won't charge the phone.  Runs my Garmin Colorado GPS and charges the Palm just fine.  That is an irritation.It does have multiple alarms.  That is nice, I take a lot of meds and being prompted to take each one is a nice feature over my z520 with only one alarm.Where could this phone actually rack up points over time?Reliability.  As much as I loved my z520, I went though two of them, well three if you count the time I took parts from the first one to fix the second one.  Google white screen of death.  Also, the magnet for the flip function tended to draw in metal dust right near where the output transistors for the RF section were located.  Stupid.  I work in a machining facility.Staying connected.  My last phone had a habit of just dropping me were signal strength was good.It is a phone.  It was 72.49 with free shipping if I had time to wait.Wes SzumeraEdit 6/5/10I purchased a copy of Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 and it would not connect to the phone.The battery that came with it was a dud, the one I bought cheap from The OEM Shop actually seems to work.  I only get a charge complete with it if I use a PC to charge it though.  The other battery is still a dud, I tested it again using the PC as a charger.I complained about the bad original battery and Amazon wanted me to ship everything back which I was against.  The phone does work and I don't want to be quality assurance on another one.  Eventually they contacted me and said they gave me a 15 dollar credit and buy another battery, don't send yours back.When I tried to apply it the credit turned out to be 6.99 but I bought the replacement battery for just less than that so it is all good on that.I finally got my ring tones on the phone but I had to use PKCommander v6 from [...] which always makes me nervous since it is hard to tell if the software you get for free is clean as in no bad packages attached.Speaker volume sucks!  My custom ring tones are not as loud as the Z520a and they buzz.  The only good thing I have to say about this phone is that it does have multiple alarm clock settings.  That is becoming its most redeeming feature.Oh yes, flat black, avoid it if you expect the paint to stick on it.

The phone came with everything that was needed to use the phone. The phone held a charge and appeared to be fully functional.Here is my experience with BSR Cellular.  If you are given the option to buy this phone from BSR, BUY IT FROM THEM. I must also say that I believe that they are the best sellers that I have had the pleasure of doing business with. Due to my ignorance, I purchased this phone without reading the entire ad and to my dismay, it was not for my service provider. I contacted the seller and explained to them my problem and without a single hiccup, they returned my money. That was not the end of it either, they not only returned my money, but also went through the trouble of getting the phone for my service provider and emailed me once it became in stock because at that time they did not have it for my provider and ensured that I received the right Razr for Verizon.

So I asked if I was going to get the faulty product back or refund and they just ignored my questions from there on.

Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.What I received appeared to be in brand new condition: the box was sealed, and so were all the bags inside. The charger has a US plug but can be used overseas. The battery appeared to be new too, and after being charged under three hours held it for over 36 hours.  The phone was unlocked, but T-Mobile branded. It worked with both my T-Mobile SIM and a UK (English) pay-as-you-go SIM.I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like \"Tron\" in its use of a blue florescent design.The owner's manual is quite skimpy and cheaply printed as other reviewers suggest. But I was able to download the full manual as a PDF from Motorola's web site.  The supplied manual is small enough to keep in a wallet while travelling, though.I didn't try sending an MMS, but received one or two of SMS advertisements, so text messaging works.  If you want a phone for overseas travel that will work in almost any country with a local SIM card, consider this one.  As long as you buy from Amazon LLC or use a seller with Amazon Fulfillment, you a) probably will not have any problems and b) will at least get a no questions asked refund with the seller paying return shipping if what you receive does not work as described.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Miss my Razr", "Author": "Erica Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2UMTA6V63TC8Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a new Razr about 1 month ago after getting mine wet.

It states on the place where you insert the battery, MADE IN UK. Using the phone I went deep into the settings and noticed that the word \"centered\" was spelled \"centred\". No big deal as it is the only one you see and it is way deep inside the phone settings which you will most likely never access again once you are done personalizing your cell phone. From the internet I read that the U.S. version does not have a button located above the wheel but on this phone I got, it does have the button and it's good that it is there because it is a button for prompting delete options of certain things such as text messages, etc. Overall I give this phone a 10.5 out of 10!
