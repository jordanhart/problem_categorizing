{"Reviews": [{"Title": "After a Roller Coaster Ride of Phones and Carriers, Ive finally got the ONE!!", "Author": "Gam3r 4 Life \"HE Loved Us Enough to Die For U...", "ReviewID": "R27VFFQMYKJUB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 05-15-2013 I just wanted to add this to the top of my review to hopefully help people understand something about this phone BEFORE buying it then complaining. This is NOT an unlocked or international phone. This is a Metro PCS Locked phone for Metro PCS only. Im sure there are ways to unlock it, but it is sold and intended to activate on Metro PCS's CDMA and 4G LTE network. If you want an unlocked white Galaxy S3 here is one. Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Ceramic White) I hope this helps yet another person from buying this phone then complaining in a review it isnt GSM, or isnt unlocked, or isnt international. Also Metro PCS is a CDMA service, the product description doesn't make this very clear. To see that it is CDMA you have to click the \"more technical details\" link, then it shows (Network Compatibility: CDMA).  I tried to get Amazon to add that to the specs so others will know, but they didnt. Also make sure you check your area for Metro PCS service before you buy. Underneath the phones picture there is a link called \"zip code checker\" to check coverage for your area. Now onto the review.OK, without going into all the details I will say that since I decided to drop Sprint Ive been through almost all of the carriers, and several different phones. And for one reason or another I wasn't happy. Prior to the S3 I had the S2 from Boost (also bought through Amazon). But discovered that Sprint had no plans of expanding their 4G CDMA to my area. So with Sprint and Boost I would never have gotten 4G where I live (North Bay, California). Well shortly after this I found out that Metro was getting the S3. And the ironic thing is that I originally left Metro several years ago to go to Sprint because of Metro's lackluster selection of \"Smart Phones\". So now I'm back with Metro and have 4G LTE!!! But this wasn't without its own issues which I will get into later in hopes of helping others that get the Metro S3 through Amazon rather than directly through Metro. But first onto the phone. If you are looking for the absolute best performing phone for Metro, or any other carrier for that matter look no further. I know its expensive, but if you multiply the difference you'll be saving by 2 years vs. the others you will end up saving. And this phone is worth every cent. Ive had quite a few phones and thought they were fast, but this thing in FAST!! You can multitask like crazy without it slowing down at all. I haven't had it long enough to give any battery life reports, but I will update this later to add some details regarding battery, but it seems pretty good for now. Now as I mentioned above I had issues with 4G that took some research, and several calls to Metro to fix. When I first activated my phone I did the whole process online. Well the first thing I noticed was the speed only being at 1X. I tried several different things like rebooting, factory reset, but still nothing. And according to Metro's coverage map I'm in a fairly good area. But with Sprint I usually only had 1 bar, and 3G speeds of 300 kbs max. And then when I tried T-Mobile it would not connect at all, so I know where I live can be tricky. Verizon worked great, but its exactly double the cost I am paying at Metro. So anyway I did a lot of googling, and discovered a forum that mentioned exactly what my phone was doing. After activating through the site not getting any 4G. And it said that it was most likely because the sim card was not activated or paired to the phone. This seems to happen when activating on your own through the site, but not if you have Metro do it at a store. To test this go to Metropcs.com, log in, then look at your profile/ account info. It is suppose to show 2 things. It should show your phone, and its device number, and also should show a ICCID number. The ICCID is your sim card. Well at first mine did not show the ICCID. So what was suggested was to call Metro and ask them to activate the Sim card. Well this should have been simple, but wasn't. The first person didn't know what I meant. The second person said it was already activated, but they said they would do it anyway. So right after she said that she activated it, I rebooted, and FINALLY saw the 4G for the first time. And then I rechecked my profile at Metropcs.com and it showed the ICCID also for the first time. So if you have this issue its fixable, but it might take you a couple calls. And if they say its already activated just ask them to do it again. That should fix it. To sum it all up I am very happy that the roller coaster is over, and I have the phone I want, unlimited everything, 4G, insurance, all for $60/ month. If your on Metro do yourself a favor and get this phone. I guarantee you wont regret it!!!!I thought of something else I would like to add. I know that the initial $500 to get this phone is a lot, and the discounted deals that come with 2 year contracts are enticing. I know, Ive been there and done that. But in the long run you save a lot of money. Ill use the Verizon plan I tried for a couple days as an example.Metro S3 price with 2 day shipping.....$549.50Metro's Unlimited 4G LTE plan............$55/ month. (Unlimited Everything, No taxes,fees)2 year cost of just monthly plan.........$1320.00Phone cost + 2 years of service..........$1869.50Verizons current cost for S3 is $199, about $251 with tax and $36 activation (With 2 year contract discounted from 599.99)Verizons 4GB Plan cost......................$110.00 (Unlimited Calls, Text, and 4GB of data)2 year cost of just monthly plan.........$2640.00 (Not including taxes and other fees)Phone cost + 2 years of service..........$2891.00Verizons Cost of phone and plan for 2 years..$2891.00Metros Cost of phone and plan for 2 years.....$1869.50........................................Savings of about $1021.50So in the initial cost you will definitely save on the phones cost with Verizon, but in the long run you can end up saving a lot with Metro. Now I will admit that Metro's service is nowhere near as good or reliable as Verizon's, but as a long time Metro customer I rarely had any issues. The only issue I have now is slower data speeds. I was getting close to 6mbs download where I live with Verizon, and about 1.5 to 2.5mbs with Metro. But that additional data speed isn't worth doubling my bill. My house is in a tricky spot, I usually only have 1 bar, 2 at the most. I know my above calculations wont be the same for every carrier or plan. But this was the situation I was in when I tried Verizon. They have lower cost plans with less data, but at least you will have an idea of long term cost, and how to calculate it yourself to help with your decision.EDIT: I wanted to add something to my review that I think potential buyers might be worrying about, and that is the T-Mobile merger. There have been comments/ reviews, etc. saying that this Galaxy S3 will be a \"paperweight\" once the merger is complete. In other words it will be useless. This just isn't true. I myself have done a lot of research about this because its just too expensive to end up not being able to use it. The CDMA network is planned to run until 2015, ask your self honestly have any of you kept a phone for 3 years? By then the Galaxy S5 will be out. If anything the service will improve. I also read that there are plans to release a over the air update to allow existing Metro customers to access the T-Mobile network. Here is a direct quote from Neville Ray (T-Mobiles Chief Technology Officer) \"Shortly after the merger, MetroPCS phones will be able to connect to T-Mobile's upcoming LTE network - it's a simple matter of an over-the-air SIM update\". That will be the Data side of things. As far as calling the Metro S3 has VOLTE, which is Voice over LTE so that it will be able to make calls using T-Mobiles LTE network. And besides the CDMA is only what handles the 1x speeds, 4G LTE will be everywhere soon, and therefore the 1x wont be needed as much as it is now. Im in a pretty bad spot, and still have 4G LTE the majority of the time, and rarely fall back on CDMA 1x. So to sum it all up, the merger isnt anything to worry about, if anything its a good thing for us Metro customers because we will have access to T-Mobile networks as well.Update: (1-24-2013) Just wanted to update my review since the $55 plan is gone now. They now have a $60 plan with unlimited everything. So basically the one I have but $5 more. Still the best deal out there.Update: (5-5-2013) I left the Metro S3 for awhile, and ironically I am back. I tried a few other carriers, and phones, and ended up buying a new Metro S3 and so glad I am.

ZERO service in most states. And the old CDMA network will be phased out during 2014, turning CDMA phones into paperweights.The newer GSM version released in Septrmber 2013 (the version currently sold on the MetroPCS website) runs on the T-Mobile GSM network which covers 80% of American cities. The Metro/T-Mobile GSM 4G LTE network is expanding to cover 90% of American cities during 2014.Botton Line: buy ONLY the new GSM version and FIRST use the coverage map at the MetroPCS website to verify your town has 4G coverage before ordering.If you buy the new GSM version you will own an excellent phone on a growing network with monthly plans that are bargain priced: just $40 including all taxes and fees for unlimited nationwide calling and unlimited texting.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "shells", "ReviewID": "R2DYJTJ9GC6ITI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone looks excellent. Although, its very thin making it seem super fragile. A phone case is a must have for this phone. The service with metro pcs is not up to par. I am able to do almost everything without a problem. Nevertheless, there will be moments when you're trying to watch a video and it continuously buffers. The navigation system wont even work, as the signal is poor. On the upside, you will only be paying $45.00 per month. Overall, I really like the phones features, hence, the four stars. I would recommend it based on your individual needs. If you're keen on \"youtubing\" then go with another company. Otherwise, you will have to tolerate the lack of service.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone and plan! EDIT: Two months later", "Author": "Mr BenBen", "ReviewID": "RP78VQA7RQQWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit after 2 months: My review of this phone hasn't changed. Everything mentioned in my review hasn't changed and no bull from MetroPCS at all. When Metro said unlimited data, they weren't kidding. This month alone I've used 23+ GB of data with no throttling at all. Even been able to have a hotspot going with my tablet (Nexus 7).Sadly the $55 plan is gone and is now $60.However, I had a firmware update that failed and said that I had to take it to a Samsung support center. So far no hardware failure has come up. My S3 hasn't crashed yet but for some reason, the game GTA Vice City is incompatible. Weird. Also the YouTube app on low quality will run on a very low frame rate. Charles get the quality to HD and that fixes it, but doing that will eat up a lot of data for those on limited plans.Original Review: Metro PCS has finally got some good hardware for its phone selection. The S3 offered here is the same across all carriers. (Specs, camera, and the like)However, the only weaknesses this device has is its service. Now; I'm not saying Metro PCS is bad, but if anyone is looking for data speeds on par with ATT or Verizon will be mistaken. And service is limited (Until the T Mobile merger) in some areas of the US. I'd suggest buying the phone in store in case service isn't available for a refund.When you do have coverage, data gets the job done. With 2 bars of reception in my apartment, I could stream Netflix and Hulu with no buffering issues in pretty good quality. Internet browsing was smooth, and downloads apps was fairly quick. (Anything over 100 mb will take a minute)The phone aspect of the S3 on Metro works great! You have reception, calls sound great. (From 1 to 5 bars even) Text messages work as they should, I would get a different keyboard though. (Using SwiftKey on mine)All in all, I love the phone and service. For $55/month with no taxes (Plan is a limited offer, don't know when it's expiring) it is a great deal. Sad that the phone itself is so expensive, but if you can make the purchase without going into debt I say go for it.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S3 from Metro PCS is a GREAT PHONE, slight upgrade over Galaxy S2 Skyrocket", "Author": "Louis", "ReviewID": "R35N89R8EXFQPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just switched (back) from using a Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket running ICS on Straight Talk for $45/month plus tax to a Samsung Galaxy S3 on MetroPCS for $55/month flat rate. Simply put, I am glad to be back on Metro PCS and if you are like me and use LOADS OF DATA (say, more than 2.5GB a month), then I highly recommend this Samsung Galaxy S3 phone (as the phone speaks for itself) and the Metro PCS service on the promotional $55/month (no tax) unlimited 4G LTE plan.  The Galaxy S3 is not leaps and bounds better than the Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, as I would consider it an incremental upgrade but yet the best phone that I have ever owned to date.  Prior to a five month stint with Straight Talk, I had been with Metro for about 3 years. My biggest gripe with Metro (at the time) was their lack of high end phones, which we know now has changed. I live in Northern California and travel a few times a year (typically to major US cities). I've never really had an issue with phone coverage for voice calls or voice call quality but it would be a good idea to put a few bucks on your Metro account to cover Travel Talk (roaming) for .19 cents per minute. It doesn't happen often for me, but I've definitely had to use it for remote or pocket areas that you may not have anticipated. Between their home coverage, extended coverage, and travel talk area (see the Metro PCS coverage map for clarification), coverage for voice and text in the US (and in a few parts of Canada, so their coverage map says) is PRETTY WELL COVERED or at least as good if not better than the BIG 4 (for overall US coverage). Now, it is annoying when I find myself out of the internet coverage area so depending on your specific travels, you may want to take that into consideration or be ready to head to Starbucks for free WiFi use when necessary :). The slower internet speeds in the extended coverage areas do not bother me and still allow for adequate internet browsing and email sync.  I have never done a speed test in the extended coverage areas but they feel like super slow 3G.  I THINK THE MAIN POINT HERE (FOR ME) IS \"VALUE\". The savings that you'll see is well documented (over contract carriers) and NOW the same premium phone is available. The Metro PCS and T Mobile merger doesn't concern me at this point since everything I read says that network changeover will happen over time with a completion target by the end of 2015. As much as I like this Samsung Galaxy S3, I doubt that I'll have it 3 years from now. Looking forward, I certainly hope that the Metro PCS tradition of offering ground breaking value is maintained. Does Metro PCS have the fastest 4G? NO, I get about 1.2M down and 2.2M up regularly in my area and I have seen it as high as 3M down 5M up on rare evenings or in the area 25 miles south of me (VERSUS 3.5M down and 1M up from Straight Talk). That said, I have no problems streaming video and audio such as the NBA League Pass, Netflix, YouTube, or listening to Pandora on this device (and GET THIS, streaming video and audio is actually allowed on the Metro PCS network, unlike some of the other carriers). It works great. The overall clincher for me really was twofold... the offering of this awesome new Samsung Galaxy S3 device (got it for two-ninety-nine, special Holiday price) and an unbeatable $55/month flat rate plan with *truly* unlimited data, no caps and no throttling. I had recently had the unfortunate experience of data being shut down (with calls in to carrier support, factory reset of device per carrier request), throttling (at about 200k - 300k down), and automated recorded phone calls (regarding my data use) with my previous carrier BUT when I never used more than 1.9GB of data in the billing cycle. I decided that I did not have time to deal with that or the subjectivity of these other so called unlimited plans, AND SO TO METROPCS I RETURNED with the hottest phone on the market and the best TRULY unlimited calling and data plan.  The only reason why I didn't rate this phone 5 stars is because battery life out of the box for me was not great.  I use the Easy Battery Saver app in Advanced mode and it now conistently lasts until bedtime.  I would consider my use medium to heavy.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this phone and the service delivered from Metro PCS.  I hope my shared experience helps you guys make the right decision. Your mileage may vary... GOOD LUCK!Update 1/08/13 -I began to have an issue with the TouchWiz launcher where it would pause the device for about (or less than) 10 seconds and display an error regarding the application being stopped or unresponsive.  My device would eventually reboot the launcher after a few seconds (as home screen icons and widgets would disappear and then re-appear).  The issue happened a few times a week and up to this point was the only real annoyance with this phone.  So, assuming it had all to do with TouchWiz, I changed to the Nova Launcher and have not experienced a launcher issue since.  In my opinion, the Nova Launcher is a smooth running alternative to TouchWiz.As for Metro 4G speeds, I stated that I was getting 1.2M down and 2.2M up in my \"general\" area but found out that it greatly depends on your immediate area (granularly).  Literally just down the hill, I am getting 4.5M down and 5.5M up.  Either way, and even though these speeds may not compare to what other carriers \"advertise\", I find these 4G speeds to be 100% satisfactory and plenty fast for my video/audio streaming, email synchronization, and web browsing needs.  I did about 4GB in my first month and rather enjoyed not having to worry about soft cap throttling or worse, getting cut off.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!!", "Author": "Nina", "ReviewID": "RPJ5KICK6K0DY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome phone!

So why are these two companies combining forces? Sounds like an integration nightmare.This is a good question. And it's one that analysts have been asking since the deal was first rumored. But T-Mobile CEO John Legere says this won't be a major issue for either company, since T-Mobile and MetroPCS have already begun repurposing or refarming their existing spectrum to deploy 4G LTE services. He also argues that the companies are well suited for each other since they use the same slivers of spectrum in the PCS band as well as in the Advanced Wireless Service or AWS band of spectrum. This should make it easier to tie the two services together.A MetroPCS store.(Credit: Greg Sandoval/CNET) The way it will work, according to the plan outlined by T-Mobile, is that the LTE service will run on AWS spectrum that is combined from T-Mobile and MetroPCS. And the new T-Mobile will use its and MetroPCS's PCS spectrum to deliver HSPA+ service. MetroPCS's current CDMA network will be phased out by the end of 2015.I'm a MetroPCS customer, so what does this move mean for me?Initially, it won't mean anything. On day one, you will still be able to use your existing phone. But over time, T-Mobile will be repurposing the the MetroPCS spectrum to work with T-Mobile's yet to be launched LTE service and it's existing HSPA+ service.This means that you will have to get a new handset, since over time, T-Mobile would get rid of the old CDMA voice network, and replace it with a GSM network. But because this change will happen over several years, most people will probably naturally upgrade to a new phone that will work on the new network. And for those who aren't inclined to change handsets within a year or 18 months, T-Mobile will likely offer incentives. But the reality is that you will eventually have to upgrade your handset.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Left Verizon for the S3 on Metro PCS and couldn't be happier!!!", "Author": "Forrest W.

Overall, i would say my experience with the device was good.I want to start with the positives of the device. One of the best things this phone has is its display. It is absolutely gorgeous when viewing pictures or videos. Crank up the brightness and play an HD video, your eyes will thank you. The colors are saturated but damn i thought they looked good. I don't know how to explain it, they just pop at you. The display size is a good 4.8 inches big which is a nice size now a days. Between 4.5-5 inches i think is a good size. I would give the display an 10/10. No complains from me.The overall feel of the device was pretty decent. People complain about the built quality of the device and how flimsy it feels. I would say this device feels very fragile. I slapped a protective case from day one. A friend of mine had  one fall from 2 feet high and the screen got cracked. I was not taking that chance. The phone had pretty good protection against scratches and minor bumps once i put it on the case. Even with the case this phone did not feel heavy or clumsy. I had a hard time handling the device with one hand but that is the price you pay for getting that big display. My hands are pretty small too. Your experience might be different. I would say overall fee in the hand i would say a 7/10 simply because of the build quality and durability. A case is a must.In every day activities this phone was really fast. The processor is a duel core 1.5 ghz processor. Very quick. I often had between 5-10 apps open and never had a problem. From time to time you would see an app crash but that was usually a problem with specific apps. One thing that always bugged me is how the original launcher that comes with the phone (Touchwiz) lags and stutters from time to time. Good thing android is so flexible. A couple months after buying the phone i received the update to Jelly Bean 4.1.2. It was a considerable improvement. That combined with the Nova Prime Launcher provided a lag free and smooth performance. Samsung included a lot of features with the phone that can be considered gimmick. They are, for the most part. The only one i considered useful is the smart stay and the swipe to take a screen shot feature. The smart stay is very useful when you are reading a long article and don't want the screen to be constantly dimming. The multi window multitasking i can honestly say is complete garbage. I used it a couple of time the first day and it is useless. The screen is just too small for that purpose. I can see that working on a big tablet screen but on a phone it is cramped. It did not make the phone freeze or lag though. I was still very pleased with the performance 9/10.The camera performance in the Galaxy S3 is very nice. It has a lot of shooting modes. If you take pictures at night there are a couple shooting modes that will improve the pictures considerably. The HDR mode and night mode are excellent for taking pictures at night. I could not believe how good the pictures looked. They were almost as good as my regular point and shoot camera. Daylight pictures looked excellent when they were taking under proper lighting conditions. I always liked how fast the camera focused and managed to take the shots without having blur. That is a big problem with cheaper phones. Videos in high definition are very good to watch but they look considerably better on the phone that when i saw on the computer or the TV. I don't know why. Pictures and video quality would diminish considerably when you will soon the camera. That is still a big problem with cell phone cameras. Newer cell phones like the Lumia 1020 do a much better job in this regard. I would say the camera earns a solid 8/10.The one Achilles heel in this device and the one thing that holds it back is the battery life. I would not say it is awful but it is far from good. It is just mediocre. It is simply not big enough. You remember that beautiful screen i talked about at the beginning? Well, that beautiful screen uses up a LOT of battery. I had days when i unplugged the phone at around 8 am and i had to recharge it at around 2 p.m because it would be at around 30%. Granted, that was with some heavy usage but still...you want to use the phone. That wouldn't be so bad if the battery didn't take so long to charge. It takes a good two and a half hours for this phone to charge from 0 to 100%. Newer phones with Snapdragon 800 processors charge considerably faster. The standby times are not that good either. If i leave it at 100% overnight i would wake up with around 65% in the morning. That is not acceptable. If a phone is idle it should not use more than 1-2% per hour. Battery life gets a 5/10.In conclusion, i would recommend this phone for its display, performance and its camera just remember that it does have its limitations. The battery life holds it back considerably. If you feel like you are a heavy user you might want to consider other options or buy an extended battery. This one doesn't last. I also feel like the phone is still a bit over priced off contract. Samsung phones are just overpriced overall. The phone is nice though and certainly worth a look if you can get it a decent price. I'd say less than $300 off contract if it had light usage. Maximum $350. Anything over that i think you should look else where.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone is amazing.

If you are in a few different cities in Ohio, such as Toledo, Cleveland or Cincinnati,  this phone will not work. The first thing you will want to do is contact your local Metro PCS store and find out if they have transferred their CDMA system over to the new GSM system yet.By checking the technical details tab, you can see that this phone is an older version, which is still on the CDMA network. If your local store has transferred their systems to GSM then this phone cannot be activated and is essentially a high priced paperweight.If you are still wanting this phone for Metro PCS and you are in an area that has started using the new GSM system, you will have to purchase an unlocked Galaxy S3.I am still giving the item 3 stars because the Galaxy 3 is a great phone, this particular phone is just of no use to those that have Metro PCS in Ohio.
