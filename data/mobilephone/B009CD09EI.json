This is the closest thing to a smartphone without actually being a smartphone. It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features. I get unlimited data on this which is very useful. The item is not as described though, it comes with a 2GB SD card, not 4GB. I was planning on putting a much bigger 32GB card in but that is not the point, the description lied. It works on AT&T;'s network pretty fluidly. All calls and messages are received. It arrived without an ability to connect to AT&T;'s data network, it took me hours to figure it out until I stumbled upon a video [...] which helped me so much, now the data works. It needs a factory reset because out of the box the apps were not launching right. The free 40 EA games don't seem to work yet for some reason, no big deal though. The screen itself is extremely tiny, they could have added another half inch in there at least. The operating system makes up for that though, it is very user friendly. Except for the fact you can not control the brightness level. If you're willing to put in a half-hour tops of work into this once you get it, it really does pay off.PROS:-Super Cheap On Data-User friendly-Apps (not many but still)-Capacitive Touchscreen-3.5 mm headphone port-Upgradeable Memory (Up To 32GB)-Stylish-FM Radio-Decent Camera (3.2 MP)-Wi-Fi-Pin Code Lock-Internet Radio-Data ManagementCONS:-Pain To Set Up-No front camera-Not many apps-Only A 2GB SD Card-No Brightness Control-Small Screen-Non-Removable BloatwareI would reccomend this to someone who is willing to sacrifice some smartphone luxuries without sacrificing them all to save a lot of cash.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good feature phone.", "Author": "CelloChick", "ReviewID": "RPWXC2KOXKHCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone a week now. I replaced a Nokia 6102i and I wanted a phone that did not need a data plan with my provider. One drawback is that the text message interface is presented as conversations, so it's a little different when it comes to finding sent messages or saving messages. You can't delete the facebook, store, online games, and other \"data\" icons, although there is a provision to customize one of the three screens that opens when you swipe the lock screen. The ringtone is loud enough for me to hear from another room in the house but I'm not sure it would be for someone with much hearing loss, and it takes a couple of swipes to get to the menu where the ringtone volume can be turned up. Also, I had to work a couple of hours to find the MMS settings online since this is an unlocked phone that is not supported by my well-known cell service provider. That was the most difficult obstacle. On the plus side, the on-screen qwerty keyboard is good and the capacitive touch screen is exactly like that on an iPod touch once you turn off the vibration-on-touch feature. It's pretty much impossible to dial this phone inadvertently since the screen locks and can't be unlocked without a deliberate swipe. The camera is so much better than the one I had on my flip phone that I really can't complain. It came with a 2 GB mini SD and uses a Nokia proprietary charger with the tiny pin. It is not heavy at all and doesn't protrude from my pocket like I thought it might. It has Nokia's proprietary ringtones and provisions for adding additional ones. The music player is intuitive and the radio works with the headphones that come with the phone. It looks like the standby battery life is two or three days, a little shorter than what I had on my Nokia flip phone but perfectly acceptable.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm not sure if you can find a better \"dumbphone\" out there", "Author": "OhHaiInternet", "ReviewID": "R2FE71W0BLC83O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have seen many sites that try to compare this feature phone to smartphones and that would be a mistake. This is NOT a smartphone (despite what Nokia tries to put on their website). That being said, it is probably the best non-smartphone that you can find that will not cost you an automatic data plan charge on your bill. You see, I have AT&T; as my cell phone provider and they will automatically charge you a data plan once their computers recognize that your SIM card is in a smartphone. I made that mistake when I bought a smartphone without knowing their policy and I was automatically put on a data plan for that month. At that point, I put my SIM back into my old Samsung and sent the smartphone back.Then I started doing heavy research to find a phone that would provide me with many of the same features as a smartphone but would not be recognized by AT&T; as a smartphone. Eventually I came across the Asha series of phones. I was about to buy the Asha 302 at first, then the 501 but after looking on phonearena, I came to the conclusion that this phone was probably the most advanced in the series. I bought it and I'm very happy that I did. I haven't seen a data plan charge since I've started using this phone. In order to be sure though, I decided to turn off mobile data. So I only use wifi on the phone (and I advise you to do the same just to be safe). Still, this phone has basically served as an extra computer for me in the house.Just don't expect the world from it. The map app is just OK (it's no Google Maps), the app selection is pretty lame (the Nokia store doesn't offer much), and the games that are actually worth playing and the phone can handle (it only plays Java games) are few and far between. Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies are two that come to mind. Don't even bother trying to play Temple Run on this phone; there's no java version out there worth talking about.Overall though, this is the most advanced dumbphone I have ever seen. Compare this phone to other feature phones, not smartphones and I think you will be very happy with your purchase.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "nads", "ReviewID": "R35M54HXZKKL98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a good phone if your not a phone person and is just looking for something simple but still have features like the other phone then go for this", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone does not work well", "Author": "Annari", "ReviewID": "R1M3O77JIQWQN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone does not work wellThis phone first of all would not be charged with the charger included in the box, now the touchscreen responds at will, it is worst than my broken 5810.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got this for my daughter", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXJX9K5O3HIVT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "She loves it!
