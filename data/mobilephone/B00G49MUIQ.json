Young", "ReviewID": "R1JF7FZZPBEM51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phone, but I wasn't willing to downgrade to a 2g network, when I am on 4g.  However, my son, who also needed a phone, absolutely loves this phone.  I think it's because it looks like the Galaxy 4G.  So, we traded phones!  Problem solved.  It's slim with a nice big screen, easy touch and navigation.  It also has a built in case, that's attached to the back of the phone.  It folds over and covers the whole screen.  Pretty sleek!!", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's just okay!", "Author": "sunny411", "ReviewID": "R2GK7PNA86828D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First I want to say that, Yes this is a smartphone, touchscreen, and android. However, it's also 2G! Which is not in the product description at all! Major downfall for this phone! Connecting to the browser is really slow when using your data plan. But if you are plan to use wi-fi from home, school, or work then maybe it's not so bad. But if you are person always on the go like me, this is not the phone for you. This phone is smart enough to give to a preteen, teenage, and some senior citizens. NOT FOR busy moms, dads, working professionals or students! Again, I only say this because of it's slow 2G. Also Microsoft office or 365 does not work on this phone. Also, you can use this phone on the att networks without any problems. I took mine to the att store, and a rep hooked it up for me. YOU will need the large SIM card for this phone. DO NOT PUT IN A SMALL SIM CARD! So as much as I liked the phone it is getting returned.Pro's:Sleeklight weightperforms wellgreat pictureCon's:2GCamera-just sucks really bad.On call speaker is not loud enough", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "good for side or back up phone", "Author": "david bringer", "ReviewID": "R1XZKENCOE2ORT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good for side or back up phone has 2 gsm but etching network defiantly need wifi like i sais good for everything except network sucks no 4g", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works well", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "RHBAZTCTVF43C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone works good but the reception is not perfect.

So far so good except...it's very slow, in a good coverage area it will pickup 3G. It keeps going to Google Hong Kong when I try to browse. I already know what not to expect from this phone. This phone says my wifi signal is poor, but my GS4 says its excellent at the same distance. Finally, battery #1 is not charging. I decided to turn the phone off to charge it. My indoor reception sucks, but outside the signal was strong. Its ok for what it cost even though I saw it for less, I just needed the phone service more than the data plan.
