Eng", "ReviewID": "R2SSL1BNBSSE0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wrote this review for the S7100 but just realized that this, the N7100, is a newer model with a newer ARM CPU.  Documentation from elsewhere says this uses the MT6572 which is a 2013 chip from MediaTek.This is NOT a Samsung phone. It is just one of the many Chinese lookalikes of brand name phones. Physically, this looks like a cross between a Samsung Note I, II and III, but the hardware specs are very different, generally lower. It uses standard Android, so software wise it is as good as any, if not better (because it does not carry the telo garbage), than any other Android phone.What this phone has that brand name phones do not have:a. Ability to use 2 SIMs. When you are traveling, you can plug in a local one so as to optimize your usage cost.b. You can program it to switch off and on at your specified times.c. Some may already be officially rooted.What this phone does not have that brand name phones have:a. No LTE, only 3G.b. Lower resolution display (960x540 vs 1280x800 of Note 1)c. Slightly heavier.d. Less RAM and built-in storagee. Doesn't have a brandf. No in-country repairsBecause it does not have in-country repairs, warranty support requires mailing it back to China. If you are lucky with the hardware and have no need for repairs, you get a capable smartphone for a very low price.  But first check that the 3G frequencies are what your telo uses.I have purchased four of such China Android phones. One died, after I left it unused for a few weeks. Apparently, if it is not powered up, humidity built up can damage it.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "astounded by this amazing phone", "Author": "lonniel roberts", "ReviewID": "RS6I3HY8147HB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it does everything the note 2 do and even had a few surprises that caught me off guard love the look as well", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money it cost !!!!", "Author": "Miss Lady", "ReviewID": "R10B4O1C0LUQU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is the perfect size but the camera is terrible.

Some small issues so far, such as - I have been unable find an N7100 case that actually will fit properly, the mic and headphone jack openings do not match the device. The included stylus does not work properly with the screen and there is no way to re-calibrate it, screen seems to work better with my finger. And, while it is great to include the extra battery, there is no included external charger, so it is useless to swap them. Unless, of course, you manage to find a compatible charger sold separately. Last issue, even though my carrier offers 4g service, I have yet to get 3g reception (this phone is suppose to be capable of 3g) even in the heart of town near the carrier's tower.On the good side, the phone was not $500 - $800 as you would expect to pay for Samsung's Galaxy Note II. I love the quality and functionality of Samsung's Galaxy line, but simply cannot afford the prices. As such, I will learn to live with this knock-off's flaws.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW WHAT A PHONE", "Author": "john m.", "ReviewID": "R2TP3GAMW6J0NM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone I use it for net10 50 a month unlimited its just like the real Samsung it's unbelievable 4 core processor faster", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "anxious", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R15AF3D9K6KLBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm ready to receive my phone hope its great .After I reveiew what ppl said about this device .... sounds like a great big phone ;) I like big phones ..", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "oprah", "ReviewID": "RV06D2A34DA4E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice phone, but volume is really low and the screen came with a crack to the lower left side :l", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Gina", "ReviewID": "RYNJAVAOAODIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looooove this phone.

In other words, you're not tying this to your account but can still get Skype, Facebook, etc apps through the chinese hacked one.Can't seem to calibrate the screen, senses touch a bit off so typing is no fun.Overall it will serve its purpose as a travel phone so I don't risk losing my Nexus 5.  Other than that its not worth your money.  I'll leave mine with a Homeless guy when I leave the PI.There must be several different models as mine has a Samsung rear cover and battery, front looks like Samsung with text over it, boot screen is Samsung, MTK reader shows its a fake, sim slots different than what is shown above on Amazon.

It says it comes with a 3100mAh battery no it dont it came with 2 2800mAh batteries. The camera is not what its supposed to be which is 8mp its only a 5mp camera. The S pen that it comes with isnt an S pen and dont even work on the phone unless u press hard. Everything about the phone is not what i assumed i was paying for. I bought 2 of these phones one for me and one for my husband and were purchesed at the same time but when the phones arrived i only got one phone and when i contacted the company they said they r sorry for the inconvenience do u still want the phone well yes i want the phone i paid for it. It comes from china so it takes anywhere from 11 to 21 days. I have been in daily contact with the company about these phones due to all the issues with the phone not being what i paid for", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "worst phone ever", "Author": "love", "ReviewID": "RHMF16Y7KBHOX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "my play store doent work.charger very wiggly wont charge well onless i hold onto it.dont buy from wieze.not compatible with fmily mobile", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "W.
