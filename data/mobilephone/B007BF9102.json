The thick chrome lining that runs around the edge adds to the sleekness, and differentiates it from similar looking Curve models. It is arguably the most good looking BB of recent times with one of the best performances.This one came without any logo which is the way I wanted, and they shipped to me in a week.I have heard a few stories on the short batter life - Well I don't think it's too bad and my reasoning is simple. I consider myself a moderate user -- not too many apps but still an app user -- then if you have to charge your device every night (any smartphone would need that), so how does is matter if there's 20% or 40% battery remaining at the end of your day.If you like to type a lot and have decided qwerty kb is the one for you -- then there aren't many better choices than the Bold 9790!", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mr", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R34U5UP3JKLQOP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd blackberry phone and after much research I decided this was the ideal upgrade blackberry for me. Functionally speaking it is much the same as older versions, but operates quicker with all up to date features you would need. It's possibly the perfect blackberry for me. But all this is all actually irrelevant because the battery life is absolutely appalling. I'm writing this review mid afternoon and my battery is already in the red.
