{"Reviews": [{"Title": "2 Stars for phone, 4.5 stars for the service", "Author": "Paul Duke", "ReviewID": "R2BTRVJDJ76M38", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Please note I'm reviewing both the Virgin Mobile service here and also the Oystr phone.First the phone. I've had Virgin Mobile service for 2.5 years and have been using an old Audiovox flip phone which is very small. Lately the buttons on the Audiovox are getting a bit dodgy and my eyesight is getting worse too (I'm 43) so I wanted a phone with a bigger, brighter screen. I've been waiting for Virgin Mobile to have some decent phones and I was excited to see this Oystr phone available at such a decent price.However I discovered that you get what you pay for. To me, this phone was only marginally acceptable. First off, the phone seems very buggy. Sometimes the keypad backlighting comes on, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the screen remains lit througout a call (that surely accounts for part of the battery problems people have been reporting), sometimes it doesn't. Setting the backlighting to turn off after 7, 15 or 30 seconds made no difference on my phone; it always turned off after 2 minutes or so -- when it did not stay on throughout a call. The messaging is buggy also -- to give one example, the automatic capitalization works after a period, but not after a question mark or an exclamation mark. This latter bug doesn't seem limited to my particular phone. I emailed Virgin Mobile about it and they emailed me back to say they replicated this on their Oystr also. How it is that a phone aimed at young people doesn't have good SMS software is simply astonishing to me -- it's not like this is a new technology. I've been using SMS-equipped phones for years in Asia, where most people send SMS messages more than they make phone calls. All of these bugs were giving me a queasy feeling so I decided to switch to the Nokia Shorty, which I am much happier with. Nokia has, in my opinion, the simplest and easiest to use cell phone software. The sound quality of phone calls on the Nokia compared to the Oystr is far superior, in my opinion.This phone seems okay for someone who really wants a flip phone at a low price. But if you use your phone or SMS messaging a lot I think you will find the annoyances of this phone rather great.Now let me talk about the Virgin Mobile service. I think it's very good overall. I have a special set of circumstances -- I'm often working outside the US for months at a time. Therefore it seems a waste to me to pay a large monthly fee for a phone which I will not be using perhaps half the year. Virgin Mobile's service fits the bill perfectly. So far as I can tell, this is the cheapest large and well-established cell phone service. If you want a cell phone only for emergencies, to keep in the car, to use when you arrive at or are picking someone up at an airport, etc., then I think you can't beat Virgin Mobile. The minimum you can pay with them to keep your phone in service is $80/year -- and that $80 goes toward call time. You have to add $20 to your account every 90 days to keep your account active. Then minutes are 25 cents/minute for the first 10 minutes on any one day, and 10 cents/minute after than first ten minutes (Virgin Mobile does not actively advertise this deal anymore, but it is still available if you ask them or search carefully on their website).In contrast, Net 10 seems cheaper -- 10 cents/minute all the time -- but you have to pay a minimum of $150/year to keep the service active (this is as of Sept. 2006 -- plans change frequently, of course).In addition, Virgin Mobile's customer support is exemplary. Every time I have called them with a problem, I got a knowledgable person who spoke English fluently and was very helpful and friendly. Their website is excellent and easy to use. I explored switching to the Net 10 service when I discovered the Oystr was such a poor phone -- Net 10 has some nice phones available. But calling their customer service was a nightmare. It seems clear to me they have followed the trend toward outsourcing their customer service to offshore call centers in order to save money and it was very difficult to get basic information about their service. Net 10 as well has a reputation (do a search on Google) for having a difficult time switching a phone number over to their service. I decided not to risk it and just stay with Virgin and the Nokia phone. I'm glad I did.Overall I give Virgin Mobile very high marks for their service, but poor marks for the phone selection. I do not know why they do not offer one good solid higher-end Motorola or Nokia phone to attract more adults (and smarter people) to their service. I hope in the future they see that they could reach a whole new market with their good service if they offered phones not just aimed at trendy high-schoolers but also at (slightly) older folks too.", "Date": "September 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Nice", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Wordsmith\"", "ReviewID": "ROOD78893EWQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so all the bad reviews for this phone almost made me not buy it. However, I needed a phone, and this one had nice features, and texting is cheap, so I went ahead and bought it, figuring I could return it if I didn't like it.So, the first thing I notieced is that it is a nice phone. It is a perfect weight, comfortable to hold. The white case has a pearl-sheen to it, and is solid feeling. It is a study and tight phone, very durable. The screen is 128 x 128, and it looks muay nice. I've seen $50 phones with screens of lesser quality. You can change the brightness and contrast. I lowered the contrast one level, and it looks nice and crisp.The phone is easy to navigate. It played with it for two minutes and figured out where everything was. It has the standard virgin mobile graphics [pig with wings, donkey, dragon, robot, etc.] and they aren't distracting or anything. The menu's are easy to navigate and see. The fonts are clear and easy to read, not cramped or odd colored. It comes with 4 backgrounds: swirls, diamond pattern, skulls & roses, and multi-colored eagles. On their site you can download more for $2. The phone comes with themes also, and you can download more.The ringtones are nice. They've now added a 'Euro ringer' because the older generation didn't like the superphonic [song] ringers. The Euro ringer sounds like a normal phone, but just a tiny bit more fancy so as to not be boring. You can download hundreds of ringers on their site. I currently have Super Mario Brothers theme. The sound quality of the ringer has improved, it sounds loud and clear. No more tin box or static sounding.The text imput is simple. You can disable auto-text and what not, and typing is fast. It is simple to navigate email, text, and inbox. Speed dialing, one touch, etc. can all be enabled, and they are simple to use. You can change sounds, including 'text recieved' alarms. You can add signatures to text messages, and graphics. The phone has both text AND picture messaging, even though the phone doesn't have a camera. Texts are cheap compared to most. A standard text is 5 cents both ways. However, even on the prepaid plan, you can sign up for a monthly texting plan [while keeping your prepaid plan]. You can get 1000 text messages a month for $9.99. Not a bad deal, best you will find for texting anywhere, especially for prepaid.Web browsing is simple and easy to navigate. With one press of a button, the phone will pull up the number of minutes you have remaining. You can do this 5 times a day for free. If you are low on minutes, you can register your credit or debit card or paypal account on your Account through their site. If you check your minutes and it is low, then you can simply enter a dollar amount to refill, hit OK, and you have added more minutes. Very simple and convient; very nice since you don't have to go to a store to buy a card. All minute plans are 18 cents a minute no matter what, and this includes tax.Oka, onto the matter everyone cares about: battery life. With the first Oystr's, battery life was terrible. Beyond terrible. Maybe 10 hours if you were lucky. Luckily, after so much complaing, VM has corrected this problem. With the older phones, the backlight stayed on constantly, even when the phone was closed, which drained the battery. Now, you have more options. You can go into Menu > Settings >Display > Duration. By default, the backlight will remain lit even when the phone is closed, though the screen goes off and the backlight dims. The purppose of this is so that if it is dark, you can see a faint blue glow coming from your closed phone, making it sylish and easy to find.If you wish to stop this, go into Duration and select disabled. This will disable the backlight WHEN THE PHONE IS CLOSED. When you open the phone, the keys will light up just like normal. The difference is, the backlight NEVER stays on when the phone is closed. Battery life goes back to the stated 7-8 days. The only thing is that when the phone is open, it takes a full two minutes for it to dim. So that is two minutes of talking when the  phone will be using a little more juice. But it doesn't make a huge difference. If you purchase an Oystr, do what I said [disable the backlight] and the phone still stays lit or the battery doesn't work, you ahve been sold the older, not-thought-out-too-well model. You need to contact VM and get them to send you a new one.Reception on this phone is good. I'm yet to have a call dropped. The calls go through fast. Since you can pull up reports on your minutes, you don't have to listen to the robot tell you how many you have left. The sound quality is good. I can go into the very lower level of the school library, which is all stone, and I still get reception without a problem.Rates on this prepaid plan are very nice, especially when you take into consideration the reception quality. Pay by the minute is 18 cents always. Texts are 5 cents always, both to send and recieve, UNLESS you want to sign up for the monthly texting plan [1000 for $10]. You can sign up for the text plan WHILE remaining on the pay by minute plan; VM is the only one with this. Another thing I like about VM is that I can switch between monthly plans and prepaid plans as often as needed. With other prepaid plans, once you switch to a monthly plan, you can't go back to pay by minute. With VM you can.Overall, I really like this phone. It was dirt cheap, $20, and it is NICE. If it had a camera, it would be perfect. It is strong, crisp, has an Xcellent screen, nice downloads, good ringer, has song ringers which are also unheard of for a prepaid cell at this price, has excellent and strong reception, on-demand minute statitics, instant minute purchasing, etc. I hightly recommend this phone, as long as it is the newer model.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love the Oystr phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Denise", "ReviewID": "R3S8O0KLVWIULE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have been pre-pay cell phone users for about 5 years now, we were with Trac-Fone, the only reason we left Trac-Fone was because we got tired of carrying around a heavy phone and for some reason the flip phones available through Trac-Fone didn't work for us, we never had a problem otherwise with Trac-Fone or their customer service, but because I wanted a flip phone I decided to do some research on other pre-pay cell phones out there.A few weeks ago we decided to go with Virgin Mobile Audiovox 8610 and were basically happy with the phone except the 1 complaint that many have expressed, the sound of the ringtone was way too low, other then that we were happy with the signal and customer service.I decided to buy my mother a pre-pay phone and saw the Oystr on the Virgin Mobile website, she's not a big cell phone person either and we just wanted to get her the phone in case she needed it for an emergency, I got the phone and charged it and was amazed how great this phone was, the ringtones go to level 7 whereas the Vox 8610 go to level 5, the ring was so loud that I had to put it down to a level 3 for her and that's still loud, so I was happy about that, also this phone is easy to program and the speakerphone worked great, this phone also offers voice dialing, just program it and all you have to do is press the send button and say Home or whatever you choose and it dials it automatically.We loved this phone so much that we decided to buy 2 more Oystr phones and are returning the Vox 8610's. We were able to buy the Oystr at Best Buy for $29.99. I can't find anything wrong with this phone at all, the outer shell is hard and seems less susceptible to damage, the ring is very loud, we get a great signal, and the phone notifys us if we have a voice mail message. You can also send text messages and browse the web with this phone but since we're not interested in that I can't comment on it.You can also download ringtones etc. for this phone. I can't say enough good things about it, for the price we paid we got a really great phone. Virgin Mobiles customer service has been awesome also, we had no problem changing over the phone from the Vox 8610 to the Oystr.", "Date": "August 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "pre paid simplicity", "Author": "M.

PENNY TEXTING is awesome! just 9.99 a month for 1000 messages. this is the easiest way to stay in touch as a family. way cheaper than calling and wasting minutes. unlimited plans are awesome too as nights start at 7pm. perfect time for my 12 year old to get home, do homework, eat dinner, and then call her friends. OH you can also text message to a land line and the message gets read to you AND you have the option of replying to that message! that feature has come in handy already. nice, simple, no frills phone with a plan to match. you can also earn up to 75 bonus minutes a month just by watching some ads on the website. it's called sugar mama, try it!", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Really Nice Phone 4 the money!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RIHOS47KRZ895", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To my surprise, this phone has a bundle of features.  You get 4 ringtones to start and the phone is loud.  Additionally, the phone has about two dozen sound-effects tones for all the features and alerts that come with the phone.For example, there are 5 sound-effects for flip (lid) open and flip close.  There are a dozen sound-effects and vibration for message alert, page alert, voicemail alert and missed call alert. There's also an option to remind.My favorite is the \"missed call alert\" that's set to \"vibrate and remind.\"  When someone calls, the phone will ring, however, if the caller hangs up, the phone will vibrate 3 times after the last ring.  Really cool if you have your phone in your pocket and didn't set the vibrate to on. Other features include: voice-dial,  Speaker phone, 4 alarms, voice memo, stop watch, tip calculator, calculator, scheduler and a Countdown Timer.  I love the timer cuz you can set it count down from as much as 99 hours or as little as 1 second.For those who are counting the minutes during a call, there's also a \"minutes alert\" that makes a beep 10 seconds before the next minute begins.The phone feels very lightweight but durable.  It has an attractive shell and the buttons inside are pretty well layout and the display is crisp and clean.  Oh I forgot to mention that there are screen savers, wallpaper and color screens to choose from as well.I have no problem with the batteries pooping out too soon so I guess they have fixed the battery problem.  To save battery consumption, by default, there is an \"energy saving mode\" for the display and keys set to on and durations set to \"7 seconds.\"  The instruction says that the display will dim slightly at the set time.  However, I noticed little difference in the brightness (or dimness) of the display, however, the keys do turn off at the set time.On the other hand, when I turn off the \"energy saving mode\", the screen becomes very very bright.  After the set time (7 seconds) the display dims to the level of brightness describe in previous paragraph and the keys turn off.The reason I am mentioning this is because most of the cellphones I've seen have display dimmers that are so dark you can't really see anything once the dimmer kicks in.  This phone actually have a dimmer that's bright and yet, in my experience so far, saves battery consumption.I don't think I've mentioned every feature of this phone but for the price, I give it 5 stars!Oh yea... I thought I would miss the front subscreen but I don't.  I no longer have to worry about scratching or dirtying the shell anymore.  :D", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best value for money out there", "Author": "Duncan C.

I had the phone run down quickly once and quickly realized that if you close the phone on a select few functions it doesnt turn off the screen. It maybe a slight knock on the phone but if you simply look at it you can tell if the screen is on or not. If it is just reopen it and close it and the screen will turn off. As far as the phone itself it has a few games a few ringtones and a few images. You can buy more, but frankly I dont care. You can set it to vibrate or to vibrate and have a ringtone. It has plenty of functions for a inexpensive phone, such as web access, texting, speakerphone. The best part of the phone however is the quality of the calls, my relatives have these ridiculously expensive phones with cameras and doo-dads and they sound like you're talking inside a toilet.

I wouldn't reccomended this phone to a 40 or 50 year old male business man, it's not really for them. This phone is good for teenagers, and young adults.

In general it performs well: nice loud ring and earpiece, clear microphone, contacts (address book) easy enough to use, display is colorful and sharp. Earpiece volume is easy to control, even in the middle of a call, with buttons on the side of the phone that fall naturally to hand. It does not support AIM (instant messaging) or picture messaging. It is a real bargain at $30 including shipping. The keys are mostly large and easy to use, except I find the Back key to be a bit small but still usable. I have not used the speakerphone or web browser on the phone so can't comment on them, except to say that I prefer the Oystr's dedicated speakerphone button to the menu-based Nokia system.It took me a while to find out how to put email addresses in the phone book for use in text messaging. It doesn't say in the product manual, either, but if you just keep pressing the down button (the one just below the OK button on the 4-way controller) you go through several possible phone numbers for a person, then get to both email addresses and web URLs.The battery life is disappointing, which is why I gave the phone just 4 stars instead of 5. I think that the firmware controlling backlighting and keypad lighting is buggy. The main screen's backlight stays on all the time the phone is open, and I don't think it should. Even worse, the keypad lighting was on all the time until I disabled it from the settings  --> display --> backlight --> duration menu. Until I disabled this I got only one day per charge, even with no use of the phone. Now I get at least two days, maybe more, but I don't like to run it down all the way so I am not sure how long it would really last.I didn't like any of the ring tones included with the phone. So I invested $2 in a new one that I like very much, \"Old Telephone 1\". Obviously just a matter of taste; I like a loud, natural-sounding ring. I didn't much like the default wallpaper or screen saver either, but disabling the screen saver and changing to plaid wallpaper made the phone much easier to look at.Virgin Mobile has increased their offerings in both by-the-minute and monthly charges. I am a very light user, so the by-the-minute offers appeal to me the most, but their $7/month + 10c/minute offer is also good for me, especially during months when I expect to use the phone almost every day. Sprint network coverage (Virgin's provider) is OK in my area, but be sure to check out your coverage before you get a Virgin phone. There is no roaming allowed, you use Sprint or you get no service.In conclusion, I think that the Oystr is a good basic phone, nicely designed and sized, well-suited for phone calls and text messaging. Its one flaw is buggy backlighting, which leads to reduced battery life. Turn off the backlighting as much as possible and the battery will last a few days, so it isn't a deal-breaker. Compared to my previous Virgin phone, a Nokia Shorty, I think the quality is similar, but the design (flip phone vs candy bar) is better. The Shorty had a different flaw, a bug that would cause it to turn itself off at random times once a month or so, and also a possible bug in the charging system that sometimes caused the battery not to recharge fully. The Oystr's bug is much easier to live with.", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "I'm the original poster Denise who reviewed this item and I'm re-writing my original review", "Author": "Denise", "ReviewID": "R3I51IQENGP9PC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!The phone has a lot of great features but because it doesn't hold a battery charge what good is it?We're going back to Tracfone.

The phone I bought another from from a co worker that was the same phone and was hoping that the phone would still be serviced. I had 200-400 contacts on it and was told that it was a privacy issue why they could not transer the contacts from one oyster phone to the other. Everyone I called gave me a different answer. I looked on a website and found out that HIPPA with Too much privacy was the reason why Virgin Mobile told me that. When today I took the phone into a store they tried to use some kind of machine to plug it in to retrive all my contacts and could not because the machine told them the phone had been discontinued by Virgin Mobile. I thought that if there were still some Oyster phones out there they had to service them prepaid or not. Now I have this phone and no way to get my contacts from phone 1 to phone number 2. I did not do anything to make the phone go dead and make the digital readout go out. Found out today from a friend who knows cell phones that at any time if a phone is discontinued by the company they will not even try to get your contact list transferred over. They sold me another phone today because I am not technology inclinded because I am 55 years old called a MS-40 by Samsung and am not convinced that the contacts will be transferrable in this phone and know that they will not be. I am putting it in a notebook and writing them all down because if this new phone is taken off the market or discontinued then they are not even going to try to help me and are going to say like they did today that privacy laws prevent them from getting my contacts off that phone. Greed and the advancing technology by the second has made the cell phone companies get people to buy another phone every year by their contacts not being able to be transferred over because if that cell phone is not in that machine there is nothing on God's green earth that will get your contact list back EVER. I hate your Virgin Mobile for not caring and saying it is privacy's falt when it is GREED's falt for why you have decided NOT to help me the customer since 2008. I hate your guts. I wish I would have never bought this phone knowing that my contact list within a few years would be gone. I am not convinced that this new Samsung phone is going to be transferrable either even if they told me this in the store because of so many lies that customer service has told me and got a different answer from 8 different customer reps why they would not transfer my service from one phone to another and it took 8 calls to do it and why they could not transfer my contact list. Virgin Mobile sucks and I did not ask for you to discontinue this phone because the SIMM card reader software said on the screen to the clerk in the store that this phone I could not have my contacts.

I had no problems for those five months and the battery life was nothing like what other people were experiencing.

If you live in an area with bad signal, it will deplete the battery faster then normal, just like a laptop when you are using the internet, the wireless (because it's always searching for signal) will make the battery life less.Overall, the features of the phone are basic, can download ringtones, graphics and that's about it.

I've tried a few times to get 2 of Vanessa Carlton's ring tones from her 2007 album. I definitely sent the text and got no response. I've gotten ONE response when I tried to get a Keyshia Cole ring tone and followed the directions to find out this silly phone isn't compatible.Ugh. I'm an avid music fan and I just couldn't understand why it doesn't allow other ring tones to be applied. So that let me down SO much. But in college I wasn't really concerned with that stuff. I just needed it to keep in touch with my ride home and to call a few people every now and then. No texting whatsoever. That didn't hit me till later!But I was glad that you had the option of buying the Virgin time cards almost anywhere instead of one of those expensive service plans!! And I hear it's a HUGE mistake ordering them from amazon! A lot of people have been complaining that the phone cards here expire about a month after you get it or have ALREADY expired by the time you get it! So, so wrong.Although it's been there for me there are many problems such as while it's charging (and on) you can't turn it off without unplugging it first. Tell me why that is? I'm sure other cell phones aren't like that!2.75 stars (is my final rating, weighing the good and bad).Edit: recently i just tried turning it off while charging, and it went blank. also, like i said the only time that i successfully downloaded a ring tone was through the phone itself (from Virgin). it does its job mostly, but surely other phones do it better (and with less trouble)!", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Oystr -- flashy color flip phone with very poor battery life", "Author": "Jared \"Jared\"", "ReviewID": "R143KDQXCVLZBR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has a great color screen, good sounds and animated screen savers.

Well, it all started when I laid my eyes on the Net10 C139. Well, I ordered it [from Amazon, provided by Target] and well, I heard about it and thought it was nice..and all. So then it was gonna come to me on my Birthday well a bit after [exactly Aug.31.] and the day before I checked. Well, guess what? They told me it would come on September 27, then In October 30, so I decided automatically to cancel it. I went to radio shack, and well my mom showed me the Oystr, and I didnt like it much. Still, I bought it and I really like it.Its very durable, dropped it once not even a dent, and no scratches. I like the color because it does not get too sloppy, and the paint does not chip off. Its hard stuff, and the numbers are easy to press.It has great features. Voice dialing when you say a phone number, calculator, tip calculator, voice memo, and other nice stuff. The design is pretty unique, it does not have a camara, but still, years ago there was not camara, and I would not use it much so it does not matter, plus its a nice economical telephone. I mean you can actually go on this internet thingy and download wallpapers, 'tones, and games [even more!].The reception is really sweet. I live around the mountains and it sounds perfectly. Reaching the people of the virgin mobile company was a bit hard, I waited 10 minutes to reach someone. Still, they are nice people and they are easy to understand. Nice thing was that reaching them was free.Overall, it was really nice. Nice design, but it has its pros and cons. I didnt want to write a lengthy review, but well hopefully it helps a bit. Since I have only had it for a day, cant say much but please look foward to updates!-Lydia", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed...", "Author": "A Long-time VM Customer", "ReviewID": "R27CVD48ZPQFJL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just purchased the Kyocera Oystr today. Everything seemed to be wonderful until I downloaded two 'superphonic' ringtones for my new phone ('Snow' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 'Plush' by STP). The sound quality of these ringtones is horrible. I previously used the Audiovox 'Vox' 8610, and the exact same ringtones on the Vox sounded great. However, on the Oystr, the ringtones sound very fuzzy and garbled. On my old 'Vox' these ringtones are crystal clear. I now want to switch back to my old 8610, but I am having trouble doing so online. I only hope that I will be able to get my money back from the Oystr. The Vox may not have many special features, capabilities, or extras, but at least my ringtones sound crystal clear.", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "EXTERNAL LCD SCREEN\nPAY AS YOU GO WITHOUT CONTRACTS\nBLUETOOTH/WIRLESS/WEB BROWSING/RINGTONES\nMONTHLY PLANS WITH OUT CONTRACT", "Name": "KYOCERA OYSTR PREPAID VIRGIN MOBILE CELL PHONE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31FB0NWAX3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000H84CFY"}}
