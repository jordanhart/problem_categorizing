Was unable to get this problem resolved.For the most part am very pleased with the phone.  My only serious disappointment is my inability to Sync, however that may be unique to myself.  Am very pleased with the extent of service by Nokia technical support in providing guidance and support, and appreciate the Nokia website which offers various extras (software and other downloads) free of charge when other manufacturers expect you to purchase some of the same options to fully utilize the features of their phones.I also commend Amazon.com customer and wireless services personnel for their attentiveness and dedication to true customer service!", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Five stars and worth every one!", "Author": "Chris Swanson \"I'm just this guy, you know?\"", "ReviewID": "RTEL1IGCLU9V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia 5310, aka \"The Music Xpress\", is one nifty little phone!

I don't want a phone, I want an extension to my computer.  If life happens and I will miss a meeting I want the numbers and contact information so that I can reschedule my life on the fly.  Apple get this.  Nokia sells tons and tons of phones, yet they seem to be too busy to do one phone to completion.  I have contemplated moving to the iPhone like my wife but the size and capabilities of this phone keep me from making the leap.What I like about this phone:1) Size: Nothing beats the size.  You don't even know you have a phone on you.2) Bluetooth: This phone support file transfer and stereo headsets.  Two things the iPhone can't do.3) Cut and Paste: Basic functionality that I have come to expect that is missing on the iPhone. This phone support cut and paste4) Sound: This things sounds great with apple ear buds!  And it has decent sound without a headset (remember it is like 7mm thin)5) battery:  At the end of the day my battery is still full.  Last month I talked on the phone all day.  Took and over night train to shanghai.  I listened to music on the train and then talked the next day on the phone.  Amazing!6) AAC support:  This phone can play unencrypted AAC files from iTunes.What I don't like...1) Wont sync with Mac.  Worse yet People on the net say creating a sync profile is easy!  So why doesn't Nokia do it!!!1.a) won't sync with iCal (very important)1.b) Won't sync with Address Book (very important)1.c) Won't sync with iTunes (less important)Nokia, Apple is eating your lunch.

I just needed something with simple web browsing ability and all the basic functions of a cell phone.

This phones meets and exceeds my expectations as far as features go.  Came with a 2GB chip which I found impressive.  The phone works well, reception is good, bluetooth works perfectly with my blueant, web browsing is fast as heck for a little phone not really designed for it.  Overall, I'm very happy with the phone.  The only down side for me is that the buttons are a little small and not separated enough so I often push the wrong buttons when texting.  The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of five is because some of the menu systems are a little funky and go against logic.

Williams \"j_bird\"", "ReviewID": "R1WHZ8H9W4G19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use to be a cell phone junky before it was trendy to have the latest and greatest phone.  When cell phones started to become fashionable (the Razer) is when I backed away from always having the newest model. I have owned phones from every manufacture who has phones in the US.  I wanted a new phone, something solid, but not overly expensive.  The 5310 is a very nice phone, if it had a few things more I would say almost perfect. The phone's very small, and feels real solid in your hand. It's not heavy, but it's not light either.  It's almost too thin, but doesn't slip out of my hand.  The speaker on it is pretty good, not as loud as a Nextel, but it's pretty clear. Much better than most other phones on the market. Battery life isn't great, but look how small this phone is.  I think Nokia has it rated somewhere around 5 1/2 hours of talk time. I don't know how much I get, but the battery icon seems to diminish pretty quick. But for how thin this phone is I'm not complaining at all. BTW I have the white/gray version. Same exact phone, just a diffent color. You don't see many white phones and I think it looks good. Supports stereo bluetooth, which is nice. I love hearing my ring tones on my headset.  Voice commands work reasonably well. I don't use them for anything except calling people.  Call quality is pretty good, the built in speaker is loud, and the speakerphone is loud too. Reception isn't as good as my Blackberry Pearl, not bad by any means though.There are some big issues with it, for me. 1 being the menus, they're ugly. the resolution of the screen is good, the colors on pictures are fantastic. The icons for the menus look horrible. You can download, or even make your own themes. But the default ones suck badly. You have this incredibly sexy phone, with a cheap cheap cheap looking user interface.  Making your own with Nokia's software isn't exactly easy either. The phone supports Flash Lite, but I don't know if it supports Flash Lite themes or just screen savers. If it supports themes like my Sony Ericcson w810i, I take back my comment about the ugly UI :)Another issue, it has a USB port, but you cannot charge the phone thru it, So when I hook it to my PC I have to hook up the charging cable too.  Seems pointless to have the Nokia charging port on the side when the USB one would work great. I dunno why they didn't do this :(What I like:Size, feel, keypad feels good. Has a standard headphone jack, and comes with a 1gb MicroSD card. I already own an iPod Touch so I don't need tons of storage. But I still like to have some to play around with. Also has an FM radio, which could be considered a minus to some since you need to carry around a connector (antenna) if you want the radio to work.The price is right on this phone, if Nokia was to release a phone that looks like this built off the s60 platform I'd jump on it in a minute.

The headphone jack is standard 3.5.  The speaker is loud.  It's also tough...I've dropped it dozens of times and nothing has broken.  Maybe a little speaker buzz on occasion, but that's not surprising considering the hits it's taken.It does everything else well, and has some useful little Apps...converters, calculators, calendars and so on.Here's what I don't like:During phone calls, many people have complained about the noise on their end. Apparently, every little movement is magnified, so if I move around just a little it sounds to the listener like I'm standing in a hurricane.Also, and I know this sounds ridiculous, it's so small and light that it slips out of my hand if I'm being careless.  Thus the frequent drops.  If you have large hands it's probably not going to be the most ergonomic phone for you.Lastly, the external music buttons are fairly pointless.  If you have it in lock mode you can't use them until you unlock the phone.

This Nokia basically made my ipod a fashion accessory - why carry a mobile and an ipod if mobile offers most of ipod's functions?There is also a camera - good enough to take pictures which will show on the screen to let you know who is calling and snapshots but their quality is only a little above acceptable so don't throw away your camera before you check it out thoroughly - and a radio, a nice addition (headphones, naturally included) although you should be prepared to recharge the battery quite often if you're addicted to listening all the time.In short - if you're shopping for small, sleek, light mobile phone with all the basic functions plus some added musical ones, this is your perfect choice.

Awsome phone. It's small and thin, you can hardly tell you have a phone in your pocket. I went the unlocked version too, so all I had to do was just slip my sim card in it, and I was ready to roll!It comes with many great fetures such as an organizer, bluetooth ect...It comes with a 2.0 Mp camera/video recorder. The camera is good, it snaps a clear pictures, but it's sort of slow after you snap the picture when saving it. The video recorder is just your standar vga recorder. That's alright, I hardly take videos.It comes with a 30 mgs of internal memory, but you can add a memory card (up to 4 megs worth). It already comes with a 2 meg card, but bought a 4 meg card and I still haven't even filled it up, and I put a lot of music in it!Now for the MP3 player: It's AWSOME!!! It comes with MP3 player controls on the side if the screen too, which I thought was cool. So the phone can be on standby and you can continue to listen to music, just use the controls for it. The speakers are LOUD! So this phone can bump music!This phone also comes with a built in FM radio! Now that's cool. So if your not in the mood to listen to your MP3s, just swtch on the radio. But you will need to hook up some headphones for that though. No worries, the phone has a 3.5 mm jack for REGULAR head phones, like the ones you use on a ipod or cd player. And to top it off it comes with some headphoes as well, with an microphone adapter for it as well if you want to go hands free.It also comes with other accesories such as a 2 mg memory card and a USB cable, which is kinda cool. Most of my other hones I had never came with that cable so I would have to go out and buy it, but with this phone, it comes with it!Last thing is the battery life. I had the Samsung Gravity for T-Mobile before, but that phone's battery hardly lasted me a day. I'd take it to work and by the end of the day, it was on it's last bar. I swear, I'd just use it for 15 minutes and half the battery life wiuld go!But the battery on the Nokia Xpress seems to last longer. I have been using it all morning long listening to the mp3 player as I type this and it's still at a full bar.Over the Nokia Xpress Music is a great phone with many great features and accesories.

It's slim and light and has the Nokia UI which I like.  Battery life, however, isn't quite as good as I would have liked.  I would have sacrificed some thickness for more battery, but it's generally okay.  With bluetooth on, I get about 2 full days before recharging.

I WISH I COULD LISTEN TO THAT ON MY BLUETOOTH INSTEAD OF THE EAR PIECE. I DIDN'T GIVE FIVE STAR BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE I HAD, HAD A SHORTAGE, IT KEPT TURNING IT SELF OFF AND FREEZING, LUCKLY IT HAPPEN THE FIRST DAY THAT I HAD IT, SO I EXCHANGE IT FOR THE SAME KIND, AND THIS ONE IS AMAZING,I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.
