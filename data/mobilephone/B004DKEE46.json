The look and feel of the phone was better than I expected. The settings are pretty basic but OK. I am travelling in the US and ordered this phone because my HTC desire phone I brought with me from overseas had problems. The Samsung t349 was supposed to be unlocked but tried two sim cards from two different carries and both failed. For one sim card it said 'wrong card' and the other it said 'sim crash'.
