{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone that easily fits in my shirt pocket!", "Author": "M. Tezel", "ReviewID": "R7WOYX861RA60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why is there a lack of high end small smartphones? This phone has Ice Cream Sandwich Android, but only a 3 meg outward camera with no light. I really wish it had a compass and a slightly larger battery but I still love it anyway. I would consider it a middle-of-the-road between low end and high end. You'd be hard-pressed to find an equivalent size smartphone with the screen specs of this one and not everybody carries a purse for their giant pads. Some of us are men with tiny pockets! Tipo fits the bill and I got the dual sim version to boot (other countries always get the really cool smartphones from the same manufacturers). I am still winding down calls from my old prepaid TMobile-To-Go sim (full size sim) while giving people my new number on AT&T; (full size sim). It is neat to see which carrier has a better signal and some comfort in knowing I have access to two separate networks.It has passive dual sims. This means you manually select which sim you want to call out on. You can setup phone settings to only use network data on one sim or alternate sims or split between times of the day. The sim switch is right below the volume so I accidentally hit it at least once per day, then purposely hit it again to switch back to my main sim. The phone will receive calls on either sim at any time unless you are already on a phone call, in which case, it disables the other sim during that call.How's it run? I've had the phone almost a month and now run Apex Launcher and MagicLocker (very popular android apps) without any major issues. Only the home key has stopped responding as defined by Apex but that seems to be common with that launcher on other manufacturer phones too. I setup a gesture to open the same app as I defined for the home key, so no worries there (home key is not permanently broken). The proximity sensor works for on/off, it isn't high end enough to determine a more accurate distance. I usually end around 30% battery left at the end of the day using live wallpaper and an app that turns off wifi/data when the screen is off so it only updates when I'm actually using the phone. I don't talk much on it but have been trying different apps so I equate the cpu-battery usage about the same. For the given specs, this phone gets a 5 star rating for being a good mid-range smartphone.I would not hesitate to buy another phone off the web again from a good manufacturer. No place in town (one of the top 10 in the USA) do not even hardly carry Sony phones at all, maybe one store has one model, and it is not this model. And to manufacturers....there is a HUGE niche market in the USA for SMALL high-end smartphones!", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good compromise", "Author": "Pawel Danielewicz", "ReviewID": "R2T7HBVZU6N3SQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:- small, about the size of a dumb phone- light - might be lighter than a dumb phone- battery life nearly as good as for a dumb phone- two SIMs that can be separately set for voice/data services- OK GPS- Android 4.0.4- native email client that works fine w/MS Exchange 2010- OK sound- OK FM radio- decent Bluetooth- working tethering, both through USB and WiFi- truly unlocked - works with foreign SIMs- rooting w/o a glitch- significant on-line user communityCons:- cramped keyboard in portrait- little of screen left above keyboard in the landscape- no compass- no front-facing camera- no focus or optical zoom- tight memory- WiFi on the flaky side- sensitive to humidity- no Sony assistance outside of North America for st21a2If you waited for a smartphone until one became available where you would gain in functionality, beyond a dumb phone, without sacrificing in the phone's size and weight and not much in the battery life, this is the one for you.  It is about the size of my old dumb phone, a tad lighter and it retains 50-60% of battery life after 24h, even after stuffing it with plenty of apps.Like for many other products these days, a detailed User Guide in PDF may be pulled down from the manufacturer's site.  That Guide can also answer some questions you may have ahead of the considered purchase.  The box that my phone came in contained just a basic Startup Guide, besides a USB cable and a decent AC adapter.Note that a smartphone is a small computer, where the phone application (app) is just one among many apps running.  With more opportunities comes more responsibility.  Just like a PC, the smartphone needs to be maintained, with the prime responsibility falling onto the user, rather than Sony or Google. Bad updates can occur due to a poor connection or other incidents and the user needs to fix those.  Backups are advisable and the power button can be used for reboots.  If you are uncomfortable with computer maintenance, you should presumably stay away from a smartphone and stick with a dumb phone.The system allows for cut-and-paste, concurrent apps and for voice recognition.  The phone's GPS locator is in practice just a bit inferior than my separate state-of-the-art Bluetooth GPS unit.  The Bluetooth connection to that unit works pretty flawlessly, much better than for my netbook.  I have been successful using voice for communicating street destination.  Sound quality is reasonable.  Benefiting from the light weight, I commonly carry the phone around the house in my shirt pocket, or hanging from a lanyard, and working as an internet radio.  The WiFi connectivity is inferior relative to my netbook - when the WiFi signal deteriorates, the phone struggles keeping up.  At high humidity, such as after a rain, the screen can react capriciously to touch.  Wind can also be a factor.The memory on the phone is tight, but is alleviated by the relatively recent version of Android.  Still, you obviously need to get right away an external memory card, preferably at the 32GB maximum.  Not all memory is equal on the phone, but there is no point in occupying higher-level memory with stuff that can put into the lower level.  The Tipo comes with its internal space divided into the phone memory and sdcard. The external memory card slides somewhat inconveniently under the battery and is identified by the system as ext_card.  Getting the external card back out is cumbersome and is best done employing the end of a paper clip as a tool.  Rooting of the phone, yielding extra flexibility with the memory, went without a glitch.  Auto Memory Manager app allows to choose a more aggressive policy, than that the system's, of relieving system memory of the apps, producing a better compromise between the number of apps on the phone and the speed.  Installation of a couple of more apps, DirectoryBind (newer, better maintained app as of Sep '13 is FolderMount) and Link2SD (fat32/ext4 worked for me with the latter), both cumbersome to set up, allows to migrate to the external card, respectively, app data from the sdcard and apps themselves from the phone memory.  As a payback, the last effort in practice lifts any limit on the number of apps installed on the phone, without sacrificing speed.  The firmware seems to be more frequently updated for the international version of the phone, st21i2.  I eventually managed to flash the st21a2 phone with more up to date (11.0.A.6.5 instead of 11.0.A.1.12) st21i2 firmware, without any adverse effects, in particular without losing the US 3G service.  There is a significant on-line community of users providing advice on dealing with intricacies such as above.After you connect the phone to a PC, using a USB cable, the phone asks about installing software on the PC.  That software allows to synchronize contacts and transfer files.  For file transfer, the file manager apps exploiting WiFi are more convenient.  Tethering off the phone works fine for the data speeds characteristic for my location, both through USB and WiFi.The cramped keyboard makes it tight to type.  Entering of passwords can be particularly nightmarish.  To progress, you need to install the Swiftkey Keyboard.  The stylus rings txtRng:) speeds up typing better than a simple stylus pen.  The keyboard in combination with the Android system does not make this phone much of a production device.  However, I managed fine to read PDF books in the landscape orientation.  For refinements regarding screen orientation, get an app named Set Orientation.  Over time, your typing adjusts to the space and errors become rare.The native email client is basic, but by relying on native server synchronization service it could communicate fine with the Microsoft Exchange system of my workplace.  The native calendar app also exploits that service and can synchronize fine with either MS Exchange or Google Calendar.  The phone comes with 5 homescreens that fill up quickly.  Unfortunately third-party launchers are unable to use most of the native widgets and some functionality gets lost w/o any substitution, such as an on-screen switch for Bluetooth.  Fortunately, Folder Organizer saved the day, sparing the need for a new launcher.As a headset, I recommend the Sony's Smart Headset.  The smart controls pathetically do not work, at least with Xperia Tipo, but the sound is good. MH750 headset is also a possibility, but its sound is on the mediocre side.  With a headset or headphones plugged in, the phone can function as an FM radio, with an average sensitivity.  Connecting an externally powered speaker, with virtually no connecting cable, surprising provides sufficient antenna function.  The camera on the phone cannot focus, in particular on smaller bar codes, so getting an add-on lens, such as macro/wide-angle is practically a must.  There is no secondary camera facing to the front, nominally undermining Skype video calls.  The reality is though is that the phone lacks adequate processing power for handling the video calls.  They are likely to turn into hiccups if you attempt them.  Voice-only Skype calls work fine.The dual SIM design works.  You can receive phone calls and SMS-es on on phone numbers associated with both SIMs, but make calls and send SMS-es only on the SIM of your choice.  In my personal travel experience, the greatest benefit of the second SIM turned out to be in the fact that the foreign service providers often provide prepaid SIM cards with either the voice (basic phone) or data (tablet users) service emphasized, but not both.  When the latter turns out to be the case, I stick the cheap voice service card into one slot and the cheap data only card into the second.  Those prepaid cards tend to be valid for 1 month and the total cost unbelievably ends up usually being under $25.  On the internet, you can find info on the best deals for individual countries, ahead of any travel.When first time abroad, in China, and still lacking experience, I ran into a problem with the data service on the phone.  When I tried to consult the Sony Authorized Service about that issue, they refused to assist with the model (st21a2) marketed for North America.  In the end, the problem appeared to be tied to the APN setting imprinted (apparently on the first connection) and uneditable, from the US T-Mobile, there even for the SIM card from a Chinese provider.  As a warning, my attempt to edit the T-Mobile setting put the phone into some state where subsequent attempts to access the edited APN setting produced an error.  Rather than edit, you should add a new APN setting and best directly import one from the provider for the SIM card, under Settings>Xperia>Internet setting (Download setting for Internet and MMS).  I have since installed an app with a database of APN settings for all major providers around the world, that gets tapped automatically.Overall, this phone is a good compromise between size, weight and functionality.  We now have two of those phones in our household.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small and light, practical but a few limitations", "Author": "Robert Hoare", "ReviewID": "R29XJWVV2UA2E9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At the time of writing this review, Amazon shows two sizes for the phone: \"6 x 4.5 x 3 inches ; 9.3 ounces\" (that's the box) and \"3.4 x 2.2 x 0.4 inches\", which is incorrect (the error comes from the original Sony spec sheet).The actual size, shown correctly on some sites, is 103mm x 57mm x 13mm which converts to 4.06 x 2.24 x 0.51 inches.  It's still small, and nice and light.  Works well for those who want a phone-sized phone rather than a mini-tablet.Dual-sim is very handy, both sims on different networks are active to accept incoming calls and texts all the time (unless the other line is in use).  Outgoing network can  be selected for each call, but it's easier to change the default network with a quick press of the dedicated hardware button on the side (below the volume).  There's an indicator at the top of the screen showing the active network, and the signal strength of both networks.Either sim can access WCDMA (3G, UMTS), but only one at a time. If you activate 3G for one sim it'll make the other sim GSM only.  So not suitable if you need two 3G networks.Android 4.0.4 (can't be upgraded) works well on this phone, although due to the small screen size the text can be very fine on some apps. There's no compass, but the GPS gets a lock quickly and keeps it well, without using much battery power.The camera is, as I expected, very poor. No autofocus means it can't read bar codes which is a limitation (QR codes are OK).  This phone doesn't appear to be compatible with credit-card accepting devices from Square or Paypal, as far as I can tell from their sites.Battery life is good for a smartphone, a couple of days with wi-fi on and moderate use.  Removeable battery is a big plus.  There are some random reboots, for a reason I've haven't yet found, but they've been quite rare.This has replaced my Nokia E51, so I now have access to Android apps with a fairly similar size and weight to my old featurephone.

Well it isn't very big, but I have fairly large hands and have never felt it was too small to use as a smart phone. And while the camera is absolutely terrible and it has no flash this is a $150 phone, I think this is a fair compromise to make to hit the desired price point. The speakerphone is surprisingly loud and clear; much better than any phone I've had to date.Unfortunately, when I plug headphones into this phone I mostly hear a lot of snaps and crackles and the voices I'm hoping to hear sound like they are coming from a speaker submerged in pool in the far distance. The higher the volume is turned up the less of a problem this is, so if you only use the phone in very loud environments (construction sites, rocket testing grounds, etc), or have significant hearing impairment, this might not be an issue.

Having owned the phone now for a year, I'm still very happy with my purchase.Dual-SIM Functionality: Thus far, I've experienced no problems switching between the my SIM cards.Portability: The Tipo is thin enough to slip into pant pockets easily and comfortably.  At about 9 oz., the Tipo is also fairly lightweight - great for those who don't like being bogged down with heavy objects when on the go.Battery Life: No complaints here - but YMMV.  I can usually go without a charge for at least three days as I don't use apps for long periods of time (less than a hour a day), and I tend to keep my Wi-Fi off unless I need it to browse the web.Price: For a mid-tier Dual-SIM phone, the Tipo is fairly priced, and strikes a good balance between its price and the features offered.Screen Issues: The Tipo's screen doesn't respond very well in cold weather, and it sometimes glitches and misinterprets the user's input - especially if you opt to use the Pattern Screen Lock feature.  This may sound worrisome, but I discovered a quick fix for these screen glitches - simply press the power button on top of the Tipo twice, and the screen issue should resolve itself immediately.Music Library Issues: The default music library takes an extremely long time to compile its internal memory after adding a song to the phone, regardless of whether the song is stored on the phone itself or stored on a memory card.  I'm surprised no other reviewers have mentioned this issue yet, as it could potentially be very troublesome or frustrating.  The compiling time could take upwards of 10 minutes (closer to 20 minutes when adding multiple songs).  While compiling, you cannot listen to any of your music!  As I mainly use the Tipo for apps and calls, a slow-compiling music library is a minor grievance I have come to accept.  That said, I can see this issue being a deal-breaker for consumers who expect quick load times for their devices.Durability: The Tipo has survived many drops and the screen is still relatively scratch free.  However, the top shell of the phone is  flaking and chipping away away with each drop, revealing a white plastic layer underneath - not the most attractive phenomenon.

All the features are working great, and most of all, is unlocked. You can just get a pay as you go and enjoy a smartphone without having to drop 70 dollars a month for a subscription.Keep in mind that without a data plan you loose a lot of features, but if you just need a smart phone to make calls, and can send email and surf the web while on wifi, this is the device for you.Highly recommended for anyone that needs a lightweight device, to play games and run apps, without the hassle to get a new galaxy or iphone with a very expensive monthly bill.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nicest \"cheap\" phone for American on 1 month visit to France. Three phone comparison.", "Author": "M. Williams \"FrequentFlierGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R3U2U2ZDE1DYA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Basic conclusions for the three phones discussed below, as well as some travel tips:Sony- nicest screen and camera, has dual SIMs.  If you need dual SIMs, this is by far the best phone for the money that I found.  The charger handles both US and European voltages for charging (like almost all phone/computer chargers), but it only came with US plug, so need a European plug adaptor (should be $5 or less).LG- Basic, reliable phone. about 1/3 cheaper than the Sony and Samsung models I looked at.  The LG phone was the only one that came with an adaptor for both US and European (not UK) electrical outlets.Samsung- No reason to buy this phone.  Similarly priced Sony phone was superior in every way. The charger handles both US and European voltages for charging, but it only came with US plug, so need a European plug adaptor (should be $5 or less).In a nutshell, these are small form factor smart phones (think palm of your hand) that use old (but inexpensive) technology to deliver very basic smartphone performance (not good for games). The main upside for the Sony phone turned out to be better screen resolution and brightness and a better camera than similar price/size phones.  The other advantage is that it is sold directly by Amazon, which means more reliable shipping times and very little chance of getting a knock-off, or used or refurb phone that wasn't properly disclosed.I purchased three different \"smart phones\" for a recent family trip to France (Paris and Nice, and some side trips), and I will compare them here.  They were the Sony Xperia Tipo Dual-SIM ST21A2 Phone (about $129), a Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102 ($127), and LG P350 Optimus Me ($89).All are unlocked GSM quad band phones, which is what you need for pre-paid service in Europe (LTE smart phones are still expensive, so not part of this discussion).  For a tourist, pre-paid service is the cheapest route, and you don't get any unexpected charges.  Using your US phone with an \"international\" plan is really expensive in my experience, especially for data.I wanted basic smartphone functionality, which included wifi, GPS, email, texting, and voice.  Didn't really care about the camera and wasn't willing to pay up for a phone to play games on (can use your US phone with Wifi for that anyway).  I have looked at the cheaper voice only or legacy feature phones, but they aren't that inexpensive (usually $30-$50) and seem to have reliability issues for the really cheap ones. Plus, if you think about how you are likely use a phone in a foreign country, being able to pull up a maps screen and pinpoint your location and find nearby food, medical, etc is a huge benefit. Also, for texting I wanted a keyboard, not a legacy phone keypad.All three phones performed their tasks reliably and competently.  The GPS is especially helpful when you are overseas and don't speak the langauge.  The GPS also efficiently integrated with Google Maps on all three phones, which meant I could use the full Google search engine to find restaurants or store places (useful if you switch phones and log in under your Google ID).One difference among the three phones was that the Sony and Samsung were dual SIM, while the LG was single SIM.  The SIM card is what lets you use a particular carrier's service and provides your phone's phone number, etc.  Having dual sim cards would let you switch between carriers without opening your phone, removing the battery, and also keeps you from losing the other sim card when you aren't using it.  I just used one sim card per phone on this trip, but if you were driving though different countries in Europe or wanted a separate data provider, you might want to have dual sim cards.If I didn't need dual SIM cards, I would just go with the LG phone b/c it had all the functionality I needed at the lowest cost.  The Sony phone is much nicer, though.  The Samsung phone was basically identical to the LG phone in terms of functionality, but it had an extra SIM slot.Also, battery life was great on all three phones.  When out and about, I typically turn WiFi off so the phone doesn't waste battery looking for wifi, so this helps.  But I run GPS pretty much the whole day.  I also set the screen to turn off on the shortest possible interval.  Doing this I got about two days of use (a lot of texting, emailing, moderate maps use, not a lot of voice usage) out of a single charge.  If you use a tone of battery, all three phones have a removable battery, so you could order an extra and keep it with you, but I don't see that as a huge problem.A note on signing up for service:I did try ordering a SIM from Orange from Amazon before I left.  This was a waste of time and much more expensive than doing it in France at an Orange store (I know b/c I went to the Orange store in Paris).  The Amazon SIM was $29.99 and included about five Euro of benefit- i.e. you are paying $25 for the physical SIM card, and then you have to go online and sign up for a calling plan.If you visit one of the many Orange (or another carrier's) stores in France, here is what I paid- For twenty Euro I got a SIM card with unlimited voice and texting for the month plus 150 mb of data and a five Euro credit.  I also paid ten Euro for an extra 500mb of data.  So for 30 Euro, I got unlimited voice and texting, plus a five Euro credit and 650mb of data during my stay.Also, rate for using your cell to call to the US was 0.09 Euro cents per minute, so the five Euro credit gave you almost an hour of calling back to the states.  The phone data plans do not allow you to use cellular data for skype, but you can use wifi to skype.To recap- buying a SIM card in the US- $29 and you get only a five Euro credit.buying the SIM card in France- 30 Euro and you get a five Euro credit plus unlimited voice, texting, and 650mb of data.If you must have a working phone when you land, you should order the SIM in the US and get it set up before you leave, but if you can wait until you check in to your hotel and then go to the Orange store it is a much better deal.  Also, I never found any SIM vending machines at the Paris airport (CDG), though I see them all the time at Heathrow.One more note- if you use an android phone, when you set it up, make sure you disable automatic and background refreshes (unless you really want them :-)  I went through 500mb of data in two weeks because of Android refreshes, and that was with WiFi on in my condo (I do self catering lodging in Europe).One more note- if you visit the Orange store in France, make sure you walk through the process of how to \"recharge\" your phone's plan in case you need to buy data.  You basically enter #123 on the phone, then follow some menus in French and enter your code.  But there are no English menus, so if you want to be self-sufficient, get them to show you at the store.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R1PUFIEP7KNKW9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone in Jan. 2013.

This model is very close in size to the Pearl, so it will fit in my pocket, meaning there is little chance I will lose it.Based on my initial experience I would have given it five stars.  Here are some of the high points:- It easily accepted the T-Mobile SIM from my Blackberry for voice calls, and the T-Mobile SIM from my wi-fi hotspot for data.- It's not 4G but I have clocked downloads at 200KB/s when using the 3G service. I believe it's using 3G when you see an H above the signal-strength bars.  This is undocumented, though.  The user manual only mentions E for EDGE and 3 for 3G, not H.- All apps I've downloaded from the Google Play store seem to work as advertised.  I'm particularly pleased with mapFactor, a free navigation program that uses downloadable maps, so you don't lose navigation when travelling through dead zones.  It's much better, for my purposes, than Google Maps.After a couple weeks though, I've had some problems with the phone.  Here are the major drawbacks:- Rebooting.  If you leave it sitting in one place where the signal strength is adequate, and it's hooked up to a charger, it will run forever.  But who buys a mobile to use it that way?  You take it with you, right?  I live in an area where cell service is hit-and-miss.  When the phone loses the cell signal, it reboots without warning.  Fortunately it comes back up in just about a minute (vis 3-5 minutes for my old Blackberry) and the audio player apps I use all remember where they left off so I can resume listening.  I've decided to put the phone in Airplane Mode whenever I might be driving through dead zones.  That seems to alleviate the problem, but I shouldn't have to do that.- Audio output.  With headphones it seems to work fine.  However, I also use a cassette adapter to listen to audio from the phone in my car.  When I plug the cable from the cassette adapter into the phone and try to play an audio file, it squeals like a teakettle on full boil.  The squealing stops a few seconds after I hit stop on the phone, so I know the phone is the problem.***UPDATE: I solved the squealing problem by soldering a couple 100 Ohm resistors across the audio leads to my cassette adapter.  Apparently the headphone output needs to see a 100 Ohm load for proper termination.Would I buy this phone again?  Yes, it is a good value for money.  If I had more money, though, I would have no problem bypassing this phone and getting something better.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst phone I've ever purchased and I've had some bad ones.", "Author": "Morgan Smith", "ReviewID": "R3CMT3619ZHCR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is excellent if you never leave a wifi area.

It is a very pricey loud alarm clock.My suggestion... if you never get past your front door for any reason and have a strong wifi connection, this would be a great choice.  If you would like a loud alarm clock, this would be a great choice.  If you want a phone that receives data of any kind and you aren't located near wifi constantly, this would be a horrible choice.
