Over all I really like this phone and would buy it again.  But, there are some faults that many might not like.Likes - size (smaller than most smart phones and fits in my front pocket), It's mostly just a phone (with an MP3 player and camera) I don't need or want a smart phone, it's lasted 2 1/2 years and going.Dislikes - the charger connector and head phone connector (I have had many issues making sure the Sony connector is connected and charging, need to clean the terminal with a small brush and jiggle and press it into place. You cannot use a standard headphone to listen to music. Keys might be small for some if you text a lot.  Uses a Sony micro SD card, not the standard micro SD.Overall - I will buy another one because it works for my needs, and lasted way beyond the other cell phones in my household.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001TA5TCY"}}
