But when I got the phone the battery part where you can tell if its been wet or not was red so it had been wet, then on the inside it was pretty torn up which doesnt mean anythings wrongwith the way it works but scares me for how it will work later.I should have read through the whole things because the title is New Blackberry Curve, but the content states it is basically refurbished...which is fine but I wouldnt have paid $50 for a refurbished phone I would have paid $32....which is how much the average one is on here for that exact phone.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mediocre Quality for a used product", "Author": "Ben M.
