I was deciding between this and the Samsung a530.  Both are small phones for the Verizon network.  I went for Nokia because of their reputation for simple phones.  This basic phone lasted me a good two weeks on stand-by without a recharge, given that I only make one or two calls for about a 2 minutes talk time.  This phone is paired with Verizon network.  I used this phone with Pageplus on a prepaid plan.  With today's technology, the market is saturated with the brick phones such as the iPhone, Galaxy, or the Note.  For me, I just need something small and compact for emergency calls.  And the Nokia Shade does just that.  I might go ahead and buy the Samsung a530 as well.  All we really need is a basic phone.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Shade 2705 for Verizon Wireless", "Author": "Monica", "ReviewID": "R212EWDYIQTUA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this new Nokia Shade for Verizon Wireless.
