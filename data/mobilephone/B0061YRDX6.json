Fits my needs perfectly!!!", "Author": "Lionel B.", "ReviewID": "R2KMNKWGXG00RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to updates I have tailored my review so readers can quickly spot what info/section will be most helpfull to them:Section I:  General Information (22 Nov 2011)Section II:  Some accessories: Chargers and Cases (24 Dec 2011)Section III: Data for T-Mobile Users (14 Jan 2012)Section IV: Some other 5\" Minitab phones (28 Feb 2012).Section V: Tidbits (07 Mar 2012)*****  Section I:  General Information (22 Nov 2011)  *****I have had my Galaxy Note for over a week now and have completely deserted my Nexus S. Concerns about size or whether it will fit in my pocket are long gone.  Any sense of what people may think when I hold it to my ear have completely disappeared and I hardly get any weird looks from anyone anyway except to ask to see the device and marvel over it.Pros: (Updated 3/21/12)- Fantastic specs.- Beautiful to behold.- Fast, fast, fast (1.4GHz Dual Core Processor).- 5.3\" HD Super AMOLED screen makes every thing easier to do and beautiful to look at.- Ideal phone for those who mostly text/chat/email/web but need to have phone capabilities handy (I use the Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset, Black which allows me to talk and still do stuff on the Note).- Excellent Battery life of 20 to 40 hrs (I recommend you first get a baseline of the battery life before you add too many apps. Watch especially the widgets you add, I have found a couple to be battery drainers).- Movies and pictures looks brilliant. As to be expected, movies will drain your battery faster.- Apps are more functional and a lot of fun to use.- A dream come true for frequent travelers as it will definitely reduce the number of devices you carry on trips. For example, I don't even travel with my kindle anymore as the kindle app is easy to read on the Note.- S pen (S Memo): Comes in handy for jotting down quick notes and lists. You can also share these notes via your favorite messaging app. A few days ago, I lost my s-pen; cost $30 to replace :( Samsung ET-S100EBEGSTA Stylus Pen for Galaxy Note with Samsung SGH-i717 - Data Cable - Retail Packaging - BlackCons: (Updated 12/31/11)- May not be ideal for those that spend the majority of their time talking especially because of its size. The advantage of the device is when you interact with it.- Only edge (2g) for T-mobile USA users. This may not be an issue if you spend the majority of your time in fast wifi environments. (See section III of the review for some information of data speeds).- It does feel fragile and I fear dropping it.- Web browsing hugs battery life. For example, visiting several web pages over a 10 min span reduced my battery life by 4 to 5%. My usual web use on an average day is about 30 minutes so I don't feel the drain that much (see comments for more details). Also, using the Note as a GPS with google maps is a big battery drain - be sure to use a good car charger when you do GPS over long distances.Conclusion:The Galaxy Note is a beautiful device in all ways and a big brother to the successful SGS2.  It now tops the small class of similar devices started by the Dell Streak (See Section IV for a list of some other 5\" devices).  These devices in the 5 to 6 inch category are not your classic smartphones or tablets so don't try to pigeon hole them into one of these extremes. You have to view the Note as we did the SUVs when they first came out.  The Note is a perfect fit for those who mostly text/chat/email/web and want phone calling capability. It is also a dream come true for travelers as it will definitely help reduce the number of devices you carry on trips.  It has quickly become my #1 device.***** Section II:  Some accessories: Chargers and Cases (24 Dec 2011) *****Accessories:** Phone Charger **:My phone came with a British 3-prong charger (Output 5V/1A) which I have since replaced as it is bulky and requires a US adapter. If you are looking for an American (US) style charger you can try one of these, all of which I have, and match exactly the 5V/1A output of the original charger:* Samsung USB Travel Adapter (ETAOU80JBE): (Updated 4 May 2012)Samsung OEM 1.0A Original Home Wall AC Travel Charger Adapter + USB 2.0 Data Sync Connect Transfer Charge CableAmazon now carries an original OEM adapter that works perfectly with the Note - yay!!!. It costs about $8, much cheaper than the 15 bucks I bought mine before it became listed on Amazon.* PowerGen 1000mA Heavy Duty USB Charger & USB Cable for Apple iPhone 4 4s / iPhone 3Gs 3G:The PowerGen cost me $6. This cube shaped charger has a similar feel and size to the Samsung charger above at less than half the price.* Power Bug & Cable -ipod/iphoneThe Power Bug charger costs about $9.  It is a bit bulkier that the other two above and has a glowing blue light around the usb port that some may find annoying. Other than that it is made by Phillips (a well known brand) and the outlet prongs fold in.I use all three chargers - one at home, one in the office, and one in my travel bag and have not had any issues with any of them.** Inexpensive Cases ** (updated 22 May 2012)The choices of cases to buy on Amazon are now so varied and numerous.  Several nice expensive case exist for around $40, however, if you are looking for something inexpensive but decent until the prices drop or want to try a range of product types before settling on a final expensive one, here are some inexpensive alternatives to try:* Samsung EFC-1E1COEGSTA AT&T; Galaxy Note i717 Flip Cover - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Orange: I got this free with my new note (old one was stolen).  The back replaces the original back so there is no added protection there. The flip cover is a nice concept and adds protection to the screen. It costs about $18. Reviews show it may not fit the ATT version.* Black S-Line Soft TPU Gel Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy Note / i9220 GT-N7000. I used this gel case with my old Note. It is very inexpensive ($2) and adds protection to the sides and back of the phone. It does take away some of the beauty of the phone (as any gel cover will do IMO, but you get a bit more comfort that your Note is more protected from drops.* elago G4 Slim Fit Case for at&t;, International Galaxy Note - (Soft Feeling) Black - ECO PACK. This hard gel case has a nice professional feel and costs $11. However it does not cover the top and bottom of the phone like the TPU case does.A few expensive alternatives to the above are:* elago G4 Handmade Genuine Leather for at&t;, International Galaxy Note - Folder type* Melkco - Samsung Galaxy Note / GT-N7000 / i9220 Ultra Slim Handmade Premium Genuine Cowhide Leather Case Jacka Type Face Cover Book Type Black* elago G4 Handmade Genuine Leather for at&t;, International Galaxy Note - Bar type***** Section III: Data for T-Mobile Users (14 Jan 2012) *****This is some info for those that want the Note but have to stay on T-Mobile and can't switch to AT&T.;  I have collected some data speeds around my area (I am sure this will vary from area to area).  I am fortunate that T-mobile is testing 3g/H+ on their 1900MHz band in my area (around Oxford Valley Mall, Fairless Hills PA) but not my home :(.Here's the data I collected:TYPE ... PLACE ..... PING ..... DOWNLOAD ...... UPLOADEdge ... Home ...... [385 ms] .. [199 kbps] .... [195 kbps]3g ...... Town ...... [50 ms] ... [2,009 kbps] .. [1,108 kbps]H+ ...... Town ...... [119 ms] .. [5,866 kbps] .. [1,240 kbps]WiFi .... Home ...... [36 ms] ... [19,658 kbps] . [11,237 kbps]As you can see, Edge is pretty slow. Since, I am with WiFi 95% of the time (at home and in the office) I do not feel the disadvantages of Edge that much and I do  get 3g/H+ in some areas when I am in town. So IMO if you are around fast wifi the majority of the time, and have to stay on T-mobile, the Note is still a great phone to have.  For those that want additional info on the areas that t-mobile is testing 3g/H+ on the 1900MHz band used by the Galaxy Note, please see Howard Forums under the T-mobile section \"Post here if you have noticed 1900MHz 3G on an iPhone or other device\".***** Section IV: Some other 5\" Minitab phones (28 Feb 2012) *****Given that the Galaxy Note has now revived the 5\" tablet/phone niche initially established by the Dell Streak, what are we to expect in the near future from other companies. Here is a short list of some new/soon-to-come models:Lenovo LePad S2005LG Optimus VuBLU Studio (Dual Sim)Pantech Vega No. 5ViewPhone 5ePanasonic Eluga PowerPlum Mobile The Might (This one looks like the Note without a stylus. It is also dual-sim)Thomson 5.3-inch X-view 2 (Dual-SIM)Hopefully as the list grows we will likely see greater innovation in this niche market :)***** Section V: Tidbits (07 Mar 2012) *****Over the past few months I did a little experiment in respond to the famous \"What is that?\" question when folks first see me with the Note.  The conversation generally takes one of two paths depending on my response:Other Person: What is that?Conversation 1:Me: It's a mobile phone that's also great to use as a tablet.Other Person: Wow, that's a huge phone isn't it?Conversation 2:Me: It's a mini-tablet that's also great to use as a mobile phone.Other Person: Wow, that's really cool.So based on my unscientific experiment, it looks like folks tend to accept the Samsung Note more as a minitab than as a phone.  Thought it was kind of interesting.  Give it a try and let me know what you find :)", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "The complete phone-tablet device!!!", "Author": "Juwan I. Hayward", "ReviewID": "RDSMMWYX827PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now there is no need to carry both an iPhone/Android phone AND iPad/Android tablet! This phone-tablet device has better resolution (and pixel density of course) than the iPad, and it's a third of the size, so it's much easier to carry and walk around with. AND it's much more than just a 3G tablet, it's also a phone for those times that you wish to send SMS, and to have a 'normal' (verbal) phone conversation without voice over IP apps. I am one of those people that actually 'texts' a lot more than I speak into my phone, but the phone is a bit large, so hands-free earbuds or a bluetooth headset is recommended if you speak into your phone a lot.Because of my impatience, I imported my Galaxy Note from a UK site before it was available on Amazon, but I would have preferred to purchase this device from Amazon instead of importing from overseas. I was so excited to receive my note, and I am simply amazed by the screen resolution and speed!! The build quality is excellent, the device is light (and thin if that's your thing), and a fully charged battery lasts from morning 'til night! I am going to sell my iPhone and Android tablet ASAP!More on the screen resolution/camera:Remote desktop/VNC access from the Note is amazing for those of us that sometimes work remotely, and this device currently has the best balance of usability and portability; For example, for remote desktop use, the iPhone 4/4S is limited by 960 x 480 pixels, the iPad is currently limited by 1024 x 768 pixels, and any Android tablet with 1280 x 800 resolution is nowhere as portable as the Note! Even if Apple finally releases a 9.7-inch 720p iPad in March, I will be staying devoted to my Note. (Tablet makers should be focusing on making 1080P tablets for 2012, in my opinion.) Speaking of pixels, the Note has an 8MP camera on the back and a 2MP camera on the front, so once again much better than any iPad/Android tablet camera, and on par with the cameras on any of the newer smartphones eg. iPhone 4S/Galaxy S2.Also, if the 5.3-inch screen is too small for remote desktop or watching movies, say in a hotel room, the Note has HDMI-out via a MHL-HDMI adapter! (Samsung and other brands available on Amazon; Take a look on Youtube for NZtechfreak's excellent video reviews on HDMI-output and other amazing things you can do with the Galaxy Note!)What would I improve about the Galaxy Note?1. LED notifications; there are no flashing lights when a new push message is received, not cool man!2. If it could have been just a bit smaller (around 4.9 inches), but not as small as the 4.65-inch Galaxy Nexus, which has a 1280 x 720 resolution (but only a 5MP camera by the way, and the home screen is still only 4 icons wide!).In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Note is:1. Better than any smartphone - matching camera/phone features but faster processor, more pixels/higher resolution = more home screen icons, and a longer battery life!2. Better than any tablet - matching screen resolution and long battery life with any of the newer tablets, but has a better camera, and is still small enough to walk down the street with.This is the best mobile device ever made!!!", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Mini-Computer (phone-tablet) to Carry With You Everywhere", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R254EUASLZZCSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the excellent, well-written review by Juwan I. Hayward, I also ordered this from Clove Technology in the UK because I didn't want to wait for it. I had not anticipated that I would be able to get it so soon from a vendor via Amazon (with the exchange rate, it cost me a little more than $100 more than it can be purchased here). Of all of the many gadgets and phones I have owned in the past 30 years, this is by far the best and most superior gadget I have had the privilege of owning and using. It really is a perfect mini-computer. I could conceivably eliminate most of my other gadgets and just use this device. It is small enough to put in most pockets (especially jacket or pants).I go nowhere without it. It is superfast, with a beautiful screen. I use it for playing music, playing games, reading Kindle and ePub books, reading and editing documents, taking notes, surfing the web (in addition to the excellent Android Browser, I love the Dolphin Browser and even occasionally use Firefox for Android), reading news feeds from Pulse and News360, checking Facebook and Google+, taking candid pictures (it also has a good-quality front-facing camera for video chats, which I have yet to use), and all of the many other things one does on today's smartphones and tablets. I have heavily invested in the Android ecosystem, and it really has no noticeable weaknesses compared to iOS (iPhone/iPad/iTouch). This one device combines all the best attributes of a smartphone with those of a tablet, and it is more portable that the normal tablet of today. I own a top-end tablet, and I find myself using it rarely since getting the Samsung Galaxy Note three weeks ago.Lastly, it has a pen. I love the pen. This device is remarkable and outstanding without it, but the pen really does take it to another level for me. I use it for drawing, doodling, taking notes, having my notes transcribed (the transcription software delivered with it is quite good), and use to more efficiently play games and such. It is really the icing on the cake.I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy NOTE. It could conceivably be my go-to device for several years to come.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Tablet and Phone!!", "Author": "George E. Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "R21X1RURLP4QRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to add my two cents worth to the other reviewer's comments - and I understand many of you won't pay attention since I did not buy this from Amazon.  One word sums up the Galaxy Note:  Fabulous!  Beautiful and very bright display and I love the pen input.  Many things, including calendars, can be written on with the pen - it is very flexible in this regard.  One point not mentioned above - it is enabled for GLONASS (Russian) GPS.  I've taken it on two walks on the GPS accuracy and speed are great.  It picks up location much faster than my other phones which I assume is due to the GLONASS GPS receiver.  I do want to mention a couple of ankle-biters though:  I've downloaded all of my Amazon games and I have to say Plants-vs-Zombies ran kinda slow.  I tried rebooting it and playing it again - same story. So - I checked today and sure enough there was a 14+ mb update from Samsung which took the version to 2.3.6 (version when new was 2.3.5).  Both games I checked ran just fine after the update. Second - it does go through battery fairly quickly when connected to wi-fi - but this is typical of Android phones.  If you're short on data (I only get 200-mb per month on mine) then this could be an issue if you intend to use wi-fi a lot.  Last but not least - I could not find any reasonably priced carrying cases for it.  One was listed for sale here but was pretty pricey and would not ship until mid-December.  So - I went to the local media store and found a Garmin pouch - intended to be used with 5-inch Garmin GPS's (ASIN: B00422KZQG).  The fit is a little tight but it's perfect for $15 here on Amazon until a real case comes out.  Anyways - the Galaxy Note really is the best thing since sliced bread - small enough to be with you all the time - yet large enough to serve as a fantastic tablet.**** Added Comments on 26 NOV 11 ****  I've had the Galaxy Note a few more days now and I wanted to update my comments.  The update to 2.3.6 appears to have addressed the possible wi-fi battery usage issue I mentioned above.  After a full charge, I have used the phone two days and two hours and the battery level was at 78% this morning.  The past two days were light usage - but I did check e-mail using 3G both days and made a short call each day.  So - if there was a wi-fi battery usage problem it has been resolved.  And, I continue to be impressed by the beauty, color and high resolution of the display.  This is a beautiful and highly functional phone/tablet that I highly recommend!**** Added Comments on 16 DEC 11 **** The Galaxy Note continues to astound me!  Just like another reviewer commented - this really is the best phone/tablet yet! Integration with Exchange e-mail (IMAP) is flawless.  And, better yet, the e-mail client does the best job I have seen in handling e-mail with embedded photos.  Screen caps are equally easy using the included pen - although the little button you have to hold down for screen caps is tricky to manipulate.  And, this is the best device I have for battery life.  With occasional use throughout each day - I have gotten as many as eight days of battery life!!  I still think there is only one (minor) downside to the Note - the lack of a quality protective case.**** Added comments on 31 DEC 11 ****  I'm still thrilled with my Note and I cannot find anything to criticize.  I continue to especially impressed with how it handle's email.  I received a Gmail message with seven large photo attachments - the Note received it in a couple of seconds - and showed thumbnails within maybe five seconds.  I use Apple Mail on my MacBook Air - and even after 24+ hours the little pinwheel is still spinning trying to pull in all of the attachments!! Despite all of it's good points, and based on a comment I just received, I would have to say that the Note (and any other device with less than a 7-inch display) is not the best device for hours and hours of web-surfing.  A 5.3-inch display is just too small for that IMHO.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note Just Rocks / 3 weeks now", "Author": "Rodger Rutter", "ReviewID": "RGGL2SK6BG0J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never write reviews. I only read them. I have been an Apple user for years because I believe in their quality. I've been using the Galaxy note now for about 7 days. It really does eliminate need for any other device to be carried around, it does it all - and it does it all excellently! I'm not going to talk about any specifics because everything you want to do (business or entertainment) works perfectly. If you're considering this device I highly suggest going for it. You will not  regret it one bit. I like this Note so much I find myself not even using my iMac at home. If I could rate the Galaxy Note 10 stars, I'd do it in a heart beat!Purchased through Amazon, the best place to shop on the planet!I'm up to 3 weeks now using the GN every day, and my original 5 star rating stands solid. I use it all day long for a multitude of things (everything you can do on a tablet and a phone) and the battery typically will have around 50% left at the days end.

No reboots, no battery issues. It is minimally wider compared to the Streak.When the Note is dropped the screen is much better protected due to the time-proven (and annoyingly iPhone3-ish) bevel mount.

But if you expect to often be using your phone instead of the laptop or tablet that you don't have with you at that moment, then no other device I know of comes even close to the Galaxy Note. It fits in all the same places where my iPhone 4G used to fit (mostly my front pants pocket,) and it does just as good a job when used as a phone. (Some people think the larger size looks strange when used for voice calls, but I don't, and I've gotten only positive comments.)Now however, my phone also serves as my tablet without me needing to carry an additional device or have an additional data plan. That's huge for me, since I would carry my tablet in a bag and now I just don't carry the bag. I can also do a lot of real work that I normally do on my laptop.I used to have my tablet at home for media consumption and communications, and carry my laptop with me from work to home for more serious work. Now I have given away the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet (btw was/is a great tablet), and I leave my laptop in the office most nights. The only thing I move around is my Galaxy Note. Big change.The Swype keyboard works quite well for me, and I've written multiple paragraphs without discomfort, but I'm thinking of getting a bluetooth keyboard to put in my travel bag, in case I want to do a lot of writing on the plane.Android 2.3.6 works well. I'm hoping ICS will be even better when it arrives, supposedly in a few months. A small thing is that when a text box appears and the cursor is blinking in it, why do I need to touch the text box to bring up the keyboard?I transferred my AT&T; Sim card from my iPhone to the Note, and then entered the APN information given in one of the other reviews to get the data working. It all worked well, EXCEPT that I didn't realize that the iPhone uses a micro SIM, but the Galaxy Note uses a standard size SIM, which cost me two days. Maybe ATT would have swapped SIM cards for me, but I didn't ask; I just ordered a micro Sim to standard Sim adapter for a couple dollars from Amazon and waited for it to arrive. The adapter works well, and now I can swap my Sim amongst devices, regardless of what size Sim they use, at least until the industry inevitably invents the next smaller size Sim card.I bought an HDMI adapter for the Note, and it works well, although I was surprised to learn that it needs a separate usb power input in addition to connecting it between the Note and the TV. So now I can watch videos on the TV. The TED Air app let's me download the TED talks in HD to the Note. The Note's screen is plenty big enough to watch the videos comfortably on the Note, or the HDMI adapter lets me watch them on the bigger screen, where they look great. Non-HD web videos will not look as good of course.The USB power adapter that came with the Note is European with a US adapter on top. So it's a little long. However, the Note's cable is standard USB on one end and standard Micro B USB on the other, so I've just been using my old iPhone USB power adapter. No doubt this is only an issue with the unlocked phone; I'm sure when the US carriers finally start selling the Note in the US, it will come with a standard US adapter. I was worried that there might be more issues with the fact that the phone was not made for the US market, but that's all I've noticed so far, except that when it starts up for the first time, the question of what language you want to use is asked in German. What's being asked is sort of obvious to anyone who's started up a phone before, but just in case they include in the package a little piece of paper to tell you which selection to make to switch everything to English. Just takes a second.Of course there's a lot to say about how good the screen, the camera, etc. etc. are, but you can get that info from the specs and other reviews. This phone really is excellent in just about every respect. In this review, I've tried to focus on 1) \"Is it too big, or is it exactly the optimal size to do the multi-function job I want while staying as fully portable as my old phone.\" [Answer: the latter.] And 2) \"Is it going to be a problem buying an unlocked non-US phone?\" [Answer: It's mostly fine, although a) you may need to exchange your  micro Sim for a new standard Sim card form factor or buy an adapter in order to switch your Sim from your current phone (don't put a micro Sim in the Note's standard size Sim slot or it may go in deep enough to be difficult to get out), and b) you might find it a little weird entering the APN settings in order to get your data connection working--I had never done it before, but I just followed the steps outlined in the Amazon review by \"san diego best weather\" and it worked immediately.I've only had the Note a week.

The camera is also quite good (for a phone) although I think the latest iP4S may have a slight edge there.I have not used the stylus much.  It works as advertised, but I don't find it to be a terribly compelling a feature.I'm happy that I got the \"Rest of World\" version which has the physical home key, which is a far better design than the the four capacitive buttons the Note will will most likely have when it comes to the US officially.  It works great on AT&T; I simply popped the SIM from my Infuse in and set up the APN correctly, which is trivial.As a former Dell Streak owner who settled for a smaller phone (Samsung Infuse) for a while, I absolutely love this device.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bought the HK version", "Author": "Tam Hung Nguyen \"Tam N.

With this phone, I no longer have to carry a tablet or an e-reader!It is fast, responsive, and the screen is downright gorgeous.  I have used it extensively to check emails and it is SO much easier to type email and view documents on this then on the iPhone or small Galaxy S.  I can type extremely quickly when it is in portrait mode.  I also downloaded the kindle app (after rooting the phone and using market enabler for Verizon).  I was able to read my ebooks without a problem.I'm currently using this on the AT&T; network and i did NOT have to add a new APN.Honestly, best phone/tablet by far!*** Dec 23, 2011 Update ***I have used my phone extensively in the states now for the past two weeks:- 3G Speeds: I do not have 4g service but I've been getting consistent 3g Speeds of 2.8Mps for downloads and 600Kps uploads.

This review is for the WHITE INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED version of this device. I bought it from Amazon but chose to do the review under the dark blue device because it has more reviews and will be read more often.***Over 30 days have past since I purchased the device (Feb 16, 2012), so I am more confident about this device as it works wonderfully in all areas! The reason I mention that is ALL INTERNATIONAL phones DO NOT have a US warranty and I took a HUGE chance spending $700 (at the time of purchase, it is now about $620) for this device! However, I have owed smartphones and computers for many years and have found that if they fail, 95% of the time they fail WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS! In fact all of my smartphones have \"shown\" me in the first 30 days by \"acting up\" whether they would last or not. I have NEVER (so far) had any problems with this device. It is superb. Below are PROS and CONS.PROS:1) Huge 5.3\" screen that is super vivid, clear and easy to read (and the phone is NOT TOO BIG, instead it is light and comfortable to hold.2) Great music player with good sound with the Samsung headset (included) or on speaker.3) FM radio included (AT&T; version does not have FM radio).4) Fast processor.5) I get 3G+ speeds for data and it is fast, fast, fast! (Mostly I use WiFi, but sometimes data and again, it is very fast). I have AT&T; data that I buy each month as I have the go-phone (pre-paid plan) and I buy the smallest data they have as I use WiFi 95% of the time.6) WiFi easy to connect and works perfectly with long range ability!7) Good stock browser, however, I downloaded Dolphin HD Browser and I can get \"desktop\" pages (not mobile pages) and also tabs, and so so many features. Opera is OK, but Dolphin HD blows all the other browsers away!8) Android 2.3.6 is fine for me, they say ICS comes out in late April or May for the GNote.9) Battery life - Decent - Since I am on WiFi or Data 100% of the time when I use this device so the battery lasts me about 5 hours before I have to recharge. Now when I turn the WiFi on and off to conserve battery, I get about 10 hours or more! Also I have backlight on 90%!10) I chose White color, very regal looking - so this is a pro for me!11) Size: Perfect combo mini tablet with 5.3\" screen and great phone, don't need to lug around my 10\" tablet anymore! And I do not think this device is too big to use as a phone and have no problem putting it up to me ear to make a call. This phone is lightweight and easy to hold. I now use a TPU clear cover for just $7 on eBay(shows off the device and does not show dirt) and also use a great cover that is for 5\" GPS I bought from Amazon for just $15 that is open at the top and does not have magnets in it. Samsung has said not to use this device anywhere near magnets (page 180 of the online PDF GNote manual).12) Camera and Video Camera - This takes better pictures than my regular camera and I move the pictures to my 32 gid SD card. And video is wonderful for a quick video! Mostly I take pictures when I am out and about, so no need to have to take my old camera as this device is: CAMERA, MINI TABLET, MUSIC PLAYER, FM RADIO ALL IN ONE DEVICE!!!!!CONS:1) NO US WARRANTY (but there is a UK (International warranty) 24 month warranty in the box). This phone came with a warranty was from the UK and I was given a UK phone number and address for the phone. In a sense, I do truly have a warranty for 24 months for this phone. However, I called Samsung at one of the US service locations and had a very long conversation with the rep. He explained that the reason that Samsung US Warranty does not cover this phone is because this is an international phone, not a phone made for the US and they warranted phones that are made for carriers in the US like AT&T; phones, Tmobile, Verizon, etc, not UNLOCKED INTERNATIONAL PHONES. However, he did say that I have a International Warranty with UK as stated on my 24 month warranty info that came with the phone. If it fails, I will have to call Samsung in the UK I believe and let them know that I am sending the phone, track it via USPS or whatever. However, I have a great feeling about the phone that this will not happen as the phone works superbly and I am very happy with it...I called Square Trade and they told me NO WARRANTY on non US (International) phones. They said they would \"assist\" in shipping or something like that, then I talked to a 2nd person and I was informed they did not warranty the Gnote international version. ***But I am not too worried, as my GNote works great and I am happy with my choice as I did not want AT&T; LOCKED VERSION. *Please not that 95% of the time, if a device is going to fail or malfunction, it is usually within the first 30 days. And I have used this device for well over 30 days and it is fast and has been perfect!TRUE STARS 4.5 STARS BECAUSE OF THE NO US WARRANTY, however a 24 month UK warranty enclosed.2) APN SETTINGS must be manually inputted (all international phones require this). WiFi and text messaging works right out of the box, however, APN settings are needed for Data and MMS messaging.--UPDATE SEPT 10. 2012--It took two updates OTA to get ICS on my GNote, however, I updated to ICS 4.04 from the older 2.3 Gingerbread very early this morning. So far, I really like it. I was able to keep all my APPS, Bookmarks in Dolphin Browser, Contacts, etc. However, I did have to change back to my favorite shortcuts to APPS (and all my APPS work great) on each screen and make new folders, etc. I did have to make new playlists though. The only things I discovered that I really dislike about ICS is more memory use and the battery goes down faster. I now have about 350 free and before had 450 free. However, this is probably due to the much larger OS in 4.04 over 2.3! Also for me, the battery does not last as long. This is just from the first day, so hopefully things will improve. The fact that I have wanted ICS since Feb 2012 when I purchased the GNote, and finally decided to upgrade, I can live with this. Now I have heard that Jelly Bean 4.1 OTA update will be available for the GNote in late October. Looking very forward to updating to JB (hopefully in an OTA in late October, 2012) Also looking forward to the GNote II coming out probably in November or December with Jelly Bean in the US!Please leave comments and I will answer all. Also, if anyone needs AT&T; or T-Mobile APN settings, please ask in the comments and I will post them...", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note vs. iPhone 3GS", "Author": "James A. Haselhofer", "ReviewID": "R396FOUWHXP4SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I suspect many people are making a similar transition - or just want an honest review of what it's like to move to a much larger phone - so thought I'd weigh in.  I've owned the Note for about a month so here are my impressions thus far:Android vs. Apple.I prefer the extra configurability.  I can set most anything.  There were frustrating few options with the iPhone interface.  Getting to the menus is not always as intuitive as apple, and submenus are easy to overlook.  Familiarity with that might or might not come over time.Stability is about equal.  I had to reboot the iPhone frequently for the first year or so I had it.  Later about once every month or so.  Buttons were sometimes frustratingly slow to respond.  The whole system would run sluggish.  My iPhone's volume button fell off two years in and I had to use soft volume knobs or a tooth pick to turn it up or down.  Programs like Google maps would sometimes not open at all.The Note isn't a perfect performer either.  Programs occasionally force close.  So far I've had to reboot once.  Things are very responsive though.  Too responsive sometimes as I find myself accidently forwarding through music tracks by accident.  But it is certainly no worse than the iPhone.  And assuming its stability increases over time like the iPhone did, it may end up being a lot stabler.iPhone iPod music player vs. *.android music players.In terms of basic usability, the iPhone if friendlier hands-down (tho size may be a factor.  More on that later.)And the simple iPod interface made it easy to rate songs, drag playlists from iTunes, and track my music for ratings and play counts between my pc and portable device.Where the iPhone utterly failed however was in playback.I keep very specific, but also very large playlists.  For whatever reason, the iPhone (maybe because it didn't have a queue) would mostly play the same 60 - 75 damn songs over and over.  No matter what I tried.  On every list.  I tried forever to correct this - up to and including purchasing apps to resolve the issue (which never worked either but that's another story).  In 3.5 years owning it, they also never added a crossfade function or downloadable album art either.I should also mention this serious annoyance with the iPhone.  I used it as my main music device and generally loved it.  I used it with a stereo jack to stereo jack in my car and portable speakers camping and while doing dishes, etc.  Toward the last year either a short in the stereo jack or a glitch in the software would make it switch between the internal speaker and the external speakers with the slightest touch.  It was more sensitive sometimes more than others but really bugged.I make no promises for the Note's reliability in terms of stuff like that.  Time will tell.  But I have high hopes.Anyway, the Note's default music player is functional, but not as useable in terms of star ratings or general access as the iPhone.  Downloaded music apps (which are a nice choice to have - let's not lose sight of that) were generally subpar for one reason or another as well.  It seemed like every one I tried would do some of what I'm looking for but never everything.Till I found poweramp.It's so feature rich and useable and (almost) perfect...except that it cost 5 bucks.  But it's worth it.  Equalizer.  Crossfade. Album art automatically.  And I've heard songs I haven't heard in years.It won't import the ratings from iSync, my very good app for syncing iTunes songs and lists to android music players...but that's a pretty specialized request in the first place.  I hope for it someday but it's neither here nor there for this review.In terms of function and sound, though, it's MUCH BETTER than the iPhone's ipod.  Even the simplest players have a variety of presets.  And its internal speaker is at least as loud.  The only downside (and maybe this just means it has a better amplifier than the iphone) is you can turn it up high enough to seriously distort on some devices like my work laptop's speakers.  And a bit at the very higest setting on my car stereo, which the iphone never did.  Other than that it beats the iPhone iPod.Now, let's talk about that size issue:The Good:That big screen is BEAUTIFUL.  I do photography and work on as ASUS professional series ips screen monitor.  In some ways, it rivals that for image quality.  Not quite the range but my god images pop on that phone.  It's 1280 x 800 resolution and 5.7 inch size is adequate real estate to spend real time on the internet.  The iPhone was simply never big enough to use the internet or play games (besides solitaire) for more than a few minutes.  And was often a frustration filled experience.Not so with the Note.This is what I always wanted.  A tablet and phone in one.  Sure it's only ~ 1/2 the size of most tablets, but tablets are still too small to do serious work on imo - so that's no deal killer.  If I really want to look at something or write or do long-term work I want a big monitor or at least a laptop size device.For an away-from-the-pc smartphone I always wanted something big enough to get weather, email and cal, to listen to music, to play games, to watch movies, to show others my portfolio, to text and to browse the internet comfortably for longer periods.But the idea of carrying a tablet and a smartphone everywhere seemed impractical.  And bulky.  And costly.  And a little decadent.  The Note is perfect for all of this and much more.And contrary to reports, I CAN fit it in my front jean pocket comfortably.  Not comfortably enough to hike up rugged hills with it there like I could with my iPhone, but comfortably enough to walk around downtown all night with it there.  Or sit with it (though I usually take it out because I want to use it anyway!).  Many things in life are a trade off, and size is one of them.  In all other ways the iPhone was just too durn small and I don't generally miss it, but make no mistake, the Note's size has downsides.The Bad:If you get a Note your days of single-handing a smart device are over unless you have really big hands.  Sure you can technically do it.  But it's clumsy, impractical, and risky (from either dropping it or taking your focus off of other things like walking).  In a car I used to be okay hitting next on my iPhone for a song at a stop, or doing it by feel (without taking my eyes from the road :) while driving.Don't try that with the note.  It pretty much demands two hands and even when it doesn't, accessing it by feel is not intuitive or quick.  Another design flaw which complicates this is the fact that the volume and wakeup/power buttons are exactly opposite and located exactly where you naturally grab it (about a half inch down from the top).  This seriously bugs because you either turn the volume up when you really want it to wake up or you put it to sleep when you want to adjust the volume.This frequently causes havoc while using the phone to game or browse or text cause I hit the wrong button. Over time I think I can train myself around this, but it's extremely counter-intuitive and I haven't made much progress on that front in the last month.  And it's this last annoying design flaw that makes it a 4 and not a 5.But don't let me end on a bad 'Note'.It's otherwise the perfect smartdevice for people who want the best parts of a tablet AND a phone.  And in my mind the small trade-offs are utlimately nits and inevitable shortcomings for something that's in all other ways incredible and useful and fabulous and an amazing piece of technology.  I truly appreciate Samsung for taking a chance and making this wonderful device for those of us whose vision of smartdevice harmony lies between the smartphone and the tablet.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "ATT GoPhone users - read.", "Author": "rAma", "ReviewID": "R3AFYVMT2649GU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not going into how great this phone is - nice, large screen, fast, great colors etc.,If you are planning to sign up with ATT GoPhone, this might help:I went with ATT GoPhone for $25 a month plus $5 data.

She got it 3rd week of January. It was quick shipping, thanks Amazon. When I saw the phone, I was very impressed with the fluidity of the phone, along with the beautiful 5.3 inch touch screen. What made the phone a killer was the combination of adding Android Market place and Samsung Apps to the Note's ecosystem. I've added 20 applications to the Note like Angry birds, Card reader, Samurai, NFL 2012, Flix, Kindle etcetera.Along with the software from Samsung Apps and Android Marketplace. Samsung has pre-installed Reader, Music, and Social hub. I find the hubs pretty pleasing to the eye and useful. Reader Hub allows you to read newspapers, magazines, and books through the portal. the interface of the Reader hub is intuitive and very neatly organized. The Social Hub allows you to combine or amalgamate all you email addresses, Facebook accounts, and twitter ID's to one single list that can be checked and updated in real time. Very simple and a good idea to simplify your life. Music Hub, you can look up a Title, Artist, or other search hints that will link you to the musician or album you are looking for purchase. Once again, simple in idea, but useful for everyday practice.The kicker to the phone is the S-Pen. I have to admit, the pen is very responsive. And I can take a snapshot of the Note's screen at any point(Hold the S-pen down while pressing the S-Pen button). Then I can email the snapshot or edit it. I can send the snapshot to Facebook, Gmail if I want to.S-Pen applications are plenty. S-memo comes out of the box. But Samsung Apps has plenty of S-pen Software applications for free download. The S-pen allow me to draw on the Note, which makes it a fun toy. If you want to buy a phone for a child of yours, the Note would be perfect (adults are children at heart anyways).Kies Air Application allows you to load your phone files onto your computer via Wi-fi. very convenient.(tether to the computer using the Note. Then tap on the Kies Air Icon on the Note). Kies Air will ask you to do Wi-fi routing. Approve Wi-fi Routing and put a green check to Wi-fi Routing in settings. The kies Air will automatically direct you to Wi-FI routing settings. After getting Wi-fi Routing turned on, Kies Air will give you a Web address that will contain all you Galaxy Note's files and folders. Just use any computer with an internet connection(you can tether at the same time while you use Kies Air). And you will have accessto you Galaxy Note's file and folders through the internet).The All share application allows you to either use your phone like a remote control on a Wi-fi enabled TV. Or you can also you DLNA wireless technology to video-port your Note to your HDTV. There is also a MHL-HDMI adapter you can buy on Ebay that allows you to port the Note to your HDTV, via wires. so you can watch Videos, play games, read a book, listen to music from the Note to the HDTV.On a side note, codecs are wide and vast on the Note. You can play many types of video files directly to the Galaxy Note. That is something that Samsung is very generous with in general. As well, Samsung is one of the few OEM's that actually allow you to root and flash your ROM quite easily. There are no bootloaders. That makes modding your Note's Operating System very easy to do. Just watch a few youtube modding videos.I say the positives are1. 5.3 inch Samsung OLED HD screen (All OLED screens are made by Samsung. Even Motorola Razr, Nokia and Sony are using Samsung OLED's right now) It's the best in the business.  Very crisp and vivid. Games and videos are a joy to watch. S Pen is a plus as well, very responsive and FUN.2. Excellent processor with the Dual-core Exynos 1.4 GHZ, very zippy.3. Battery life has been very good with 2500 milliamps. which is just enough for a mammoth phone like this4. Biggest factor has to be the excellent android ecosystem, with the Touch Wiz overlay. I mean Samsung really packs lots of good software apps for the note. So I am delighted that the Note is one of the most useful convergence devices around.5. Lots to explore like All Share, Kies Air and tons of apps. And, nothing feels too overburdened on the Note.Negative.I wish I could tether to the computer right out of the box. But there are tons of USB or Wi-fi tethering apps on android, that are good solutions for tetering needs.You can also tether to the computer by downloading the Samsung application called Kies for your PC. It is downloadable on Samsung's website. Basically Kies(Not Kies Air) installs the drivers for your PC that allows the computer to recognize the USB connection from the Galaxy Note to the PC. After you download Kies from Samsung.com, install Kies and wa-la, you can tether to your computer.To tether to your PC, make sure you connect your micro-USB cable from the Note to the PC. Go to Settings and look into Wireless Settings. You should see \" tethering \"in the list of Wireless settings. Go into tethering settings.

Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R18KSGTNMJ2O14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I would like to state that this phone is not intended for the masses. Not everyone would be comfortable with carrying or holding a device of this size, so be sure you know what your getting yourself into. With that being said I am delighted in owning the Galaxy Note. I recently bought it via Amazon and have no regrets. The screen is to die for. Samsung included a short video file in this device to get you aware of the color,contrast and capabilities of this device screen and it just blew my mind away.The Galaxy Note is a huge device and I choose it over the Galaxy S2 due to screen resolution. While the S2 and the Note pretty much carry the same specifications, the screen resolution of the note is 1,280x800 compared to the weak 480x800 of the S2. This means that you get better viewing fields (more info in less space). Other than that there seems no other major points that make it a better option.Anyhow's the camera takes wonderful pictures, typing is a breeze due to bigger keyboard layout (you may have to use both hands). Build quality is \"excellent\". Samsung is known for using plastic which makes some of their devices seem cheap by todays standards but not the galaxy note.The only plastic you will find here would be the battery backplate and it doesn't look or feel cheap at all. The Note has the perfect weight, Its blazing fast, and I have no call quality problems (so far). Battery performance is a 5/5 star for me. Gets through the whole day without a problem.  My only complaint would be the back speakers, they are just not loud enough for a device of this size.There is an included styles which can  seamlessly be put away in the built in styles compartment. I cant comment much on it at this point since i dont use it much but it does hold in pretty tightly (not afraid that it would fall out).Overall if your looking for something that can function both as a phone and a mini tablet, than this is the device for you. The screen size and resolution are its selling points. Its a capable device, thats future proof and I cant wait for the \"Icecream\" OS update.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easily the best phone I've ever owned, and I've owned many!", "Author": "A. Bailey \"#TeamAndroid\"", "ReviewID": "R3ITJQKUZTFESB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review builds upon the rave reviews for this amazing device, called the Samsung Galaxy Note. Please note, my review is on the 4G LTE U.S. model Galaxy Note, under the AT&T; brand. I didn't purchase an unlocked phone off of Amazon.This is my first Samsung branded phone. I was a little bit worried about it, due to there being issues with the build quality of the Galaxy S II, which is the phone the Note is largely based off. But, upon actually holding the phone, you'll find the Note is a higher quality build. I've previously owned only HTC branded smartphones, most notably the HTC Touch Pro II, EVO 4G, and EVO 3D. Having extreme issues with Sprint's network and lack of competitive phones, I knew it was time for a change and I wanted the Note after hearing so much about it. I wanted the white Note, as the black model seemed too typical, generic, and all of the other phones I've owned have been black. I definitely wanted something different. I made a good move! The white Galaxy Note is gorgeous and looks so high-end and much more expensive than the black (or blue as Samsung claims) Note. Your first impression will most likely be a curse word said out of surprise, followed by amazement at the sheer size of the thing. You may also get a bit intimidated. Don't! For a guy, my hands aren't very large, and the note feels mostly good in my hand. It really helps that this phone is insanely thin, as with most Samsung devices. I don't know how they do it, but it's incredibly thin. Thinner than the iPod touch, even.The display is a 1280x800 HD Super AMOLED resolution, which provides an absolute stunning display! The display is higher than most other HD displays which only have 720p, so the Note's HD display is better than pretty much any other device, sans the iPhone with its retina display. The screen real estate is wonderfully huge! So large that unlike virtually every other smartphone, there are five rows of icons supported, instead of the usual four.\"TouchWiz\" is Samsung's user interface. I am only used to HTC's \"Sense.\" I still think that in most ways, Sense is a bit more refined and advanced, but I'm growing to really like TouchWiz. The 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor means that the Galaxy Note is extremely quick and fluid. In fact, coming from HTC devices, the Note shatters the HTC products in speed and it's very comparable to the iPhone. For advanced users  worried about benchmark differences on the U.S. model, I ran a benchmark test and my results were 3,175. A reviewer ran a benchmark test on YouTube for the international version, at it came out at 4,559.I want to talk about battery life. I had to edit my review to update my battery life experience with the Note. Initially, I stated the battery life was phenomenal. However, that was based on usage that didn't drain the battery such as playing games, watching videos, etc. Without doing those things, you can easily get 20+ hours of battery life on the Note. But, if you do play a lot of games and watching videos or even listen to a lot of music, your battery will literally be dead in just a few hours. Looks like I'm still searching for an Android phone with an adequate battery that can last me 7+ hours with constant use.I like the massive 16GB internal RAM. I'm so used to 8GB of RAM on-board from HTC. I purchased a SanDisk 64GB Class 6 MicroSD card that originally retailed for close to $150 from Best Buy, for only $70 after incentives and a huge sale BB was having. Even though the Note (and most other Android phones) states that the highest capacity MicroSD card you can install is 32GB, that is entirely not true. You can actually add MicroSD cards as large as 128GB to your phone. All I did was pop the SanDisk into my Note, formatted it using my phone, and I was good to go. Added to the 16GB of internal memory on my Galaxy Note, I now have a whopping 80GB of memory on this beast! Try getting an iPhone with that capability and for this price. Plenty of room for music, videos, apps, photos, and much more!Now, let me talk about the stylus or \"S-Pen,\" as Samsung insists you call it. The S-Pen is not like the boring stylus you are used to from cell phones in the past. This S-Pen is intelligent and powered. You can use it to input text or even draw on the screen! The S-Pen is also pressure sensitive, which means that how light or dark your drawings are, is based on how hard you press the pen against the screen. You can also use the S-Pen to take a snapshot of whatever is on your screen, and use that snapshot to write notes and captions on it. While browsing the web, you can use the S-Pen to cut out an image you like, and attach it to an S-Memo (a built-in Galaxy Note app) and you can do all sorts of things with the image, including sending it to a friend via email or text messaging.Network/Data speeds are unprecedented, at least for me. I stay in the Washington, DC suburbs, and coming from the third largest carrier in the nation, I became accustomed to non-existent 4G and 3G data speeds that were laughable at the very least. Using AT&Ts; 4G LTE network, my last network data test revealed I was getting 33.31Mbps download and 12.7Mbps upload speed. If you know anything about understanding data speeds, you know that it insanely fast. Videos and web content load at a flash. I have yet to experience that annoying buffering while trying to watch videos on YouTube. I know this will be irrelevant to those who are purchasing the international version--as it is incapable of utilizing 4G or LTE--but for those getting the U.S. version, I thought I'd throw that in there.Call quality has been really good in my area. AT&Ts; coverage map shows I should be getting the best call quality they offer. I can hear other callers loud and clear, and other callers tell me I sound really good and clear, also.Using the Galaxy Note as a music player, is now a reality for me. I have never been able to do that with any of the other phones I've owned, because I feel that the sound quality (and video quality) didn't compare to my iPod touch. Well, Samsung has now got me singing another tune! Firstly, you can transfer almost any type of music file to the Note, such as WMA, AAC, MP3, WAV, and others. That in its self makes this phone amazing and above other alternatives, that may only play ACC/Apple files or MP3/WMA Windows files. Then, audio quality is superb! There is a function that lets you transform the sound to 5.1 stereo surround sound. It makes a huge difference! Also, if you combined the inherently good audio quality of the Note with a third party app from the \"Google Play Shop\" (formerly the \"Android Market\") you can transform your phone to a beast in terms of sound quality. There were songs that made me have to say \"Ouch!\" because they were so loud. I have never had to do that with any other phone I've owned. I am really impressed.For those people who think they might feel a little ridiculous using this phone and putting it up to your head to talk, you can always use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth setup was literally the easiest I've ever experienced one a cell phone. Oh, and I know many people will worry about pocket ability of this giant. I can tell you, I do not wear baggy jeans, and I can easily slip this phone into my pocket and feel totally comfortable. It doesn't feel bulky and it fits perfectly. I opted to not use the generic Samsung case, as I did not find it particularly attractive or useful. Plus, I love the way my phone looks and didn't want to hide it with an ugly case. This is the first phone I've ever owned where I didn't have some sort of protection, such as a case or screen protector.One more thing about the screen... it's so big that I ended up returning my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 to the store I bought it from. It basically had no use for me, anymore, after getting the Note. You can do everything an tablet or iPad can do on this phone. I even have downloaded books that I had on my Galaxy Tab, transferred to my Note, and the screen is big enough that it makes reading books on it, quite feasible.To end a very long review, so far I am totally happy with the Samsung Galaxy Note. I highly recommend it. This certainly isn't a phone for everyone, given its immense size, but I think most people will find they could work with it. A week after purchasing this, I don't even notice the size, anymore. In fact, I find myself stating that the phone almost seems a bit small! My one and only gripe, is the placement of the on/off/sleep button. Most phones have this button practically located at the very top of the phone. Samsung, for whatever reason, thought it necessary to awkwardly place this button the upper-right hand corner of the device. This is at a place where most people grasp their phone to hold it or pick it up. So, you accidentally end up turning off your screen all the time. It's aggravating, but you can learn to deal with it and kind of become more aware of the positioning of the button, so it's not a huge problem anymore. Of the many pluses, the phone is super fast, beautiful, and there are so many feature built into it that will keep you amazed for a long time to come. Well done, Samsung! I can now see why you guys have become the market leader for cellular phones. Easily the best phone I had ever been proud to own!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 months after buying it... the good, the bad and the....", "Author": "Dimitri Suraweera \"Dimi\"", "ReviewID": "R149CXOSQ6NTZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after reading all the reviews I decided to settle on the Galaxy note eventually after much debate between this and the iphone...I bought it in early February and got it shipped to the UK as it was cheaper buying here in Euros than getting it on Amazon.co.uk. I've been using it extensively for the last 2 months. Other reviewers have made plenty of comments on the various features so i will try and keep that in summary form. I always want to know what's bad about a product when I buy it so I've focused more on mentioning the bad. However despite some of its shortcomings it is still the best phone I've ever used - the good outweighs the bad by miles.I must say that I travel between two coutries a lot and in my home country (Sri Lanka) I use this purely as a tablet with a sim that is only active for data. The other half of my time (I spend around 10 days every month in Bangladesh) I use this as my local mobile phone for calls and internet/email. However I donlt get that many calls on this when in Bangladesh compared to my regular phone.Please note that unless specified otherwise I am using all the `stock' programs for things like email that came with the Note.Firstly, what's great about it:1. Screen - excellent - the perfect size for reading emails, web browsing and especially great if you use it to read work related attachments such as spreadsheets because the screen size menas you have less scrolling around to do and the text is crisp and clear. I honestly cannot see and difference in resolution on this compared to the iphone's retina display although 'technically' the retina display has a higher resolution. If anyone can actually tell the difference i@d probably be willing to bet a lot of money that to the naked eye the difference is inconceivable. In terms of colours i think the colours on the note are actually brighter and more vivid.. but i might just be a bit biased here2. Watching Videos - Simply Awesome resolution and vibrancy etc. I've got a few HD videos which I've watched on it and it is awesome3. Wi-fi hotspot  - Just love the fact that I can share the data connection4. Kies Air - Samsung's excellent tool that allows you to transfer anything on to your phone form any laptop over the air (without the need for any cables).5. The Visidon Application (free) - this app uses your fornt camera to allow you to selectively lock certain apps using face recognition. Yes, I too was sceptical and thought that it would take a long time to recognise your face. However in bright light it takes less than half a second to do the facial recognition. It is a problem in low light but it has a password override feature. Now I give my phone to friends with no qualms - safe in the knowledge that they can play around with it, browse the net, watch youtube videos.. but cannot go and put in silly Facebook updates on my behalf because I have locked access to the facebook app. Because it allows you to select which apps you want to lock it is great. Even settings and things like access to your photos and files can be locked in this way. A must have app!!6. Contacts integration with FB and Gmail - works like a charm. I have phone numbers of people on FB and everything gets updates as long as they update their profile. It also logs activity of that person so you know what you've been doing with them.7. Portability - it is excellent to have something that is equally good as any tablet that I've used always on you. It just fits in your pocket and stays with you. Simply great!Neutral:1. Phone size - donlt believe anyone who says its too big. I've got just a 32 inch waist, am 5'10\" tall and weigh 68kg... so not a big person and the phone fits perfectly well in all the trouser/jean pockets that I've worn. ZERO discomfort. Once you've got used to the screen size on this baby you simply cannot go back to a smaller screen.2. Camera quality - is excellent in low light but I found that the iphone's quality is better. Not a problem for me because I rarely use it for snapshots and when I want good pictures I use my dslr.. not my phone! Works great for scanning business cards and even paper/magazine articles and advertisements.3. S-pen - I've used it a few times and was excited about the ability to just write down notes as opposed to carrying a book with me... but unfortunately it isn't that practical to do this. I have used this on occasion to take a photo and scribble on top of this photo (prices of things like floor tiles with an image when I was looking at refurbishing the house). Overall not used as much as I thought I would - I am not into sketching at all!!4. Siri-like voice assistance - not really used this much at all except when driving, but even that was occasionally only. A car with  good navigation/bluetooth system would be able to handle the outgoing calls equally well so this was not a particularly impressive feature for me.Things I don't like:1. In MS Exchange you cannot select which folders to sync it just syncs all your folders I think.  I would have liked to be able to sync every single email in my Inbox and `follow ups' folder. Unfortunately syncing `ALL' (date range) made the phone unusably slow. I have to then settle for syncing it for `one month'. Whilst this is not a major problem it would have been nice to be able to really individually select which folders to sync. I have found paid software available that allows you to do this, but I think the stock application should have catered to this.2. Cannot sync Outlook Notes - The `notes' in outlook just wont sync. I used to use this feature extensively but have now had to stop using it which is a bit of an annoyance. There is talk that ICS will include NOTES synchronisation for Outlook but I've not tested it yet so can't say for sure. For the moment I make do by installing Evernote, which has more functionality overall and also addresses my main need which is to have my notes synced across various devices. But it was still a disappointment3. Calendar doesn't auto sync(I've turned off the general autosync feature for applications) so when I look at the calendar I sometimes forget to sync it and there is a cance you could miss appointments. Not been an issue for me personally because I still get the reminders on my blackberry. But it has prevented me form moving completely away form the BB and using this as my primary phone.4. Email program has an annoying habit of not letting you open the attachments until body of email is downloaded. Sometimes embedded images in email bodies take ages to download especially if the email trail is long and there are 40 emails before it. This really seems silly to me.5. You cannot individually select which applications are allowed to auto sync, this is more a problem with Android than the Note though. I would have ideally like to have said that my Email program and my Gmail program are allowed to sync data automatically but for all other programs I would have preferred to do it manually. As far as I could see you can either ask all to sycy auto or none!6. On a few occasions there was an email or two that simply would not come on to the Note. It was showing on my Laptop in outlook as well as on my Blackberry torch, but it simply would not come on the note until I forwarded it fomr the BB back to myself... then It came!!!7. Battery Life - On the occasions I was using it as a phone cum tablet, the battery seemed to always die before I was ready to go to sleep. Even if you use it as only a tablet for emails and web browsing plus a bit of facebook the battery dies by evening time so i typically need to charge it again when i get back form work. I have found, however that by turning off WCDMA and leaving it only on GSM mode that the battery tends to last longer. The only downside of doing this is that web browsing and especially if you are lookingat youtube videos the speed gets slow.8. Google maps - unbelieveably accurate even in the asian countries I've been using it in like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What a lot of people might not know is that this has an additional GPS technology that allows it to communicate with more satellites than your average phone. (I cant remember what it is technically but imagine that usually you can get only the US satellites, so if you donlt have one close by.. your location accuracy gets affected.. the note has A-GP and Glonass technology which translates to better accuracywhen  pinpointing locations. Also the large screen is a definite advantage here!Conclusion:If there was an iphone with the same screen size would I have bought the iphone instead - most certainly yes!! Why? Because ios is still sleeker and less buggy and some of the apps are better. But, until Apple starts catering to people who actually want to have at least some options as opposed to ONE option in terms of form factor etc I'm sticking with my note! I donlt normally do reviews but this product was so great that I thought others deserved to know!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best execution..period", "Author": "N. vaikhary", "ReviewID": "R33A95ED0J8X4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really surprised at all the negative reviews by the bloggers and tech writers about the phone. I personally think none of them have ever touched or used this phone before making a judgement. I'll sum it up.1. Is it a phone or a tablet?? - Tablets are not practical to carry around and if you enjoy 11\" screen vs 55\" tv, i cannot argue with you. Tablets are cool, and if only browse and chat they are  better buy than pc or mac , in terms of both price and simplicity.  Coming to note, it is a phone which has the most usable internet experience coz of it's size and execution.2. It is not bulky, it is super sleek and very light - Forget what these bloggers are saying , if you don't believe me, hold your iphone and hold the gigantic galaxy note in you hand and you be the judge. Don't let it's size fool you. It's bigger screen is really a + for multimedia , but is weighs the same as you 4\" phone. Also my hands are not big but i am still able to operate the note with one hand.3. It does fit in pocket very easily - Again it is the execution. The phone is so light and thin that you hardly notice it. Agreed it won't fit in your back pocket but i don't think most people keep their phone in the back. And all those apple folks with the gigantic otter box on iphone, please stop whining about big and bulky.4. It is very very fast - the browser is superfast when you get 4g LTE or wifi. There are few software quirks, but those are limited to android and the integration, both of which are fixable.5. Amazing display - it takes few days to month to get used to it. It is so bright and vibrant and i felt the colors are over saturated, but again our eyes are trained to watch the faded ones. Once you use this for few days you will love it and please do not put any screen protector that could reduce it's brightness or else you will be disappointed.6. Stylus is very functional and almost close to perfect - it's a huge leap from what we used in palm :). The stylus feature is very useful for me as i am able to comment on the designs my designers send me for reviews. Do i use stylus all the time? NO. But again the subtle features like this is what makes this phone great. Now i have a phone that can call, browse the internet easily and faster, take beautiful pictures, act as a gps, help me in my profession and in the night act as a night stand, guess all i can ask more if it's got a D#&% massager...seriously.7. GPS - with screen so big, Google's navigation is a delight.Overall I am very happy with this phone. I am an entrepreneur and technologist and i was so much waiting for a device like this and i can totally assure you that samsung has lived up to the expectation with the very 1st execution. I am sure it'll improve a lot in coming years.

Sure, I would have preferred LTE, but I wasn't willing to give up Samsungs Exynos for the lame Snapdragon processer. I began shopping online for the international unlocked model and came across this offering from amazon. After much debate, I decided to give this unlocked phone a shot and ordered it with overnight shipping. Being a very hesitant iPhone 4S, I can give all of you fellow iPhone users great advice if you're considering this device. I don't consider myself a apple or android fanboy because I love both platforms.So I took the plunge and have had the phone for three days now. While unboxing the phone, I found myself feeling an old feeling come rushing back.  It reminded me of the excitement of getting my first iPhone.  I pulled it out of the box and for the first time, truly appreciated the huge 5.3 inch hd screen. I rushed to the AT&T; store and was given a new sim card (with great customer service) and off I went. I quickly ran into some problems with the APN settings though which caused some problems surfing the web. After about an hour of searching, I finally found the correct apn settings that worked with my device. All problems fixed, off I went exploring a whole new world of android. I found all of the same apps I was used to with iOS and some new ones that made android feel great. I have no complaints so far and am truly enjoying the device.I wanted to address a couple of key points with this phone that I feel are pertinent.1) I am experiencing better battery life with the Note than I was with my iPhone 4S. I never thought I would see the day that android matched iOS in this department.2) The S pen (stylus) is neat. I won't be using it much, but it is a worthy idea.3) I truly recommend this phone over the AT&T; version. I feel that they crippled this phone to make it compatible with AT&T;'s LTE network.I'll still keep my iPhone 4S as a just in case device, but I don't see going back to Apple any time soon (iPhone 5 maybe).If you need any APN settings help, feel free to contact me via the reviewer contact link.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever!", "Author": "Timothy Tasmin \"AKB48 Follower\"", "ReviewID": "R25ARO970XXBN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is one of the best phones ever. so much that I have to review it. I am a tech junkie and that means I love to collect phones and resell them. I have owned in the past: Nokia 6290, KIRF iPhone 4(lol), Samsung Galaxy S II GT-i9100, LG Thrill 4G, Samsung Focus i917, HTC Sensation 4G, Sony Tablet S 32GB. None of these can compare to the mere presence of the Galaxy Note.Build Quality 10/10: Has a very sturdy feel to it, choice of materials is your opinion. It is made out of plastic, but not anything cheap. I prefer the plastic b/c if Samsung had opted to choose a type of metal e.g. aluminum it would feel very heavy and uncomfortable in hand.Call Quality 9/10: Produces some very nice tones and clear vocals. The volume could be have higher volume output, but nothing that would make me hate it.Multimedia 10/10: Witht he Super AMOLED HD screen makes viewing pictures and videos a plus. Even encoded in 1080p videos are smooth and jitters, I don't know why somepeople do this b/c the resolution on the Note is 1280x800 not 1920x1080. Gaming is very smooth thanks to the Mali 400GPU.UI Speed 9/10: Smooth for the most part, but sometimes when switched on to a live wallpaper, it sometimes jitters a bit. Also, when getting an overview of all your items the transition is not real smooth. But everything else like scrolling and launching apps is smooth.Text Input 9/10: The keyboard is standard, nothing great about it. It is a delightful to type with two hands in landscape or potrait, but not with one hand unless you have insanely large fingers lol. I think they could have made better use if they put a number row on top since of the large real estate you get.Battery 9/10: I'm a big battery user and I get 5-6hrs. on it, if you're light user it'll probably last you a day or more. You get a 2500mah battery which is half the amount used in 10.1in. tablets.Internet 10/10: Very fast and of course like any Android out there supports flash. Very smooth and text is easy to read b/c of the WXGA resolution. No lag at all.Camera 10/10: This is a mobile phone is by far one of the best camera out there on a mobile handset. Pictures are crisp and colorful, no graininess well I haven't taken night pictures yet, only in daytime. Video capturing is a very awesome experience too with a smooth framerate in 1080p.Everyday Usage 10/10: Use it everyday.Display: One of the main reasons to get it of not the main reason. The Super AMOLED HD has a resolution of 1280x800 not 1280x720 like the Galaxy Nexus or Optimus LTE(ATT Nitro HD). 5.3in. makes browsing the internet and reading eBooks a pleasure.Overall I'd give this phone a 9.5/10 only b/c of not producing a Super AMOLED+ HD screen since it would look better, but the plus is not to get worked up over. Oh yes, another thing many users including I notice black splotches when putting on a completely back background. Their tiny and you won't notice the splotches at all if you have other colors around.

The 1 guy that won't like it is probably hardcore Apple sheep and he probably doesn't like it because Apple and the ghost Steve Jobs tell him not to.Joking aside, this thing is super convenient to take along during long flights and during short trips. The big screen makes it very pleasant to view contents on the web (Youtube, video, pdf, you name it). Also, having an S-pen is a plus. Have any of you ever written a shopping list of things to buy before going to the supermarket ? This thing is a life saver.

I constantly need to sign a lot of form as the nature of my job. Having this really helps. I can use the S-pen and the annotation feature to review and sign any form my clients send to me on the go.

If you want to get an iPad, get a laptop and you will be able to get more works done on the go. I sold my iPad 1 to another iSucker and have never really looked back.

I am stationed in Germany and it still arrived ahead of schedule. The phone was delivered unlocked as advertised and it works very well with my telecom sim card. In order to get 3g to work on this phone, you have to enter the APN settings for your cell phone company. I was able to google APN settings for my network and now my phone works very well. One of the features I like the most is that the phone automatically switches from 3g to wifi once it recognizes a preexisting connection. It is a HUGE smartphone/tablet. Therefore, I use a motorola bluetooth headset or the speakerphone with it most of the time. It also comes with a corded earpiece to talk on. Although it is large, it is very thin and lightweight. It fits easily in my jean pocket or my coat pocket. I use the BoxWave case for it and a Realook anti-glare screen protector . The super HD Amoled screen is the best clarity I have ever seen on a smartphone. Movies show very well on this device. It is like a miniature HD tv. The camera on this phone is one of the best out there. It takes HD quality pictures. The wifi connection is not as strong as my other devices, but it works well with two or three bars. There are too many features to list about this phone. I have owned several smartphones throughout the years, including the iphone. I think this phone is the \"iphone killer.\" If you don't mind carrying around a larger than average smartphone, you will love this device.UPDATE (8/6/12): I have owned my Samsung Note for 6 months now. Since my first review I have changed screen protectors because more options are available now. My Note is still running well. I am still amazed at the video and picture quality. I am currently stationed in Germany and I have not had any issues with my telecom sim card. The phone has frozen a few times, but holding the power button and home button restarts the phone with no issues. My phone serves as a mini command center and I do everything with it. This phone seems to have endless possibilities.I use the bluetooth feature everyday in my Challenger while cruising the autobahn. The phone pairs very quickly. I have to make sure I am not too close to my car while standing and talking on my phone because it will pair several feet away from it. It is important to deactivate bluetooth and wifi when not in use in order to preserve battery life.

I don't mind that I got the European version because I like having the physical home button.  I just switched from the Galaxy SII which did not have the physical button and I like this better.  I was an iphone user since the day the iphone came out years ago and have upgraded to new iphones every year.  I liked it but definitely felt like I missed a lot of the functions I had with my pocket pc's (customization, etc.)  If you don't care about customizing or a smaller display, nothing wrong with the iphone.  Depends on what you like.  A few months ago I switched from the iphone to the Galaxy SII and loved the change.  Now a few months later, I switched again because this was the kind of phone I dreamed would be developed eventually.  (kind of like the pocket pc's but with phone usage, more storage).  Love having the S-pen (stylus) again.  It's nice to be able to switch between using fingers and pen, depending on what you are doing.I am female, only 5'2\", small hands and was worried that the phone would look ridiculous.  Either I ended up not caring because really who cares what other people think!  Or what I really noticed was because I have long hair, when I talk on the phone, my hair is covering most of the phone anyway.  I don't think anyone has noticed it looks any larger.  I have definitely had friends ask me about it (when I was texting or checking emails) and thought they might wonder what in the world??  But all they have said is \"That is REALLY cool!\"  So don't worry about it looking silly, I realized it was a silly thing to worry or think about.So comparing it to the Galaxy SII which I had for a few months, I would say it's pretty similar but larger screen, FASTER, better batter, has the S-pen, no negatives.  I liked the Galaxy SII but LOVE this phone!  The main thing I didn't like about the Galaxy SII was the battery did not last me all day and this phone does.  I would say the battery lasts the same as the iphone, which is all day and then charge it at night.  The display (to me) looks exactly like the Galaxy SII.  I know they're a little different but I look at them side to side and the Galaxy Note does not seem any less colorful or bright than the SII, and the clarity is better on the Note.My apps that I used on the SII work just as well on the Note.

I live in Pasadena/Los Angeles area where AT&T; has very good 4G/LTE coverage.Awesome-------Network speed: Using the \"Speed Test\" app, 4G/LTE download speeds range from 10-15+Mbps for downloads and 5-8Mbps for uploads.  I've even seen download speeds reaching 20Mbps.  So, network speed is about 4-10x faster than using my old iPhone4 over AT&T;'s 3G network.  I'm also getting 4G data coverage in certain parts of town where I had virtually no 3G data coverage.  I no longer bother switching to Wifi mode since it is too slow compared to 4G/LTE.Size: Great size for content viewing (webpages, YouTube, etc).  The iPhone4 screen seems so tiny now and I also returned a 7\" Android tablet.  I found that there is no need to have a separate phone and a tablet.  I haven't felt that I need a phone case and this unit slides very comfortably into my front pant pockets since it is pretty thin.Good----Cost: I bought this device from Amazon Wireless which was about $250 (White) all-in including a car charger that came with it.  This is about $100 cheaper than buying from AT&T; which is about $300 and then sales tax on the non-subsized price.Data plan: My previous 2yr contract with AT&T; iPhone4 had an unlimited data plan and I was able to convince AT&T; to roll that into my Galaxy Note plan.Speaker phone: The speaker phone is very clear and loud.  For conference calls, you can place the unit on a tabletop and listen over the speakerphone.  I was never able to do this with my iPhone4.Battery life: Screen is the biggest drain on the battery.  I usually keep the screen brightness to less than 50% and it consumes about 60% of battery.  I think the battery life is a bit better than my iPhone4 but not much better.  I basically still have to charge this unit daily.App store: Google app store has all the popular apps that are available for iOS.Roaming: I was able to roam (voice and data) without any problems in Japan (but without the benefit of 4G/LTE speeds.)S-pen: Very useful to take quick notesSo-so-----Hard and soft button layout: This unit has the power and volume buttons on the right and left sides along with the soft bottons (menu, home, back, search) on the bottom.  When you want to take a picture, you need to hold the unit just right so that you don't accidently hit any of these buttons.

Definitely a keeper with better screen and newer Android.  Strongly recommended for anyone like myself trying to consolidate a smart phone, a tablet, and a laptop into a single communication device.I had minor challenges to get this phone fully working on AT&T.;1. Out of the box, phone was set to German language, so had to find the \"language\" icon/button to switch language to English.  That was fun since I couldn't understand a word on the screen.  To seller's credit, I did eventually find a note at the bottom of the shipping box with instructions on how to change, but only after the phone was all set and I was putting away the boxes.2. Once the SIM card was moved from Streak to Note, the phone worked but not data.  The fix was to add \"wap.cingular\" to APN in the network setting.  Data portion worked immediately afterwards.3. With existing AT&T; 3G data plans, Note will show \"3G\".  However, upgrading your plans for 4G may enable \"H+\" where service is available.Many thanks to Samsung for releasing this device.  To Dell: Shame on you for dropping the Streak!------------  Update ------I have upgraded my AT&T; plan to 4G plan and the Note now displays \"H+\" when available.  Also, the addition of USB to HDMI converter can output to my HDTV.  So, I can now stream Amazon or Netflix onto my TV from the phone!If this continues to work reliably, I might consider cancelling both the local phone and Cable TV and just get a much higher bandwidth AT&T; plan for the phone.------------ Update 2/19/2012 ---Now that I've had both the Galaxy Note N7000 and Galaxy Note I717 (AT&T;), I actually prefer the N7000 due to following reasons:- Battery lasts about 30% longer.  I can't make a full day with I717, but N7000 has no problem surviving a day.  It's either the hardware difference and/or the AT&T; bloatware.- The large single button is more useful than having four tiny touch buttons.  However, the missing button on I717 makes it easier to apply the screen protection film.- The N7000 says H+ where I717 says 4G on the screen----------- Update 3/11/2012 ---So far so good.  Both the N7000 and I717 are performing well now.  I have figured out that the I717 for some reason uses much more battery with WIFI is turned on, especially in areas where WIFI is not available.  N7000 hasn't done this so I'm guessing that this is where the hardware difference matters.Last point for any new buyers - This phone not only looks big, but it's so big that you can no longer safely text while driving because you'll most likely need two hands - one to hold and the other to text.  I have medium-large hands and I definitely cannot do many tasks with just one hand that I could do with other smaller phones such as Captivate or iPhone.  This is due to the fact that many of the menu functions and \"search\" data fields are located at the top left of the screen where my thumb isn't long enough to reach the screen.For example, While in phone dial mode, my thumb isn't quite long enough to reach the \"Logs\" without unsafely holding the phone.  I guess this is where the voice command replaces the old habit of finger texting with voice texting.Despite the size, it's still an excellent all-in-one phone.  The though of going back to a smaller phone and the new iPad 3 has gone through my mind, but I'm sticking to the Note for now for the convenience of not having to carry a phone & a tablet.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Music Is Life\"", "ReviewID": "R2UK8MN028MZAF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't bore you with a long boring review for this phone...Its on fire, and you can see glorious remarks all over the web...One word to describe this phone....AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb phone--happy switch from the iPhone", "Author": "wendy", "ReviewID": "R1W7BGSQ5UCAQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edits a/o October 2, 2012 (the international version, Note I): Still 5 stars! As soon as the Note II is available in the US, I am buying it, though this time I will buy it through my carrier vs. an international version so I can take advantage of the LTE. My phone has gone through several system updates--all went flawlessly. I believe Jelly Bean is just around the corner. This is an awesome phone. I could never go back to the small iPhone screen. I eventually dropped my phone enough times to crack its screen (the crack extends from the lower left corner to upper right corner). After cracking the screen, I applied a screen protector film and the screen continues to work perfectly, despite the crack, as does the Wacom stylus--no hiccups in execution of drawing, etc.Edits a/o April 18, 2012 (the international version): Had to add that I've been using this phone for a few months now and I still marvel over it. I have dropped it several times and have noticed no scratches or problems--I am using the BoxWave Samsung Galaxy Note case which clearly is doing its job to protect. I was unable to cleanly apply any of the screen protector films, so am relying only on the BoxWave case. The volume rocker position is the only element that doesn't seem quite right. I hit it by accident sometimes when taking pictures or powering down the phone. I love the phone's size. When I look at my husband's iPhone now, I just can't imagine using a phone with such a tiny screen. I look forward to seeing this phone evolve. And now that AT&T; is selling the phone, I am running into people on the street who are asking about it or want to stop to compare notes because they are so excited about it.I also purchased the Hyperion batteries for my Note and they have worked very well. The back comes off easily, making it a snap to swap.Original:I have given this phone a 5-star rating because I can't find any fault with it. The phone is slick and beautifully designed. I had planned to wait till it came loaded with Ice Cream Sandwich, but am finding the interface very intuitive (even as an iPhone user). Still, I've downloaded the online manual because I keep discovering surprising features and I suspect there are things I will miss if I don't review the details.I switched from an iPhone 3GS. (My husband has the 4S and he grudgingly admires my NOTE--a lot!) When placed next to an iPhone, the Note's screen seems gargantuan, but after using it for a few days, it seems natural and not outsized.I did have trouble getting the Note set up and here is my account:My phone is the German version of the Note. I started to use the phone with wi-fi before inserting a SIM card. When I took the Note to a small AT&T; dealer, he removed my SIM from the iPhone and inserted into the Note. The phone could make and receive calls, but would not connect to the internet. I had entered the APN settings I had found online. He tried changing my data plan to tablet vs. smartphone. That didn't work either, so he changed the data back to smartphone. I then tried some new APN settings mentioned in this amazon review string (for cingular). Those didn't work either--until I did a factory reset of the phone. Then everything worked perfectly.I have also dropped the phone from eye level. I was framing a picture and my dog suddenly jerked the leash when she spotted a squirrel. I dropped the phone and it landed, fortunately, on a patch of dirt/grass next to the sidewalk. There were no scratches and everything continued to function as before. The case I had ordered hadn't arrived yet, so I count myself as lucky.Oh, and best of all, the Wacom stylus/writing feature is amazing! I use a Wacom tablet on my PC and this seems to work better. I don't have to struggle with any settings to get the pressure sensitivity to work and the stylus itself is very responsive. Another reviewer said he snapped a photo of his Christmas tree, added a note to it using the stylus and then sent it off. I tried the same thing and it all worked as advertised!The volume rocker and power button are in the same position, on opposite sides of the phone. I find I hit the volume rocker by accident sometimes, but that's just a minor quibble.Again, I give this phone 5 big stars: *****", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE THE NOTE!!!", "Author": "Morning Joy", "ReviewID": "R3L7JBTHQ3ZHE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my personal take on the Note with a nod to other Note fans/reviewers on here who have pretty much covered all the great and not so great features about this phone/mini-tab.I've owned my Note for around six months now and ordered this particular one through Amazon--the unlocked international version. Currently, the phone is not described as such, but it was when I bought it. I have the dark blue version, but you may as well just call it black.Right now, there seems to be some debate whether there is warranty coverage and there was when I bought it. I personally am in the dark about it and took quite a risk buying mine--with the exception that I bought it through Amazon, a company with a great return policy. But after six months, I am totally stoked and satisfied with this expensive little purchase.After using normal no frills cell phones for years, I decided to look into getting an i-phone and/or i-pad, maybe a kindle being an avid book reader, but for sure definitely wanted to upgrade my cell phone. I came straight to Amazon, as I always do, to look for cell phones with the highest ratings, specifically honing in on unlocked phones for a couple of reasons: I prefer the prepaid no contract option with carriers AND I wanted the phone to be ALL MINE.The highest rated reviews at that time(and still are) were for the international Galaxy Note, before the locked ones became available through the US carriers. The reviews SOLD me and I plunked down a little over $600, which to me is a better investment than purchasing a branded phone with a contract, which will cost you more in the long run. Plus, I get to choose my carrier because it's MY PHONE. Let me briefly explore that point because it's been addressed very thoroughly in other reviews. I use T-mobile prepaid, which right after I received my phone I went down to the local T-mobile store and told them I was looking to purchase a prepaid sim card for my unlocked phone. Not a problem. I went home and popped the sim card in and I didn't have to do anything else--no entering in additional numbers, nothing! That easy! Of course, I should point out that I had been a current customer of T-Mobile and when I purchased the sim card they updated all my information for that card to be used on my Note.Let's get back to the Note. It seems many Note fans are saying that their phone will fit in their pockets pretty easily. Even a woman reviewer on here mentioned she was 5'3 and her phone fit fine in her jeans pockets. I also am a similar sized woman of average weight and can tell you right now that my Note doesn't fit cozily in my pants pockets--front or back. I don't wear skinny jeans, either. And after spending that kind of money, I wouldn't dare let it dangle so precariously. My answer? I put it in my purse, in a compartment all it's own and it has even more protection because I bought one of those dandy little flip covers--which, by the way, you have to special order for the international Notes because the ones made in the US only fit the branded Notes. Of course, now we're brought to the realization that size could be an inconvenient factor with this phone. For me, it's a resounding NO!Here's why: For calling/talking purposes, I have a bluetooth earphone, which really is nice for any phone when you need to be hands free. (Aside from driving, how many times I bemoaned pushing an unwieldy shopping cart while holding a phone to my ear!!!) The big plus for me is that the Note IS bigger instead of competing with all the tiny phones. Then, it would just be a phone. Not a mini tab. If the Note were smaller, I doubt highly I would enjoy all those things which go beyond being a simple cell phone. A bigger screen means more readability and less eye strain. I mentioned really eyeing a kindle earlier. Not now. I downloaded the kindle app to my Note and I have taken to digital reading like a paperback! And with my flip cover, it feels just like a small book in my hand! The same thing holds true for being online. It is much more user friendly than a smaller screen. As it is, when I'm at home I prefer using my laptop when I'm online. But, when I'm away and have access to wi-fi, I don't mind using the Note one bit and am overjoyed that my screen isn't smaller.I've heard concerns from various folks on here about the ice cream sandwich update not being applicable to certain Galaxy Notes. Well, I'm here to say that I updated my Note just fine through the Kies software on my laptop. My phone has been updated to 4.0 firmware.Finally, I want to touch on battery life. I'm not a heavy user of my phone, except when I've downloaded a great book to read. Now, I have nothing like this phone, smartphone or iphone to compare it too, but it seems to me battery life is not the greatest. Internet activity is a big drain, watching movies via netflix, and reading books as I just mentioned. Recently, I pulled out my phone to check what app was using the battery the most and it turned out it was my display! There are settings to help with this and currently I'm still looking into it. As it is, when I'm using my phone at home, mainly for reading purposes (I just love having something that's the size of a small book to hold rather than reading with a laptop!!!) I keep my phone plugged in.For me, the Galaxy Note is an ideal phone/tablet all in one. I LOVE the size and probably would detest it if it were smaller. One reviewer mentioned he even wished at times it was bigger, but imo for portability any bigger wouldn't work. To me, it's just right for all the things I want to do with it when I'm away from home. My Note is for personal use, but it has all the tools necessary for business purposes and there's TONS of apps out there. Btw, the Note has a great camera which takes photos that are surprisingly good! Zoom is so so, but that's what professional cameras are for.I feel like I made the best choice possible out of any phone out there and except for the battery life, which might be a setting thing, I am very satisfied with my Galaxy Note!***UPDATE***Finding this out a little over a year later, but international Galaxy Note owners CAN register their Notes through the Samsung UK website, which I just today did.

Trust me, as far as performance in all aspects you can not do better than a Samsung; perhaps that is why Apple goes to Samsung for 1 out of 4 components in their iconic iPhone.Now for the negative: Samsung seems to be in a poor place as far as QC is concerned.  In both my GT-I9100 Galaxy S2 and GT-N7000 Galaxy Note the USB connector malfunctioned after only a short period of non-abusive everyday use.  If you purchase an international Samsung product in the US it may be difficult or impossible to get your device serviced under warranty.  The USB connector on my N7000 failed after only one week of use.  The phone was never dropped and was never exposed to water.

I mean for example, I am not a fan of touchscreen keyboard and I find it very challenging to type with it so I just use the voice input which is very convenient and accurate even though I speak English as a third language lol but it never is a problem with the Note it always recognizes what I want to say. Very smooth and feels good. One thing however is that the battery life is not that good if you use the internet too much but that is the same with all smartphones so cannot blame Gnote.When I purchased it from amazon it listed the Note having a US warranty but after waiting for 10 days and confirming it I am sure that this phone does not have any warranty in USA which is the only thing worrying me about this phone because after spending nearly $700 on a phone you expect some kind of protection. I might just go for a third party insurance or something but that is the only drawback of owning this phone that I have to worry about it a lot such as what if I drop it?

Everything about it exudes beauty and elegance. The screen is absolutely gorgeous and make me smile everytime I look at it. I was worried about it being too big but after getting it, I was amazed at how easily it is to fit into my pocket. Note is pretty thin and lightweight considering its size but it definitely seems to look bulkier than it really is.The screen looks decent under bright sunlight and under normal conditions, images are so vivid that they pop out from the screen. the audio and battery could use a bit improvement though. I also wish Samsung could improve on the \"plasticky\" feeling of the phone for being too light!Call quality is great. Its definitely clear and crisp. Reception is good and I don't experience any drop calls yet nor do I see instances where it goes straight to my voicemail like my Nokia pull on me sometimes. I may invest in a bluetooth headset soon as it will make my sometimes prolonged conversation more convenient. At home I still use my beloved Note for quick browsing. The browsing experience is phenomenal as it offers me a near native desktop browsing experience. I am sure with the new AT&T; LTE offering with note, it will only add to the satisfaction.Actually, I find the S-pen very useful, instead of just a gimmick. I used it in plenty of occasions, like jotting down some notes and using it to run errands. it served as yellow stickies for me. I have also used Note as a mini-whiteboard when running ideas with friends. It works great. Besides a tiny bit of lag time when writing, I totally loved this S-pen.I played with the camera quite a few times using various cute android camera app like Paper camera and cartoon camera. Its so much better viewing pictures in a huge high quality screen like this. Taking camera steadily in a big phone like this takes a bit to getting used to. A physical camera button will help a lot in this case. I found the pictures quality on par with my Sony 12megapixel camera. Nothing to complain in this department.I have however found the battery to be quite hot after using it intensively for a few hours. On few occasions where I just played games and watching videos non-stop for 2-3hrs, it got to be pretty hot and had to wait for it to cool down before putting it back in my pocket. Just an observation, as it maybe a common trait across all smartphones. I just never came across it til now since I had never spend so much time playing with a smartphone!It is the only smartphone that I recommend getting a second battery. Its not to say it has a weak battery but a testament of how addictive it can get playing with Note all day. Watching movies, reading comics, browsing are all common activities that I do with my Note even at home. I think Samsung Note just kill the 7\" tablet market.After only few weeks of owning it, now I wish it is bigger! I can't get enough of this gorgeous big screen. I have the Koi live wallpaper as my background. Oh my, what a great feeling it is to turn on the screen and see a life-like Koi pond. It gets to be pretty addicting playing with Note. I am also getting the desk charger so that it can act as my desk clock as well. sweet!This marvelous device is such an attention seeker that you are sure to get looks/attention from people around you. From the sea of smartphones, this unique device do stand head and shoulders above the rest.

It leads everybody in inches and pixels, is up there in terms of storage (save for the Iphone, but with the benefit of micro-SD storage), has a top of line processor, the standard day long battery life (which is a reach for many top of line Android devices, especially the beautifully built HTC line), and Samsung's signature plastic yet solid built. The camera, while not the best out there, is far superior to the Nexus' (which, remember, doesn't support micro-SD). The only way around it is not considering it a phone, but let's be honest here: it would be silly (if not moronic) to carry the Note AND a phone around; it fits (if barely) a pocket, it makes calls without a earpiece, so it's a phone. While I'm not particulary found of tablets, I do love smartphones, and I took the leap of faith to buy the huge \"phablet\" Note for phone only use. But really, make no mistake, it's a big phone, NOT a small tablet. And boy did a make a good choice. The screen is absolutely stellar to the point of putting my old HTC Deside HD to shame; there's no way to come back to the tiny 4.3 non-HD screen. It's funny how the once considered huge 4.3 screen has been dwarfed by the Note's. The performance is top-notch by any standart as it handles every task you throw it's way. And there's no complaint whatsoever about handling the big device. So much is said about the difficult one-hand use of the phone; well, it's a good thing then that I happen to have two of them! The lone problem for me is that I preferred to carry my old phone in the shirt pocket, but using the pants pocket is just fine. Granted, the Note doesn't ship with Ice Cream Sandwich, but it's a safe bet it won't take long for Samsung to upgrade the operational sistem. In short, there's no better Android option around, and I can guarantee you'll get used to the size of the device if you keep an open mind and care about quality and performance. As for the Iphone, you may get a better camera and more storage, but really, it's like comparing a Hyundai Sonata with a Fiat 500 (I live in Brazil; don't blame me, that's what I have here to compare).

As such, the quick-start manual came in Spanish and some vendors' apps will now download because they are unfamiliar with the model number.

The TiVo app, which I enjoyed on my former smart phone, does not even show up in the download list.  When I go to the TiVo website, it tells me my phone is incompatible, yet is SHOULD be, so I suspect that TiVo has not entered this model in its database yet.Also, I tried to use this phone with my Consumer Cellular account, taking the SIM card out of my Motorola Bravo smart phone and plugging into the Samsung Note.  I could make calls and I could connect to WiFi, but 3G/4G did not work.  Consumer Cellular told me that it won't because they didn't install their software on it.  So, I had to switch carriers to AT&T; for $30/mo more than Consumer Cellular was charging me.  Since the phone is slightly different, not all of the AT&T; features work and, of course, their custom software and apps are not pre-installed.Bottom line?  I LOVE the phone but not sure that the hassles I incurred are worth the savings by buying through Amazon.  In retrospect, I might have been better off to just buy the phone for $300 from AT&T; and agree to the 2-year contract.  My intention was to use it with Consumer Cellular, but that's not happening because of THEIR lack of flexibility.  I guess having an unlocked phone is good because if/when Consumer Cellular or other GSM phone provider will support it, I can switch-- which I could not do if I have an AT&T-supplied; phone (what I was told).

Schwed \"NYC\"", "ReviewID": "R2K5407WKIRBKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a tale of two reviews -- the Galaxy Note and the Android operating system (2.3.6). Told from the perspective of someone who has used Symbian (rooted), Windows Mobile (hacked with custom ROMs), iOS (since 3.1, and always jailbroken), but never Android. For the last two years, I have been comfortably ensconced with Apple, first on the iPhone 4, most recently on the 4S. But the small screen and, until last week (only after I ordered the Note), the lack of a jailbreak, had me coveting something larger and more customizable.Cut to the chase -- the Galaxy Note is a 5 star device. I can second the experience of most of the reviewers here and, although I have a few quibbles, it's a great phone/tablet. Android -- meh. Three stars, I think, especially compared to a jailbroken iOS 5.0.1 (which I now have -- thanks Chronic Dev Team!). Maybe I've gotten too used to the iOS ecosystem, but I just found Android horribly complicated, the Android Market difficult in terms of separating the wheat from the chaff, the Google voice recognition significantly inferior to Apple (if I had stayed with it, I would have definitely bought the keyboard that comes with Dragon), and the lack of a unified inbox in the default Gmail app frustrating as heck (yes, you can download K9 or use the built-in Samsung email app, but each has its shortcomings, like lacking a server search or having an ugly display or having no instructions (I figured it out eventually) for setting up push). I'm also not a fan of the soft menu and back buttons, which I invariably grazed and activated unintentionally. Would I have gotten comfortable eventually? Sure, and I probably didn't give it enough time before returning the Note (I recommend waiting to order until the \"fulfilled by Amazon\" link is offered if you think this might be a possibility for you too). But when the jailbreak for the 4S came out, I very happily reverted to that phone, small screen and all.So I offer that experience only in the spirit of possibly helping someone else contemplating the same move. Many people have switched from the iPhone to the Note happily. I just wasn't one of them. If you know and already like Android, this is a great phone. And, even if you don't know Android, your experience, obviously, may be different than mine.As for the Note itself, I will confirm what others have said: gorgeous display, great S pen, acceptably pocketable size (even in the front of tight jeans), responsive screen and scrolling, very visible outdoors, good and quick camera, fine audio and reception, and oh that screen size! Only real negative IMHO, as others have mentioned, is placement of the power button on the side. Either hard to find, or you accidentally hit volume (on the other side) when you do find it. I was not worried by the back cover -- it needs to be thin and light to keep the weight down, but I never felt I was in danger of breaking it.If you're on AT&T; (I'm in NYC), I can confirm you can simply pull your microSim card out of your iPhone, put it in a regular Sim adapter (available for a buck or two on Amazon) and use it in the Note -- and once you adjust the APN settings as outlined by other reviewers (I won't repeat here) you've also got data on top of voice. No call to AT&T; needed (although I separately confirmed that my grandfathered data plan would transfer over). One caution -- keep your network setting on \"GSM + CDMA\" -- even though AT&T; is only GSM -- or else you won't get 3G or HSPA data speeds. Took me a while to figure that out!Now, if only Apple would make a 4.3\" screen iPhone!

So why should the size bother you when talking is a secondary function anyway? But if you're the type that actually talks on the cell more than playing around with the \"smart\" features, then maybe you should fine one that's a bit more comfortable to hold. At first I was also weary and conscious of the size. But then my wife made a very poignant comment, she said.. \"You don't talk much on the phone anyway, so why should the size bother you?\" She's absolutely right, texting, browsing and multimedia is what I do most.

Like previous reviews have stated, Global Mobile was courteous enough to provide instructions on how to switch the OS language from German to English. That small detail along with the speedy delivery made me a Global Mobile fan for life. Now, moving on the the device itself. After opening the box, I was amazed at how big the phone was. I watched all of the youtube review/unboxing videos but they don't compare to the feeling you get when you actually have the device in your own hands in front of you. It is beautiful when it is off and then when you power it on for the first time, it is glorious. I installed angry birds to test the display res and when I played it for the first time, I smiled to myself. The game took up the WHOLE screen and the resolution was beautifully clear and colors just popped off the display. This coming from someone who has owned iphones for the last 4 years including the iphone4 with it's retina display. For those of you who are concerned about making the switch from iphone to android as I was, everything that you liked about the iphone can be enjoyed on the Note. And after 4 days with the Note, what I have come to love about it is how much more freedom I have gained making the move to android. Most of the apps that I paid for when I had the iphone are free in the android market. The boundries that I once had customizing the iphone to my liking are now a thing of the past. There are numerous ways to creatively customize the Note with all of the space on the screen and multiple widgets. The pictures that the 8 mega-pixel camera takes are awesome. The 1080p video is amazing although I recommend purchasing a 16 or 32GB micro SD for external memory before you get too crazy with the pictures/video becuase the 1080p video files are HUGE. I also enjoy the S-pen and the features that are provided with it. I have used it to sketch and I was surprised how responsive/accurate it was while using it. Some may not care for the S-pen too much but people that take notes frequently or love to sketch will find it to be very useful. The battery wasn't great at first only because I could never put the phone down but yesterday I made it through the day for the first time. All in all I believe that this is the best phone available currently and people hesitating to make the switch will not regret it once they do.

The HD screen was the key for me.  I own a Galaxy S II Skyrocket and live in a LTE area but I felt the display resolution of 800x480 was getting old in the age of higher resolution screens. LTE speeds are great but I wanted more resolution!I kept reading about the GNote on the boards and the reviews and it seems like everyone likes it!  It does everything well and the specs are very strong.  Of course the USA will get it until June 2012 (LoL) and I did not want to wait.  I wanted my GNote now!  I ordered from Global Mobiles and Amazon fulfilled the order. Shipping was fast and the product was just as described.  The GNote was set to default German language and there was a piece of paper in the Amazon box that explains how to change the language to English when you turned it on for the first time.My first impression was this looks just like a Galaxy S II but bigger!  The nice thing is that if you are familiar with touchwiz and Samsung, you already know how to operate this phone. I charged the phone to 100% first, so I could have a great time setting it up!  Once I saw that 1280 x 800 HD display I was amazed!  They have 5 HD photos and 1 video pre loaded and will blow you away!  Once I set the ATT APN, I was set with HSPA+ speeds.I really like the larger screen real estate.  I like having 5 icons across the screen.  Typing for text and emails is really easy now and my misspelled words have really decreased!  Of course the S pen is a new device to learn.  There are several \"how to\" videos on you tube on the GNote to learn how to utilize the features of the S pen, S memo, and S planner.  They really are neat!  Being able to take a screen shot of anything, PDF, picture etc and write on it and then share it is pretty cool!Battery life is very good as well!  Much better than my Skyrocket but I knew it would be!  My only concern at this time is how to carry it.  I have never been a pocket guy and usually wear a case and holster combo.  I have not yet found a combo that I like.  I have a S line TPU case for it and it is a great case for 7 bucks. I just have not figured this part out yet.If you are on the fence, there are plenty of videos on line and many reviews from the major tech websites that can help you make up your mind!

I've owned or test driven most of their devices over the past few years:  Galaxy tablet, GS2, tested the GS3, and now have the Galaxy Note to go along with the others.  I love the size of the Note most of all.  It's very similar to the GS2 which I've had for the past year in terms of its overall operation and navigation between the various features.  The Note is a solid unit and extremely user friendly.  I particularly like the keyboard which has been expanded from the GS2 so that you can enter both text and numbers from the same keyboard without having to toggle.I've only had the Note a couple of days at this writing so there's still a learning curve I have to experience on the use of the stylus and its various uses.  I've easily set up the Note to accept my various emails, gotten the Amazon Kindle to sync with it along with all my dozens of books, and have successfully downloaded and installed my favorite sites like USA Today and Twitter.  All that done with ease and without a hitch.  Ditto the voicemail, personalized greeting and again, no problems. I've yet to tackle the Skype video voice call system but do not anticipate any drama there either.  Also, the pictures and video recordings I've done with the Note have been first rate.  The test calls I've done are crystal clear and superior to the audio quality on the GS2.  The fact that the Note is still using the Gingerbread operating software is not an issue with me as it's the same as the GS2 and easy to use.  I prefer the old tried and true ways it goes about its business.  The new GS3 and ice cream sandwich OS?  Not so much.I am not easy to please when it comes to devices of this type.  Having gone through a couple of iphones, many Blackberrys and even the GS3 which I didn't particularly care for, I was ready to take the Note back to AT&T; for a full refund within their 30 day allotted period if the Note either frustrated me or simply didn't work the way I wanted.  No worries on those fronts with the Note. I bought the Note with a 2yr contract at a refurbished price of only $49 which is a steal for device as sophisticated as the Note!  It arrived in perfect order and looks/feels/responds as a brand new unit.  It's an excellent device in every sense.

And when the screen is running, I fall in love with it even more.<><><> Its unbelievable resolution....plus fast speed....plus big screen & numerous features....plus incrediby SLIM....equals SOLD!***About 4 weeks after, and the more I use it the more I like it.-Battery life is not a problem, because I shut down all active apps when I'm done with it (sure,why not).-Super AMOLED display is flawless, even under the sun. The screen is huge, you have plenty of HD screen estate for your pictures, movies/video, and web browsing.-It has a Home button, which the US version does not have.-The screen fits a lot of icons (5 rows vs 4 rows from other phones) which can be customized according to your preference.-supports gesture controls (turn to mute, tilt to zoom, etc)-Has Exynos with topnotch power.-It has a great video player that supports various files, plays in fullHD with ease-It has FM radio which the US version prob won't have.-Great camera, so you get great detailed pics. It has a photo editor, with lots of effects. Lots of tools like image stabilization, geotagging, face/smile/blink detection, scene modes, metering, and a lot more.-Browser plays 1080p flash video, love it.-Screen is very responsive to the touch. Three screen mode choices: movie, standard, & dynamic. Imagine that.-The S-pen? What a delight.WARNING: It may look a little big, but I assure you that you will feel that way ONLY in the beginning. You will get used to it after less than a day (or maybe even after a couple of hours). Because then you will start to realize that it is THE right size. Take it from me, I'm petite.****I really want it bare, because I want to flaunt this SLIM phone...but just in case- I got a nice slim case + screen protector for it, and it fits great.****Also, just downloaded the first set of major updates wherein the msg keyboard now has the numbers on it (no need to switch screens) and I love the one-hand opearation mode. And of course we get all the updates first (faster than the US version will get it).", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "AT&T; issues with forcing you to a tablet plan?", "Author": "Debt Free \"Eric\"", "ReviewID": "RNXMX026T3XEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just ordered the Note after selling my GSM Galaxy Nexus.  I have AT&T; in the US.  After reading numerous complaints from Note users on AT&T;, it seems they are receiving texts from AT&T; saying they need a tablet data plan.  If ignored, AT&T; simply shuts down the data, rendering the phone useless.Is this even legal?  I am nervous about putting my SIM in this thing when it arrives since I have grandfathered unlimited data.  If AT&T; plays games and tries to cancel my plan, claiming this large phone is a tablet (which it is NOT a tablet) I will be supremely pissed.So, AT&T; users in the US.  When did you put your SIM in for the first time and how long have you used it without threats from AT&T;?  Those who did get a threat, how long did it take?*** 12/20 edit ***In an effort to fiend off the angry mob of negative voters, I'd thought I would add to my review.  Received my Note yesterday, rooted it, backed up and deleted the EFS folder, set the APN settings and all seems to be well.  Working fine and it's an amazing device.  I do still, worry that AT&T; will hunt me down with the accusatory text saying I'm using a tablet not a smartphone.So, for now, I plan on keeping this for a long time as it's an incredible device.  If AT&T; acts up, I'll return it and get something else.  So, if you are on the fence and have AT&T; in the US, don't just plop you SIM in and go unless you want to open a debate with the carrier about a tablet vs. phone argument.*** Additional Edit ***Keep down rating me all you want, but I have a gift for you all.  I personally worked with product managers at AT&T; and they realized the Note's IMEI's were incorrectly classified as tablets.  Because of my working with them, an issue was identified and corrected with the Note's IMEI and now they are recognized in AT&T;'s system as a smartphone.Since links are deleted, go to XDA-developers dot com, forums, Galaxy Note, Q&A; forum and see the thread titled \"AT&T; users of Galaxy Note - I was able to remedy the tablet issue!!!\"Have a good one and I would appreciate all the knee-jerk negative ratings to be re-thought.

I contacted the President of AT&T; and heard back from the Vice President. After several phone conversations later, the Director of Marketing was able to identify the error and fix this issue resulting in Note IMEI's to appear as smartphones, not tablets.In short, buy the Note, put your SIM in, and your good to go. No issues with accusatory tablet texts. Here is the message I received (names redacted)**********I just spoke with our supply chain team and we figured out the issue - a digit was transposed when we loaded in a set of IMEI TAC ranges to our systems in October and this resulted in classifying a subset of Samsung Galaxy Note products erroneously. Your IMEI range was not impacted and your product will work without issue and without concern of losing your unlimited smartphone data plan experience.To be clear, you have not actually received any \"alerts\" from AT&T; about data plan eligibility because you have not moved your SIM card into the Samsung Galaxy Note product as of yet? You can do so without issue at this time.***********So, I'm not one to take credit, but I sure did take this issue to the top of AT&T; and it all appears to be well.Great news for us Note users in the US.

However, the phone was half the price of the soon-to-be-released SG3, although it didn't have \"Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS),\" and it's processor had slightly lower specs. In operation, I found it to be very fast and responsive, even after I installed another launcher that caused my old phone to \"choke.\" I am VERY HAPPY with the volume on this phone. The speakers are loud and clear (for a cell phone), and the in-call volume is great (I'm hard-of-hearing - so that's a big deal for me!).The phone is very thin, if that's important to you (I think this concern is just an overblown advertising gimmick perpetrated by the \"fruit\" company. What finally got rid of my \"buyer's remorse\" completely was when I found out that the phone CAN be updated to ICS. Just Google ICS and Samsung Note and you'll find simple instructions. The phone does everything I want it to do and that it does it quickly and seamlessly. It never freezes or chokes. With Aldiko - a reading app, and the Kindle app, I can read all my books without squinting thanks to the huge screen, and the sound is great. Enjoy this phone for half the cost of the competition and use a pre-paid GSM SIM to get unlimited phone, text, and data. As an aside, I am using this phone with pay-as-you-go T-Mobile (under the brand name SIMPLE mobile - with unlimited everything). The phone WILL NOT GET 3G on T-Mobile, it only gets EDGE, but I find that getting UNLIMITED data makes up for that, and it is fast enough to stream Youtube etc. The phone WILL get 4G on AT&T;, but I cannot find a true unlimited plan from AT&T;, so scr*w them. On the other hand, because the phone is unlocked, I can use AT&T; pre-paid anytime I want to if I really need 4G and I don't mind being ripped off.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent device...", "Author": "galonp \"efren59\"", "ReviewID": "R3N7RRG9KJ5LWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is a product that meets user expectations.

Small gripe - not many cases or Samsung accessories to be had yet - but starting to become available.2.  Ships with Gingerbread - but Ice Cream upgrade is going to be available soon (according to Samsung).Overall:I was looking for a full functional device with extreme portability - and it has delivered big time.

I knew before that it was coming in the market, read its reviews online and waited anxiously for it. I am very happy that I bought this phone cum tablet and because of its larger size, it is much better for me that Samsung Galaxy SII.I have previously bought Samsung Galaxy SII as the larger screen phone (4.3\" display) and was very happy with it but found that the screen was smallish for me and so I looked forward to a bigger phone. I found Samsung Galaxy Note (5.3\" display) to be that wish come true although I still sometimes feel that I can even be fine with 6\" screen size.So after more than a month of use, following are my conclusions:Review Highlights:Price:It is more than iPad2 and all the other tablets I have seen till now but as it is unique, I am compelled to pay. If it was at a lower price, it would have been better.Size and Weight:Samsung Galaxy Note is the largest of phones available in the market. Because of it large size and Android Gingerbread 2.3, it is a very nice mini-tablet as well as a secondary phone. Unless there is a 6\" phone-cum-tablet is launched, this is the best phone-cum-tablet your money can buy. Its weight (178g)is perfectly acceptable considering the size of the phone and its thickness (9.65mm) is nearly as of Samsung Galaxy SII (8.49mm), a really thin phone.Display:Very nice Super AMOLED display and it is really great watching movies and photos on this big display. It feels like a mini-tablet and it displays very well. Because of high pixel density (285ppi), the text and details are very smooth.Speed:The speed is good due for dual core (1.4GHz dual core) processor and I don't feel it slow. Although when I installed more than 15 apps, then I found it getting slower and sometimes was taking too long to start an app. Therefore, I always try to keep only those apps installed which I actually need.Battery Life:It depends upon how many apps are running in the background, whether the phone is in energy saver mode, the WiFi is switched on or not and the extent of brightness of display. A CPU hogging app can drain the battery within few hours but if I use WiFi selectively, keep brightness to near minimum brightness (which is still fine for display), in energy saver mode and just run basic applications and minimize widgets, I can get battery life of up to a day. I suggest not using Samsung Galaxy Note as your main phone as you may end up connecting to charger all the time. Use it as a tablet and secondary phone, along with another primary phone and that is the way it brilliantly shines.Android Gingerbread 2.3 Experience:I like its user interface and widgets but I have uninstalled some widgets to keep it fast and have low battery usage. Widgets take a lot of battery life and also use CPU continuously as well so I always uninstall Samsung widgets that I do not need.As a Phone:It feels big as phone but I do not use it as my main phone. My main phone is Blackberry Bold 9780 and so I use Samsung Galaxy Note as secondary phone. For secondary usage, it is fine although I do not like the fact that at higher sound volumes, the telephone call sound from ear piece is loud enough that people nearby can hear the conversation. Therefore, during calls I reduce the earpiece volume. The speakerphone is very good and video calling through Skype is very enjoyable.The large touch keys and display makes it very easy to use it as a phone.As a Tablet:It is very nice as a small tablet. My son uses it for gaming and likes gaming on this phone a lot. For me, I can browse internet much better than a Samsung Galaxy SII, read emails better and its kindle app is great. I feel that a kindle 6\" is not required when you have this phone. As it is not an Eink screen, I can read it well during night when lights are switched off.There are many apps in the market but I install only those ones that I really need as I want to save memory, CPU usage and battery life. Many of the apps keep running in the background after usage once so a number of times, I go in Settings> Manage Applications to clear cache and stop applications that I do not require running.Use with Data:It has usual GSM, WCDMA and HSPA+ capabilities and I have seen its performance to be very good.Photos:Photos look brilliant on this phone and its both front and dual cameras are excellent. The low light photos are not as great as a dedicated camera but its LED flash is strong as well.Videos:It has taken very nice family HD videos and I really like those. It plays videos very smoothly as well. Because of brilliant display, dual cameras (8MP rear and 2MP front) which take good shots and videos, and efficient microphone, it is an excellent device for photos and video capture and playback.Sensors:I have mainly used the Accelerometer which works fine. I am not a huge fan of digital compass in a mobile phone. The digital compass in phone always behaves erratically.Two features that I want:1. I need a similar touch button as for Wi-Fi switch on and off TO switch on and off the usage of data using Mobile networks.Final Verdict:Excellent secondary phone and a small tablet. Use another phone as primary phone and you will be fine. Keep widgets and running apps to minimum and you will be happy with it.Use of a plastic cover and front display screen guard will keep the phone safe even when it uses Corning Gorilla glass to prevent scratches.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone / tablet", "Author": "Dennis H.

If you can look pass that, you might consider it because of precisely that, the screen size. You would also expect that because of this screen, that one of the main usage of this device would be for video playbacks/pictures etc.And you would be right - Samsung marketed it as all about their screen as well. However, do beware that it has absolutely horrible banding/screen issues that makes watching any videos with dark scenes (or anything with dark shades of grey for that matter) impossible - they all show up as dirty dark blocks/blobs. (for details, you can read all about it at [...] or [...] or [...]) or just google \"samsung note screen issues\").The sad part is that their previous AMOLED phones didn't have such issues, but the latest 2 in the series (Note and Nexus) both do! They definitely changed something up in their production recently.When i brought it to Samsung's attention, they refused to acknowledge the problem and claimed that it was perfectly fine. The service center I was at even went as far as to suggest that since their sample model phone they had at the back exhibited the same artifacts, that my phone looked to be in perfect condition. Looking around on various web forums, it seems like this is a fairly widespread problem across Samsung notes (and not the only screen problem mind you, just the most obvious one) and apparently it's due to some poor QC on their part and you might get one that's good (apparently low probability), or one that's horrible like mine. You can try returning it if you're in the US etc but sadly that's not an option in my country, and it's different everywhere, so yes, do check amazon's return policies or wherever else you might buy it before you press the buy button! You just might utilize it for the first time on this particular phone!So yeah, it's basically a lottery to see if you can get a working one. I went around various shops to look at the display units, and they all have varying amount of such screen issues. It would be the above-mentioned bandings or weird screen flickering or strange tints or various combinations of the above, so I'm not even sure what the probability of a \"perfect working set\" is.Some folks even reported that they have exchanged as much as 10 Notes in an attempt to get one such unit. Since that was not an option for me in my country, all I can do is suck it up and not watch videos/photos with an over-sized smartphone that I basically use like its smaller and much cheaper alternatives :(Or so I thought. Until even with very minimal usage, it was barely 2 months old before the next problem arose - the wifi broke. I just got it fixed a few days ago, but I'm just waiting to see what the next problem will be with this expensive abomination that could have been a great phone, but instead ended up as a frustrating and expensive lesson learnt to never buy anything from Samsung again. The only thing I can do now is hope that the problem is with the software and that ICS (which samsung keeps delaying, prolly due to this very problem) would solve it. I doubt so though.So in conclusion, if you're looking to watch videos on-the-go or use it as a photo-book, get their competitors instead. If you just want a phone with basic web functions/emails and such, get something cheaper instead, you'll end up at the same place after all without a hole in your pocket nor a rock in your pocket.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware N7000B", "Author": "Mac Wizard \"Mac Wizard\"", "ReviewID": "RWGCS3BP7O0PB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY GALAXY NOTE N7000B.

It's thin, so I could easily drop it into my work pants, but jeans...that's another story. The size is great for viewing email, watching movies, or texting, but is a hassle to use as a phone and walk around with.The S-Pen works pretty well. It's a magnet based stylus technology that allows you to take screenshots and mark them up, process signatures, draw on pictures, etc. I wouldn't use it, but I could see why people would like this. The pen is small though, and could seem uncomfortable for normal use. It easily slides into the phone for storage.Bottom line, if you're going to use the S-Pen and don't mind a giant phone, pick this one up.

This feature alone is worth more money than any other phone/tablet on the market.The size?  It looks really big but it actually fits in a tight jean pocket with lots of room left for other things due to its slim form factor.The best feature on the Galaxy Note?  Its 2500mAh battery lasts you full 2-days on medium use and at least 1 1/2 days on heavy usage.  I've never seen a phone that lasts as long.Why unlocked Galaxy Note?  All the U.S. carriers will have this phone eventually but its not going to be the same as this \"original\" version plus the software support on original versions are much better, more ROMs also when you root your phone.I love my new phone/tablet, throwing away all my 10.1-inch tablets, they are so outdated already once you get this.

I was unable to use the cellular parts of the phone because of this.I was intrigued with the Note since it launch due to the impressive specs and I felt the very large screen would be a plus since I read a lot of e books on my phone.I was hesitant to buy this because of my very poor experience using ATT's Captivate primarily because of TouchWiz but this phone has the latest TouchWiz version and no carrier bloat and had very good reviews so I decided to give it try.First impressionWow! beautiful phone,awesome display, bright, and vibrant.I like the home button, its convenient having a very easy to find way to wake the phone in the dark.Camera took very nice pictures, a bit better than the Nexus but not nearly as fast as the Nexus.No Carrier bloatware and tethering is enabled just like it should be.The bad (my opinion)TouchWiz, I really enjoyed the minimalist software approach the Nexus has. TouchWiz has taken the opposite approach, there are loads of apps I may not use and nearly every application has been modified from the stock versions in some way. This wouldn't be so bad except you can not uninstall them for example social hub, music hub, readers hub, and photo editor. These are just some that I would have chucked if I could.I find TouchWiz to have no advantage over the stock launcher and would rather just not have it to start with.What I would like to see from Samsung and for that matter any android phone manufacturer is a stock Android install where the custom applications and launcher are optional and can be installed or removed at will. This would perhaps make updating the OS quicker and get the Android community closer to having a current os on every device.Yes, I could have rooted and installed custom firmware but would rather not spend my time fixing something that shouldn't be broken to start with.I returned the phone due to the SIM socket problem and ordered another Nexus because of TouchWiz.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung move the Power button", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R1MGHKANAJW9DT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the Note for over a week now and have been very pleased.  I have not had the screen issues that some others have complained about. This is the second Android phone I have owned, my first was the Google Nexus One that I purchased the day it came out. So I was interested to see what Samsung had added to the pure Android experience.  I was pleased that Samsung did not get carried away adding their own UI over the default Android os. I like having much more screen for icons and widgets.  It so far seems to perform fast I do notice a little lag when pressing the power button to wake the phone, but it isn't a problem just something I am not used to yet.  The placement of the power button seems awkward to me.  When holding the phone in my left hand and reaching for the power button to sleep the phone my thumb naturally lands on the volume rocker and adjusts the ringer volume up or down.  This is more of a aggravation than any thing else, but if Samsung had just moved the button to the top of the phone it would not be an issue. So far all the apps work fine.  I did notice when I installed Swiftkey X for phone that Swift key brought up a message to use Swiftkey for Tablets instead.  I just ignored the message and have had no issues with Swiftkey X.

Root attempts: 1 (success first try) I loved this phone when i first got it but now that i own a Note 2 the Note 1 seems a little slow to load apps after having a few aftermarket background processes like yahoo mail, auto sms, multiple game auto update's etc.Pros:-replaces a camera, phone, tablet, and most desktop PC programs. No need to carry a ton of gadgets.This fits in your pocket!-very fast with stock Android OS-Dropped it twice with case and took zero damage.-Even with only 8GB internal and the 8GB SD i have, i never really seemed to run out of space but using Google+ auto picture/video upload feature is highly recommended because you can just delete the videos once they are on Google+-Pros definitely outweigh Cons, so i do recommend this product but if you can afford to get a Galaxy Note 2... get the International N7100 instead... every thing loads faster and the 2GB RAM on Note 2 makes a HUGE difference.Cons:-Somewhat little laggy with Jellybean 4.1 or higher-Battery doesn't last very long with normal to medium-heavy use, especially after installing a Jellybean ROM. I recommend having at least 1 spare batteries to swap out in the middle of the day if you play a game here and there.-Lose about 5 to 8 feet of range on wifi if you have a protective case on it but this seems to happen with all phones or ipods that use wifi.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can this be set to Russian and work in Tajikistan?", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"PolyglotRach1989\"", "ReviewID": "R1IOXBZDWQ5A66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm taking my chance to ask, so if anyone knows-will this work in Tajikistan and can this be set to Russian interface? it's important,i'm searching for a great smartphone either Samsung or this or Nokia to give to a friend speaking Russian and in Tajikistan..anybody who knows,please tell me,", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "good seller, but samsung does not worth that much", "Author": "feiya", "ReviewID": "RRW44GP4NNOD1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Maybe it's because I'm using IOS, I could not get used to Android that easily.

Yes, it has most amazing bright HD screen and it DOES fit into front pocket with room to spare. The device is super responsive and it DOES NOT feel odd to hold it by the ear. It is THE mobile device and I have never been this impressed by a gadget... But I am experiencing 2 issues with this phone and is wondering if this is due to hardware design problem or maybe I just received the faulty unit.1) In-Call Volume problem with Galaxy Note (Deal Breaker)The \"In-Call\" volume on SGN is way too low. Headset/Speaker volume is fine and they can also be further boosted by using Volume+ app from the Market but I cannot seem to find any cure for the low In-Call volume. It is almost unusable while driving with window down. I have currently work around this issue by turn on the speaker for each and every call. I do not believe I should need to do this.2) Inconsistent Network Speed with Galaxy NoteOnce I plugged in the SIM card and manually set the mobile network by entering the APN, I was able to get the AT&T; data service onto my new SGN but I noticed that the network icon (EDGE/3G/HSPA+) keep changing between 3G and HSPA+... I also noticed that it switched to HSPA+ when it actually try to download network packages (email/internet/yourtub...etc) and it has connectivity problem when 3G icon is displayed. This behavior of constantly switching network antenna will result in poor battery drain and degrade the user experience.Please let me know if anyone else are also experiencing the similar challenges. Thank you very much for your time.------------------- Update 01.03.2012 ---------------------The recent firmware update from Samsung resolved the issue of \"In-Call\" Volume being too low...Hence changing the rating from 2 star to 4 star.There is still network lag when it switch from 3G to HSPA+ for internet use. Most of time, it is less than 5 sec but sometimes (based on where) it could take up to 25 secs.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be careful!", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R135YA455UVNRV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am sure this is a great phone and all, but When i opened the box and tried to put my T-MOBILE sim card in. . .it wouldn't fit!

The reasons for giving a 4 star are:1. The phone got locked up by the \"unexpecting error\". After some research, I believe this is the Android problem and happen mostly on Samsung and HTC phones and tablets. I did not want to reset the phone to clear this error because there would be a lot of custom re-configuration of the phone to be taken place. So I called Samsung USA, none of the three support staff I spoke were knowledgable to know about this common problem at all. Later they found out this phone was not yet available in the U.S. and then told me they could not provide any support. What a joke. So, I ended up reseting the phone and it works fine so far.2. The phone is for the European market. So it does not come with the Asian language pack (except Korean...Duhhhh). The seller should mention this in the product description.3. The phone came brand new to me because the way it was sealed. This made me the happiest. All phones I've got in the past from the local T-Mobile authorized dealers were opened and used and they still claimed they were brand new. When you had no option, you could only pretend you believe them. Now I figured out how to get a brand new phone you will like/love but you can still get your cash rebate from the local mobile phone authorized dealers will offer.4. The price of the phone dropped by 7% right after Amazon shipped the purchase. Amazon allowed to return the phone but not refunding the difference because this phone was not sold by Amazon directly. I decised to keep the phone because I believe it was brand new.5. The phone is big for me. Almost all of the time I need both hands to operate the phone, though I can hold it with one hand comfortably. Well, I like the big screen. So this is not my complaint. This is for other's information.6. Similar, it is a bit big for my pants back pockets. I can't button the pocket at all so there is a big chance it will fall out of the pocket, especially when you sit or bend down. Better to keep it in the front pocket but makes the pants look funny.7. This phone is perfect for business, design professionals and web lovers. So I am not going to describe all the good things this phone offers.8. Oh, one moe thing: the phone's material is somewhat cheap or flimsy. I am scared every time when I have to remove the battery cover because it can be broken very easily. I am also scared the phone can break in half if you bend it because it is pretty thin and wide.9.

You will not like this device on your nightstand...  Even adjusting to minimum screen dimming it lights up the entire room.  Dimming adjustment should be programmed to dim to zero and/or almost zero brightness. 3- Also while docked, there are no options as to what notification you get or not.  At night I would like to receive phone calls only and nothing else (no email, SMS, appointments, etc.).  Again, simple programming option could be written and included in updates to software. The only option is full silent. Maybe the programmers need to use a Blackberry for a week to get some good ideas in this area of in-out of protective cover and the automatic \"bedtime mode\" options while docked.  4- Do you want to watch a screenplay of your pictures and videos on your HDTV?  Forget it.  Even if you buy Samsung's own HDTV Smart Adaptor, it simply does not work.  You will have to upload media to your computer, watch it there, or transfer to a device that will work through a HDMI port on the TV.  Bottom line of this lack of functionality is a big disappointment if you plan to use the Galaxy Note to show presentations on any hotel A/V systems.  5- Also, there is no way to find/control your phone from the Internet.  The European model manual says that when you log on to your Samsung account and your Gmail account at the same time it automatically connects your PC and Galaxy Note.  US model does not. 6- The pen is cute and seems like a fun tool but, you handy work will crash if you attach as an MMS. It will attach to an email just fine. Also, if you touch the screen with your palm while handwriting over any of the bottom buttons, it will launch that button.  Again, programming should disable those buttons at the bottom while you are using the pen.  And, last for now, and the WORST:  Samsung support has not been helpful with any of the above.

But what it ended up being was it was too small for a tablet and too big for a phone. This phone is uncomfortably big for it to be no longer a one hand device. Only when you lose the ability to use your phone one handed do you realize how much of an inconvenience it is. I already knew that size might be an issue and was fully prepared to deal with it for the ability to use it as a tablet. But disappointingly that was not to be.  The problem of using this as a tablet is the screen resolution (800 pixel width in portrait mode) is just not enough to read web pages and books(pdf). The text is slightly smudged when displayed on 800 pixel width display, but becomes really hard to read when that screen is 5.3 inches, 800 pixel width is perfectly fine on a larger(7 inch or bigger) tablet as the slightly smudged text would still be large enough to easily read, but not on 5.3 inch screen. I ended up using the landscape mode to read books and webpages, which made the point of having a device of this size pointless. I can do the same with no difference on a 4.5 inch screen too. The point I am trying to make is when I went for this device the expectation was to be able to read webpages and books in portrait mode without having to scroll, but the device resolution fails at this. So Samsung if you are reading this review, you have made the almost perfect all in one device, please bump up the resolution(width should have more than 1000 pixels ideally 1600x1000) of this device, other wise this would be a almost but not enough device.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "2/18/12", "Author": "Dan Deforest", "ReviewID": "R219EUL2VPQPL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "since i am an att customer with an upgrade available i will be able to purchase it for $199 on amazonwireless on 2/19/12. i too will sell my iphone 4s.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY IT USED!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Balme\"", "ReviewID": "R3UXS05KD7V362", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just to warn you not to buy this cellphone used.
