From the very beginning, I saw that this phone was meant for business users. While the UI isn't as flashy as android, there is no lag, no constant avertisements, and it was integrated with all the MS products that I use for school and work. Best of all, I really loved the way everything just worked. I have not expericenced a single crash or had to search the app store for something that should have been included with the phone in the first place. The only downside to this phone was, of course, the app store itself. Although, I never play games or use social media, certain utility and financial companies, do not have an app for WP8. I was a little unhappy, but I would glady use a web-browser page in the meantime.If you just want a phone that just works, I highly recommend giving this one a try. The os is smooth, your privacy is respected, and you don't have spam in your face 24/7. It gets you in and out of your life without requiring you to spend hours of your time on the web looking for solutions and reviews for the most basic applications.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent work Nokia and Microsoft..", "Author": "Kenneth W.

This is not even the top of the line 1025 and it has so much more functionality than the iPhone 5s.  I am sure that the iPhone 5.xxx or 6.x will catch up at some point .. :) It is funny because I was so much into Apple products for the last 10 years, considering a different product would have been uncivilized until Apple released IOS7.  What a piece of crap!  This Nokia 925 is fast, easy to use and I must admit Microsoft finally got it right with this OS unlike Window's 6.5 they tried years ago.  I love the media and others talking about the massive APP store with Android and IOS because the windows store has the majority of the key APPS and adding hundreds of APPS every week.  Most of the APPS in the IOS and Android stores are crap anyway so if you remove the crap from all the stores how many APPS are there amongst the different stores.  Nice job Nokia/Microsoft, keep improving and stay the course.  Smart people will eventually start migrating over as long as you maintain a quality product like these lines of phones and the Surface tablet.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast delivery and awesome phone", "Author": "Cristian Ortega G\u00f3mez", "ReviewID": "R2UGIQIIKXJJP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from Europe and this phone came with an European power adaptor.I absolutely love the phone.

Almost zero gap.  There is some creaking from the back plastic but no flex in the phone itself.  I like the metal surround compared to the all plastic Nokias/Windows Phones.-Size: Not too big, not too small.-Screen: Not the highest pixel density but great contrast from the OLED.-Reliability: What Nokia is known for (with some embarrassing exceptions).  No issues with the hardware including LTE.-Camera: Not as great as the 1020 but good.  Also, the 1020 looks weird with the camera hump.  However, I don't take pictures with my phone.Cons:-Software: Both Windows Phone 8 and Apps.  MS was late to the smartphone game (due to a hard reset) and it shows.  Common things like being able to change the ringer volume and media volume separately and having a notification light is difficult/missing.  However, the OS is very stable.  App store is a disaster with no support from Google (of course) and lack of basic apps.  The update cycle from MS is slower than Android or iOS which is insane considering they are behind in the first place.-Specs: Absolute mid-tier compared to Android phones.  However, considering Windows Phone OS is more streamlined (limited/basic?) there seems to be no performance issues.-No micro SD card support: Enough said.-No removable battery: Seems like the trend but bothersome since it does not have the best battery life.-USB Charge port on top: Makes the phone upside down on the nightstand.-No induction charging without a back cover/case that must be purchased separately: Would be less of an issue if the case was not so ugly.Overall, a good phone and one I enjoy using along with numerous other (mostly Android) phones.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good switch from Blackberry 7", "Author": "Lyndon Williams", "ReviewID": "R1X2MO2VYRQEV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Blackberry 9780 for the last 3 years, and was enjoying it until I saw reports of Blackberry not doing so well on the market anymore.I started looking at replacement options.

Several months ago I bought a Nokia Lumia 810 through T-mobile. A few months ago I had to send it back because it was having problems. Since they were no longer making the Lumia 810 at that time they sent my the Nokia Lumia 925 to replace it. And I am really glad that they did. Even though the Lumia 925 don't have the removable memory like the Lumia 810 with the built in 16 GB of memory I don't even miss it. Because I didn't have too much music are videos on my old phone anyways. Only a little over 1.5 GB. With 16 GB of space I still have plenty of space for all of the music and videos I had in the first place. The 16 GB of memory gives me twice as much memory as the Lumia 810 for apps and games. Plus there is still the 7 GB Skydrive that comes with the phone that you can also use for music, videos, and pictures if needed to free up space on your phone. And you can login to your SkyDrive from any were that the internet is available with any internet compatible device. I am also a big fan of the Windows 8 OS. I have been ever since that Windows 8 came out for the PC. I updated both my All in one touch screen PC and my Laptop the day that it was released. Both of these had Windows 7. The Windows 8 OS for smartphones is the best OS available on the market to this day. This is by far the best smart phone that I ever had. I have had all of the available OS they have on the market. I like the Windows 8 OS  better then all of them. The Nokia Lumia 925 also has a really great camera on it with a 6 ellament lens on it unlike 5 that come with most smartphones come with today. The 8.7 mega pixel camera takes great quality pictures/videos that are up there with very high end SLR digital cameras out there. If I was to tell you everything that j like about the Nokia Lumia 925 phone I will be typing for hours. Mater of fact I am writing this using my Lumia 925 phone. I can do just about anything on this phone that I do on my Windows 8 PC/Laptop. I take it everywhere I go. I even use Internet Explorer 10 which is included with the OS to do my online college homework. I also love the idea that it comes with Microsoft Office. And I can download Xbox games with it. Including Xbox 1 games coming some. And again with the 16 GB of built in memory I can download a lot of games on it plus still have space for other things like apps, photos, music, and videos. To top it off the Snapdragon 1.5 Ghz processes (my opinion one of the best processes in the world for smartphones) helps this phone run smoothly and really runs all of the apps and games really well. It also makes multitasking really easy. With this processer you can run many things at the same time. I am in my 3rd year of college studying computer information science in the programming field. And some of the classes I had to take covers smartphones. In my opinion I would recommend this phone to anyone that would like a really nice high end smartphone. And the price is right to. The main things you should remember is that Nokia is the number 1 makers of phones. The Windows 8 OS is number 1. And Nokia broke the mode when they made the Lumia Windows phones. Take it from me. I am now a computer tech. And work on computers and smartphones every day. The Nokia Lumia 925 is simply the best. And with the upcoming updates it will only get better.

And the phone's 8 MP camera actually puts out some very nice snapshots that you won't mind sharing on Facebook or via the now-available Instagram.The phone's performance is \"peppy\" and I have not noticed any slow down at all. Switching between apps is very easy, simple and fast. The only thing I find odd is not closing apps - Windows Phone just expects you to leave apps open and they will eventually close themselves after a set amount of time of non-use. Yeah, you can do ctrl-q, but that's not really what the developers intended (which is odd).The Windows Phone 8 store doesn't have as many games as say, the iOS or Android ecosystems, but what is there is not bad. My favorite mobile game, Contre Jour, is available, though things like Candy Crush are not, which really has me scratching my head.If you are looking for a good camera, attached to an easy to use OS and makes good quality calls, then the Lumi 925 is a darn fine choice. Just realize you aren't getting all the apps (many of which people don't use, though some people DO use are still not available natively) as the Android/iPhone equivalents and you should be happy.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "the best phone ever", "Author": "alvaro", "ReviewID": "R3EGUJOMB4KRG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this phone, honestly it has nothing to envy to android nor iphone ... all the apps that i use are available at the windows store", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "There is no other software better programmed", "Author": "Gabriela Hammerer", "ReviewID": "R2OC5U9CDYRPOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im giving it 5 stars, because of the reasons im giving you next:1.- With only 1 gb RAM and 1 Ghz, it runs a lot better than any ios or android device.2.- The personalization.

Me and my family went to Disney World, we have a proffesional photocamera, but no, we took the photos with this little guy.Those were the Pros, now the contras1.- The Nokia Market (App store/ Google Play) has not that much of apps. But its growing, so in a year or so it will have a lot more (i believe).2.- It's hard to find a hardcase for this or any nokia lumia, due to the amount of people that have one.3.- Internet Explorer. I know a lot of people say Internet Explorer is bad (and it is) but not in the nokia lumia. Its like the safari in ios, but with another name/logo. But, (at least today 01/18) there is no Firefox/Chrome app in the market.I Hope this helped you for deciding if your going for this.

The windows OS is ok and should satisfy most ordinary people with no high demand for their phones. It gets basic things done. The quality of apps are definitely not on par with iOS or even Android. But you do have many of the essential apps, minus some of the hottest ones.However, the SIM Card tray is so fragile. Not only did the metal piece fell off because of weak glue, the entire SIM tray just failed to work after some time. I did swap SIM card many times, but I have done way more with iPhone and never had a problem. Nokia Lumia 925 just stopped recognizing any SIM card all of a sudden.After I send it in for repair, it not only took almost 2 weeks to get it back, they refused to repair it claiming \"corrosion due to water damage or high humidity environment\"  \"and/or\" physical damage.The phone was not water damaged. And even if it is, they can't just claim so but must show some evidence for it. If by physical damage, they mean I \"broke\" the SIM card tray, that's ridiculous because it broke because their poor quality and design flaws. If they have 50% of the sim card tray design quality of iPhone even since 2007, I am sure it would not break at all.PS: the screen is also not has durable as iPhone.

It doesn't have a NEST or KEVO or whatever-it-is app. It just got Instagram. It's a chicken/egg issue (devs don't make apps without the user install base already there, while the base can't ever get there without the apps). If you can get past that (I can, I don't give a s*** about Instagram) the OS is fast, easy-to-use, different and a great alternative to iOS and Android. 4/5HARDWAREThis phone is beautiful and the processors allow responsive multitasking. It's very similar to the Lumia 920 except lighter, thinner. Of course the recent famous LUMIA camera tech stomps competitors into the ground. There's a key problem here. I just got this stupid thing and 1 day later it's already completely out of space. Although there are versions of this thing with 32gb, this ain't one of 'em. It has no micro-SD. Lesser Lumia models have micro-SD. Why not the higher end? While pics and other things can be offloaded to OneDrive, apps can't. I have no pics, no music, nothing but the OS and apps on this thing and it's out of space and nothing can be done about that...The storage space is such an issue that I may have to return this phone. The battery is also not replaceable and like most cell phones, leaves much to be desired. 3/5", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Phone out there", "Author": "Raggamofing", "ReviewID": "R1QI3155QGQMTI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a good windows phone, I'll recommend Nokia Lumia 925 is a good choice.

Really, she couldn't care less about multiple apps or widgets or rooting her phone. She just wants Facebook status updates, a decent Contacts app in a form factor that is somewhat smaller than the recent spate of monster-sized Android phones. (As an aside, personally, I use either a Galaxy Note 2 or a Galaxy S4, both rooted - she wants nothing to do with all that).This phone fit the bill perfectly. After a bit of a learning curve, she fell into a routine with this phone. Call quality is great. The keyboard is spot-on perfect for her smaller hands. She loves this phone.Well, she loves it when it works, anyway.Lately, this phone has been powering off at strange times. Sometimes it requires a soft reset to bring it back. Other times, simply plugging it into the charger is enough to bring it back to life. After a quick trip through the Googles, I'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-air firmware update to resolve this problem.Thing is, that firmware update hasn't hit her phone yet. So...the waiting game.If your phone's OS is  8.0.10327.78, you are still waiting for the firmware update.Aside from this absolutely MAJOR issue with the phone's stability, its a wonderful flagship device for Windows Phone 8. Its really too bad that people don't give it a fair shake. Its not nearly as feature rich as a Droid, nor does it have as many apps as an iPhone. But there are just certain people out there who really...don't care about all that. They want the uncomplicated basics. Most of those people buy iPhones because family insists or have Androids foisted upon them by overeager Best Buy geeks. (nothing against the geeks - I am one)Those people should be looking at Windows Phone 8. And provided they get a phone that isn't broken right off the bat, I think they'll enjoy the experience.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst cell phone I ever had.

I bought this phone the first week it was available in the US, to replace my existing Nokia Astound (8GB, 8MP camera, Symbian OS). Mainly I wanted a larger, crisp screen and a more customizable interface, and of course a nice camera. WP and the Nokia Lumia 925 seemed to offer all of this, and indeed it does.In retrospect, I now realize that the trouble started one night in mid-September when I was exploring the different menus of the WP OS. I stumbled upon the very last item on the App list, \"Wi-Fi Calling.\" I had never had a cell phone that was even capable of Wi-Fi calling, so I was intrigued. There are three settings offered: \"Wi-Fi Preferred\", \"Cellular Preferred\", or \"Wi-Fi Only.\" Actually there is a fourth setting: Wi-Fi Calling \"On\" or \"Off\". I didn't really trust the technology yet, so changed the setting from \"Wi-Fi Preferred\" to \"Cellular Preferred.\" Over the next month, a very aggravating thing began happening: I would pull out my phone to make a call, and get a \"No Cellular Service\" message. Or a message stating \"You are in Airplane Mode\". Or, \"Cellular Service is turned off, do you want to turn cellular service on?\" Reasonable responses to all of these messages never resulted in re-engagement of the cellular signal. In fact, I gradually discovered that the only thing that would return cellular service was to turn the phone off and then turn it back on, whereupon it immediately resumed its normal functions.I began missing phone calls from friends and relatives. Sometimes over a day would pass before I would realize my phone was no longer functioning as a phone. It was infuriating and extremely disappointing. I found myself apologizing to people who were trying to get ahold of me. Texts would not come through either, while it was locked into this Wi-Fi calling hell on earth. Naturally, the only time I got frustrated enough to take it back to the store was after I had re-booted it, and so it worked fine while I was at the store.I finally did some online searching, and actually stating my problem using ask.com revealed the answer: Choosing \"Cellular Preferred\" causes your phone to lock into Wi-Fi calling mode. I have turned off Wi-Fi calling completely, and plan never to use it again. It's not worth almost having a nervous breakdown over. I want to like this phone, but right now it is in the dog house, and it's going to have to work to earn my trust back.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "DIDNT WORK OUT OF THE BOX.", "Author": "AaronWysocki", "ReviewID": "R2DPGUYZJ8ZSA6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HORRIBLE....bought this as a present for someone in BRASIL..Didnt work out of the box...FROZEN ON THE NOKIA LOGO....now I am in brasil with a 500 dollar phone that doesnt work....lovely feeling!!!!", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Fragile", "Author": "Michel", "ReviewID": "RPBWNHALV79WP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is beautiful, Windows Phone 8 is fast and efficient, but Lumia 925 has a fatal problem: The Screen !!!After his fall from my hand, the display, the screen crack !!!
