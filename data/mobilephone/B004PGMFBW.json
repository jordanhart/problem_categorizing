{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent choice for a middle range unlocked phone!", "Author": "Art Emperor", "ReviewID": "R1VHVRP1PH9SGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally wanted to stick to my budget and bought the HTC Wildfire from Amazon. Unfortunately, the one I got was Arabic version and did not have the Android Market app on it. I finally returned it and went for the more expensive HTC Legend instead. Am I glad that I did!!  It is solidly constructed with an all Aluminum body. The Amole screen is beautiful. The processor is fast enough for what I need. And I finally can enjoy all the great apps from the Market. I am having so much fun using this little gadget. I do have an iPad2, but sometimes I don't feel like carrying it with me when I am on the road. So the Legend is the perfect size in my pocket. I do wish the screen is another half inch larger, but I didn't want to go up on my budget to a Desire level phone. Overall, I am supper pleased with my purchase. And the seller was great in answering my questions via email, also they delivered the phone in 2 days!", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android\nTouchscreen\nSmartphone\n5mp camera\nWi-fi", "Name": "HTC A6363 Legend Unlocked Cell Phone-International Version (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YISydy5pL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004PGMFBW"}}
