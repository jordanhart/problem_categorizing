I ordered this one hoping it would get here before I left for college (Aug. 17) and it arrived only 4 days after I placed the order, as opposed to the usual week. I'm glad I chose to buy from fgn02008. The phone was in very good condition, the screen is flawless, but the back was a little banged up so I changed it (it came black, but I changed it to white), and the best part about the product was its' price ! A 32GB Apple iPhone 3GS and I only paid $175.99 as opposed to the $199.99 AT&T; was going to charge me for purchasing the 8GB iPhone 3GS without the contract.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "First IPhone", "Author": "Monica", "ReviewID": "R34JQIPFHQ0MKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little bit apprehensive about getting an Iphone, but a friend talked me into it. I decided on this one because it was a fair price and I trust Amazon. My phone arrived within 2 days, still shrink wrapped. I do think the heading should have *WHITE* taken out of the title, because the one I received is black. I also thought it came with an otterbox, but that might just be from looking at so many phones. I have yet to use it though, as I'm waiting for my SIM card to arrive, since I'm turning it into a prepaid phone. But all the papers were there, along with all the cables. It is in brand-new condition, which I love. Thank you for actually making it affordable. For future reference, it might be nice to actually include the otterbox that supposedly comes with the phone, seeing as how most stores don't carry them for the Iphone 3's anymore and they have to be ordered offline. I'm afraid of breaking it! But once I start using it, I will most likely come back and leave a longer review.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Brand new, unlocked perfectly, but watch for the battery life", "Author": "raymond", "ReviewID": "RXI1LD6EALTAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first iphone ever.  The brand new iphone 3gs works fine so far with T-mobile.. perfectly unlocked.. Upgraded to IOS 6 with ease.  The first two that I ordered had issues with the battery, and were returned to Amazon ( free shipping ).  Great service from Amazon and the vendor Tablet distributor.  Highly recommend it at $230.00 for 32 gb.  Make sure to get a car charger and the screen protector together. You will be able to replace the battery if needed...", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "impaired", "Author": "Marcos", "ReviewID": "R242PHJL0FMFKB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in December last year, his performance was good the first week.

Nothing but trouble, from day one Att Wireless has been dropping 50% of my calls, or maybe even more. Imagine the constant worry and aggravation of so many dropped calls! Over the course of the contract I have attempted to have the issue resolved with both Apple and Att Wireless. Apple has replaced my device with a brand new one and Att's solution was to change my sim card. Neither solution worked; in fact the problem has gotten worst over time. My local Apple store where I purchased the phone refuses to replace it saying the problem lies with the service. Att refuses to accept the problem saying it's a hardware issue and sending me back to Apple. See I am a customer a human being stuck in a contract between this two conglomerates whose faulty product cost Americans billions of dollars per year.  Last two years I have had to leave my office and walk outside in order to talk on the Att Wireless phone. Sounds like I live in at the edge of the universe well, No! I live in Center City Philadelphia just 2 blocks from City Hall. If Att Wireless doesn't have good coverage here where does it cover? Att Wireless was charging $138 per month on the unlimited everything plan which over the 24 month contract is well over $3000. Transferred to Tmobile on a prepaid unlimited everything plan for just $60 per month. Now I am surfing at 4g instead of 3g, I speed tested the Tmobile phone at 4-5 Mbps which is much faster than speeds the Iphone 4 3g offers. Best of all I can now talk on the phone without having to walk outside my office and without the constant worry of dropped calls. Still thinking about Att wireless? Save yourself a lot of money and a lot of aggravation and stay away from the horrible service of Att Wireless.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good item", "Author": "Lorenzo", "ReviewID": "R2ER5LWWGKMH12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "im glad to make business with Davey Plays Guitarwas a pretty good item,i would like to make businesswith you again, Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0057CZCEU"}}
