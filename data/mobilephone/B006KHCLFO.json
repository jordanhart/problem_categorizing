I will add pictures if I need to. Disappointed, any reply from Amazon that goes past a \"we're sorry and we don't lie to the customer again.\" will just highlight the shady practice. Not nice.Taking a look at orders for new factory sealed iphone 4 8gb that were filled by Amazon I notice that this isn't an isolated incident. going back 6 months, this happened to 5 different customers including myself. Terrible business practice. I do not fault Planet Mobile since Amazon is clearly knowingly filling this new factory dealed description with a used, scratched opened box iphone.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness - Amazon really came through", "Author": "Lisa J.", "ReviewID": "R183DEC2859ZYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For Christmas I bought my son a \"refurbished\" iPhone from another seller. It arrived in plenty of time for the big day and looked great. Unfortunately when we attempted to activate that phone the carrier said it showed as stolen. Of course we were all a little heartbroken.I immediately contacted Amazon about the issue. Within 3 days I had my refund and another iPhone. The new phone looks new and works like a dream.
