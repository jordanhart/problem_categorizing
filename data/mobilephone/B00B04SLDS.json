{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely love my L9", "Author": "Jeremy Battle", "ReviewID": "R3VER8RO26BTWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on phones before picking this one. I wanted an up to date android phone with a few bells and whistles. My tastes run along minimalist design and the L9 is right up my alley. The phone is responsive and plays games easily. The Android OS makes it a breeze to update and offers an endless amount of apps to really tap into the phones potential. My girlfriend has a Galaxy S4 and she plays games on my phone and can't tell the difference. The design is simple and sleek. The only flaw I can really find is that the chrome around the edge of the screen is a magnet for small scratches even with a case. Also, without a case the L9 is a lot lighter than many of the top end phones on the market. This may be seen as a plus or a negative to some, for me it makes it easy to forget its in my pocket. The traditional and front facing cameras are great and the phone has a nice LED flash as well. If you plan on purchasing the L9 be aware that there are two distinct models on the market place. The phone was launched overseas first and later brought to the states by T-Mobile. The overseas version has a bigger screen and the camera is placed in the top left corner of the back plate. The T-Mobile version comes with a smaller screen and the camera is in the middle of the back plate. I only note this because I found it difficult to find decent cases for my International version. This is in no way an indictment against the L9, just letting prospective owners know the heads up.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone but", "Author": "Andres", "ReviewID": "R2QKHK35GYL9V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is excellent, it has everything you need, its so fast that I wonder why you need more cores when this dual core phone can handle everything (i was chating on whatsapp listening to music donwloading from the play store and it is always snappy)The Camera is good, but in low ight conditions Not so Much But still it let you take really good pics.

I am from The Dominican Republic, and it works  wonderfully over here. My internet works faster than on my old phone. We had to google how to turn on the DATA(3G), Because in my country this phone needs a APN, so we searched the APN and entered it on the phone and immediately the internet worked...This phone is so fast, I think that the dual core 1 GB RAM do wonders on this phone. The phone has great battery life, It lasts me all day and I am a heavy user. I am so happy with this phone. Just so you know the LG L9(P768) the camera has 8MP. Also The phone is very light and the screen size is perfect for me(I cant use those tiny phones anymore).The Phone I got came with English and Spanish options from the factory on the contrary to what some other people said.The only issue I'm finding, is that I can't delete more than one picture at a time Or I haven't figured out a way to do that as this was very simple to do on my previous droid.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone..

They allow any unlocked phone and the Optimus L9 International fit the bill.  I liked the reviews so purchased one.  CC sent me their Sim card and set up the phone and card.  Basically every thing works ok but....First of all, Amazon's representative for this phone (AEG) did not send the International phone but a T-Mobil USA phone.  Had smaller screen (4.5 not 4.7) and less pixels on the camera.  I overlooked this and set the phone up.  Keeps getting a text msg error 122 which nobody has been able to help me clear (sends the text every 20 minutes).  The BIGGEST problem is the battery.  I can literally watch the percentage drop while not doing much of anything with the phone.  The screen resolution is great, speed is great.  This is a T-Mobil phone and even though it is unlocked it has a problem letting other carriers use the phone.  As far as the battery goes,  I deleted apps, turned on power saving etc. etc. but the battery is just not going to hold a charge for more than about 6 hours.  Optimus L9 is a discontinued phone according to the CC folks.  Nice phone (USA version) but be careful.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Susan Loss", "ReviewID": "R2D3N4R8KFSQEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UnfortunatIy where I live I have to use verizon towers to make a call.
