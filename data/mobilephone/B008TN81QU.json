{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great gift for grandma", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R11A6HWL78Y38C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this phone for grandma since she always forgets to charge the battery and she has trouble pushing the power on button after charging. We can't visit her very often. That's why we bought this phone for the advertised monster battery life. When the item arrived, the model number said T190i instead of T190Q. And the spec states the battery could last only 500+ hours, far less than the advertised 1700 hours standby. We decided to give it a try anyway. So far, it's been 2 weeks, the battery indicator is still 100%. We'd be happy if the battery can last 1 month. The voice quality is great. Overall, if you are looking for a fancy phone, i.e. 4G etc., it's not the phone for you. However, for a very basic 2G phone, it has everything, large buttons, good voice quality, dual sim, long battery life, camera, music, and flash light etc.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phones For Travel", "Author": "soldmymind", "ReviewID": "R2WCDRW3NRJWCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have multiple of these phones for working with small film crews in foreign countries. As they are exclusively for working abroad, these phones actually have many more abilities than I need, but for the price I don't feel like I'm paying any more than I should for a phone that can work abroad.The second SIM card slot that allows my crew members to plug in their own personal SIM as well is a great perk.I, and crew members, have had a few problems with the phones seeming to get stuck in silent mode - eventually after a bit of button mashing we always seem to figure it out.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best little buddy for the buck", "Author": "jhauck6671", "ReviewID": "R3JNATK61GXUMG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, this little device is my constant companion.  It has a GREAT radio and a GREAT light, but I rarely use them. I like the fidelity of the calls, and with the 4 GB micro SD card, I can keep a lot of photos and music on here. I mainly made my purchase for the battery life, which is outstanding. Quad band seems to be working here in Asia, but it also worked great in the Transcaucas and Middle East. Wait 'till you hear the speaker! I dropped it multiple times and it is still \"ticking\". If I had to do over again, I would certainly buy it a second time.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Instructions not understandable", "Author": "Beverley Nolton", "ReviewID": "R2G3RHZC1GCRU4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The instruction manual was too small to read and the instructions were not very helpful.
