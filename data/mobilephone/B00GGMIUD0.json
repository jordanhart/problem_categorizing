I needed to find a budget phone to wait until I saved enough money to buy a new samsung. I came across the Touchtalk Lite and quickly realised that there was no point saving up for Samsung as the Touchtalk Lite does everything the Samsung did.As I was left without a phone for a couple of days, I was really relying that the TouchTalk Lite would arrive on the expected delivery day, and I was not let down. It came well packaged and on time.I have already recommended the smart phone to my Uni friends who financial are in the same boat as me. I had no problems but my new sim card into the phone and it was very easy to set up. The phones provides 3G which makes going on the internet fast and enjoyable.I have also downloaded many Apps, which again was no problem at all, and enjoy playing on all the latest games. The battery life is extremely good, I charged it fully and it lasted a good day, if not more if I hadn't of been on it all day!To be honest I was not expecting a lot from this \u00a380 phone but I am totally amazed and surprised about how good it is and how much I like it.Great buy and worth every penny!!!", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "With the assistance of the Media-Tek 1.3Ghz Dual Core processor and 512MB RAM, the Touchtalk Lite can easily handle the daily life of a modern day smartphone and offers a fast and fluid user experience.\nThe Touchtalk Lite comes with a 4\" touchscreen, a brilliant size for web browsing, App browsing and general uses of the phone.\nWith Dual-SIM technology, the Touchtalk is able to have two SIM's inserted concurrently, giving you the flexibility of having alternative personal and business SIM's and numbers on the same phone.\nInternet connectivity has never been easier.
