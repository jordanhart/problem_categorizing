O.", "ReviewID": "R3E6PSUQV284XW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a month ago as my first smartphone and almost immediately, had to go to India for an extended period. This review isn't meant to be an extensive/comprehensive review of the phone; rather, I wanted to make a comment on how useful the dual SIM feature has been. I normally replace my US SIM card with an int'l SIM card whenever I travel abroad, but this time I didn't want to as my provider in the US offers unlimited data and text in almost every country, all included in my regular plan. But since voice calls would cost 20 cents a minute, and because it would be expensive for people in India to send a text message to a US number, I got a local SIM. The set up was simple -- just put the new SIM in the second slot behind the battery and then the phone prompts you to pick which SIM you want as default for which function: for data, for voice, for video calls, and for texting. You also have the choice of picking a SIM each time you perform a function. So for texting back to the US, I pick my US SIM and for texting within India, I pick my local SIM. The phone also allows me to seamlessly pick between using Skype to make calls or dialing directly. I must say that I didn't expect this phone to be this good for a hundred or so bucks. It comes with a ton of apps which I have found useful here, such as google maps/navigation. But most of all, it's been the dual sim feature that has been a lifesaver. I think that with the amount of usage I have had here so far, I would have racked up a bill of over $100 by now, but it has been a tiny fraction of that.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "TRY BLU", "Author": "Patricia", "ReviewID": "R1W9VAQD7SLO07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is fabulous, when I opened the boxI was totally surprised.

This phone is not stable.First of all, it's not easy to swap sim cards, you will need needle or pin to remove them.The battery does not hold charge very long.For some reason when trying to view calls history, I get a pop up with list of countries which is annoying. I can't blame it on OS (android).

I was really hesitating on whether or not to purchase this product because I never heard of BLU cell phones. After much research and reading many reviews, I went right ahead and purchase the BLU Advance 4.5 unlocked cell phone. I totally love the phone and its definitely worth the money. The phone looks exactly like a samsung phone, you can't even tell the difference!!!! If you are unsure whether or not to purchase this phone (\"I know I was\") I can definitely tell you its worth the money. I'm very happy with the phone! It comes with a screen protector and a phone cover. By the way the phone does run on a 4g network...this was one of the questions I had when I was looking around for phones!!! You definitely will not regret your purchase!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "About Phone", "Author": "caleny", "ReviewID": "RNLTWPTKODDNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love it Very easy to Use Good Working Phone Arrived On time Love that It came With Head Phones An a Case :)", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Memory card", "Author": "Riva Tambis", "ReviewID": "R19PBOHE1Y697P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yup it met my expectations except for an instance that it cannot read my memory card if i insert one..
