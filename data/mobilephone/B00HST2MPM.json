On T-mobile it is only capable of 2G; The RM-994 is capable of 3G on at&t; network only, T-mobiles 2G. The RM-996 is only 2G capable in the US.

I play games occasionally and use the internet a lot, work, msgs, pictures. social networking, the best i had with the Xperia Z was around 11 hours, and that bested its rival from samsung and htc by like 2 hours. Android is filled now with bloat software, of course wasn't an issue when i changed to cyanogenmod 3 months after purchase.-The mobile network connection was getting on my nerves with the Sony. Lots of lost signals, call drops, network choice instability 3G, 4G, GSM ..etc.-Finally i made no useful use of the Sony's Awesome 13MP camera, or its resistance to water and dust.-now the nokia 1320:-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=First of, i didn't realize any performance issues, i thought i will realize the performance drop from a quad core 2GB ram mobile to this one, but i didn't, windows mobile is actually pretty light and suitable to give you better response than you are used to.-The nokia definitely got a better battery life, had it for a day now and didn't even charge it out of the box yet !!mobile network connections are definitely more stable and less call drops when i am driving + the wifi network is far more powerful and responsive -for some reason- than the xperia z. I can definitely see the difference in youtube and facebook videos.-the verdict:-=-=-=-=-=-served the expectations  i change it for i guess with so little drawbacks, i guess.-the bad:-=-=-=-didn't even expect the nokia to have such a poor app store, the choices are very limited, the presentation of apps is not as delightful as its rivals from apple and android app store, but i guess it is something that i have to live with, for a while at least.-One personal disappointment is there is no \"clash of clans\" yet on windows mobile app store.-=-=-=-edited:-=-=-=-the camera button is one irritating feature for sure, the mobile is huge and you usually would need to hold it from below several times, every time when this happens, whenever you are on your home screen or mobile software menu, the camera goes active, and you have to close it to continue whatever you were doing,,-the right side of the mobile is filled with buttons, camera, volume up and down, power button ,, surely they could cancel one of those or transferred it to the other side", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "NOKIA LUMIA 1320", "Author": "BILLYWHIZZ", "ReviewID": "R3FQT5C5PYRD4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Phablet  is great and does more than I expected.
