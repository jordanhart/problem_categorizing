The ZTE Merit used 2.1 Android, this Whirl uses 4.1, and had 2 gigs of phone memory so I can download apps to my hearts content. I have not even gone past 1.5 gigs, and I could delete a lot of the scummy apps that I have tried out....Much better than my Merit (Which broke it's USB plastic port). The Merit had a meager 150 meg of memory and I was always getting a 'phone low on memory' message.The Whirl has a metal USB port, I hope, much sturdier....", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "ZTE Whirl Android Cell Phone- No contract (Net 10)- Well worth it!", "Author": "Pandora H.", "ReviewID": "R2SESOHOHVFMBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is only my second Android/ touchscreen cell phone.I received this one as a gift from a family member, just last week.I am so very pleased with this cell phone!It runs Android 4.1, the first version of Jelly Bean- please see here:[...]- which seems to be quite fast and user-friendly.My previous Android cell phone was the LG Optimus (Prepaid Tracfone),in white, which ran an older operating system named Gingerbread,which I bought here on Amazon. The differences are amazing!With the older LG, I kept getting a \"low on memory\" error message,from Day One. Well, this is definitely not the case with this ZTE Whirl!*Please be aware that you can only add minutes and service dayswith a Net10 UNLIMITED card. I was informed about this byNet10's Customer Service rep, whenever I called to activatemy phone. (There ARE Net10 pre-paid cards that do NOThave the word \"Unlimited\" written on them, and these arethe ones that will NOT work with this phone.)Hope this helps.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IOTJ9AQ"}}
