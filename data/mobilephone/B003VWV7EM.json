{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good choice for travel", "Author": "Randy Brazie", "ReviewID": "RX8YU6U5MXIOA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although the listing mentions this phone for use on T-Mobile, I was unable to get it to access internet via their network, even after much searching for settings and so forth.  That being said, once I went overseas, I found this phone quite easy to set-up and use.  The quality of photos produced by the 8MP camera is quite amazing and I manage to get some quite decent shots despite the inherent limitations of a compact camera.  I do find it rather annoying how long it takes to wait before I can take the next shot, however, and find myself frequently pressing the camera button several times to force it to hurry up.The GPS works quite quickly and I have had no trouble getting an accurate signal in either the UK or NZ.  There are 3 apps on the phone for this - Maps, Motonav and Navigation, but I am only able to get the Maps app to work for me.  Motonav requires a Motonav SD Card of some sort (must be available in Europe).  Navigation is actually Google Maps Navigation and is not available in every area I have checked.Call quality is quite good with this phone and I have had no dropped calls whatsoever.  When the phone is on vibrate mode, however, I can't set it up to vibrate for any text messages, so bear that in mind if you do a lot of texting.  Ringtones are somewhat small in choice but I think you can download more.  The alarm does work with sound even in vibrate or silent mode, which is an improvement over other phones I've had.The internet browser works well.  There is an Email app on the phone which I found super annoying when setting up my Yahoo! Mail account.  Instead, use the Yahoo! Mail app, and of course you'll need a Gmail account for this phone anyway.  The Email app does work well for my Mobile Me email, however.  Contacts and Calendar are fine to work with, and the screen is pretty responsive and accurate, although occasionally it enters the wrong character from an adjacent key if I'm going too quickly.  As others have mentioned, the responsive vibration when you touch the screen is quite a neat feature and very gratifying.My only other complaints are that the home screens seem to have problems with placing and organizing widgets - it seems like there's enough space, yet sometimes I am unable to put one more icon on my main screen.  The world clock widget I downloaded for free is not as nice or user-friendly as the iPhone clock feature (having recently switched from a 3G model).  My Sign is quite a neat feature.  So far, I have not tried the radio or any voice commands, so cannot comment on those.Finally, this is one of the newer phones and ships with Android 2.1, which was a big factor in my not going for something else with 1.6, as I have read reports from others that this makes a big difference.  In conclusion, if I was remaining in the USA only, I would really need to do more homework on seeing if I could get internet access with the darn thing - admittedly I was experimenting with a prepaid T-Mobile SIM, and their on-account plans may be a different story.  This model is apparently sold by one cell phone provider in the USA, so it is possible, just a matter of getting the right settings and working with a company that will support your unlocked phone adequately.This phone is packed with many features and pretty nifty HD video capabilities, plus is easy to use and feels solid in the hand.  An excellent all-around choice provided you ensure you can access internet via your mobile network provider (otherwise you'd be stuck to just wifi access).", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "B.A.H. \"Chicago Blues\"", "ReviewID": "R72XX2ZTB2XY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a major upgrade for me.  I needed a phone that could have applications.  Downloading apps is quick and easy.  I use the phone for alarms to keep my busy schedule in check.  I have alarms going off every hour or so.  I am able to enter my schedule and contacts on my mac and it updates on the phone.  I also have flash cards and games downloaded for entertaining my children when we have spare time in places like waiting rooms or car rides.  The camera is a nice feature and has good resolution.  Phone software is easy to use and locate what I need to use.  Texting screen seems to be accurate.  I have had no problems using the touch screen keyboard.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Droid XT720", "Author": "Jedi4good", "ReviewID": "R12YTXKKED9GGH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the phone and it works great after one month of ownership. The only down side is finding a case for my phone in the states. The camera is very slow with flash. Very little memory on phone for apps storage. This is a known issue with these phones.

It has a really cool setup and a great capability for viewing maps.The phone however resends em my entire e-mail inbox nonstop throughout the day. I get charged extra from my network provider which will not help me. I have tried a different motorola milestone and the same thing happened-also, the microphone didn't work.I have tried to contact the place I bought it but they only offer warranty for 15 days. I reported the problem just over two weeks after I bought it, which is also roughly when I set up my email services.Lastly, I constantly loose calls and my phone will often just shut off and reboot.Makes for an excellent toy!", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003VWV7EM"}}
