{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Important About Unlocked Note 3 Phones", "Author": "Ryan Lewis", "ReviewID": "R13GVA42E6BDN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T;/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T; to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T; model can change at anytime due to AT&T;'s bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T; SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title":

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone.

Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III. I will be glad to answer any questions.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Technical/Hardware Masterpiece", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R27F60CN6T6O2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I owned the Galaxy Note 2. I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:  * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.  * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).  * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative. This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and awesome battery life.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy galaxy phones with this company, they sale defective samsung galaxy note 3", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R34QPO1QTRE34U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my galaxy note 3 a month ago, it was working ok the first 2 weeks, after that phone turned on slow running any application and I did not download so many, then the screen became freeze pretty often and I had to restart it over and over again, finally when I get upset is because I was charging the phone and suddenly appeared a message on screen \"SIM CARD REMOVED REBOOT PHONE\" so I did not but it was not detecting the SIM CARD anymore, I replaced the SIM CARD with a new one and it did not recognize it either.

I really like Samsung products but had issues with the other two devices. The s4 was a great phone but possessed so little on board storage that it hampered it. The 5 inch screen was gorgeous but still too small for movie watching. I bought a note 2  because of the bigger screen but at the cost of resolution and a slower processor. I have wanted the note 3 since before it came out and it is the best of the two previously purchased devices combined. From the beautiful 5.7 inch screen to the very speedy processor, its everything I want in a smartphone. The s pen is great for setting reminders or other note taking. The frosting on the cake is the systems 32 GB on board storage. I know all samung s products come with expandable storage but you can't put all app data on an SD cards so large app files fill system memory quickly. This is an exceptional device with very little to complain about. I switch devices a lot but the only switch I will be making in the future will be for the eventual note 4. Until then, this phone is the best available that combines every aspect of what I want out of a smartphone.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best of all Bests", "Author": "Collins Larbi", "ReviewID": "R1KFWASPQKJVRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best,hands down,i say its compared to none,not even the so called iphone 5s unless you have been sold a fake product.Great!!!.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Features", "Author": "Reynald N.

Search the web for Galaxy Note 3 SIM Restrictions and you will see why. It seems these phones are region-locked by Samsung as an attempt to prevent grey-market imports. The phones are blocked from using SIMs from other regions - e.g. if you buy a Note 3 in Europe, you can't use a Chinese local SIM when traveling in China. Many people do this sort of thing to avoid heinous roaming charges.Samsung have stated that if the first SIM you use with the phone is one from the \"home region\" of the handset then the region lock is automatically lifted. However, there have been several posts from users on the web who have stated this is not the case. These users have been blocked from using local SIMs even though they had first \"activated\" their handset with an in-region SIM before traveling.My advice is do not buy this handset if you think you will ever need to use it abroad without paying roaming charges to your home carrier.(Thanks to Simon Jerrie for the heads-up).", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "fraud", "Author": "sania hameed", "ReviewID": "R1VUK46ZV37UQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "wrong specification shown by seller for the phone.it does not have lte 4g in usa.only gives 3g..selling stolen phones from europe", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Used", "Author": "Jay Choi", "ReviewID": "RPZWYG9L0G605", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It says in the description that the product is new.
