{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great after firmware update!", "Author": "O. Prusak", "ReviewID": "R34OC2ODKD7YYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been looking to get rid of my landline for a while and needed a solution that lets me put the base unit in a small closet and the handset where I need it.If you're in the same boat, you don't have many choices.I purchased the Simens GIgaset 675 about a year ago, and while it works fine, the volume from the handset was SO low that it was almost unusable.I've since read that other Gigaset models are louder but that the volume issue for my model is a common complaintI recently stumbled across this unit and since I've always been happy with standard Panasonic cordless phones I thought I'd give it try.I was VERY hesitant to purchase the unit since the vast majority of user reviews I found mentioned endless issues getting it registered to their voip provider.After a while I found that there was a firmware update in Sep 2010 which solved the issues and indeed I didn't see any mention of setup issues after that date.So I got it and the first thing I did was to download the new firmware and install it.Then it took me 15 minutes to set it up to work with my voip provider, callcentric and it's been working fine so far (I got it 4 days ago).I do agree with most of the comments I've seen that the documentation is not for the average joe.The admin manual is 250 pages long!!!Luckily you really only need to setup one page of settings if you're just using it as a simple SIP phone and not doing anything fancy.One thing which is a bit annoying - the web interface is OFF by default (though it's easy to turn on via the phone's menu system).5 stars for the hardware - 3 stars for not making a \"simple\" version of the interface (though I guess it's aimed towards offices that have an IT guy).", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent cordless phone system for small business", "Author": "Eric T", "ReviewID": "R2AOS58U6Y2PJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked and looked, and finally decided to try this system.The product is very high quality office grade equipment, not \"consumer\" grade. All buttons have a nice feel.BASE STATION:Nice glossy black finish.  Looks high tech and is wall mountable.  It has an LED on the front that changes color to indicate the connection status... green means it is properly connected, orange means trouble.  There is a Page Handsets button on the side that causes all handsets to ring in case you misplace one.  Handset battery life in standby mode is about a week, so you should be able to find it before the battery dies.  The only other feature is the ethernet port.  Just connect the base station to your router, and you're good to go.  The base station has a built in web-based control panel, so you can setup most of the features from your PC. Just get the IP address and enable \"Embedded Web\" access using a handset.  This access turns back off after a short time, which can be a bit annoying.  But it is a security feature, so probably not a bad idea to protect the system.HANDSETS:Speakerphone in the cordless handsets is a very welcome feature! The handsets are extremely lightweight and fit your hand and face. The screen is clear and easy to read. The buttons have a nice, crisp feel to them. The charging cradle is wall mountable, so you can stick them anywhere with AC outlet nearby. The batteries last a super long time (like a week) in standby mode, and talk time is great (several hours) due to DECT technology. If you should ever need replacement batteries, you can just buy rechargeable Duracell or Energizer NiMH batteries off the shelf, no weird proprietary batteries to hunt for.USAGE:We really like the Intercom feature, which has an \"auto answer\" speakerphone feature. When we ring a coworker's extension, they can respond without touching the handset. You can use this system with a single phone number/account and have it ring one, all or any combination of the base or handsets. You can also use separate accounts for each handset if you need to, since the system supports up to 8, which can be assigned in any combination. In our case, we just have one account that rings our receptionist and office manager. We signed up with a company called voiSip (highly recommended) and saving a TON of money versus our old telco. They helped us connect our voiSip account via a remote support session. They even helped us update the firmware.  Call quality is superior to our old AT&T; office phones, and also better than my own Vonage service at home. I purchased a similar Gigaset C610A IP system for my home and switched my home number over to voiSip.WISH LIST:The handsets show \"New Voicemail\" and have a small LED blinker, but the Gigaset brand handsets have a much brighter voicemail light. It would be nice if these could do 4 simultaneous calls instead of 3. And we may eventually want more than 6 handsets, so having up to 12 per base would be comforting (but probably not necessary in reality).WISH LIST UPDATE: Some of our offices are now using this with the voiSip PBX systems, which let you tie together up to 4 base stations and 24 cordless handsets into a single group of extensions, each with its own voicemail box.Overall, I would highly recommend this for an office with up to 6 people. For a larger office, you should probably consider using these with a PBX system, to get up to 24 handsets.UPDATE July 2013: Be sure to update the firmware when available. Unlike other brands, Panasonic's menus do not have any means of setting the \"Registration Retry\" duration. This setting defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour). Your router may kick the phone offline before 1 hour, causing inbound calls to fail (outbound calling works fine since it causes a registration event). I don't know about other service providers, but voiSip has a firmware customization they can apply to these phones that sets the registration to 3 minutes. The phones are rock solid once this patch has been applied. (This is only necessary if your phone is connecting to a voip provider or pbx system through a firewall.)UPDATE Feb 2014: We have several of these now, at various offices around the country. Some of them are connected directly to a voiSip \"Clone Line\" account, and others are being used with a PBX system. Quality and durability has been excellent. We've just had to replace some of the batteries at this point. Luckily, they use standard AAA size rechargeable batteries... look for either Duracell or Energizer NiMH AAA batteries.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Business phone, but Home User beware! It lacks several major features that Home users are accustomed to.", "Author": "Peter Nielsen \"Perfectionist\"", "ReviewID": "R13ZBN3PHEGN6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the past 2 years, I've been using a \"higher end\" Panasonic DECT 6.0 home telephone set with 4 handsets, talking CID, and answering machine. I was very happy with this setup, but I recently decided to switch to VOIP and was recommended the Panasonic KX-TGP500 because the sound quality supposedly is better compared to using an ATA with my existing phones. The fact that the the KX-TPA50 (handset of the KX-TGP500) look very similar to my previous KX-TG653 handsets made this a good and easy switch with low learning curve. After using these for a few weeks, I can say that the sound quality indeed is excellent and the handsets are very nice and high quality with a slightly better look and feel than my old Pannies. The downside is that the transition made me lose several features of my previous system that I had gotten used to:-The phone does not have a talking CID-The phone has no answering machine. While my VOIP provider does provide voice mail, you lose the ability to just let the phone ring and let the answering machine take the call while putting the caller on speaker output. You no longer have the ability to listen real-time while the message is recorded and pick up the phone and catch the call while the caller is recording. These common features, that many take for granted, are lost.-The handsets are not interconnected. Another person can't pick up a handset and join the conversation. On a positive note, this means that neither can somebody evesdrop, so this is for good and for bad.This phone is designed for business use, and it shows. Line selection, which most home users will not need, is an integral feature. While the phone has very good sound, you really need to consider if you can live without the lost features. Maybe getting an ATA while waiting for Panasonic to release a similar model targeted for home use and equipped in that fashion makes sense.Finally, I must say that apart for the missing functionality, I have no issues at all with this phone. It works flawlessly. Like clockwork! I can highly recommend it. The only reason for 4 stars is the high cost. I also feel that Panasonic could have thrown in talking CID as an optional feature at this price point. I recall paying not much more than $100 for my Panasonic POTS Dect 6.0 4-handset setup from Costco two years ago. In comparison, the KX-TGP500 with 3 additional KX-TPA50 sets ran me just shy of $400, so in comparison it is a rather expensive setup and I still question if keeping my old phones and going with an ATA would have been a smarter choice.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cordless VoIP phone", "Author": "Marla A Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1QSMOBUNBJQ0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "3 simultaneous calls and up to 6 cordless handsets, perfect for small business or home office.Range and call quality is far better than previous generation cordless phones.  Includes all the necessary features: Speakerphone, Transfer, Intercom, Message Waiting Indicator, etc.My only suggestions to Panasonic would be to allow more than 6 handsets. Not sure we'll ever need more than 3 or 4, but it would be \"nice\" to feel like the system could grow more if we needed it to.  Also a dedicate transfer button would be handy.  But if you're transferring a lot, you should probably get a desk phone.Some reviews mentioned difficult setup.  Our VoIP provider (voiSip) was able to do it remotely in about 2 minutes.

Elward", "ReviewID": "RLCH1AA19F0ZY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product continues a fine tradition of \"nice idea, great spec sheet, poor final product.\"  There is more to a recipe than the ingredient list.  In this case, the software is poor, and uses an asinine security model that was designed by a \"we know best\" team.  The sound quality was pretty good, and I had no issues with range or battery life.  The phone itself is a decent and attractive design, but it would be nice if more thought were put into the additional features offered by an IP phone.  It could just be that it is not possible to offer easy access to all the functions from a small cordless handset, but if you need even a basic like transferring calls on a regular basis, this phone is not for you.  It technically can be used as a business phone, but will be inadequate in most cases.  I have not seen a better cordless IP phone, however, I still ended up returning this phone after a few weeks because I found it unusable.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "good product - could be better", "Author": "Bren W.", "ReviewID": "RTFIOAEUXA4MI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "review and it's a shame this person had such a negative experience.It wouldn't surprise me that there would be a particular unit that didn't function very well.My experience with Panasonic support was just great and I'm thinking they would take care ofthis person. I had a problem upgrading the firmware and was in communication with Panasonic Support.They offered multiple suggestions and ways to diagnose what the problem was.My base unit just wouldn't take when I performed theupdate on my network. However, since I lived near the vendor I took it back and they updated the firmware in a fewminutes without any gymnastics. It was a problem on my side, somehow.]This is not a device for the weak-kneed. It's a little formidable what the device is capable of.Being a VoIP novice at the outset, this was a little daunting. But I needed to get up to speedand not rely on the good graces of some turn-key VoIP system.However, after getting used to the unit for a while and practicing with the configuration, itis not as intimidating as it started out. Thanks to the folks over at dslreports.com for all theirassistance in correcting configuration errors.Also note that this is NOT an ATA device. This does not convert the digital signal over the internetinto a signal that runs over your copper, in-house phone wiring. This is a 100% digital unit thatconverts the signal to/from analog on the handset speaker/mic only.The TGP550 and TGP551 are essentially the same as this unit except the base unit is an actualphone with a corded handset attached. All the extension handsets are identical for these systems.All the base units have a web interface that must be started from the hand set before it canbe accessed.Now to the review itself.Really love the feel of the handset. The feel of the buttons is just outstanding.I'm a button lover in an increasingly buttonless world. Woe is me. I love the device'sergonomics and even though I'm right handed, I love that it doesn't have a lefty orrighty feel to it. The handset alsoas a unit feels solid and durable. No questionable creaks or groans when squeezing itor torquing it slightly. Not sure how it handles a drop as it hasn't happened yet =)The battery life on the handset seems to be fantastic. I had Unidens with a dedicated lionbattery pack and it always seemed to be on the edge if out of the charger for a few hours.Just as a test I have left a handset off the device for a few days, and there were still acouple of blips on the battery. Nice.The base unit also feels strong and seems nicely constructed. See below for other comments about it.There is one button on it that will register handsets in range and can be used to restart the device.Only one light on it to indicate that it's restarting (red), initializing software or registration error(flashing amber) or all systems go (green).I have not used such features as call transfer (which I understand is a multi-click action that is tediousif performed regularly), conferencing, forwarding, etc. And because there are multiple lines on the phonemy family is still getting used to joining a conversation from another handset (Named lines would bebetter than numbers for this - see below).Basically a good product. As I have not compared other VoIP devices to this one, I cannotindicate how well it performs in relation to others. Reading reviews on dslreports.com seemsto show there is consensus for the all-digital VoIP devices: the KX-TGP500, 550, 551 area breed apart from other consumer-level devices.With any product, there is usually always some room for improvement, so here it goes.1. Changing registration configurationThis has come up in the past few days and especially today. I have had to tweak the registrationover the past few days, and it appears to be working fine. However, today I had to change theAuthentication ID and Line ID for one line. The ID and password were exactly correct, but justclicking 'save' started the device blinking amber. However from maintenance when I restarted thedevice, it successfully went green.Request: 'Save' on the VoIP config pages would do everything necessary to successfully re-register.If it means a restart, so be it.For now, lesson learned: Any config change to the VoIP settings just restart the device.2. Handset headphone jackThis is located exactly where the phone might be held in your hand making it a little awkwardto hold and use with a headset. The headphone jack could be either on the top or the bottom andthe problem would be solved. Or on the side near the top of the device.3. Handset joystickWould greatly prefer a 4-position 'rocker' button for up-down-left-right navigation and a clickpush in the middle. There seems to be enough real-estate for it and it might take up less spaceinside the handset itself.The buttons on the handset truly rock. I love them and they feel solid and durable, whereas thejoystick does not give me the same impression.4. Base unit designPersonally not a big fan of devices that use non-functional shapes. It would fit nicer in mydevice stack (vertically oriented) if it were a simple black box, rather than what it is rightnow. I have several vertical and several horizontal devices. It would be nice if there weresome kind of industry standard for device shapes of this type. They all have to co-locate,so it would be nice to have them all fit into the same kind of footprint.This is a comment on the industry at large. Panasonic is just part and parcel to this mystifyingarray of disjointed and unmatchable devices that constitute our LANs.5. Phone displayIt would be nice to have better display on the handset for incoming calls. I have 4 linesassigned and it would be nice if it were a little more clear which line and number. Forexample the incoming call number/name in 'bold' and the line id and number in 'light' orsomething. I'm sorta used to the way it is, but it would be nice..6. Ringer tonesWould be nice to have more options. Downloadable? =) They offer user-customizable tones forthe calls themselves (dial tone, ringing, busy, etc). How about the handset ring tone as well?7. Web interfaceThis is one of my areas of expertise. This one looks old-fashioned and needs some features:a. on the Telephone Multi Number Settings, it would be nice to set some some things globally,like the default line for a handset, which phones use which lines, etc.b. the ability to load profiles for either specific lines or the entire VoIP configuration.When I'm testing things, I have to manually change every niggling detail every time.It would be nice to have a CallCentric profile that I could assign to Line 3 and it justgets set to my CallCentric configuration automatically. Or just to save a golden profilefor the entire set and reload it if things get too out of whack.c. Copy configs from one line to anotherd. Name lines so I don't have to remember who is on which line every time I change something.e. Status page shows *all* the status: there just isn't that much to show, why click so manylinks for the whole status?f. Context-sensitive help icons - a question mark icon that can be hovered or clicked on everyfield with full details as to what it really means and how it's used.g. Configuration wizard (or basic/advanced pages)h. Web server should be able to be set to always run, and not have to always restart it after someinterval.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "good product", "Author": "Pongo", "ReviewID": "R38ANY0ZTV90B6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it works good simple to in stall sound quality is good good valuei woulf definitely recommend it and possibly purchase another one", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally, a great SIP Cordless", "Author": "jsbuffalo", "ReviewID": "R2CC7NPXAYDVE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have purchased several different brands of SIP cordless phones to try out with our 3CX PBX.

We'd been using a few Snom M3s, and while they worked, they felt like cheap, flimsy toys. Based on positive experiences with Panasonic telephone products in the past, we bough this unit plus a few spare handsets, and have been very happy with the result. The units are solid, fit your hand well, and the audio is excellent. Though the screen is monochrome (unlike the color screen on the Snoms), its bigger, clearer, and visible over a wider viewing angle, making for a more positive experience. Configuration to talk to our Asterix/Raspbx system went quickly, even including installing a telephone directory file.
