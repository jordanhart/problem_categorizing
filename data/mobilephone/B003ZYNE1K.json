It has large buttons that are easy for him to press. The only drawback is lack of features.

Cole Jr. \"wcole67\"", "ReviewID": "R79ZSDDOQ1J7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not much of a phone guy, and especially with these recent cell phones that are expensive to buy and expensive to operate...and have all those bells and whistles that i'll never use. All a waste of money for me.But now I'm getting up in age and I decided I should have some sort of wireless emergency notification device that I could carry around with me...just in case. I think there are some companies that sell a device you hang around your neck with an emergency button on it. I'm not sure how it all works but I assume there's a monthly charge for the priviledge of pressing this button....Nahhhh. not for me.Then I saw the \"Just5\" Cell Phone on Amazon and it looked rather interesting. Basically a simple cell phone with no gimmicks (camera, internet, games, etc.) It was quite small, had large numbers on the keys, and a nickel sized (big) orange button on the back of the phone that could be programmed to dial 5 phone numbers in succession.(the \"SOS Button\" must be held for about 5 seconds before anything happens). If no one answered the first number, it would automatically move on to the second number and dial it...and so on. If no one answered any of the 5 numbers it would then jump to Emergency 911 and dial it. A very nice feature and just what I was looking for. There are some other minor emergency features too but I won't get into them here. Plus now I had a \"walkabout\" phone too.I bought a refurbished phone from one of Amazons top rated vendors for a very low price (less than $30.00) and it was sitting in my mailbox in a few days. It was packed in a nice little \"Just5\" gift box with all the accessories, a separately packaged battery, a wall charger and an instruction manual. If it was reburbished, I couldn't tell..everything looked brand new (and packed like new) to me. I slipped in the SIM card (see below) and the battery after easily snapping off the back cover panel (it snapped back on just as easily). I charged up the phone and it was now ready for ACTIVATION.Now this phone is \"UNLOCKED\" which means you are NOT \"tied in\" to any specific phone carrier. You can pick and choose. You can buy a SIM card which slips into the phone, under the battery. You must ACTIVATE the SIM card however before the phone will work. I bought a T-MOBILE Sim card at Amazon for about $6.00 with about $3.00 worth of free minutes (half hour talk time)on it. Then you must call T-Mobile (on another phone obviously) and go through a TEDIOUS (to me) activation routine. I finally got a \"Real Person\" after struggling to talk to a computer and gave them all the required information and got my new phone number.I went on their \"Pay As You Go\" (Prepaid) plan. $100.00 for 1000 minutes for one year. And you can always buy more minutes if needed. Since I'm not a big phone \"rag chewer\", this will suit me just fine.(So for $8.33 a moth, I get 1.4 hours (83 minutes) of talk time per month...Plenty for me. And there are oodles of other plans, just pick the one that best suits you. No contracts, no credit checks, etc.  But for long \"rag chews\" I'll stay with my \"land line\".What's not to like on the this cell phone? The Menu Setup. Trying to read the manual and follow the Menu Instructions left me literally \"crosseyed\".If you are giving this phone to a non-tech older person, they will not...I repeat....they will NOT be able to set the phone up properly. Trying to follow the instructions and press the right button is definitely user-UNfriendly.They will absolutely need HELP.But once it is set up it'll work just fine for a non techie.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just 5 brought back the electricity", "Author": "Lynn M.

Mom had never selected a long distance company for the home phone, so the cell phone would fulfill that function.  I wanted a simple one.  I set it up for her and sent it.  She called recently to tell my how useful it was when a truck hit the utility pole late one evening, knocking out electricity and phone service in her home and others.  She was able to use the cell phone to contact AT&T; and the electric company.  My mom also finds the radio nice to have with her out in the garden and around the house.  She promises me that she keeps it with her during the day and at her bedside at night.  I'm happy that she has not had to use the personal Emergency Response System, but grateful that it's there.

Hetherington", "ReviewID": "R2U416XKIDY8O4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased this phone for my mother and we are both very impressed with it. It has a good feel, is easily dialed, easily read and all basic functions are also very simple to perform.Due to the small size and small LED screen, navigating the menu isn't as intuitive as more traditional phones but doesn't require a degree, or even a manual as ours shipped without one. Overall I wouldhighly recommend this to anyone seeking  simple phone, senior or otherwise. My mothers is being used on the T-Mobile network so I cannot speak to the quality of the Just Five network.Pro's:* Size, appearance, design* Loud, clear, speaker and microphone, remarkable sound especially considering the size* Emergency Dial Feature (SOS button)* Price / value* LED light is great* Has external switches for many features so navigating menu's isn't necessary for volume, LED light, Phone Lock/Unlock, Radio* Good battery life and a nice chargerQuestionable or Con's:* FM radio really necessary for a Seniors phone? - I doubt many will use it* Case material could be textured or rubber coated to make handling such a small phone safer and more comfortable* headset, again, unnecessary and I doubt many will use it* Did not include an owners manual but Did include a quick start guide (Owners manual quickly found searching Google)* Ringtone selections were pretty badAgain, if you are considering this phone and the features suit your needs I am confidant you will be satisfied. Know the phonesdimensions are 4 inches by 2 inches wide, so it is a very small phone but makes carrying and storing it much easier. I currentlyuse a Nexus One $565 smart phone and will be ordering one of these for myself to use as a simple phone and as a backup phone.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Mom Loves It", "Author": "Courtney S. Putnam \"C.S. Putnam\"", "ReviewID": "R1IUHH48WS9TCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second \"senior phone\" I have purchased for my mother.  The first one came directly from China and had too many Chinese issues to make it work for her.  I decided to try this phone (even though it cost more) because it claims to be from a European company and I thought the language issue would be less of an issue.This phone came packaged in a beautiful box with very easy to read instructions.  The charger cord is bright orange which makes it easy for my mom to figure out which cord she needs for her phone.  The ring tone selection is limited, but it has a tone she enjoys so she's fine with the limitation.  The SOS feature works great on this phone (it didn't work at all on the Chinese phone) and we had fun testing it out when the phone first arrived.  Auto text to several people then auto call to several people until someone picks up.  After her call is answered, her phone automatically goes to speakerphone and she can easily talk into the phone.FM radio is a silly option and she hasn't done much texting yet, but she tells me she really loves this phone.  Technology may be great for most folks, but for some the bells and whistles simply create stress and headaches.  I would highly recommend this phone for someone who wants a simple, yet high quality phone that kind of stands out in a smart phone heavy society.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rubbish", "Author": "Charles W.

The first phone (yes, I know, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me) stopped working entirely within 60 days after purchase, and neither the retailer nor the manufacturer would honor the warranty.  The second phone failed in stages, disconnecting calls, lock switch fail.  This cheap Chinese piece of doodoo has a non-standard headset 3.5 mm pin configuration, despite the advertising which says the phone is compatible with Blackberry/iPhone headsets.  I tried multiple iPhone compatible headsets, all with ZERO success. Same with the charger -- but luckily I found an obscure Nokia replacement charger by examining the charger which came with the phone, and measuring the pin. Oh yes, the headset supplied with the first phone died.  Now both phones and all accessories are sitting in a box in my office -- if anybody wants them for spare parts.

Noia", "ReviewID": "R2GP6A1VRMAXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mom would never use a cell phone--hated even regular phones--but now she is getting to like her JustJ509: the keys are big enough that even her shaky, arthritic hands can manage them; she likes the speed dials I programmed for her children and doctor, and the shape and size of the phone makes it something she holds better than any other cell phone she's tried, and she can slip it into a pocket and keep with her ALL THE TIME, which means she can always be in touch!  Most phones have given her a problem with her severe hearing loss/hearing aids; this phone works very well--anyhow, better than other cell phones--in that area...so now instead of resisting using the phone, she will use it, though it is still not her preferred manner of communication. The panic button on the back is a great idea; makes her feel more free to go about on her own, knowing she could easily call for help should she need to--and this makes us her 'children' feel more at ease about her independent ramblings, too. Good as the phone is for her, it's even better for us--we are scattered all over the world, in now that she has a manageable cell phone, we can reach her from anywhere, anytime! The only complaint we have is that the speakerphone is unclear; the audio so bad that even I, with fine hearing, won't use it.

Exactly all such requirements were present in these units, amazing quick charge and added an extra feature which is a big red button at the back which act as panic. It requires somebody else to program and load with information because the device has some power inside, because it is not that simple. Maybe this is the ONLY comment.

My Mom could answer her old Motorola and set it down on the table so we could all talk to out of state relatives, but this one doesn't have that capability.  She has to hold this one to her ear.  It is amplified, but the speaker function on her old phone was louder.  And the display is really not any larger than her old Motorola Razor.  The buttons are larger, which helps.  The multiple programmable speed dial buttons are a very good feature though.  You can program contacts to be dialed by holding down a key until the number dials.

I also had hired a new tutor and I do want her to easily reach me when she wants to. I\u2019m a full-time single mom so I hire sitters/tutors to do what I can\u2019t when I am working. It makes sense now that she's well into grade school and asserting her independence which I encourage. However, I am still a firm believer that a mobile phone with all the bells and whistles (ie. texting, emailing, wireless surfing is too much too soon for her age) and this device comes with basic rules. It stays in a dedicated space in her backpack in locked mode especially during school hours. She calls me when she\u2019s at her sitter\u2019s house and if she has or doesn\u2019t have enough snacks, or is not feeling well, etc. I feel connected hence relieved. Batter life is awesome, I charge it every weekly. I added her to my AT&T; service provider for $10/mo ($36 fee was waived as a courtesy) which they refer to as a family plan and we share my unlimited talk minutes, easy as pie.I did my research, narrowed it down to 4 models and this product was number 1 on that list of alternatives for her age group and purpose. Perks are only the numbers I program in it can call her. There will be no chatting with friends after school; she can talk to them when she\u2019s in school. The SOS feature is a perk for obvious reasons. There is a texting feature but it's the old school press #2 to type in the letter \"C\" kind of thing.

I wanted a simple device, does the job and the size of this phone is perfect for her little hands. The big buttons are user friendly. I chose white so that she could easily find it in the dark.
