{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent quality", "Author": "Jersey", "ReviewID": "R47V2EDX3G0NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this phone and this review that sums it up perfectly for me:DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users. You wont regret, there is a world outside iTunes :)", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good price, description was a little misleading and confusing", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R249JG4T2O7GEV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone came in from shipping in pretty decent condition, I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being banged up and heavily used, 10 being brand new) this is probably a 9. The seller was very approachable and contacted me several times to ensure that everything was on the up and up. Shipping was very quick as well - got it in probably 5 business days. The ESN is clean and Sprint had no issue swapping my phone over. The phone operates the way you'd expect it to, so no surprises in that department.Now, the description and the picture together are a little confusing, and I should've asked more questions in that direction. This is NOT a 32gb white Galaxy SIII - it's a 16gb metallic blue Galaxy SIII. The picture shows the right color. For me, this wasn't a big deal - while I bought an extended life battery for it with a white backplate, I also bought a black cover for the phone as well, so the color difference isn't really noticeable. Still, for others, that may be a problem.One thing that was a little iffy for me is that the phone wasn't wiped when I got it - it still had some stuff that the prior owner had on it (a few apps), and it was rooted. Not a big deal to me, I factory wiped it, but it may be a problem for other buyers.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "The original phone didn't work", "Author": "Ira", "ReviewID": "R2Z0JC3DGTLCAA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I lost a week of my phone being activated and I was telling him that it wasn't working properly.

I previously had the original Galaxy, then the Galaxy II, and because of the great performance of these two previous phones, I decided to stay with the same line when I upgraded to the Galaxy III.  I have not been disappointed.  The pictures are great, even the zoom pictures are clear.  The phone is very user friendly.  I can't find one thing bad to say about the phone, or about the vendor who I bought it from.  I received this phone in less than the expected time, the phone was exactly as described on the ad.  The customer service and promptness were excellent and I could not be happier. I had ordered this phone from another vendor and the experience I had with them was horrible, they sent me the wrong phone and when I wanted to return it, it was such an awful experience, that it made me appreciate the customer service from this company even more.  In summary, both the phone and the vendor I ordered from are both excellent and I am very pleased.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Vicki P", "ReviewID": "R17CLRPBBTHB02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone after my trusty Blackberry was on it's last legs.

But, when I tried to activate the phone with Sprint, they claimed it was incompatible with their system although it was clearly marked as a Sprint phone.  We could not resolve even with a \"repair\" ticket into Sprint (an internal software adjustment Sprint does on their system to accept outside phones).  Had no choice but to return phone.  Weeks later, found out the phone could have been accepted under an \"upgrade\" contract if I had asked for it, but at an additional price.  Cost to \"upgrade\" the contract far exceeded the actual cost of the phone in the first year!  The phony upgrade is because Sprint is quietly trying to phase out smart phones from their earlier grandfathered contracts.  I suppose if they advertised that, Sprint would have a mass exodus of customers.  5 stars for the vendor; ZERO for Sprint.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just like new", "Author": "adam edwards", "ReviewID": "R3JHF9ITMBCL0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first phone I ordered had some issues charging, I contacted the company and they said they would exchange it, which they did.

This phone came to me in almost perfect condition, with the stock battery and wall charger. The only way I could tell it was used, was that the screen protector had a few scratches on it. I took it off once I installed my otterbox and the screen was virgin. Everything else is a breeze. I have installed atleast 30 apps on my phone: about 50% of them being stuff like: compass,netflix,vine,google chrome, lookout,etc. The other half was games such as temple run, fruit ninja, subway surfer, etc. I have 400 songs on it and this device operates with nearly no lag. Sometimes it may be a 0.5 second delay, but thats nothing! If I see any product from this company on Amazon that I'm interested in, I won't hesitate to buy.The only thing that bothered me was that it didnt come with a micro sd card.

When I took it to the Sprint store, I went ahead and bought a screen protector, when the Sprint employee went to clean the screen before putting the protector on, he showed me not less then 20 scratches on the phone and one really deep one that he said could impact the phone's performance.  Once the screen protector was put on, you could not see the smaller scratches.  The deep scratch has so far not impacted the performance.  The battery life only lasted about 30-40 minutes, so it had been well used, so I had to buy a new battery as well.  Also, the standard shipping was $4.99.  The seller later tried to get $20 additional out of me for shipping, so I had to contact Amazon and they straightened it out with the seller.
