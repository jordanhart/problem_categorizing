I just got the phone yesterday, so this is not a full review.PS  I purchased from seller Open Wireless Group on Amazon for $148.99.PRO'S:1. Great Resolution2. Decent Battery Life (if you close applications running that don't need to be on) IF you turn screen light off when not in use; otherwise battery will be out in a 2-3 hours3. Decent Camera with autofocus - great pictures in daylight4. Easy to update firmware5. Easy to figure out how to operate6. Mine came with a European Adapter and US adapter7. Easy access to Android Market8. Easily connects to unsecure/free WIFI networks9. Touch screen sensitive; recognizes all actions / Smooth transitions between screens10. Cool feature to dismiss unwanted calls with generic messages (or you can customize message)CONS:1. Factory-installed apps cannot be removed unless your root your phone (and lose warranty; if you have one)2. Very annoying news feed on home screen.  (BUT I was able to remove it by pushing down on app until it vibrated, than moved to trash.  Done!)3. Small keyboard (but I remedied this by going to android market and downloading ThickButtons and use as default)4. May have trouble connecting to secure WIFI network like I did.  Refused to connect until I found the MAC address of the phone, then added it to my router's list of approved mac filters / Without doing this, could not use my own wifi (Seller had phone and was able to connect to their secure WIFI network w/o issue; so it may just be the way my router was set up)5. There is a notice in the back of the manual that says the phone's WI-FI (WLAN) cannot be used outside in France, Ukraine or Russia.  Since I am planning on taking phone to France, this may pose a problem.  Emailing LG was a waste of time and energy as they have no knowledge of their own products!  Eventually, it was explained to me by the seller that those countries use a lower frequency for their free outdoor wifi that smartphones cannot connect to, as it is too low.  But apparently, cafe's, other businesses with free WIFI inside, we should be able to connect.  I may just have to buy a sim card from France that includes a data plan to make sure I can connect online6. Horrible pictures without light; very dark and grainyHave not played uploaded music, movies yet.  But from other reviews, I hear it does well.All in all, I like the phone.  Will keep.UPDATE:  Easy to take photos and set as wallpaper or email.  Also using Dolphin HD web browser instead of installed one for more features and more useable space on screen.  I've upgraded my review from a 3 to 4 star.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "UGH", "Author": "Erika", "ReviewID": "REWALFRQ6QM92", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, maybe I got a dud. I bought this phone at amazon nearly a month ago for significantly less than it's currently going for ($115), and after 3 weeks of using the phone, I started having problems. First, the phone said it was charging when it wasn't plugged in - weird, I thought, but liveable. Then came the next problem - when it was turned off and turned back on the screen would read \"emergency mode\" and wouldn't respond to any of the buttons - and wouldn't go back to normal unless I took out the battery for at least 30 minutes. And finally, when I turned the phone off and plugged it in to charge, it automatically turned back on and wouldn't go off. Needless to say, since I was only allowed to return, and not exchange the defective phone, I've moved on to a completely different - and hopefully better - phone.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "dogintheair", "ReviewID": "R2T2APWBA4M9RY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good: screen, and speed.
