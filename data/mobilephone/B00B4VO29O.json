Seems like the best you can get anymore without being required to purchase a Data Plan with the phone. I don't need one, but I still like the idea of having a smart phone. Its capable of using Wi-Fi calling for one, which is free to use anywhere in the US. But why should I have to pay for a Data Plan for my phone when I'm going to use data services on my own Wi-Fi connection which I'm already paying for? I'd definately have bought a Samsung Galaxy if the costly Data plans weren't required with the purchase of the phone. Really $70.00 extra for 24 months? That's like paying $1640 in adition to $150 for the phone. Almost $2000 for phone? Ridiculous. This phone is $100.00 once, a big difference.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone stinks.

I've had it six months with no complaints.  I like it for ease of visibility, easy access to features and multi-screen programming.  Visual voicemail is a big plus for me and no data package is required.  I do not use it for internet connection so I have no comparison with other touch screen phones.  For me, this is a superb phone for those who want to use a phone with all the conveniences of touchscreen.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$109.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Huawei Summit - Black (T-mobile) Smartphone *Brand New*", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510KJRP9jFL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B4VO29O"}}
