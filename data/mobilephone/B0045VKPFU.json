It worked perfectly, cellphone quality sound. Battery lasts quite a bit, plus you can charge it using USB. Not as big as it looks and it is quite rugged, had it in the tool compartment while off roading, woked fine in 100 degree heat.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding!!", "Author": "MSDC", "ReviewID": "R3S3GI4E2YYO72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid hikker and have used different sattelite phones in my many treks. From Globalstar to Iridium, I've used them all. All of them usually required a spot were the signal was good and to be very still. I have used this phone from a moving car while crossing over the Andes with very good reception. I have also used it in the middle of the desert in Peru, in a hike over the Callejon de Huaylas in Peru and in the middle of nowhere in Costa Rica. I'm very happy with this phone.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best deal for a satphone", "Author": "Robert A. Staton", "ReviewID": "R3UC9TEKZHRL7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The sound quality is similar to a cell phone.  Not the same, just different.  I think it sounds \"cleaner\" than a cell phone, but slightly robotic sometimes.  Once you have a good signal, it will not drop the call.  Other carriers tend to drop calls a lot because their satellites are constantly moving and are often near the horizon.  It does text messaging, short emails, and twitter, using the numeric keypad.  It's great for emergencies, hiking, or international travel.  Like all satellite phones, it's not designed to work indoors, but I've been able to make calls indoors anyway!  Or, if you can get a signal by a window, you can use a bluetooth headset to extend the indoor range. I have used this bluetooth handset with mine: New TK2 Mini Bluetooth Handset White, working with iPhone,iPad,Smart Phone,Tablet PC,PC NoteBook,MID,Voip,Messenger,Skype", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "No More Two Year prepaid options, Max is one year.", "Author": "Steven M.", "ReviewID": "R19GRB8DJ135F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone works great, but the description is old and does not take into account the fact that Inmarsat no longer offers a 2 year prepaid plan. The max length of a prepaid plan is now 1 year. You have to buy 500 minutes to get a plan that lasts a year. Anything less than 500 minutes is good for 6 months.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great SAT phone-speakerphone not good", "Author": "Satphoneguy", "ReviewID": "R23S32OY558MWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The voice quality is excellent.
