Schneider", "ReviewID": "R1BOHXH4YXVO12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After rolling through four phones, this is the first I have found acceptable. I don't want a lot of features, just the functionality that is offered with quad band architecture and good call quality. I got it with this phone. Voice quality is the best I've heard so far. Connectivity with Bluetooth is flawless -- better than the LG and Samsung phones previously tried. Battery life is good. Screen is good. Camera is decent. Of course the software and features aren't as snappy or as fast as a smartphone. So stop yer whining knuckleheads! The Cedar a great phone. At the end of the day, I returned all the LG and Samsung models, paying a restocking feel to ATT, and bought two Cedar unlocked phones at full retail with NO REGRETS. My wife and I are very happy with these phones.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice looking phone, 3G only @ 2100", "Author": "Luis Mansilla Miranda", "ReviewID": "R34DVB6VQA1HHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone support GSM/GPRS/EDGE @ 850/900/1800/1900 and UMTS/HSPA Band I, that is to say support 3G @ 2100 ... which is strange right???, not the same frequency as GSM.Anyway, menu phone language only in english, french, dutch and some other who-cares asian languages. If you have problem accesing internet via EDGE, just update software, repairing current software.It would be ideal for amazon to provide more information about phones in order not to gamble in the choice. Also, Sony Ericsson does not allow you to choose software to upgrade the phone (I don't see how!).", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Phone memory up to 280MB, with microSD support (up to 16 GB)\n240x320 pixel TFT screen\nSupports networks: GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900, UMTS/HSPA 850/1900/2100, and UMTS/HSPA 2100", "Name": "Sony Ericsson Cedar J108i Unlocked QuadBand GSM Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No US Warranty (Black/Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZunG7pUXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0046EJYP8"}}
