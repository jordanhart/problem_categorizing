Turned out I was partially right. Here is some helpful info:PROS: Looks and feels great - you would believe that this is a new HTC or a pretty expensive android device. The screen is nicely bright, the phone signal is loud and clear, and, overall, the android system is responsive and relatively fast. The phone also comes with two batteries which is a plus.CONS: The software has issues in terms of PC connectivity. A proper USB driver is missing and only the SD card will be recognized by a PC (mine runs Windows 7). After sending an e-mail to the company that produces these phones, I obtained a very, very convoluted answer how to upgrade the software and decided not to do it.The internal memory storage space is VERY little - upgrade a few apps, install 2-3 larger apps like Viber, and you will be out of space immediately. You'll need to clean bloatware by rooting the phone. I had to learn how to do it.Battery life is low - you will likely need to charge the phone every evening.The battery cover is somewhat difficult to open - you will need to apply considerable pressure to do so. The 3 MP camera is not particularly good either.You can play all sorts of media files with this phone, but if, let us say, movie files (mkv, mp4, avi, etc.) are larger than 300 MB, the playback constantly interrupts..The wireless receptivity is average: Google Play, for example, often loses signal.Overall - solid as a phone, looks and feels great, but has multiple performance/connectivity/storage issues.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Whew!", "Author": "Vale", "ReviewID": "R1LLGNS1G7OUE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Am breathing a sigh of relief because am all the way in Saint Lucia, and I know if there were any problems with this phone, i would have a shipping nightmare on my hands to send it back.First off, the phone is exactly as described. It came packaged with everything including a screen protector and case which is just excellent as am not sure if there are others on the market to fit this phone. There were also 2 batteries, a headset, charger and adapter.Secondly, for a dual sim phone its very good. The android system makes it look and behave like any other top brand phones out there. Works great with both carriers and google play.I've already downloaded whatsapp.When i read that it was 2G, i was a little skeptical, however it works great with both my carries who are 3G and 4G.Love it, Love it, Love it.Its a great affordable android dual sim 4.0 smart phone, that's nice to look at, feels strong and works great.UPDATE. 12/1/13The phone works great but for some memory issues. Since it only has 256 mb of ram, it can only take a few apps before it runs out of space. An annoying \"your android memory is running low' keeps appearing on the screen and if the memory gets really low, then the phone will keep restarting over and over, mine did this for over 9 hours before i lost patience and did a reset. If this happens to you, first install a program on your computer called Mobogenie. This backs up all your apps, contacts, music and messages from the phone and memory card. It is very important to do a back up because the reset clears everything even your SD card. Once the reset was done i now have lots of space, i can move all my apps to SD and can download new ones from Mobogenie and then install using a data cable.My cubot is now working like a charm and for the low price its still a great budget android phone.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice for the price.", "Author": "william", "ReviewID": "R306MB9CTGXNII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchase as a replacement phone for my son.
