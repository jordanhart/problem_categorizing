It's very cool. It's much more sleek than the iphone or the stupid clunky android phones. The level of customization of the live tiles is beautiful.That being said, it's not the windows operating system or anything like that that is the problem here-it is the phone itself. It is simply a technological failure. I have had three phones in three months. That's right-three phones in three months. After about 4 weeks, each time I've had the phone, it fatally crashes. Trust me, all of my family and friends think I am insane for getting the same phone over and over and expecting different results. Maybe I am, but I'm forced to because that's my plan with tmobile.Please, don't put yourself through what I did. The phone is beautiful, but it doesn't work. Go with an iphone or something.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D6D3CHG"}}
