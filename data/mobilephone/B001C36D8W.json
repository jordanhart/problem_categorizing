This phone basically works with a wireless connection (with a USB Dongle that is included) that is from your computer.  So no computer on, no skype.  It is quite useless.

It's brand new and looks sleek as far as the phone unit and the wireless adapter.  The engineers put in a lot of thoughts into the unit.  The unit is so neat.  The wireless adapter has flexible standing up steel strand extension cord, one that I haven't seen before.

I tried to use it connecting direct to the USB with cable provided, no dongle, and it is working OK. A problem is that I can not dial a number from the phone, I can dial only to the contacts that were registered in the computer, that is, if I want to call a friend from the phone, I must register it in the computer previously, and then it appears always in the phone. Another problem, it is not possible to use it if the user is a Microsoft user with the @, that is  xx@hotmail.com in example, and must be a SKYPE user account. I paid US$ 10 each, I bought two units, and for that money it is a good buy.
