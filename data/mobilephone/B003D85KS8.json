For example bought a phone with triple minutes for life when I tried to use this card the pin came back invalid, contacted customer service they had to convert the card so that the total minutes I got ended up being only 1200 minutes NOT 2400.  I could have bought a 400 min 1 year service card and got the same thing, saving me 20-23 dollars.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tracfone Airtime Card", "Author": "TheDuke", "ReviewID": "RYWCT1XO8XH5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good product-I got a Tracfone airtime card that gave me service for a full calendar year and a double-my-minutes included. Since I use Tracfone sparingly, this will assure me of continuing service. And I have found that Tracfone gives me quite good national coverage. I travel quite a bit all over the USA and I virtually always get a good usable signal. I would comment that Tracfone is not suitable for a person who is a compulsive caller because the total minutes provided with a card could be used up rapidly if one engages in frequent long calls.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Christmas SAvior!", "Author": "pdonaldson789", "ReviewID": "R34BEHFLXA4P0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was what I bought my entire family Christmas.  We're a tracfone family because we used to be on a contract carrier but we quit that because we learned we were overpaying each month for nothing. I've used the same number of minutes under Tracfone and literally paid half as much for a service that uses the exact same towers so I think it's a great value.This card doubles all of the minutes you buy over the life of your phone (a HUGE money saver) and gives you a robust 800 minutes to burn through, which will take care of me for half a year.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Received a pre-used PIN number", "Author": "Bill the Cat \"Bill the Cat\"", "ReviewID": "R4DYI1UPDVPU7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was sent an image of the card - not the actual card.
