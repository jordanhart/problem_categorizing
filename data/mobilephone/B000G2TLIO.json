{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sleek Looking Phone with Lots of Nice Functionality", "Author": "D. R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...", "ReviewID": "RAXUCU77A27CJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG VX8300 is the latest offering in the market for do-(almost)-it-all cell phones.  It combines all of the standard phone functionality with music and video playback and phone, making it a media powerhouse considering that it's such a portable, affordable package.  The next step up would be a smartphone, but at significant extra cost for the addition of more well-rounded PDA functions.THE PHONEThe first thing you'll notice about the 8300 is that it's a great-looking piece of tech - stylish and modern yet also subdued enough that it won't embarrass you in business settings.  Some pictures make it look black, but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color.  It's roughly the same size (3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9) as LG's other recent clamshell phones, although a little slimmer for easier pocketing.  It feels solid but not heavy at 3.9 oz with the standard battery.  The plastic case feels softer than prior models, so it may be more susceptible to scratches and scrapes over time.  There is a leather case for it, but I doubt you could bear the idea of covering up this good-looking unit.The 8300 runs on Verizon's CDMA all-digital network, so coverage may be an issue if you live in rural areas.  I've been a Verizon customer for years with LG digitals and never run into any dead spots around town and while traveling, but check Verizon's coverage maps on their website beforehand.Voice clarity is superb, both for you and for the person you're calling.  The 8300 has speakerphone capability, but amplified through the external audio speakers, it tends to be so loud that it may distort - set your volume appropriately low.The phone has a wide array of conveniences, including numerous handy voice-activated commands (send messages, check voice mail, look up contact, examine wireless account, etc.), one-touch calling, unique rings and photo IDs for different contacts, an address book with room for 500 contacts, and so on.  I'm a huge proponent of the voice-activated commands, and while the 8300 is very easy to set up, the long-term downside is that instead of matching up your command with your own prerecorded voice as prior models did, this phone tries to actually phonetically \"read\" entries from your contacts list and find a match that way.  So, if you have unusually-spelled names with silent letters in your contacts list, the 8300 will have a tough time making a match.  Plus, when it repeats the name back to you, it generally mangles the pronunciation, making that form of caller ID undesirable.  It's too bad that the contacts list doesn't have a separate \"nickname\" field so that you could accurately store the contact as say, \"Mike Krzyzewski\" but have the voice-activated commands look the entry up as \"Coach\", for example.If you're obsessive about ringtones, then you'll be disappointed with the default offerings.  They play back with great quality, but they're pretty boring.  Verizon clearly wants you to go to their GetItNow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones.  It's not documented in the manual, but it is possible to use MP3s loaded into the phone as ringtones.The phone supports Bluetooth v.1.1, which makes it easily compatible with many wireless devices like headsets/earpieces.  You can also use this to wirelessly transmit and receive contact information with other Bluetooth devices.THE CAMERAI bought my first digital camera about five years ago - a 1.3 megapixel Olympus for about $350.  Now, for a fraction of the price and space, the 8300 delivers that same picture quality.  It's also got additional features that make the results actually worth viewing/printing, including flash, white balancing for a variety of lighting conditions (no more washed out or oddly-tinted phone pics), a four-position digital zoom, and night mode.  There are also some capabilities for having fun with your photos such as special effects (negative, posterize, etc.), self-portrait capability using the external screen as a viewfinder, and a timer.  You can take pictures from 160x120 thumbnails all the way up to print-quality 1280x960.The camera can also take videos, although the quality is predictably choppy and the largest clip that can be sent via email is only 15 seconds.  Like any of the phone's media, larger clips can be stored to the phone's internal memory or onto an optional microSD card and then copied to another device or PC.Photos taken can be used as contact IDs or wallpaper on either the external or main screen.  Both screens are breathtaking in their brightness, clarity and resolution.  They never fail to register the initial jaw-dropping compliment when someone sees the phone for the first time.MUSIC PLAYERYou can't really say MP3 player because the 8300 wants to only play files in Microsoft's .wma format.  This is because Verizon wants you to use their VCast online music store.  I purchased the Music Essential Pack with my phone and was sorely disappointed in this - the VCast software wouldn't load (it kept trying to roll me back to Windows Media Player 10 even though I'm on 11), the USB cable kept losing connection (crummy driver software), and the headphones were just so-so.  I recommend instead investing in a big MicroSD card and using it to store and transfer all of your music, photos and videos.  This is clearly the easiest way to load information back and forth between the phone, although Verizon won't tell you that since it cuts their overpriced music store out of the loop.  And if you do prefer MP3s for playback, the 8300 may not be configured out of the box to play them, but it's a simple change to make - just search the web for instructions.The sound for playback is very good, again considering that it's not a dedicated music device.  The external stereo speakers are on either side of the clamshell hinge and they pump out a lot of sound for their size.  The 8300 has a very good ergonomic feature in the form of player control buttons (play/pause, fast forward, rewind) on the outside face of the phone.  So, you can keep it in the palm of your hand rather than flipped open while listening.BUSINESS/PRODUCTIVITYThe 8300 comes with the standard roster of business apps dumbed down for cell phone usage:  calendar, world clock, calculator with tip macros, etc.  At this time, I haven't found an easy way to sync data back and forth with any desktop apps like Outlook or Notes.  There are open source apps on the Web like Bitpim that can do this, but the 8300 is currently too new for that software to handle.  That gap should be remedied soon.Verizon offers wireless broadband via an EV-DO network that includes most major metropolitan areas and airports.One exceptional add-on that Verizon offers is VZ Navigator, which turns the 8300 into a GPS-driven navigation device.  You can purchase the add-on either monthly if you do a lot of traveling by car or even day-to-day if you're just taking a short trip.  It works well, looks great, and really boosts the usefulness of this unit.CONCLUSIONThe LG VX8300 combines a great phone, a camera that's actually useful and some pretty cool media capabilities into one compact unit.  There are of course some trade-offs for each, but the convenience of only having to carry one slim item in your pocket is invaluable.  It really is a marvel for the price.PROS* A very clear phone with many convenient features like voice-activated commands.* A 1.3 megapixel camera capable of taking pictures you'd actually have printed thanks to 1280x960 resolution, flash, and color effects.* A good-sounding music player that, when combined with your own library on an optional microSD card, puts hours of entertainment in your pocket.* Bluetooth capability for wireless add-ons and communication with other devices.CONS* Incompatible with existing accessories - get ready to buy new chargers, sync cables, etc.* VCast music store is overpriced and not easy to set up (just get a microSD card and use it to store/transfer media instead - no problem).* Initial selection of ringtones is pretty dull - another attempt by Verizon to squeeze extra charges out of you.* Some of the external buttons are awkwardly sized and/or placed - people with larger hands may cramp up after prolonged periods of use.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good phone overall", "Author": "L. Kuderick \"nitey\"", "ReviewID": "RK01W411Y3LX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just switched to Verizon after using Nextel and the i730 phone for the last two years. I purchased the LG VX8300 phone after quite a bit of research. Both here and on other websites. This is my 3rd cell in the last 4 years and my 2nd flip phone.Overall I am very impressed with the performance of the 8300. Every phone has some features that are not liked or are not implimented well, but I believe that the majority of the people that select this phone will end up liking this one.Reception/Clarity of Call: I would say that it is good to very good. Verizon to Verizon calls seem to be clearer than other calls. Land line calls tend to come in very clear while cell calls tend to be slightly broken up at times. Reception in my area (Tampa, FL) seems very good. I generally get service in areas that I didn't before with Nextel. I was also advised that Verizon users should perform a Cell Tower update every month by punching *228 and selecting option #2 since this gets you the latest tower mappings. Option #1 will perform software updates, however, I have no idea if these will over write any hack's that people make to their phones. As a phone, this gets a 8 on a scale of 10.Ease of Use: I would rate this at about a 7 on a scale of 10. The manual is not written to enable you to get started quickly. It took me a few days before I figured out that the CLR button is the back button for the menu system. Knowing that really helps alot. The menus are well layed out and the options very clear. The buttons on the phone seem big enough and are easy to depress. The phone seems solid, but light. Overall construction seems sturdy. The LCD screens are very clear.As a MP3 player: It's no iPod. The sound is satisfactory, but not great. Most people should be satisfied though to use it as an emergency player. Those of us that have MP3 players are still going to use them, but in a pinch or if you are caught somewhere without your MP3 player this is a good alternative. If you plan to use this feature at all you definately need to pickup the Music Essentials kit and the microSD card. There just isn't enough on board memory to hold many songs. BTW, using this as a MP3 player drains the battery quickly.Battery: I have what I would consider to be light cell phone usage. I get roughly 10-20 mins of calls on my cell every day except on weekends. So my total talk time is roughly 1 to 1.5 hours a week. Playing even a few songs or browsing the web drains the battery quickly. I estimate that I get about 2-3 days between charges with this usage. This is pretty much on par with what I got on my older i730 and my old candy bar phone.VCast: When I purchased my phone (Aug 2006), you got one month free of Vcast service if you selected VCast when you purchased the phone. The VCast service also encludes Web Service (which you can purchase separately if you don't get VCast for $5/Mth). My original plan was to only try the service and kill it after the 1st month, but I decided to keep it after the 1 month trial. VCast DOES use your airtime minutes, so if you find that you use this feature a lot, then you might want to upgrade your plan. I use mine about 10 minutes a day to pull down news clips, weather reports and sports clips. It's a great way to use unused minutes toward the end of the month so long as your careful not to leave yourself to close to the end of your minutes and go into overages. I had the web service on Nextel, but hardly used it. With VCast, I also find that I use the Web service as well. For me, it's worth the extra money.As a camera: It's no great shakes as a camera. But for occassional use (taking a picture of a item in the store to later show to your spouse or taking a picture of some problem to show to a service man) it's fine. You can also take short video clips, but again other than for embarrassment/cute effect, it's not all that great.Customer Support: I found CS to be very, very good. Everyone was very polite, cheerful and helpful. I do suppose that some of this was due to the fact that I was a new customer, but overall I would have to say that Verizon's support people were excellent to work with.Accessories: No real Must have's. Some accessories that you might want are the music Essentials kit (mainly for the USB to PC cable) and a microSD card (purchased on the web for $40). The extra storage on the SD card is essential if you plan to either use the camera function or to play music. Bluetooth headset if you need to be able to use your phone without having to use your hands. Holster or belt clip if you don't like having your phone in your pocket. Extended Battery if you talk in excess of 60 minutes a day and use the phone as a music player or play games on the phone.Negatives: Not many, and most of them are minor. The rubber covers that cover the headset port/usb/power port are not attached to the phone so when you remove them they are easy to get lost. My old i730 phone had these covers attached to the phone so you could easily replace them when you were not using the ports. The phone tends to get slightly warm after about 10 minutes of use. It's not uncomfortable, but you do notice it. If you have the phone flipped open and recieve a call, you get two screen options, quiet and ignore. Pressing either disconnects the call. You have to press the SEND key to take the call, not exactly intuitive. The phone has a option for large fonts, but they are only available when you send text messages and type in phone numbers. You are stuck with the smaller font for the contact list which is fine if you don't have a problem with farsightedness and don't have your glasses on. Font size on both LCD windows are also quite small. The phone has a limited set of ringtones, 9 are bell variations and 6 are song variations and none of them are that good. If your not fussy about ringtones, you should find at least one that is okay. If you are, you are not going to be happy with the default set. As I mentioned the manual is not great, it takes some effort to find some answers. For example, there was no picture or mention on how the microSD card is inserted in the phone (it turns out you insert it upside down). So be careful when putting your card in the slot. The card is fragile and you don't want to force it.Hope this helps someone.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "I'm in love with it!!", "Author": "Lauren R. Bennett \"foreverLaur\"", "ReviewID": "R3BLCKVZ2ZGWZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the fourth cell phone I have had over the years.  I've previously had Samsung, Nokia, and NEC.LOOKThe phone is really nice.  It's a dark grey color.  Both screens are in color and everything is easy to read.  It has large buttons that are easy to push, too.RECEPTION/SERVICEI recently spent the weekend traveling all over Ohio and I had great service everywhere.  The phone connected every call quickly and never dropped a call.  I receive every call and text message that is sent my way.  Every caller is very clear and easy to hear.  The reception is fantastic.VOLUMEEvery phone I have ever had or ever talked on, I always wished I could turn it up louder.  The ringers were always too low even on max and the callers always seemed too quiet.  On this phone, I have to turn the volume down to medium.  If I turn it all the way up, I can still hear the caller loud and clear, I just need to hold the phone a foot away from my ear in order to avoid breaking it :).  So I love the fact that the volume is loud.  The ringtones are also super loud.  I can hear it ringing in my bedroom when I'm in the basement or in my car when I've got the music blasting.PHONEBOOKNew numbers are very easy to add.  You can go to your contact list and add a new contact that way.  You can type the number in like your going to dial it and save it that way.  Or you can go to your call list (dialed, received, or missed) and save a number from there.  You then type in the name, and you can save up to 5 numbers per entry.  You can set a speed dial, a group, a ringtone, a picture, and a text messaging alert for each contact.  You can type in a letter or a part of the name to access someone quickly.  It takes just one click to get into your list of contacts.TEXT MESSAGINGBy default, it is set to Abc (I hate it, but every phone is).  You can change it to Word (T9 predictive text), ABC, 123, or Symbols.  Sending a new text and responding to a text is very simple and easy to use.  You can also easily send pictures (and you can add sound to the pictures) or you can send a video clip.  All are very easy to do.  You can also send each text message to up to 10 different contacts.  Quite nice if you want to send out a bulk message!!CAMERAIt has a nice 1.3 megapixel camera.  The pictures look pretty good for coming from a phone.  You can change the shutter sound to: silent, normal shutter sound, ready 123, or say cheese!  It has a self-timer and a flash.  You can turn the flash on or off and it will remember your setting, you won't have to turn the flash on every time you want to use it.  You can the option to save or erase any picture you take.  The button to access the camera is on the right side of the phone.  Press once for camera and twice for video.  You can also adjust the white balance and the brightness as well as the resolution and color mode (color, sepia, b&w;, negative, solari, vivid.  There is also a night mode which you can set to on or off.  And you can decide if you want the front screen to also act as a camera.  Nice for taking self portraits!  And its really easy to save, send, and erase every picture.  When you go to view you pictures, they show up as tiny thumbnails so you don't have to deal with filenames and such, you can just see the picture.  But you can rename them if you wish.MUSICYes, this phone  can play MP3's.  Verizon will tell you that you can only play Window's Media Player files because they like to try to scam you for money.  Just go to menu, hit 0, enter all 0's  for the service code, and scroll down to 11. Music Setting. In there, select MP3 Enable.  Viola!  I got the Music Essentials kit which comes with a USB cable to hook your phone to your computer, the software you need, and headphones to use with your phone (regular ones won't work).  You can then upload MP3's onto your phone.  It has a forward, backward, and play/pause button on the front.  I haven't tried to use the MP3's as ringtones yet but that would be a very nice option.RINGTONESThey suck :).  But if you don't care about ringtones, then no big deal.  I really hope that you can put your MP3's on your phone and use them as ringtones.  Or there are website out there that let you make your own ringtones from your own MP3's.  I was too lazy and just paid the $2 a song for the stupid Verizon ones.  But the three that I got all sound great!CUSTOMIZATIONYou can set the clock to multiple different ways.  I set mine to digital because its really big and easy to read.  The wallpapers aren't too bad either.  I found one with bubbles getting big and little floating around and its pretty cool.  You can also customize the menu.  Mine is called \"Pulse\" and I love it.  It looks really really neat.  You can also change the color scheme.So.. you can change the front wallpaper, main wallpaper, front clock, main clock, display themes, front banner, main banner, and big font/normal font.  You can also change the power on/off sounds, alert sounds, and keypad volume.  You can also have a different ringtone for caller ID, no caller ID, restricted calls, and all calls.  Needless to say, you can basically customize the phone to look however you want.BATTERY LIFEI use my cell phone as an alarm, so I have it next to my bed everynight.  So I just plug it in while I'm sleeping.  I've never tried to let it go multiple days.  But it has a full battery at night unless I spent the day taking tons of pictures/videos.  I also have a car charger which is quite nice.OTHER FEATURESIt has three separate alarm clocks, that you can set to go off just one time, to go off daily, to go off Mon-Fri, or just on the weekends.  And you can set it to any ringtone.  It has a calendar with reminders, a world clock, voice commands, a notepad, a calculator, an EZ Tip Calculator, security (password protected), customizeable shortcuts, and more!CALLSWhile on the phone, you can access basically everything on your phone.  You can access your contact list and the menu.  So I suppose you could send a text message while on the phone if you really wanted to!  You can also record while on the phone and listen to it later.  Or possibly send it as an attachment to a pix message.SPEAKERPHONEIt is loud and easy to hear.  I'll drive with the phone on my lap while chatting on speakerphone and I can hear the caller great and the caller can hear me great.  It's a nice feature and there is a button on the phone to turn it on and off.  An icon shows up on the bottom of both screens when speakerphone is on so you won't accidently have speakerphone on and not know it.I basically spent countless hours researching every single phone Verizon had to offer.  So many phones had so many complaints and this one seemed to have the least amount of them.  We bought 4 of them, one of each person in our family, and I got my boyfriend one too.  All 5 of us love the phones.  The buttons are big and easy to push, the phone is very attractive, the reception is fantastic, the volume is very loud, and the phone is very simple to navigate while having a lot of cool features, including a nice 1.3 megapixel camera!!  The removeable memory is also a nice feature, as well as buttons for the camera, volume up/down, and the voice commands!!Don't waste time browsing other phones or trying out a cheapie -- they are no good, I've been there.  Even my boyfriend (who is 24) and swore he'd never get a cell phone cuz he hated them loves it.:::::::UPDATE:::::::*I am still loving the phone.  I have figured out how to default T9 (Word) text, or whatever else you'd like defaulted.  I have also purchased a 1 gig microSD card.  I just stuck the card into the adaptor and stuck that into my computer.  Transferred some songs and pictures and had them all on my phone! Why buy the LG Chocolate when the VX8300 can play MP3's too?  My only real complaint is the lack of a service light.  I have no idea if I have a missed  call, a voicemail, a msg, etc without lighting up the phone.  But in comparison to the other availabilities, it is a minor flaw.  Every other detail of this phone way surpassed every other phone on the market.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "For all-around functionality, grab this phone!", "Author": "Paulba", "ReviewID": "R3UK7X80FWZW5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is just great.  Have had it for about two weeks now and am very impressed with it in just about every way.The sound quality is excellent for both parties.  The same holds for this phone when using speakerphone.  This is definitely a feat considering the electrical requirements of a loud, clear speakerphone.  It also allows for very good pickup so the person you're talking to won't even know they're on speakerphone.  This phone has two great speakers which boast a remarkable amount of sound (even in the low-frequency response range, surprisingly).  When you download or transfer MP3s, you may notice the sound actually comes in stereo (two-channel) output.  This makes the songs you play sound even better.The camera is also quite incredible.  Its ability to take 1.3 megapixel shots is uncanny.  Definitely better than my first digi-cam.  This is without a doubt the first and only phone camera I have seen that takes pictures actually worth saving and printing.  Even the RAZR's VGA resolution doesn't touch the 1280x960 resolution.  VGA is 640x480, which computes to a mere 0.31 megapixels.  This is exactly 4 times more pixels per shot!!  You can full-screen your shot on a computer and still retain full screen quality.Many other great features abound, including the MicroSD expansion slot.  I have a 1GB MicroSD card in the mail (do not confuse with MiniSD which is actually much bigger than the pinky nail-sized Micro card).  I will then be able to get several hundred songs on here for free, rather than paying $15/mo. for verizon's lame VCast service which only lets you download songs they specify.  Another irritating thing about verizon is that they limit this phone's bluetooth capabilities.  They do this so that users cannot share ringtones and pics for free in a peer-to-peer manner -- you must get it through the network, which requires the monthly fee.  However, this phone has more bluetooth profiles enabled than any other under verizon.  Play/pause, next, and previous buttons on front side allow you to choose music with the thing shut - VERY cool.  Also, cool flash UIs - this phone actually allows you to change display themes, not just colors.  This means entirely differently operating menus and the works.  Finally, the interface is very condusive to easy use.  It gives supreme functionality without making anything confusing or overwhelming.  In other words, if you are a power-user interested in implementing all of this phone's features, you will be happy at how much there is and how easy to use.  On the other hand if you are someone who just wants the essentials (1 phone number per contact, etc.), you won't be confused by an over-complicated interface design.The only complaint I have is regarding the service (Verizon).  The phone itself is phenominal and hasn't given me one problem.  It features top-end technology in a very attractive unit.  I just hope I don't bust it in the next two years, although i probably will, lol.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Probably the Best Phone for Verizon", "Author": "J. Darby", "ReviewID": "R4PA5DLI1PJOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So it's time for a new phone. I see tons of ads for the Razr and it sounds like a heck of a phone so that is the first phone I check out. Hmmm, looks great, very stylish. But, I don't care for the way it feels in my hand. So I go online and start checking out reviews for it and other phones. Someone suggest the LG VX8300. I check this out. Wow!! It may not look quite as stylish as the Razr but it's a great, feature packed phone. And the reviews tend to be much better than the ones for the Razr. So I got the VX8300 and couldn't be happier with it.Yes, Verizon cripples it in numerous ways but there is lots of info on the net to get around this. I love this phone. Great reception, call quality, music sounds decent considering the size of the twin speakers. The odd size headphone jack is a problem but Amazon sells a Headphone Adapter for $3.99.The 1.3mp camera is great compared to older phones with vga. No, it won't replace your brand new 7mp camera but the pictures are clear and look good.The phone comes with mp3 playback disabled but it is simple to enable. Follow the instructions given by Ron in his review. It works and doesnt harm your phone in any way.Get the micro-sd card.There are many places you can get a card at a much lower price than Verizon. With it you can transfer music and pictures from your pc to your phone and vice-versa. You can also play your videos from your pc but you will need a conversion program. I use \"3gp converter\". Search the net for it. Put the videos on your flash card and show your home movies away from home. Keep in mind that the screen is tiny and not meant for a large audience. But it's great for its size.Yes, the ringtones that come with the phone leave much to be desired. There are many ways to get new ones, both free and paid.

I wanted voice command so she could use it \"hands-free\".  I bought her a bluetooth ear piece for this purpose, also.Since I am my wife's \"IT support\", when we got the phone home, I set up the bluetooth and tested it using voice commands to call my home phone and one other contact.  This seemed to work fine.Now, however, when my wife uses voice command, the software hardly recognizes any of her commands.  My wife does not have any kind of accent, nor do any of her contacts have difficult-to-pronounce or weirdly-spelled names.  One of the ones it has problems with is \"Ed\".  No last name, just \"Ed\".When I try it, the voice command works perfectly, including \"Ed\".  Verizon tech support told me it was because I was the first voice the phone heard when voice command was used for the first time.  I don't know if this is true (It wouldn't be the first time I have gotten bogus information from any tech support.)There is the ability to train the Voice Command in the Tools-Voice Command-Settings menu, so she did that and now it works better, but still not as well as it does for me.Therefore, I would caution users to not test the Voice Command software for the first time if you are not the primary user of the phone.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Comment on transferring music files", "Author": "Robert A. Moverman \"moverbob\"", "ReviewID": "R26D1O94MX62IO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found, after  much searching and discussion with various Verizon people, that you do NOT need the Music Essentials kit to play your own music on this phone. You simply need to format the Micro SD memory card (just a few quick clicks with your phone), then remove the card and insert it w/ adapter into your PC, then drag the music files onto the \"My Music\" folder that shows up when you bring up the window for the drive that reads the card. However, you either need to do with with .wma files and windows Media Player version 10 or 11, or else set up the phone to allow .mp3 files--see earlier review on how to do this. Good luck!", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Leobardo", "ReviewID": "R18SXRM5YCWILV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided on this phone after months of research, and have been quite happy with my purchase. MP3 playback is great, and you can forget about paying for the Verizon music kit- just get a MicroSD memory card instead. They're suprisingly cheap, and the phone handles cards up to 2gb. You just stick the card in your computer/reader, and use it like you would a regular flash drive.  After you drag and drop your mp3s into a folder and put the card back in your phone you're good to go. You can do this for pictures (and videos!) too, and won't have to worry about running out of space.The primary reason I got this phone was for the camera, and it works beautifully. While you can't expect the world of a 1.3mp camera, it does an admirable job at taking photos with decent sharpness, color detail, and clarity (see my \"customer image\"). I'd recommend shooting at the highest resolution and then resizing by 50% in a photo editor for optimal quality. You can also turn off the shutter sound, as well as take photos while the phone is still closed.Another great feature is the GPS navigation option. While the extra $10/month or $3/day seems pricey at first, it's well worth it. It's extremely handy when you're trying to find an address (especially in a city with hard to see street names). It'll also automatically recalculate your route on the fly if you miss a turn.Battery life is great, and you'll get several days of regular use out of it (talking, web surfing, etc) without having to recharge.On the downside, Verizon doesn't support much in the way of open standards- so you don't get any java programs/games, and can't run the full featured mobile gmail program or the opera web browser. That's by no means a dealbreaker though! I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Obsessive LG Lover", "Author": "Gwen \"Gwen\"", "ReviewID": "R3VEKMRPYRA07S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Almost everything our spotlight reviewers, \" Ronald M. Cronovich `Ron'\" and \"D. R. Jeanclerc `Reader, Listener & Obsessive Observer'\", said in their reviews is dead-on.  I just have a few things to add....1.  I need to emphasize just HOW annoying it is that Verizon is becoming increasingly rigid about their phone options.  I had the LG VX6100 for 2 years and my ears were trained to know who was calling according to the ringtone playing.  I pick up the 8300, and they have the worst selection of ringtones that are just different types of bleeps!(If you really want to create your own ringtone - press down the Voice Memo button on the left side of the phone.  You can record up to 1 min of whatever sound you want.  Start recording the song about 1/2 sec before the point you want to record and stop 1/2 sec after - the phone tends to truncate the \"edges\" of the recording.  Then, send a MMS to your phone - cost is $0.25 - and save it as a ringtone.  Again, the phone seems to truncate the end portion by another 1/2 sec here.  It may not be the best quality sound, but for $0.25 I don't mind getting a customized ringtone!)2.  On the 6100, I could still hear the vibrate mode when someone would call.  With the 8300, it's not as prominent.  For some, it's a pro, for others, a con.3.  I don't like that I do not have the option to have a simple looking menu like I had on the 6100.4.  In the 6100, sms was a bit different, too.  Before, I had to click twice from the point I put in the number I was texting, to get to the text body area.  In the 8300, as soon as I hit enter after putting in the number, it goes directly to the text body area.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I'm just not used to it.  I've sent many blank smses, (\"pages\"),so far because of doing that.I do like that I can send the same text message to numerous people at the same time.  That saves time.5.  The last thing - don't buy the Motorola Bluetooth H500 'kit' from Verizon.  They tell you it's a great Bluetooth, but they are salesmen and working off commission, so can't really blame them.  The H500 hurts the ears, is incredibly weird about pairing with this phone, as well as battery life fluctuations, and falls off if you bend your head down.  For the same price, get a Plantronics 510!  (Has much better reviews - google it.)  I am telling you here because if you get this phone - you will most likely go into a Verizon store - where they will tell you that, a.) the 8300 is the best selling phone AND b.) the H500 package is an awesome deal and a great Bluetooth.  Take it as you may.The phone is good, especially since I am not paying $100+ for it.  I just wish we could have the option of stripping what we individually didn't need, and keep things we really do want.  But, that's asking for the impossible!*Note -  I really like Verizon Wireless.  I've had Sprint, AT&T;, Cingular, watched people with T-Mobile and Nextel.  Every wireless company is essentially the same - a business, duh.  With Verizon, the bells and whistles may cost more, but the coverage I get makes up for it GREATLY.  I have made and received calls in buildings where no other carrier really works.  And for the most part, customer service is comparable.  Maybe not in store, but def phone support.UPDATE:  As of December, I have had this phone for 3-4 months.  I still say it is an OK phone.--I STILL am not used to smsing and keep sending blank smses - you know how it is - physical memory is hard to break!--I don't like how I can't put the phone on vibrate from the side buttons.--I was having this problem where I couldn't make/receive calls/smses/etc after 8pm for three nights in a row but the next morning, my phone would work.  I think it may have been a tower problem.... Anyone else experience this?--I wish I had my \"quick alarm\" option as before on the 6100.  It was very convenient to quickly click on 10 minutes or 3 hours of alarm time, plus it gave me 4 alarms to work with instead of the 3 I have here.--I wish a little bit of backlight would stay on for the front lcd so I wouldn't have blind my eyes looking at the time.--Phone is bit slippery for me BUT it has been good to me without a cover and does not scratch easily.***I like that I can turn the volume/vibrate mode off except for my alarms.  VERY convenient.***I like my \"custom\" ringtones, mainly cuz I get to choose what to record and it's a fraction of the Vcast cost!  The sound is clear enough that I can enjoy them.***I like that I have less dropped calls than everyone else on different networks.  That makes me very happy!***I like that the side buttons on this phone are not as susceptible to changing my ring mode as the 6100 was.

Franklin \"Justin\"", "ReviewID": "R1J14TZRPONZLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a top-notch piece of equipment that is first and foremost a good phone, but doesn't sacrifice some fun features, this is the way to go.  I spent quite a bit of time comparing this with the Motorola RAZR V3m, and decided on the LG for some very key reasons: 1. Better battery life 2. Brighter screen (though smaller than RAZR) 3. Camera WITH flash (not great, but it's there) 4. More comfortable key pad 5. Externally accessible MicroSD slotThe above elements combined with the fact that, hey, the RAZR isn't that \"cool\" anymore since everyone's grandmother now has one, led me to go LG.  After also owning a Motorola V330 GSM phone that I did like, I am so far more impressed with LG's quality.The VX8300 is a little large compared with some phones these days, but it feels a bit more durable than phones like the RAZR and KRZR.  The gun-metal gray is also a very stylish color.I have not found any cons to this phone yet, though many people complain about Verizon's propriety operating system and locking out some basic features of the phone.  These things don't matter to me, as pictures and videos can easily be PIX messaged off the phone or saved to the MicroSD card (which you will have to purchase separately).Now, if you're all into ring tones, wallpapers, etc., this phone or Verizon in general, may frustrate you.  However, if you want a good product with good features and excellent reception and sound quality as well as ring volume, I strongly recommend this phone.And buying from Amazon is the way to go, particularly if you want a one-year contract without getting penalized on the price of the phone.Also, my encounters with Verizon customer service have so far been excellent, and I have not waited on hold for long when I've called.Note: Be prepared for a large first-time bill if you do buy a Verizon phone from here.  They will charge you for a partial period starting the day the transaction goes through, then a full month in advance in addition to your activation fee, if it isn't waived.", "Date": "November 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good reception but with other flaws", "Author": "E. Campisi \"extrabooksalbany\"", "ReviewID": "RUIMDSTGPRCME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a week. At first glance, it was so many lightyears better than the free phone T-Mobile had given me that I was overjoyed. Then I noticed some flaws. I'll summarize this as a pros and cons list.PROS - Fabulous reception. The last time I had Verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house, so I was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone. Even with 1/2 a bar the connection quality was excellent. I heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well. And, in NY, Verizon has a better overall coverage area, so I was happy. So far, so good.I personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the Chocolate or the Razr, but that's a matter of personal preference. For me the deal-killer with the Chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too.I also like the way the phone book is set up. Everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general.So far, so good, but the cons are a definite annoyance:CONS - 1. Horrible battery life. This phone has a battery life like phones of 5 years ago. You need to charge every night, even on standby. Don't forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone, especially compared to the Nokias my friends have.2. Horrible voice-commanded calling. I have yet to get this to work on the first shot. I bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this - just push a button and say \"call...\" so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone. I'm sorry that's not going to happen with this phone.3. Iffy speakers - if you make them loud, there is a lot of distortion, but if you put them on medium it's fine.4. Mp3 disabled - this goes under the general Verizon greed issue, but if you go to Ron's review, you'll see how to enable it - and you'll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the \"mp3 disable\" is checked off. I enabled mine, so far so good.So, if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone. This phone has the best reception of any phone I've had. Judging by other reviews, this isn't the case across the board, but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends.And, beware, you CANNOT port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on Amazon. However, there is a plus side on the Verizon end. You don't have to get bogged down in a 2 year contract anymore with Amazon either! That was good for me because I wasn't sure about the reception issue. So, I just called and emailed everyone with my new number, which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was. I wrote this in a review that wasn't published, so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one. If not I'm complaining, because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy.So, overall I am happy with the general things about the phone, but LG needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get 5 stars from me.

I just got it yesterday, and all in all, it's a 7 on a scale of 1-10.  It has the best speakers and sound quality of all non-MP3 dedicated phones (meaning the Chocolate and others like it).  You do not have to convert MP3's into WMA's anymore.  That makes it really nice.  Sound quality on the speakerphone is very good too, from both ends.  Nice to have MP3 functions on the outside of the phone also.  Forget the \"music essentials\" kit that Verizon says you need.  It's not essential.  All you need is the memory card (Transflash, also called T-Flash) and a reader/writer.  Format the card on the phone, pop it out of the phone, into the reader/writer, put the USB part of the reader/writer into your computer's USB hub, the computer does the rest.  Click, Copy, and Paste your MP3 files over to the My Music folder of the memory card and away you go.  You cannot makes these songs into ringtones though, the phone will not allow you to copy them to the ringtone menu.  There is a website called Freeringers.net that lets you make your own, edit them down, and send them to your phone via a MM from the website.  Costs whatever it would as a normal message on your service plan, plus a one time fee for the website (8 bucks for one year is CHEAP!!!!)  It even allows you to test your phone for compatibility before you pay for it.Now for the not so good features.  The video and camera features come out WAYYYY too dark when you are taking a shot from a few feet away or in a bar/club, even with the flash on.  My Motorola actually took better pictures, it's scary to say.  The voice command feature on this phone is HORRIBLE when trying to recognize names.  I get everyone BUT the person I need.  Again, I never had a problem with this on my last Motorola phone.  It's nice to be able to reprogram the shortcut keys, but you can only program the keys on the main wheel...not the left and right soft keys under the inside screen.  That's rough cuz I am used to buttons on my last phone performing certain functions.  You have to leave the flip open to use the speakerphone, which makes it hard to handle while driving and I hate bluetooth adapters.  Also, you cannot program the phone to turn off the speaker automatically after, say, 20 secs of non use, like my last one.Phone sound quality is no better or worse than any other one I have had.  Reception seems fine so far, except I see when I am in my house, I go into the 1X quite a lot instead of the EV-DO.  Never did that with my last phones either.So all in all, I am going to wait the full 15 days for my trial period, but so far, it looks like a keeper.  I have never really had a problem with Verizon from a customer service end after being with them for a year.  I was with Cingular for 15 years before switching.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones.  I still have to play with the phone more and get to know its \"guts\".  I just wanted to let everyone know about the main things cuz I have been looking at get this phone for the last 4 months.

After some browsing of online reviews and whatnot, I finally decided on the VX8300 for my new phone from Verizon.BOY that was a smart choice!First of all, all the old LG accessories - like chargers and data cables - are 100% compatible with the new VX8300. You don't need a \"music essentials kit\" if you want to play music. You can either use an old modified USB data cable from an old LG phone, or you can transfer songs onto a MicroSD card using a reader. You don't need to buy tones or wallpapers, just use Bluetooth (or again, USB) and BitPim just like you did with the old LG phones. You don't need to spend money emailing camera photos either, just use the MicroSD card and the phone's \"storage\" menu to transfer between your internal memory and the MicroSD card.The \"LG Handfree Stereo Headset for the LG Chocolate and other compatible LG handsets\" (search for: B000HZZIGO) is the perfect companion to this phone. It, plus headphones (NOT earbuds, blech!) are 100 times superior to the Music Essentials Kit. It, plus a tape adapter, is all the handsfree car kit you would ever need - the phone has a built-in echo canceler for full duplex car-stereo speakerphone operation, even in the oldest of cars. Phone rings while it's playing your music through the stereo, you push the button, and when you hang up, it goes right back to music automatically.I didn't even know it had an MP3 limitation. I did have a problem putting my MP3s on the phone at first, but it turns out that was because it didn't like MP3s with long ID3V2 tags (esp. tags with cover art embedded). It plays MP3s fine as long as you remove the ID3V2 tags (I use Mp3tag to remove ID3V2 tags and leave ID3V1). Otherwise you get the dreaded \"Unable to play\" message. It does support WMAs of course, and I found that WMA offers better compression as well as cover-art tagging (shows the cover image while the song plays, hello iPod!), so I converted most of my on-phone music to WMA and added JPEG cover art - I saved a lot of space with that.The speakers are great. The phone is incredible. If you get VZ Navigator, a very worthwhile investment, you have the world's best navigation system in your hands. It can get you from point A to point B with pinpoint accuracy, and never miss a turn either. Forget buying a navigation system, just use VZ Navigator! It costs a little extra... like 10 bucks for a \"subscription\" (not sure what that implies) plus some airtime. Still haven't looked at the bill to see what all it ended up costing.Without a doubt the best phone LG has made to date. Better than Chocolate. Verizon tried to skimp on features and chop this phone down to size but they failed miserably at ruining it, so their loss is your gain! Grab one. Seriously.Oh... and that modification I mentioned earlier? Just cut out the center bump in older LG cables, the bump that prevents you from plugging it in. The wiring is identical. I think it was just a marketing trick to get you to buy new accessories. Your old car charger will work, your old data cable will work, your old car kit should work too if you're so inclined to have one.

All you have to do is a little dragging and dropping and then bitpim does the rest, transfer them over to your phone and voila you have free better quality ringtones.  You can do almost anything with bitpim.  With a file converter you can convert any mpeg file to quicktime format and then you have movies on your phone.All in all it's a good phone, ok camera, great media platform, and ergonomically sound.  I am slightly concerned with its durability.  Coming from the old phone I had no cares in the world about durability, I dropped it on concrete and everywhere a normal phone would break.  I suspect that this phone can take some bumps and maybe one or two big ones, but after that I wouldn't hold out much hope for it.  I guess that would be how I would rate any phone now.  With as much technology packed into modern phones, they have to be sensitive and there isn't much room for error.  One thing I know is Samsungs flip both ways phone breaks at the drop of a dime, as my girlfriend will tell you.  Also, I know that no one should ever get the chocolate by LG.  My best friend inadvertently calls everyone in his contact list about twice a day, has already had to receive a new phone because it just stopped working, and they have no durability.Once again, this phone is a good buy at a good price.  I got mine for $50 from the verizon website.  It was worth spending a little more to go through Verizon to avoid hefty cancellation fees imposed by the place you buy it and then Verizon, also you get customer service perks that you can't get if you get your phone from Wal-Mart.

Only today, it's hooked up to my Bluetooth in the car, and it stays in its little cubbyhole and doesn't see the light of day except for its weekly charge. It's really too much trouble to take it off Bluetooth, so we do all our calling from the car, and even that's not much. Our kids all all back in this state and within an hour of us, and chatting doesn't seem to be anyone's style nowadays. It's not a smart phone, but we're smart people: we now prepay for a year and, although we ended up with 120 hours per phone (my wife has the same one), we're also running $500 less than when we paid monthly. And Verizon has even gotten better. I haven't found a dead spot in this mountainous area except for Sequoia National Park where I didn't want to talk to anyone anyway.Still think it's a great phone, And if you absolutely MUST, you can get on the internet and you can take a snapshot. Unfortunately, that will cost you extra.****I have owned cell phones since the time of \"the Brick,\" and 10 models in between. Now that coverage is excellent in most of the country (mountains are still a problem in this neck of the woods), if you want a phone to make phone calls, this is probably a little better than most. It is certainly more durable than the Razr.The pluses: Good reception for the most part; great speaker phone (better than my wired office phones); good display.The minuses: The handbook that comes with it is 37 pages long. Anything after page 4 costs money. Send out five high res pictures, and you run into real money. And it may be an MP3 player of sorts, but at $2 a song, I'll stick with my iRiver or iPod.The long and short of it. After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls, this is what we chose. I don't need the camera, but now you have no choice. With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones. Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.Four stars because it's a fairly good phone, and I've given up on persuading anyone under 50 that they still need a wired phone especially when you want to talk to more than one person at a time.

There are at least three or four menu options which, as soon as selected, will happily start data exchange which may result in extra charges depending on your plan.2.

Has a lock feature to keep young ones from making calls; but, this is not same as Key Guard; still 911 is allowed to go thru (lock feature can be enabled by pressing # for 2 seconds which three different Verizon associates were unaware of and one of them owns this phone.)5.

Specifically, Bluetooth doesn't support receiving/sending phone numbers, pictures or ringtones from other phones, doesn't support synchronization with a PC. Makes you look stupid when all of your friends can share photos over bluetooth with much older phones.I found that out after I bought Bluetooth adapter for my PC. I also wanted to use the phone as an MP3 player and bought a 1Gb memory card for it, formatted it using the phone and put a few mp3 files on it. The phone refuses to play those, giving an error. There may be a way to fix it, but there's nothing about this in the manual. What IS in the manual is how to buy music, ringtones, clips from Verizon. In fact the phone menu is designed is an ad brochure with \"GET PIX\" and such being the most prominent choices. The rest of the menu is very inefficient. For instance, to set a wake-up alarm (something I do quite often), one has to scroll away from \"GET PIX\" to \"Tools\" (?)  section, pick alarms and then go through a couple of additional screens where the time can actually be set.I've switched from a 2yr old Sony Ericsson phone, and it amazes me that 2 years down the road the top phone from LG and Verizon is considerably worse than what I had.

So far, I like it pretty well. I wouldn't say it awesome or anything like that, but it's a good phone.My favorite feature is the camera. The pic quality seems to be good. I know it won't compare to a real camera so I won't even go there. I can't compare it to another camera phone 'cuz this is my first one. I like that you can take someones pic then have that pic come up on the screen when that person calls. I know it's old hat to most people, but it's new to me!The sound quality is great. It sounds clearer than the Motorola to me and to the people on the other end of the line. The ring tones sound very good as well.It has alot of ringtones to choose from, but of course I wanted to use downloads. They are now $3 ea thru Verizon so I chose to do it the \"round-about\" way. I purchased a USB cord to go with the phone and my husband used it to download songs from his MP3 that he cut down to 30sec. This was great because we got to decide what part of the song we wanted to hear.As far as making calls it is a bit more involved than my other phone. My old phone had a \"shortcut\" to call people that I've recently talked to. No matter what number they called from, I could still easily access a different number in their entry. I can't do that with this new phone. I have to actually go into the \"Contacts\" to call that person if I want a different number than what they last called from. It's easy enough to do, but it takes a while to get used to a new phone after so many years with the other one. If I want the same number they called from, it's really easy...just hit \"Send\" and it brings up the last numbers called.It's enabled with the VCast stuff, but I didn't get any of that...I just need a phone, not a TV. It has the Navigation, too...I haven't had to use it yet, but look forward to getting a bit lost one day so that I can (ha,ha!)It has LOTS of menus. Some may say that's a good thing, but not me. I still haven't figured out where everything is! Most of the stuff in the menus are the things I don't use. It gets frustrating sometimes when I'm trying to do something, but I can't remember where it's at so I have to go thru everything in there.Anyway...a good phone to have as a phone. Good camera when needed for that \"oh how cute\" moment with the kids.

Sawin", "ReviewID": "R2EW35L52F0GUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I swapped for the the LG VX8300 Verizon phone after getting the Samsung SCH u540 from Costco.  Luckily Costco's policy allows you to try a phone for 30 days and if you're not satisfied, you can switch to another.  I tried the Samsung for a week and was very unhappy with how overly sensitive the touch-sensitive buttons were on the outside of the phone.  Essentially, we kept taking pictures of the inside of our pants pockets or purse b/c the buttons would register anytime you brushed anything against them.  Plus, I found the Samsung's reception to be spotty at best.After switching to the LG, I was immediately happier.  Not only was the outside more user friendly for those of us who tuck the phones in our back pockets or purses, but the reception seemed better and the battery life was much better than my old Motorola.  The photos are also very easy to take and send to other phones.  I found the bluetooth connection easy to setup (very intuitive) and the voice activated calling was fairly easy to use, although I will say my old Motorola was better at recognizing what names I was saying.  I like the loud and clear speakerphone function on the LG, too.  Easy to turn on and off with the prominent button that even my five year old can find and use.  My only complaint is the lack of good ringtones that come standard with the phone.  My old Motorola had a fabulous ring that was first a vibrate, then a ringer.  The only setting close to that on the LG is a combo vibrate/ringer.  I'm sure if I went online I could download something, but I am not that tech savvy nor time-available of a user.  I want something that I can open from the box and charge and go.  I was happy that the LG was good for someone who didn't want to spend time to read a lengthy manual.  The menus are all pretty easy to navigate and therefore perfect for me.  Supposedly you can do video too, but haven't tried that yet.All in all, a good \"ready to go, out of the box\" phone that's easy to use and has good reception & sound quality.  It lost one star due to the lack of good pre-installed ringtones.  I would actually give it 4-1/2 stars if I could.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, few minor details, but good value", "Author": "Wiseguy 945", "ReviewID": "R3BUOM8GXO6E2O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are a media geek, this phone is a great value for a verizon customer.

But, one thing that annoys the heck out of me are the worthless side buttons.  the left toggle button on my last 3 phones change ringtone from loud, soft, vibrate or silent, without having to go to the menu. This phone I have to go to the menu if I want to turn the ringer back on, and there is no option to change the sidebuttons, only the ones on the keypad. Also, the menus are not my favorite. It took me a couple of days to get use to pushing the CLR button to back out of menus. And they have so many menus, finding the feature i want to change is a bit of a pain.  Finally, this camera does not have a zoom feature for the still camera, although the video part does.  But, all in all, its decent.

Here are some things I love:You can assign a caller ID picture and it shows up on the outside display too!Everything is very customizable, from colors and displays, wallpapers and sounds.I can assign a different ringtone to anyone I want, and it sounds amazing.The camera works really well, and it also has lots of options to change brightness and quality.The menu was different than I was used to, but I think in the end it's actually more user friendly.The audio quality of phone calls is outstanding!  everyone can hear me, and I can hear them.I've made one call to verizon tech support with a question, and it was the best call I've ever made to a customer support center. The person was friendly, helpful, and did a perfect job helping me with several issues.Here is my one compaint.  I was told in the store that I could get on verizon wireless online and download ringtones to my phone. Not true.  On this phone you have to access the Get It Now ringtones through the phone and browse them that way.  All this and it uses up your airtime minutes while doing so. I could browse music for hours before I find what I want in a ringtone, and I was not happy about having to use my minutes to do so.  Plus it is so much harder to do all that on a phone as opposed to on a computer.  Just another way for verizon to make a buck I guess.  My solution?  Make my own ringtones. If you have any audio editing software, you can take an mp3, select a small clip of it, save it that way, and then email it to your phone. When you open the message you can choose as an option to save it as a ringtone! It's great!  I think you can even use voice recordings as ringtones.So in conclusion, I love this phone, and I just hope I continue to get good service with Verizon, and that I continue to find ways around the things I don't like.UPDATE:  I've read that not everyone with this phone is able to make and recieve ringtones in this way.  Apparently verizon had disabled the phones capability to play mp3's.  Yet my phone, as well as some others who have it are able to play mp3s.  Weird.  I guess I lucked out.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "basic phone verizon no data plan needed", "Author": "Luis \"Chicago\"", "ReviewID": "R3G2W9BP78MOEH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are looking to save $30-40 a month on your Verizon bill here is the solution to that quest. If you are really looking to save money you should move to a provider that has much lower monthly data fees. At Verizon you are basically making a \"lease\" payment for the rest of your life with them to have a new phone every 2 years. That is why you magically can upgrade a \"free phone\"anyway that is maybe more than what you need to know. but if you are looking to buy a phone in Amazon for Verizon its very likely because you dont want to sign a new 2 year contract which even if you dont you are still paying to get a free phone.

The earpiece that I bought through Amazon.com is worse.  I can't hear much of anything through it.  I like the features but doing simple things isn't as intuitive as with my last motorola.  The phone gets about a 3 and verizon gets a 1.  Only because I can't give them zero.Whereas the phone overall is decent, I will say that the service I've received through verizon is the worst I've ever had with a cell phone service.  THe signal is good, but trying to get these people to honor their rebate commitment is like pulling teeth.  After spending about 10 hours on the phone between Amazon.com and Verizon, I am probably going to cancel the service altogether.  Tmobile has better service and I never had a problem when I called htem up.  I've spoke to about 7 service reps at Verizon and most of them are rude and some will hang up on you.

This phone embodies style with the gun metal coloring and it's thinner than its previous version the LG 8100. Coming from a mini typewriter and 1 Smartphone and 1 PDA and various other mid sized cell phones, I think this phone is awesome. I love that I can still access Wireless Sync with my email and calendar(Get It Now catalog) to the phone and also Backup Assistant or WS my contacts to my phone. Then leaning towards the entertainment side....I have a MicroSD card with 89 songs and then 125 pix and 10 videos that I can transfer and use from phone to phone without a glitch. On top of everything the phone is VZ Navigator capable which is a life saver for a person with limited directional skills. For those who think you need the Vcast Music Essentials kit to get music on the phone, this isn't necessarily true. All you need is a Memory card reader and a PC that has a USB port, a memory card and you're good to go. On top of everything, a feature on the phone that is beautiful and not really discussed much is that this phone supports Bluetooth stereo headphones. I have the Moto H20's and they work like a charm! Plus even if you don't download music, V Cast Music is a great add-on! Imagine being in Best Buy and you see a CD that's packaged great and looks like it could be good music, all you need to do is launch V Cast music, search for the title or artists' name and sample the music before you buy the CD. Although, V Cast purchased from the handset can be a bit pricy @ $1.99, the benefit is that you get 2 different versions. One for the phone and one for the PC! However, if the music catalog is downloaded on your PC and you just want to sync to the phone later, you can purchase music at only $.99 just as you would in any other music store(Rhapsody, iTunes, MSN Music). V Cast, when you think about it, is really a great feature to have because all you need is a Verizon account and you don't actually have to have a V Cast capable phone to purchase the music! Then on top of that beautiful feature, you have V Cast video where you can actually watch live perfomances of artists (of course live but pre-recorded) and download music videos and watch video clips of some of your fav shows RIGHT ON THE PHONE!!!!! You want a laugh? Comedy Central! You want to see Flava Flava? VH1! You want news? CBS! You love Lupe Fiasco? Download Kick, Push video! What phone or cellular company offers this type of entertainment at the push of a button and all at your fingertips?
