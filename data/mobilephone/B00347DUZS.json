It was kind of a pain in the neck to do. It could not go back to the original shipper and I had to send in an e-mail to get a confirmation number before I could ship the broken phone for repair / replacement. The new phone came within a few days and works as well as advertised. Unfourtunately the phone did not come with the $50- Motorola Phone Tools CD to use all of the functions of the phone.The phone reception is very clear, It is easy to use, and works well with my Blue Tooth devices.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00347DUZS"}}
