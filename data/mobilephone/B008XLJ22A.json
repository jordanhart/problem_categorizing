Lasts all day with no problems and charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not sure what all the fuss is about I am glad I saved about 200 by avoiding max.Camera is not an SLR but works fine and can take good picture.The phone is super fast and bug free based on my experience. Also it is easily rooted which opens up a lot of new features (titanium backup, rom manager, free tether, etc.)The screen looks amazing and I love the fact that it's 4.3' only (only?). It looks simply amazing without a case. Also, you can put it in a nice case and it will still fit in your pocket (I prefer the protection of otterbox since not trying to impress anyone). I can't stand samsung phones which are all too huge and don't fit anywhere, and look akward and are hard to hold.HDMI outlet is a nice plus.Con:The battery does not come off but haven't had the need to pull it out.Overall thumps up!", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely Recommend this phone over iphone", "Author": "kanetria", "ReviewID": "R2OTAXZAGRRHQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!

I am going to Europe this summer so I needed a GSM capable phone. Sold my Iphone 4s and purchased this Droid.

She was upset. Needless to say, after trying to dry it out it would not work. She had to go a couple of months without a phone before we allowed her to get a replacement.When we were looking at replacements, I knew we were going to get her a little older, probably used  phone. She decided since she is on an iPad all day at school, she didn't want another iPhone. Her dad has the newest version of the RAZR and she likes it, so we found this one at a really good price.Got it really quickly, fired it right up and got it activated without a problem. She is still learning some of the functions on it, but she says that is part of the fun of having a new phone, but loves it. It texts great, calls great and takes great pictures. She hasn't downloaded too many apps yet, but what she has have worked great.Overall we are really happy with this phone for her. It was a good price, a little older and yet it does everything I need it to do to keep her in contact with us. I am glad we got it. Easy to use too.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery Life Sucks", "Author": "M.
