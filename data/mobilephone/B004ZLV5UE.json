{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "G. Lee", "ReviewID": "R3I1GWDEOL53BI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up the Verizon iPhone 4 on its release date and am very pleased with its performance so far.  Previously, I used a Droid Incredible, which was also a great phone.To preface this review, I am a light to moderate user that mostly uses the device for making phone calls, texting, checking email, and occasionally using internet and maps.  I'm not the type to sit around for hours playing games on my phone, nor have I ever streamed any video on my phone.  I have one \"official\" app on my iPhone that is related to the camera, and I don't use it to listen to music; I have a separate iPod for that (to save my phone's battery).The Verizon iPhone works great as a phone and has the best call quality in a smartphone that I have ever used.  This is in comparison to my previous Droid Incredible, a Blackberry Curve prior to that, and my friend's Motorola Droid.  The earpiece volume is crisp and sufficiently loud, making the other person easy to hear.  The microphone works well too based on what people I call tell me.  The visual voicemail system is phenomenal- it's all managed by the phone itself instead of through Verizon, so when a person gets your voicemail message, all they hear is your personalized recording without the \"at the tone, please record your message.  When you are finished recording...\" garbage.Texting and email work nicely.  The touch keyboard feels more natural than most other touch screens I've used on other mobile operating systems.  One strange thing about texts is that the phone will make a \"whoooop\" noise everytime you send a text.  There's no way to turn this sound off by itself without putting the entire phone in silent mode.  Not a big deal for me, but I can see how this would really annoy some people.Based on my personal experience and all the reviews floating around online, the camera is without question the highest quality camera you will find on any phone today because of an ideal blend of lens quality, the type of sensor, and a modest megapixel count.  Higher megapixels do not correlate with higher quality images; although there are many other phones out there in the 8+ megapixel range, none match the overall image quality of the iPhone.  The 8 MP camera on my Droid Incredible doesn't even come close.One thing I really miss from the Android OS is Google Navigation.  No turn-by-turn voice guided navigation software comes with the iPhone.  Apps are available that provide this feature, but they are inferior to Google's program.Battery life is excellent for this type of phone.  Most days with light to moderate use from 7 AM to midnight, I end the day with around 80% battery remaining.  Obviously, if you're a power user, it's gonna use more juice.  I'm particularly impressed with how little battery is used when the phone is on standby.  Battery life was my biggest gripe about Android (HTC phones tend to be notoriously bad at battery conservation), and it is a huge relief to not have to carry around a spare battery anymore.If you're considering converting to Apple from an Android phone, there are a few areas of frustration.  The notification system on the iPhone is archaic and unnecessarily intrusive.  Texts will pop up on the screen regardless of whatever you're doing, requiring you to exit whatever you're in the middle of to reply.  Android's notification system is excellent, and I am hoping this issue will be addressed in a later version of iOS.  Also, there is very little flexibility as far as how the phone is personalized to your tastes.  Not happy with the 6 text tones that Apple gives you?  Too bad- you're stuck.  There's no easy way to add more text tones.  A third issue- when using Safari mobile, there is no way to disable mobile view.  Sites like yahoo and banking sites will automatically funnel you to the mobile (crippled) version of their websites.  In Android, all you do is check a box to disable mobile view.  No such luck with iOS.Fortunately, there is a way around all of the above restrictions, provided you're a moderately intelligent person with a basic knowledge of computers.  This and any iPhone can be easily modified to fix all the problems I mentioned- just search online for instructions.The back glass plate seems to be fairly prone to collecting light scratches.  I had my last phone for 10 months with no case and no screen protector the entire time, and it never got a single scratch.  Since noticing the tiny scratches on the back of my iPhone, I bought a minimalistic case for it, and it's been fine since then.  Still no scratches on the front glass in 5 weeks of use so far, so I have no plans to ever use a screen protector.One last thing I'll mention:  there is not a single piece of Verizon bloatware on this phone, unlike every other smartphone I've owned that came installed with all the crap applications loaded on by the carrier that you can't remove.There are lots of good phones out there right now.  In my opinion, this one is the most polished, and despite some limitations, it provides the most satisfying overall user experience that is yet to be matched.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Advertised as NEW but was opened and refurbished!", "Author": "susan lombardi", "ReviewID": "R434QB19RG91Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because the seller advertised it as brand NEW.

I paid to have the lens repaired. He offered to reimburse me and never heard from him again. Don't buy from him. He is selling refurbished phones as brand new phones. I don't know why Amazon allows him to sell on their web sight. He must joy out of ripping people off.

After seeing my girlfriend get an iPhone 3 I became infatuated.  I ended up getting one when my contract was up about a year after drooling over it.  It was a great phone (I recently upgraded to the iPhone 5) and I would purchase it again if it weren't for the iPhone 5.  The amount of features it unlocked after coming from a non-smart phone is incredible.  The abundance of apps is great and the quality of the phone overall is superb.The battery life blew all my other phones out of the water.  The picture is crystal clear and the sound that comes out of the phone isn't bad.  It's better than my other phones (Samsung Glyde, Samsung Reality) but it's certainly not great. Call reception is great on Verizon, I've never had a dropped call and I get service where a lot of other cell users do not.My only qualms is that it doesn't support 4G and not all apps on the app store free or that great, but this is not the fault of the phone.Now that the iPhone 5 is out the iPhone 4 seems more reasonably priced and remains almost as great as the 5.  The iPhone 5 is WAY overpriced and doesn't do much more than the 4.  So overall, the 4 is a great phone and I would recommend it to anybody.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Genuine Iphone- Can't beat it!!", "Author": "Sockster", "ReviewID": "R2GD7RR7V7L46B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Iphone as a stop gap so I could have an Iphone 4 from Verizon without having to re up my contract- which I would do when the new Iphone 5 comes out.

While it no longer sets the pace in the smartphone realm, the iPhone 4 does an adequate job of handling nearly all basic smartphone tasks and offers well rounded performance; which is all that many smartphone users really want from their device.  While it is not for everyone, and no device is, the iPhone 4 is a solid device and is definitely worth a look for non-power smartphone users.1. Design.1. The compact and svelte design of the iPhone 4 is refreshing, as the smartphone ecosystem continues to evolve from \"brick\" to \"cinder block\" sized phones.  It is slim and pocketable, and the side keys are arranged in an intuitive manner.  Volume keys and the power button (which doubles as a screen lock) are very tactile, and the ring/vibrate toggle on the top left side of the phone is a great addition.  While the phone's physical appearance is subject to personal taste, i'd wager few would find the phone unattractive.  I have the white version of the phone, and find it much more vibrant and visibly appealing than the more unassuming black version, though some may find the white to be too loud on the eyes.2. Despite the phone's relatively small size compared to other smartphones, there's a bit too much wasted space on the front of the phone for my liking.  While the screen is clear and bright (there is no pixelation whatsoever due to the 960x640 resolution), it's a tad small when considering the width and length of the device.  In fairness, problems due to the screen's size are more a product of the operating system and not the physical dimensions of the screen, but the OS also has no relation to empty space on the phone's front face.3. Both the front and rear facing camera's are flush with the phone's design, which is a big plus.  Apple also hit the correct layout for the charging/data port and the 3.5 mm headset jack; the former is located on the bottom of the phone, while the latter is at the top.  Several phones i've used (feature and smart, and from almost every manufacturer) had the headset port on the bottom, which is fine if you like to hold your phone upside down all the time, and also featured charging ports in the middle of the left or right side of the phone.  If Apple changes anything about the physical design of the next iPhone, these two items should not up for discussion.4. One thing that should be up for discussion however, is the back of the phone: it is made out of glass.  Many iPhone 4 users lament this, but Steve Jobs didn't amass a fortune by mistake.  The more people that drop the phone and break the glass on the back, the more money Apple makes.  It's a design flaw, even if it was intentional.Performance1. Calls: I tested the iPhone 4 on Verizon's network in a variety of locations across Louisiana.  Call quality has been very good; I have not encountered any dropouts or conversational blips during any call.  Callers do not sound overly warm through the earpiece, but they do not sound robotic either.  Callers also sounded good through the included headset and on three different bluetooth headsets I tried, but speakerphone quality was abysmal at best.  The speakerphone is not loud enough and suffers from \"the wax paper effect.\"2. Reception: the iPhone 4 gets above average reception on Verizon's network; like many Verizon phones, I generally have 3-4 bars nearly everywhere I travel.  It rarely has full signal but I haven't dropped below two bars either.3. Battery Life: the battery will take you through a day of heavy usage and two days of light usage.  Phone calls use surprisingly little power, and I only lose 2-3% of juice while the phone is on standby during the night.4. Data Speeds: While this varies from location to location, I find that the iPhone 4 isn't as quick in this regard as other phone's i've used, particularly Blackberry and Android devices.  Depending on the location, I generally get about 10-20% slower speeds on average with the iPhone 4.  In fairness, I've observed the same with my fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t;, so it's not a carrier issue.  Regardless, I haven't had any problems loading large webpages, streaming audio and video, and moving files.  In the two areas I spend the most of my time in, my download speeds range from 0.6 to 1.4 MB, and my upload from 0.5 to 0.8 MB, which is normal for many Verizon phones in many locations.  With that being said, it is clear that Verizon's 3G network is slowly clogging up, which i'm hoping the influx of 4G upgrades and devices will address.  Despite these notations, Verizon's 3G network is far more consistent in terms of speed and connection than other carriers in the area. My fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t; ranges anywhere from 150 KB to 3 MB down and 50 KB to 1 MB up, and even though At&t; theoretically has a faster 3G network than Verizon, my data connection seems far more reliable.Features:1. Operating System: After using several smartphones with different operating systems, i've concluded they are all more or less the same with a few differences here and there: tap an icon on the screen and go.  Up front, I don't find the iPhone 4's OS any easier or harder to use than Android, RIM, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7, and I also don't buy into the idea that iOS is simpler and easier to use than those offered by its competitors.  There are a few differences here and there; Android offers widgets, Blackberry offers a few home screen icons and a drop down menu, and Apple offers...a convoluted mess of icons and programs with little rhyme or reason.  It's simple to use, but that does not mean it is always pleasant.  A drop down menu would do wonders for this OS.  Personally, I miss the widgets than Android and Windows Mobile offer, but I understand Apple cannot become too much like its competitors (well, maybe not until OS 5).  However, there is little organization going on when you first fire up the screen.Where iOS really begins to look like every other OS is when you delve deeper into the menu.  Again, there is little rhyme or reason to how anything is arranged, and for a couple of weeks until you memorize where every option is located, it can be a frustrating experience.  My favorite example was browser settings; you cannot access them from the browser, but only from the overall settings menu itself.  Is this any better or worse than other OS?  No.  Is it any easier though?  Well, no again.A final side note: iOS does not require \"babysitting\" and constant attention like Android does in order to get your battery through the day.  I know rooting solves many of Android's babysitting issues, but a lot of people have jobs, families, and other hobbies that make rooting an unnecessary annoyance.  While I personally like Android OS better for the customization it offers, the entire babysitting/rooting issue is a turn off to some, and I myself don't miss them either (even though I never had a problem rooting an Android device).2. Business functions: Apple does not have the business reputation of RIM or even Android yet, but nothing from my usage suggests it is inferior to either OS in this regard.  Push e-mail works like a charm, Exchange works as it should, and Office files along with PDF's open and render as they should.  I am not a power business user and cannot offer comment on such, but the iPhone 4 gets the basics down in this category.3. Multimedia: This is a big of a mixed bag for me.  The iPhone's 4 camera is one of the best i've ever used on a smartphone; both the rear and front facing.  Though the rear camera is only 5MP, images are clear, sharp, and beautiful as long as there is adequate light.  Night shots with flash were less than stellar, which should surprise no one with a smartphone.  The front facing camera is only 1.3 MP, but still takes images with little distortion.  Beyond this, i'm not blown away with the iPhone 4's multimedia capabilities.  iTunes integrates files nicely with the phone, but i'm not sold that Apple's ecosystem is any better than dragging and dropping.  The iPod is perhaps the most underwhelming feature on the phone; I find it no different or more impressive than any other smartphone music player on any other device.  And the speakerphone performed no more impressively for music and video playback than it did for voice calls; multimedia audio sounded waxed over and washed out on the speaker. The AppStore will only impress those migrating from RIM, WM7, and WebOS.  But one thing I've noticed about using applications on the iPhone 4 is that they don't seem to crash nearly as often as they do on Android and Blackberry, and in fact, I don't think i've had even a handful of them in a month's usage.  And the lack of Flash does not seem to be a hindrance on the phone's multimedia capabilities; QuickTime handles things well, and the YouTube app helps too.  Again, multimedia is a mixed bag on the iPhone 4, but that's more a knock on the hype the device receives rather than the device itself.Conclusion:Other than subtle differences in the OS, the iPhone 4 offers the same similar features that many other smartphones offer.  It does a good job of handling core functions and basic business needs, and its multimedia package is somewhat overblown, yet still more than adequate.  If your looking for a mid sized smartphone that requires little maintenance and don't need LTE services, the iPhone 4 is definitely worth a look.  For the price however, it offers few features that stand apart from any of the other top smartphones in Verizon's lineup.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love my iphone", "Author": "Catherine Paty", "ReviewID": "R28LL9HRXLO265", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you!

So I went into one of the trendy Apple Stores in the mall and learned that their stores are not infact full of customers - but Apple product owners in for technical support on their malfunctioning or misbehaving products!  The youngster who help me was impatient - definitely not as helpful as the Verizon Experience store folks helping me with my Android.  And while it might seem I'm reviewing Apple in general and not the phone, please bear in mind that if you buy an iPhone you too will have to deal with the unhelpful iTunes website, Apple's useless technical support and their tendency to sell you more products rather than access and enjoy what you've already bought from them.  Not to mention I just bought a camcorder and found several reviewers disappointed that their Apple computers won't recognise the best image output from their camcorders - this is because Apple wants you to buy Apple Video Editing programs.  So remember, once you start going down the Apple road, things become unfriendly with Apple blocking access to many features of your non-Apple tech products (I don't know any other tech line that does this).  As for the iPhone4 - I honestly recommend you compare it with the best Android device and see which will allow you to move 'your' purchases amongst your devices most easily.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too good to be true!", "Author": "Raynald Guirand", "ReviewID": "R1QPSOFNL9OOOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unbelievable!

I had to get a new phone when my old one crapped out, so I thought, \"Why not get the most hyped up phone on the market?\" Now I know WHY it's so hyped up...it's definitely the coolest phone I've seen! When I received it, it had only been used for 6 hours. It was in pristine condition and had a clean ESN. The only bad thing I have to say about the iPhone is that if you're using it frequently during the day, it'll only last about 24 hours, so I have to charge it every night. But that's not really a problem for me because I've always done that. I just plug it in right before I go to bed. Apps are easy to download, ringtones are clearer and crisper than on any other phone I've had, and it's true what they say: If you have a need for it, there's an app for that! Apps are also very easy to erase if you don't like them. It's also very nice that I can turn my phone sideways when sending a text and the keypad gets a little bigger (I have big fingers), so I don't mess up my typing as much. It didn't come with an instruction manual per se, just a little pamphlet thing that told me about a few things that it does. It was fun to figure the phone out as I used it. I haven't had ANY problems with it (I've had it for a little over two months) and I'm so glad I purchased this phone!

I love the quality of my iPhone 4 but hate being under contact, which is why I wanted to get the same phone for my two daughters but without the 2 year obligation. Verizon is doing a $25 per line discount on non-contract smartphones right now too. It is a great deal that can pay for an outright device purchase quickly unless you wind up using a lot of data.This review is not for the iPhone 4, but for the seller I dealt with through Amazon Prime, and for Amazon itself.The purchase I made was entirely misrepresented. Neither of these iPhone 4s were new as claimed by Trans Tech Products & sold as new by Amazon Prime.Both iPhones purchased looked pretty good cosmetically and had a clean MEID that could be activated through Verizon without problems, but both serial numbers had previous Apple registration & expired warranties. There was non-standard packaging on both phones (incl. replaced back and front scratch protector stickers with hair and dust stuck under them, carefully lifted but tampered external box seals and info tags, replaced wrappers and twist ties on wires, and a metal SIM insert holder in the rather dogeared welcome material enclosure, on a SIM-free Verizon CDMA phone). Both phones were missing the standard dot moisture sensors in headphone jacks and plug, which my local MacXpert said meant the phones had almost assuredly been opened, either for service or part replacement. Their absence would usually void any warranty on the phone. Although wiped of personal information, each phone had an updated operating system and many applications open when I powered them on. They immediately displayed the lock screen instead of the set-up assistant wizard. Clearly they were pre-owned.I am not adverse to buying a refurbished or well cared-for used device at a decent price, but I paid Trans Tech Products a premium for these iPhones based on the \"New\" claim, thinking I would also get the manufacturer's warranty. When I contacted Amazon about this issue, I indicated a willingness to keep the devices at a fair used price. They immediately agreed to refund to me the difference between what I had paid initially and what a used iPhone 4 is now selling for on Amazon, about half the nearly $200 \"New\" list price charged by Trans Tech Products.This sort of dishonest and misleading listing made under the umbrella of Amazon Prime really damages the trust of the consumer, regardless of whether Amazon is almost always willing to make it right through return and refund or not. This corporate \"honesty\" unfairly depends on the critical attention and a high degree of product knowledge on the part of the purchaser. If I buy something claimed as NEW and sold by such an established retailer as Amazon, I should be able to trust that it will delivered as 100% new in every aspect without exception.

I had it for about a year now so I think it marrets a review. This phone is pretty dependable when making calls. I never dropped a call on my end so far. I'm on 3G now thogh I don't know why they don't update mine to 4G.  The 16 GB HDD is pretty spacious. I'm able to hold 150 songs and around 120 apps and I still have lots of room to maneuver. The memory and CPU helps it run very well. Most apps never crash on me compared to android apps like google which now crashes all the time on android market in my experience. The battery is pretty good if you take care of it. Charge it when it's at 20% and don't try to charge it overnight and use a 5 volt charger as much as you can. If you take care of the battery it can last almost two days without charging it.  The 3G network does have problems sometimes because it occasionally switches from 3G to 1X which is a pain in the ASS sometimes like when I try to use the GPS or brouse the web. It even switches from 3G to 1X even with international CDMA turned off. the newest IOS 7 doesn't look as good as IOS 6. IOS 6 looked more professional. In IOS 7 the apps are more cartoony which I don't really like but whatever. Another thing I don't like is how the slide down menue is on the bottom of the lock screen which is annoying because I end up activating the slide down menue instead of unlocking the phone.  Over all I still love it. I don't think I'm upgrading for a while because it's still good to me Apple in my opinion rushed the 5, 5c and 5S. The iPhone 4S to me still feels like a top of the line. I forgot to mention the 8 megapixel camera! It's great to. Pictures come out beautifully if you allow it time to adjust to light and focus and photos don't take up allot of HDD space. Also there is a small flaw in the speaker when watching YouTube videos.

Even though Android phones have bigger screen sizes iPhones have better quality, battery life and game selection.Screen Size:Android has a variety of screen sizes to choose from. Depending on manufacture, it ranges from 3.2\" to 4.3\". A larger screen comes in handy for surfing the web, viewing text heavy pages, and seeing a lot more detail in pictures and videos. iPhones have a much smaller screen than the Android phones and it makes it difficult to surf the web and scroll on screen.iPhones offers a simplicity and better quality than Android phones. I am able to pick up an iPhone and quickly understand what's going on. It has one main button on the front of the device and everything consists of tapping app icons from the home screen. However, Android has several buttons that perform a variety of functions. It has many possible home screens and ways of doing things from those screens that can get you confused easily. Android models are low quality and are made from plastic. One of the biggest problems I had with Android phones was that it would always freeze and I would always have to restart the phone.Apple phones have a longer lasting battery that will get you through your day without having to worry that it will die on you. With an iPhone you can manage what is running in the background with a push of a button. You decide whether to keep the apps open or closed them by holding down the home button. An iPhone can give you up to 8 hours of battery life, even when you watch videos, play games or even surf the internet. Due to Android's larger screens, their battery burns faster so you're going to have to carry your charger with you at all time to be able to charge it when it dies. The Android phone gives the user at least 4 hours of battery life.Games:An iPhone has a better game selection. Apple is a major player in the mobile video game market and it has a wide selection of free games to choose from. Android doesn't keep up with the updates of the free games. Android has good games but you have to pay for them. Some of the game companies have stopped making games for it all together.In conclusion each phone has its pros and cons; it just comes down to what you prefer in a phone. Switching over to an iPhone has been the best decision I've made when choosing a phone. Why choose an iPhone? iPhone gives the user what they need, better battery life, quality and game selection.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Seller Delivers the Awesome", "Author": "leECB \"ECB\"", "ReviewID": "R1YIZN1M5F9XGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was new, sealed, and still in the box, as promised.

Although I said no to downloading OS7, it downloaded when I finally gave in to the keyboard fix and really, really makes the Iphone very hard to read because it has a transparent look to help you with other applications.  When you go online, you now have WHITE LETTERS against a WHITE BACK GROUND or white letters against a light green back ground which you cannot fix on your phones screen!  You now have to darken the back ground (I use BLACK NOW!),  just to be able to see your ICONS and applications better!  The download also changes your address book and not all address/contacts will sync between my MacBookPro and my IPhone 4s?  Yes, I called tech support but they do not have an answer as to why apple did this new look.  I called tech support twice before I did the KeyBoard Fix and was advised TWICE by tech support (documented at apple support) as the fix required 3.1 GB!  When I asked apple why the file was so big, I was advised not to worry as the fix would leave everything on my phone the same as it was but the down load needed that space to down load the 4s keyboard fix.  What really happens is you end up with the look of the cheaper IPhone C.  Apple ruined the 4s with this recent upgrade to OS7 operating system which went from easy to see, easy to read, easy to sync, to almost impossible unless you keep adjusting the brightness for each article you want to read-what a pain!.  I AM DONE WITH APPLE PRODUCTS UNLESS THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MISTAKE WITH A FIX, TO MAKE MY 4S LOOK AND WORK THE WAY I PURCHASED IT!  It is now almost impossible to go on line and read anything as the screen gives out a powerful white back light that makes you just give up on using your apple IPhone to do any type of research which means staring at the screen which really makes you physically ill (check reports of such on line).  This is the first negative report I have ever given to APPLE.  Their tech support is the best!  But, even tech support can not fix a basic, powerful, APPLE, misstep.  Why apple decided to make the OS7 change the screen on the Iphone 3, 3s, 4, 4s very hard to see with the human eye, is totally beyond my comprehension! Who wants a phone with great apps if you CAN'T READ THE DARN SCREEN!  There should be a warning that states this keyboard patch will COMPLETELY INSTALL A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM.  IF YOU DO NOT USE OS7, THEN OS7 SHOULD WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE INSTALLING A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW YOUR PHONE LOOKS AND OPERATES.

Brackin", "ReviewID": "R1XWBI8NMD3Q4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my Verizon iPhone 4 the day that it launched. I wasn't expecting any surprises considering that Verizon released it well after the AT&T; launch. In this regard I was correct. My model shipped with IOS 4.0 installed and that was very fun. The feature that makes this phone great compared to the competition is the Operating System. IOS is the best system available for a smart phone. I've owned 3 Android Phones and 3 iPhones. The iPhone is definitely the best of the bunch and I don't expect that I will be going back to a Droid anytime soon. The build quality of the iPhone 4 is superb. The glass resists scratches and the iPhone 4 has glass on both the back and front (compared to previous iPhone models and the iPod Touch). This leaves it very resistant to scratches. All of my Android Phones scratched easily.The iPhone 4 is weak in a few areas. The volume isn't as loud as it was on my Android phones (especially the Droid Incredible). I would rate the actual sound quality as high and the volume as average. The Wireless is hit-and-miss at best. Apple used the same Broadcom wireless module that is found in the iPad and iPod Touch. This module is a very low-power device which translates into low range. It's not uncommon for the iPhone to struggle with picking up Networks that other devices can see easily. The iPhone 4 lacks a SD Card Slot and thus cannot be upgraded. The Battery is also built-in and will have to be replaced by Apple if it fails. The iPhone relies on iTunes for syncing media which can be a pain if you're not a big iTunes user. The Camera takes amazing pictures... as long as the subject isn't moving. There is a noticeable delay in taking motion pictures. The Video Quality however is fantastic.Overall the Verizon iPhone 4 is a great addition to the Apple Library and deserves 4 stars. It does have a few downsides, but the enjoyment that you will get out of it will make you forget them.

No visible scratches, even though we expected to find a few. Everything else seems to work perfectly. It also arrived in original packaging, and was packed well to avoid accidents during delivery.As for the phone itself, it's what you would expect from an iPhone.

The first iPhone that I received had a completely dysfunctional battery. After returning it to the company (to the incorrect address that I was given), I received the same phone with a new battery weeks later. It was still unusable, though it ceased the sporadic battery loss after the first day of use. The phone refused to stay connected to Wi-fi for more than 45 seconds, which became almost comical. Almost. After complaining extensively to Brad's voicemail and via email (I don't think we ever spoke on the phone except the first time I called) I was sent a new-used-iPhone, seriously nicked, which functions well enough.

I checked the new and used prices and found one called \"Hollywood Merchandise\" and something else, the cost was only $175 plus tax which came out to $179. It actually came very fast. Shipped in two days, considering I live in California though. But where I live is completely on the other side of California.Down to the condition though.The condition of this phone is pretty good. It came packaged into USPS, the mailman left a key in my mailbox which opens the big boxlike part of the mailbox, bubble wrapped packaging in an orange envelope for papers, the iPhone was in a box that says \"iPhone\" on the front of it with a picture of the iPhone 4, nothing more. Came with a charger cable and a USB wall adapter, a pair of microphone earbuds (pretty cheap, but still.), and the iPhone had a screen protector on it to protect any scratches while being shipped and it also lied down on its face with some black plastic thing to protect the back of the iPhone. The phone was also inactivated ! I was worried I was going to order an activated iPhone that was someone else's. But the only things that were wrong with the phone is that you can tell someone left an otterbox defender case on it for roughly over 6 months at least. It is a tad bit scratched but I actually just rubbed rubbing alcohol on it and it cleared up fairly well. I mean the scratches are still there but it's not something you notice the first time when holding the phone. The last thing is that the vibration on the phone makes a disturbing sound, as if the phone were laying on a wooden desk and it was on silent and it makes a chattering noise from the wood, but I don't use vibration cause I never have my phone on silent, so it wasn't a problem at all for me actually.I am a very satisfied customer and I recommend this to anyone, even if the iPhone 5 is out.

I have been use to the OS of Apple for many years, as I have had a Mac computer at home, and an iPod touch since I was in 9th grade (I am now a senior). The interface was very easy for me to use, considering my experience. The OS is exactly the same as my iPod touch- the only difference being that it could now call and text people without the use of Wifi! I was thrilled. There are, as with any phone, flaws and improvements. One, that I was somewhat disappointed with, is that this phone does not have speech-to-text, which I found very useful on my old android phone. Obviously, this issue has been fixed with the iPhone 4s, which has Siri to type messages for you, but my thought was, \"Why in the world did Apple not include this feature when the very simplest of android phones have it?\" Stil, it does not deter from my love for the phone itself. The second thing that I find slightly annoying is that, without turning the phone on silent, there is absolutely no way to just have your text alerts on vibrate. The third problem with this phone is it's durability aspect. In other words, if you drop it on anything harder than your big toe, the screen shatters and you're out 30 bucks. A nice, durable case, made by many different companies (otterbox, incipio, lifeproof) make very durable cases that can be purchased at a discounted price right here on amazon! Most of these cases get great reviews, although they do make the phone a little bulky. The most important think is to get a case that had a small lip over the screen of the phone so that, if dropped, the phone never lands directly on the screen.In other, happier news, this phone had a stunning display. Images, videos, icons, everything is nice and crisp. The screen has a higher resolution than most other Apple products (i.e. older versions of the iPhone, and iPod touch). Opening applications is fast and very responsive. The screen itself responds almost immediately with very little to no lag. Browsing the web can be tricky, as you don't have the usual options as other phones, and it takes a while to acquaint yourself with the differences. The camera on the back is very good. I have found that, although images may not look as crisp and clean as say the Samsung Galaxy SIII, they are about the next best thing. The flash is very bright, and very useful in dark places. The front camera does have some distortion, make sure you have plenty of light in order to use that camera. If you are not familiar with the Apple secrets (double tap zoom, touch the screen in camera mode to adjust light exposure, three finger double tap on home and lock screen to zoom, etc.), I would suggest investing in an app that will tell you those things.Call quality is very good. The keyboard use is very responsive- I finally have a touch-screen phone that can keep up with my fingers! Text messaging is a breeze, and games are very crisp. The best thing for me about this phone is the memory. I love that I don't have to worry about the internal memory getting too low. The battery is very good, lasting all day or more with minimal use. As ever, Apple's music playing capabilities has blown me away! As i have said before, I am very use to the Apple interface- itunes, the ipod (music) app, the way videos playback- thus playing music on this device is like returning home after a long trip. Apple has done a great job with this phone, and I can't wait for the next line of apple products that are sure to take the cake!", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Steve Jobs is God!

I'm the fanboy that makes you sick. But let's face it: Apple Products rock!Not everything is perfect; I have issues with the Apple TV, but am still waiting to see the hobby device become something serious.But the iPhone 4S lives up to its promise in many ways. If I could advise you on one thing about this phone it's this: get as much space as you can afford. Yes there is iCloud, but it's not even close to it's potential. Also, if you're like me and use streaming music services, you'll want the space for travelling without a network (like on a plane). Not to mention all of the beautiful pictures you'll take with the awesome camera this has built in! I do not take my standalone digital camera with me anymore. It just doesn't compare. And, bonus, my pics automagically get shoved up into iCloud so I can share them with all of my other Mac devices (yes including the Apple TV). Siri is in beta, but just about every time I talk to her, she really hears me and puts down my words in writing.The other thing about the iPhone that most folks don't know is that the software running it is alot older than you think. Sure the interface itself (where you touch the screen) is all new. But underneath it all is an Operating System built from the Mac OS X bits and pieces that are matured from as long ago as 1993. I know because I worked with that OS (NeXTStep) back then (both as a developer and user).I see Android devices catching up, but I'm confident that Apple will just leapfrog over whatever they put out. In the meantime, I have a phone that does everything I want, with a consistent look and feel and the elegance of a well thought out and designed operating system.Now as far as Verizon goes. Yes, it's still 3G. If you don't like that, wait for the iPhone 5, it'll be LTE by then. It actually doesn't bother me that much. I also grab wifi when I'm in a stable place. But out and about I've rarely noticed a loss of data nor dropped phone calls. I can't say I could compare this to AT&T; or any other carrier for that matter as this is my first iPhone 4(S).If you're thinking about this phone, can afford the voice and data plan, just get the most amount of space you can afford and you can't go wrong.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!!!!!!!", "Author": "landlockedAsh", "ReviewID": "R3VS022W4M8F5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so pleased with my iphone4!!!

Thank god for Amazon - the price of this phone is exactly what I was looking for.The first iPhone 4 I purchased worked great for the first week but then the light sensor went out. (When you're on a phone call, the screen usually goes black so you don't dial anything with your cheek.  .. this one didn't work like that, the screen never went black.) I returned this product and purchased another one. Amazon was great with the prepaid return label and the quick refund.The second iPhone 4 I purchased works perfectly! The only thing I notice is that it is a tad slower than what I'm used to but that is to be expected with the older operating system.I would definitely recommend purchasing a phone from Amazon. If the first one doesn't work out, try again. These phones are refurbished so you might have to try a few times to get a perfect one but the price makes it worth it.

Francis \"David Wayne\"", "ReviewID": "RF264XEBL46V2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the weekend I got the Apple iPhone 4, and decided to go through Verizon. I was on straight talk and had an Ascend 2. I wanted to switch earlier, but just didn't have the funds. So being that the iPhone 4 was free, all I had to pay was 125 dollar desposit,and after that get a case since I have had previous bad luck dropping the phone. I like the over all design and lets be honest even though this thing is a 3G phone is still great. It's incredibly responsive. I have mine in a case but the touch pad is just right. I am tall and have long fingers. I need a big keyboard and the iPhone 4's keypad is plenty big for my fingers. Occasionally auto correct has me going back to correct a few things but its not nearly as bad as my previous phones with cricket/straight talk.By the way for anybody who has Straight talk let me just say that I'm in no way discouraging you from Straight talk. I was in a position to either buy a phone outright and pay the 49 to continue my service, or get a free phone and maybe pay a little more for luxury I hadn't previously had. I didn't have the 600 bucks for an expensive phone so I went with this phone. I'm going to be stuck with it for 2 years, but the way I see it is this. I love the phone. A lot of friends and even my brother do not like Apple, or the iPhone craze, or the perceived craze. But it works for what I need and that is the most important thing.I would definitely recommend the iPhone 4 to anybody who wants to give it a trial run. I fell in love with his little phone and I don't see why anybody else wouldn't. I'm on the 2GB plan and so far its all I need. Should I need more I'll adjust it. But as of right now I'm very happy with my new phone and also the switch to Verizon.So when you look at it from a perspective of what you need it works. Doesn't make you obnoxious for having an iPhone. Just maybe that you were a little curious. You decided to try and maybe you'll fall in love with his model. While itunes is great. Haven't used it yet. But I like it for everything else.Give it a try and maybe you'll surprise yourself.

So if you want a FREE phone, I would still say pay extra to get a later generation because eventually, this will be too slow to handle new apps.I noticed that Amazon will buy back the three different models almost reflects the difference for ordering a new phone from Verizon with a new 2 year contract e.g. if the 4 is free with new contract, the best offer from Verizon is $125 and so if the 5 is $200 from Verizon, then the best offer from Amazon is $335.  The iphones still have better resale value than other smartphones although all are in the $200 range for the newest phones.  This may be something to consider when choosing a phone.The battery takes about one hour to become fully charged.

It is still a fine phone even with all the newer Android phones, the only thing that doesn't stand the test of time is the size of the screen.LOOK & DESIGN (NOT SCREEN)The black Iphone 4 has a nice sleek look to it. It's smooth black casing that protects the inner battery and the camera, It helps protect the phone from drops also, the iphone 4 is very durable if you drop it screen side up. Screen side down is completely different story.SCREEN SIZEThe 4.5X2,3 inch screen is way to small now with all the phones out now. Some of the Windows and Android phones have screens the size of some of the smaller tablets. The screen is very clean,clear, but it is just tiny and isn't big enough to watch Netflix, play games, or watch youtube videos comfortably without straining your eyes.STORAGEThe Apple people know what they are doing. The fact that you can't have a SD card is ridiculous. You have to squeeze all of your games, music, apps, and photos in 16 Gigs. It is easy to do unless you have an extensive collection of music or movies. If you want more storage you have to buy the 32 gig or 64 gig Iphone. It gets annoying when the new IOS come out and you have to delete stuff just to download the new operating system for your phone.HOME SCREENThe start up screen has a very nice look to it. If you group all of your apps together you can do anything directly from the start up screen like call your mom, play pandora, start itunes, check your calender, search the internet. It is a very user friendly interface and didn't take me long to figure out all of the in's and out's of the Iphone $.BATTERY LIFEAlong with the screen size this might be the thing that iphone fans complain about the most. If you are playing a lot of games your battery will last you 4-6 hours before you need to plus it in. What is the point of having to be tethered to your charger? Sure it could last all day if you only use your phone for random google searches or the occasional itunes song. Most people don't do that, at some point their phone gets a lot of use and it drains there battery pretty quickly. I hope when the Iphone 6 comes out this is fixed.CONCLUSIONThe iphone has became just another smart phone. They once where the innovators of the phone world. Now it seems like they are just posturing. Coming out with small advancements one phone cycle at a time. The Galaxy is now water proof, i know Apple can do that too.

Long story short, I got this phone as an upgrade from verizon. Was free (well verizon FRee means 30 dollar upgrade) so I figured why not. Here is the breakdown.Pros+Phone works flawless+No lost calls+Clear screen+Good lighting+Light+ThinCons-Entire thing is made of glass! I broke mine the first day! And I am very very very careful about things that are fragile. Life happened and I dropped it because it slipped off my lap, 1 foot drop at best. Front smashed in, no longer could use it.-Had to buy replace screen (icracked 65 dollars, dont use them they are terrible also) screen now works but has lines through it and black patch marks on it. Takes away from the picture, and it was insane to fix in the first place. For apple to fix, it will cost you 200 dollars.-Had to buy a case for the phone, a tough as nails case from Otter Box (they are good) cost 60 bucks.-Because of the case (which you WILL need) now the phone is bulky and no longer thin.-Insurance for the phone with verizon is insane at price, 15 dollars a month forever. And if you break it you still have to pay 150 out of pocket to replace!All in all, the phone itself works great. But what is holding the phone together is pure trash and a gimmick to get you to buy more stuff. Free phone really means Phone Upgrade $30 + Phone Case $60 + Phone screen replace $65= $155 dollar free phone. I will never buy from apple or this phone again. Stay away from unless you want to carry around a fragile phone all day and fear of it breaking, ever drop your phone?", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "stolen phone", "Author": "kitty08", "ReviewID": "RJF31DMWN0WQO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My new iphone was stolen today.

I reviewed the description multiple times and made my selection to purchase it because it was exactly what I needed. The day I got it I went to the Verizon store to try and activate the device in link to my phone number and they tell me that I was \"sent a phone that needed a SIM card along with it, Verizon phones don't entail SIM cards.\" The manager of the store then told me to take the phone to the Apple store, an hour away, and see what they can do. I went to Apple earlier this afternoon and they basically told me It was a scam, and I was sent the wrong phone. Not a Verizon phone, like the packaging described, an AT&T; phone. I would rate this experience very low.
