Over the course of the next year and a half, the phone started to fall apart: first the camera button stopped working, then the hold button; it started to have electrical problems where it would, untouched and sitting on a table, go on mobile web as if a ghost were operating it; the screen (which is pressure-based, not capacitive) became less and less responsive and gave me more and more \"fat finger\" problems.  It has now degraded to the point where the screen cannot be used or calibrated (you have to press well above where you want to respond).  Even when it was working, it was a \"meh\" phone, but with these problems it is officially a \"do not buy\".", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Price but Flawed Phone", "Author": "Yan Gao", "ReviewID": "R3WPNVVJ47NE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ended buying two, for its great price, though Phone has some flaws. So far, we enjoyed the phone.1. Both phones arrived with box seals (round shape) noticeably re-sealed, but the phone itself seemed brand new. I assume it was opened to unlock.2. Both phones came in unlocked. I checked \"preferred operator\" in the network setting - one phone has only T-mobile, the other phone has many other mobile carriers listed there.3. When you turn the phone on, you need to set up the time/date and calibrate. Setting time/date is completely redundant if you set your phone automatically update time. You also need a very thin but not sharp(avoid damage) tool to calibrate touch screen. A stylus would be helpful to calibrate.4. It is a tap phone - tapping works but not so well with sliding. So, don't expect it works like iPhone.5. It came with some cool apps, such as radio, my account, weather, etc.6. Battery works fine - normal usage last 48+ hours. Idle last 72+ hours7. Built-in software only works with Window, not Mac OS.8. SD card reading not compatible with phone. That is, phone has no data access to SD card, not even as storage media. So, if you bought and inserted a SD card, it will be mostly useless.9. The package comes with a handfree earphone, but the plug is not 3.5mm standard stereo. Instead, it shares the same slot with the power charge/date port. Also, no cover for that slot as well to protect dust getting in.10. We've observed more than usual call drops (it shows \"no service\" or \"emergency call only\") - not sure it is phone or carrier.11. Screen lock comes on right after a call is connected. So, if you call some place need to press 1, 2, 3 ..., you'd hate it. I don't want to disable the screen lock, have not figured out how to deal with this problem", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "they sent me an awfull phone but, replaced it with an awfull phone", "Author": "nickalas payne", "ReviewID": "RQ25CSD6K70DG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i had ordered a huawei tap by t-mobile that is a very good phone as it said but instead i got a huawei u7519 which is a slow and retarded version of the huawei tap by wind mobile so it didnt even work with my company and the usb port and charging port didnt work.ohhhh...yeah dont forget that it had nude pics of fat ugly russian ladies and fat russian babies but, this was resolved and they sent me a LG GS500v which is a better and more expensive phone.but blutech usa is still awful dush-bags considering that they sent me a phone that wasnt acquired to a company so it doesnt work at all and when i resieved the phone i asumed that it worked and thats why i posted the good comments about them but it was not working so i called the t-mobile company and they said that the sim card may need to be boosted but i just got back from the t-mobile store and they said that it wouldnt work unless the phone was unlocked and that it wasnt compatible with t-mobile so it wasnt my sim it was the phone.we did try to call a amazon rep. and he the number he gave was invalid.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is deceiving!", "Author": "Crystal Boswell", "ReviewID": "R22VPCH4LJCXSZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone works good.

G. Publications \"Books\"", "ReviewID": "R26F1M1JY3W0CP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone with a renewal upgrade from Tmobile and was excited at that time to be moving into the \"Touch\" technology world.  But I quickly found that, for me, this phone was not very user friendly.  Although it looks somewhat cool and the reception was much improved over my previous phone, the touch screen made me want to throw it on the ground and run over it with my car.  My fingers are not particularly large, but I am constantly having to erase, go back and make corrections because the screen registers the wrong letters and taps. Even if I make it a point to specifically hit a key, say like a \"b\". it will come up as one of the neighboring keys...which is very frustrating when you have to go back and fix it.  Then you have to haggle with trying to put the curser in the right place and get it to tap correctly.  I have gotten to the point where I don't even want to text because it drives me batty.  I finally thought I got rid of this phone when my wife's Gravity was having battery issues so I traded her while I got her a new battery.  Let me tell you...I would trade a fast draining battery for frustrating tap/touch issues any day of the week.  Although it was older technology, the Gravity with the full keyboard was much more user friendly and texting was much simpler.  after my wife had my Tap for a week, she gladly gave it back and has never complained about her Gravity again.  I have found that using a stylus (like for a Nintindo DS) makes life a lot easier when using a Tap. But then you have to worry about keeping the stylus in your pocket and not losing it all of the time.  I personally think that this phone would have been 100% better if the maker had just included a snap on, built in, stylus that attached to the phone.  Without a stylus, the Tap works best a a paperweight.  Overall it is just a very rough use of touch technology. I have an Itouch that I use regularly and I have never experienced the touch difficulty issues that I experience daily with the Tap phone.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003Y0N9QU"}}
