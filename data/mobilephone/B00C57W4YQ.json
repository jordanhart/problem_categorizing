The phone sucked though. The Sony Xperia L c2105 let me keep that same price per month. This phone is awesome! It runs android. The internet is very fast compared to my prior phone. The touch screen is ver responsive. The display is easy to navigate and sleek. Video quality is spectacular. The 8 mega pixel camera is good enough for me. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the front camera, it's pretty bad. The phone has Sony quality! This is a great no contract smartphone!Rating 9/10", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Jasmine", "ReviewID": "R2TG57U2E1KANX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding phone.....uncomparable with others.everybody should try once...music is just fantastic,,,this is what we wanted for us,,so just go for it,", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best price value relationship", "Author": "Marcos Rivero", "ReviewID": "R2RFN1VNUJYKD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "smarphone simply unique, very satisfied with this terminal, the processor in high yield figure, the camera first, the only thing that should be improved is the battery yet with the stamina function is much less and with a more or less strong use replied everything you expect from a mid-range phone and it has more the sony xperia L no doubt.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C57W4YQ"}}
