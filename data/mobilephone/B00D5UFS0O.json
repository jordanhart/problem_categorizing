{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The ONE To Rule Them All", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R1DWUQIQDY9C4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7\" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) Some people don't like the Sense UI(user interface), and want the pureness and functionality of stock Android. Well, now you can have your cake and eat it too. Everything that you love about HTC phones(design, craftsmanship, etc.) and Android OS are here, plus because it is a Google phone, it would receive all the pure stock upgrades about a week after it is released by Google.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect and really the \"only\" good alternative to an iPhone", "Author": "Raama Srivatsan", "ReviewID": "R1FYTUF8JYP1IK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many competitors out there. They all want the fame, the fortune, and the glory that the iPhone has received  in the past couple of years.There are few competitors that deserve to be up there.The HTC One Google Editions is one of them.Build Quality:Similar to the iPhone 5, the HTC One uses a combination of Anodized aluminum and Glass. The entire body is made up of Anodized Aluminum, but across the back, there are little seams that are make of white tinted glass that allow the antenna signals to go through. Similar to the iPhone 5's back ended top and bottom glass bezels.This phone has a strong unbreakable feel to it, and because of the metal, has very little flex (the amount of which a phone can be bent [if dropped or stepped on]).The glass on the front is seamless and has no vertical bezels and gives it a larger feel.The screen is a 4.7 inch giving an insane 468 Pixels per inch. The screen might as well be a windows into real life because the entire screen has a square pixel density of more than 2 million pixels, and this is more than anyone has ever anticipated. its right up there in color accuracy, saturation, viewing angles, and sharpness with the iPhone.Camera:4 MP might not sound like a lot in the monstrous amount of MegaPixels that we have today, but this camera isn't actually 4 NORMAL MegaPixels. It's 4 Low-light attracting, larger than MP, color sharp UltraPixels. HTC has called it the ULTRAPIXEL because of the ultra permormance it gives.Camera quality and every detail might not be as you want it, but its not that often that someone tries to zoom into a person's head to see how many grey hairs they have on their head. Or zoom into a blade of grass to see if its turning yellow. well, not that I know it anyway.People will still be able to capture those beautiful scenery shots, and be able to blow them up to a decent size, just not to a 100 inches. Color Fidelity is Ultra-accurate, and Amazing, and more than I'd ever thought I would have in a phone.Video is in full time 1080p quality and so is the front camera for the first time in smartphones.The front camera is a super wide angle lens so you can take those selfies with a million people in the image without having to stretch your arm to obliviion.the front camera consists of an also autofocus 2.1 mp camera, with just as clear pictures although its not UltrapixelAnd you get photosphere, something that HTC decided not to incorporate in HTC Sense, and makes up for the loss of HTC Zoe.Software:What Can I say?Its stock android, so that means the Nexus treatment. Pure Google, flawless, seamless, smooth JellyBean straight from Google's Oven. No artificial flavoring. Just how it came out of the oven.You get updates the day they come out. As soon as google releases them.You get the beautiful feel of Android just the way google intended.Everything is perfect, and life is complete.You get the NEXUS Experience.[...][...]Hardware:With a 1.7 Ghz, Quad core Chip with 2 Gigabytes of memory, and a whopping 32 Gigabytes of space, what't not to love about this?I love the Snapdragon 600 processor, and the beautiful seamless speed it delivers all the while maintaining the versatility and battery life and a super thin, super light smartphone.Speaker:Well, they got the name right. This thing really Booms it all out. The bass only distorts on insanely pumped up songs, and I feel like I dont even need an external speaker. While watching youtube videos, I can feel the sound surrounding me, and enveloping me in Dr. Dre's trademark Beats audio.Sense Voice:HTC, like many other smartphone manufacturers, incorporates the use of 2 mics in their phones as to use the mic for video recording if you block the speaking mic. HTC Doubles this feature.They use noise cancelling features, and they tune out the ambient noise of background voices during the call focusing on only your voice so you can speak clearly to the other end without any interference.Overview:With the added features like the camera, the speakers, the screen quality, the mic performance, and the SOFTWARE, this phone is a great and probably the ONLY good alternative to the iPhone in terms of build quality and performance.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than a regular one.", "Author": "DavidAlan1988", "ReviewID": "R25FPTP9POEUD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After the release of sense 5.5 my HTC one became not only slow but also unintuitive. so I've ditched sense and fully converted my phone into a Google edition, by that I don't mean simply flashed a custom room, I mean using an update utility which means the firmware, bootloader, boot image, OTA updates, everything is now Google edition, here's my experience.With KitKat now installed everything is stripped down and lightened leaving more hardware resource for the stuff that matters, there's almost no bloat ware in the Google edition meaning nothing's hogging your RAM or your battery. The speed my phone carries out tasks is unreal, I didn't think the phone could get any faster.The interface is pretty bare however this is a good thing, makes the screen look bigger and more open, personally I don't like the stock launcher because you can't add or remove pages from your home screen, however you can get a free KitKat launcher from the play store, problem solved.Thanks to the upgraded firmware including a new radio, I've found I get a consistently stronger signal everywhere I go, my mobile data also stays connected to the strongest network for longer, no more hopping between data conections which drains battery. Speaking of battery, the phone uses more battery during games and videos but almost no battery at all during standby, I checked my phone at the start of work and it was at 93% after a 10 hour shift with no use the phone was still at 90%, great standby time.Should you buy one? Not for 800 but I would at least give it a look with the regular HTCone, hardware and construction of both phones are identical.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "this sells for 600 at Gogle play store why is it $749 here?", "Author": "Yohei fujita", "ReviewID": "R2OS3EY7QQZQUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this sells for 600 at Google play store why is it $749 here? this doesn't make any sense, don't buy here.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "THE BEST ANDROID PHONE EVER", "Author": "Fernando R.", "ReviewID": "RSOTDNWDLV7R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not much of an enthusiast so I actually waited til everyone agreed with the reviews.I moved from iOS and I bought a Samsung Galaxy S4 on July but as soon as I turned on the device, I was feeling overwhelmed by TouchWiz. (Man what an ugly UI) And even using Nova to cover up the uglyness, I decided that next time I should go for a Nexus device.My first option when I decided to leave the apple and try something new was the HTC One X+. I didn't knew what I was really talking about, I just knew that the reviews were good, the spec-sheet was amazing and the phone looked great. But I kept looking around until the wave of new high-end smartphones hit and then I knew that the HTC One was the right phone for me.After using a high-end device like the Galaxy S4, I knew I wasn't going to be happy with a Nexus 4 and the Google Play Edition phones are not available on my country (neither was the HTC One with Sense until a month ago or less) so I waited knowing that somewhere, Google had an HTC One Play Edition for me and that one day I could get it.Then the Nexus 5 came out and I was torn with my decision. The only thing I was hearing was \"bad camera\", \"bad camera\", \"bad camera\" and I mean, if the HTC One has a good 4 MP and the Nexus 5 has a bad 8 MP, I should go for the one that I like most (which by the way has the best speakers I've heard in a smartphone since ever).And I did. My brother was coming to see me for Christmas so I ordered it and he received it. He arrived and the first thing he did was give me my brand new HTC One, I was thrilled! In minutes, I was already talking with some friends about how amazing the device feels and looks. You can tell just by using it a couple of times, this was the right choice (t least for me).", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "DONT Buy! Overpriced!", "Author": "Humberto R.
