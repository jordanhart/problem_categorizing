{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone!", "Author": "Sorrel Miller-Dixon", "ReviewID": "R2AXQLCPOERCH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone a couple of days ago and it is very impressive!What I was really looking forward to is that this phone is one of the only octa-core import phones that actually supports US frequencies for 3G on At&t.;  For 3G it supports 900/1900/2100Mhz.  1900Mhz is used by At&t; for 3G.With a Straight Talk/AT&T; micro-sim I was up and running within minutes.As I expected my T-mobile sim only connects at 2G speeds since the ZP980+ supports 2G at 850/900/1800/1900Mhz.  This is fine by me since it is a full size sim and goes in the second slot which only supports 2G anyway.That's right this phone has a micro-sim and a full size sim slot.The ZP980+ has an amazing screen.  The 1080x1920 screen looks beautiful from all angles.The backlight is bright and doesn't bleed from the edges like some other phones.  Blacks looks look very rich too.The touchscreen is very sensitive and I had no issues using it even with my gloves on.The battery lasts me an entire day and still had around 20% remaining in the morning.  The MTK6592 has 8 arm a7 cores that just sip power.Wifi works well.  It connects to my network with no issues.GPS locked onto 15 satellites within  20 seconds of activating it.(tested with GPS Test app)BT works as expected.  No problems connecting to keyboard, earpiece, speaker.The loudspeaker on the phone is great for music/videos/games and pretty loud for speakerphone.The microphone was good when in normal phone mode, but for speakerphone I had to enter engineering mode and increase the sensitivity a little from 0 to 3.(very easy)The 14MP camera takes AMAZING pics.  The auto-focus is quick.  The flash is timed properly and is very bright.(much brighter than my GS3)I installed several media and benchmark apps from the Play Store to test out the phone.Media Apps:-MX Player-hardware decoding works great-does not play DTS audio.-Dice Player-hardware decoding works great-DTS audio works in this one.-Netflix-works great, no issues streaming.  Subtitles and audio in sync with video.-HBO Go-works great.The ZP980+ also has enough CPU power to playback 1080p videos in software decoding as well.  I needed to do this with 2 of my hd avi files with bad encoding.Benchmarks:-Antutu scored over 26000-Quadrant Standard Edition score over 14000-Vellamo- HTML5(1924) METAL(663)I found the physical design of the ZP980+ to be very pleasing.  The phone is quite sleek and feels sturdy.The outer edge is a silver striated metal band that provides a little bit of grip when handling the phone.I've also ordered a case, but that will probably take quite a while to get here since I ordered it from another vendor.I'm very happy with this phone.  It is way better than I expected.I highly recommend the ZP980+ to anyone looking for something a little different, especially if you're looking for performance without breaking the bank!", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$369.98", "Features": "MTK6592 Cortex A7 Octa core CPU,1.7GHz; 1GB RAM +16GB ROM\n5.0inch IPS FHD screen,with LTPS low temperature poly-silicon technology,1OGS technology, Corning Gorilla Glass;920 x 1080 pixels, 441 PPI,same PPI as Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone\nDual camera:5.0MP front camera and 14.0MP back camera with flashlight\nDual SIM Card Dual Standby,WCDMAGSM+GSM (one regular sim card slot, one micro-sim card slot)\nSupport 3G/GPS/OTG/Gyroscope/Wifi-display; Support OTA (Over The Air) update Technology", "Name": "ZOPO ZP980+ Octa Core Smart Phone 5.0\" LTPS FHD Srceen MTK6592 1GB+16GB 14.0MP Camera 3G/GPS/OTG/Gyroscope with Free Protective Film Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kwZuQVwJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HT2DLIA"}}
