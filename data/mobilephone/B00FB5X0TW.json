Was not my idea to have an iPhone, had to take it. First off, I never have used an iPhone before or use Mac computers so I have almost 0 experience with them. I work with MS and PC, and Android mostly. My take on the iPhone:First it is smaller than my Samsung Galaxy (personal phone), not as wide. the plastic case feels slippery and I got a case for it imediately. If the case covers the phone, the color of the phone will not matter since you can't see the color. The apple cover has holes in it so you see spots of color, but if you get a full cover you dont see the phones case.The new iOS, since I dont use apple stuff I have nothing to compare it to, just the Android OS. In general they operate the same, what I don't like is that the iPhone doesn't have a back button like the Android. If you use apple then you are familure with how they work but it takes me longer to manuver the OS. I find it frustrating sometimes.Adding programs is a simple install and uninstall. But I dont have the option to kill programs that my be running in the background like I can with an Android. Of course this is the first iPhone that runs multi programs at once.Having to use the app store is also a pain, they say they have mullions of apps but it seems harder to find what you want. Again this is compared to Android phones, if you use apple you would be familure with the app store.General feel of the phone, it seems limited compared to the Galaxy. I can't arrange the icons how I want and everything is an app. I dont have widgets like the Android. You have to do everything through iTunes or iStore. The phone feels small, the text pad is small and hard to read, will not rotate like an Android. It is hard to read anything on the screen (text of apps) even when you set font size to the largest size. Even with glasses on I find it hard to read. Again compared to my Galaxy phone, the 5c is small and difficult to use. Again if you have always used an iPhone you would not see this difference.I give the phone 3 star, it is average and useable but not great. My Galaxy phone I find is much easier to use and I like the larger screen, the visual quality is the same even though apple makes a big deal out of the new screen.If you like apple you like like this phone, if you use other phones you may find the 5c limited and hard to use.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FB5X0TW"}}
