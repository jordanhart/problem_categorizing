{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lots of features for the price - definitely worth checking into", "Author": "KatyKatIL \"KatyKat\"", "ReviewID": "R1EX3OZYB8OJZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I know the opinions so far are very varied on this model of phone.This is my first \"smart-phone-wannabe\", so I can't compare it to anything but previousSanyo and Motorola phones I've owned.When I got the phone, I was actually pretty surprised by how small this thing is!Not that I expected a Kindle-sized phone, but I certainly thought it would be maybe 2\" bigger than it was. That being said, it makes it a bit of a challenge for us older people who already need magnifying glasses on occasion! The saving grace for me will be that I can add the numbers I call the most to the contacts list and go from there!  The Querty keypad that I thought would be great works great, but is really a bit of a pain to use. Men - forget about it. The keys are miniscule and close together. Ladies and younger teens/tweens will probably have no issues. The numbers only exist as a shift/key stroke on the middle set of keys. See the silver color in the middle keys? Those are your numbers. Yup - that's all. I didn't even see numbers on them at all until I turned onthe overhead light and got my glasses on! So, it's a bit of a pain in daylight. In a dark room, they do light up as part of the lighted keypad.We have a regular family plan with another carrier. When we tried to add a phone for me, we were told we could not add another phone yet. (??!?) I suppose they are waiting for the current contract to expire. Anyway, it was a real pain in the rump. I started looking for other services.NOTE: How well this or ANY other prepaid service phone is going to work for you is really dependent upon your area. Tower access differs all over the country, so there isn't any way to say an absolute yes or no as to whether or not this will work for you. That being said, do some research and find out what phones are listed as working in your zip code. WalMart offers that right on their site for the phones they sell. (For me, it was between this and one other carrier. I decided to give Net10 a shot.)I also read HUGE discrepancies in the customer service and workability on this model. The reason seems to stem from where you buy it. The phones, plans and minutes bought directly from the Net10 website seemed to have the most issues with both the phones and the loading of minutes, etc.  I guess perhaps the phones were not checked for working in the areas before being sent out. Buy locally, or from a big retailer with a good return policy, like Amazon or WalMart to cover yourself. Also, there were more issues with the auto-pay monthly plans than with loading minutes that you bought on refill cards, so be sure to consider that. You can load a new card directly from your phone OR from the Net10 website. I bought my card from an online retailer and loaded the code from the airtime code place right on my own phone, and had no problems at all. In fact, it gave me extra time.My phone came with 10 minutes of airtime. The one I bought was also a package which had lots of extras, including a microSD card, car charger, home charger and headphones. What it did NOT come with and you will want, is an LG USB cord so you can transfer things like photos and music from your computer to your phone without using your minutes. (I ordered one today!)Being a prepaid service, it does not allow you to send emails with attachments (sms/mms). Net10 has so far been charging me 2.5 minutes for accepting a message with an attachment from another phone, plus 1 minute to open it, for a total of 3.5 minutes. That is, for example, if someone is sending you a ringtone from their phone. It is worth it, and cheaper than buying one from the Net10 site. The minutes round UP, so if you make a connection and only talk 30 seconds, it is still going to deduct one full minute from your account.This phone is LOADED with features for the price (I got it cheaper than the current Amazon price as of the day of this review). It offers bluetooth (you will need a separate ear or headset which is not included), internet, FM radio (you have to use the headphones for the radio, because the antenna is in the headphones), MP3 player, and oh yeah - you can make and accept calls on it too! ;  )If you want to look for ringtones or wallpapers, I would advise doing so from the ''' Net10 dot com slash data ''' website. Otherwise, it charges minutes against your account while you browse. The only app mine came preloaded with was Facebook. I think it was a quick connection - I got to the signin page, but didn't use it so I saved my minutes.On getting a phone number - that was the only \"bummer\" part - I could not choose from available numbers. I had to put in the zip code where I would most be using the phone (home for me), and it was randomly assigned from their available number pools. I guess I could call and request a different number if it was something I really hated, but I can live with it. So far, I have no complaints on the call quality.  Most of my calls (incoming and outgoing) will likely be local anyway. My husband works in another city, so we'll see when he goes back to work how good the quality is from there. He called today from the store, and I could hear him very well, and even the people around him were picked up. He could hear me perfectly as well.So, it gets an \"A\" for quality of call. Again, this probably depends on your local market and cell tower availability.One carrier might work better for you than another, and just read all the reviews you can find. (PS - I learned to pretty muchdiscount the ones who were profane. If they don't mind reviews full of venom, you can bet any interactions with customer servicewere the same, and didn't get a friendly warm welcome!)I look forward to trying out other features as I have the phone longer. I'll be sticking with the prepaid minutes insteadof the plans, however, because as I understand it, the company is based out of Mexico. I don't want to try to fix a problemwith an auto-debit with someone who lives in another country. Be sure to refill your minutes before your days are out, or you will lose them. If you refill BEFORE the days are out, they will just be added to the amount and both minutes and days will roll forward.Overall, very pleased so far. I would NOT recommend it as a business phone - anyone trying to use it for business surelywould want an unlimited plan with a local carrier anyway. But, for the everyday user, tweens, teens, soccer moms, college studentsand people who want to be able to access a map if needed, this is a really nice phone.It feels good in my hand, and I am now on Amazon, shopping for a silicone case for it. I am used to (and prefer) flip phones.However, I really wanted to try a smart phone, and so far, I am really enjoying this one. Note that it is NOT a true smart phone.It looks a lot like a Blackberry, but it isn't. I can't play Angry Birds on there, or scan the new black and white info squares with it. But I can live with that for the difference in the price.UPDATE:Okay, loving this phone still. We've tried it in a couple different cities, and everyone can contact me without a problem.The calls are clear, the voices are clear (both ways!). I wish Amazon sold the refill cards, but hey, I'll live with other places.I've played around with it a lot more, bought a USB cable (you will need one, and it does not come with one, even in the bundle),and plan on moving photos and ringtones to the phone. (You can download them, but why pay for it with your minutes if you cantransfer from your PC for free?) I ordered a gel case today as well, since I often have it on my desk, and it slides around.The gel will keep it in one spot. (Update - the case works great - no more sliding, and it looks great too.)All in all, this is just a hair below a true smartphone, and is totally affordable.Still in love with it too.  I downloaded BOLT mini browser, which is much faster than the one that comes installedon the phone. Someone else said they are spammed from Net10 with text messages. The only ones I have had were one quick textwithin a day or two of loading a new card, reminding me of their website and thanking me for purchasing the minutes. I haven't received an unusual amount of spam/ad texts from them, even though I wish it was zero. (I'll let them know if I need to get in touch! Ha!) I also occasionally get an email from them, but it is far from spam-filled, and has not been annoying.I have downloaded a couple of games, but there is a big lack of games for this phone. The model is basically the same as the GW300 (European version of the L900G). While there are a load of games for the GW300, when I tried to download one of them to my L900G, I got error messages telling me that it was not compatible with my phone! So, I don't know what they have done with that part - they really need to tell the getjar people that it is the same basic phone. Once you download a game, you do NOT have to spend minutes to play it unless you are in an online version of the game. For example, I can play the skeeball I downloaded with nothing against my time or minutes. I also downloaded a small program that allows me to make my own ringtones. The weird part is that I cannot send them directly to my phone (I have not tried to transfer via bluetooth connection yet), but can get them if I send them to my daughter's phone and SHE sends them to me. I don't know what the holdup in the loop is on that one, but a small burp is not insurmountable.Still loving the phone, and very glad that I chose this model.SPECIAL NOTE: For those wondering where the heck the L900G hid the speakerphone - it is the \"OK\" button.Push the button while in a conversation to turn it on, push again to turn it off.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Net 10 LG900", "Author": "PSU Mountain Man", "ReviewID": "R3RH6BSRAK6O28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owned the phone since x-mas and have no problems.

My last ATT&T; phone was the LG Shine and it worked well during the entire length of the 2-year contract, so I trusted the LG brand.  Mine is a Net10 phone and it was easy to register and set up.  I'm not a power user, but with this phone I can do EVERYTHING I want to do...check email, check stock prices, surf the web, etc.  It is fast on the web (at least in my area) and the reception is so good too.  When I bought mine I paid $90 for the phone and a $50 unlimited monthly card so the phone was only $40...quite a buy for a phone with all these features (including music player and FM radio too!)The only initial gripe was that the supplied browser is pretty worthless...it runs out of memory and aborts on just about every web page that has any graphics on it.  I fixed this by downloading the Opera Mini broswer and that fixed everything.  Opera provides a really good browsing experience on this kind of phone.The phone isn't a pedigreed smartphone but doesn't have the battery issues that smartphones have either.  Like my Shine, I charge this one up and I'm good to go for at least three days, even when doing considerable web surfing.

The only problems with this phone that I have encountered are that the browser that comes with it isn't very eye catching and is a bit slow, but if you install the opera mini application it is worlds better in swiftness and looks appeal; the other problem is that it doesn't do youtube videos because of an incompatibility with the phone and youtube for some reason.

Yes, the keyboard is a bit cramped, but it's perfectly serviceable for texting and simple emailing. And yes, the internet access, such as it is, will be slow and frustrating compared to your friends with their slick 3G or 4G service.

I was hoping to retire my workhorse MP3 player with this one. If all you want to do with this phone is play a longish podcast--say, if all you want to do is listen to Car Talk on your way to work--no problem.But if you want to play an actual album, no dice. There is no way to play a set list of songs, one after another, without actually selecting the next tune in some way (either by clicking the right-arrow before one song completely ends to go to the next one, or by laboriously opening the menu and selecting the next song.)

No drop calls, good reception here in my area. I can basically do everything I want, log on to fb, check my email, the weather forecast, most importantly takes great photos and unlimited video minutes as long as you have a big gb in your memory stick.The good thing I've noticed is, it doesn't really cheats on me on the number of minutes I have left in my account unlike when I used  ATT prepaid. For example, if tonight I go to bed with a  700 minutes left on my phone, The next morning, I'd still have  that same minutes unlike in ATT which happened to me a lot, I go to bed with a $3 still on my account, the next time I try used it, they're all gone. I have no clue where it went. With Net10, you could always check it with their minutes counter displayed on your phone.The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is, it won't let you play youtube videos or send any international text messages or make international calls.UPDATE: MARCH  14, 2012I am still using my LG900.

It saves me money plus I can stay on the phone and chat with my family and friends without asking them to hurry up as I am losing minutes on my prepaid.

Prior Misleading Review:  So Let's Set The Record FACTUALLY Straight!", "Author": "B.Thib", "ReviewID": "R1TU1K3KA1D4QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You just should know that the other reviewer saying \"let's set the record straight\" and that this isn't a smartphone was TOTALLY MISLEADING and just plain uninformed. This phone definitely IS a smartphone and, a Smartphone does not have to be an \"Iphone or other Android devices\".  Honestly- was that review serious??  That other reviewer said some things that were just completely false.  Whether this is just a cellphone or a smartphone aren't just semantics either.When you buy simply a cellphone you expect just that. When you desire to buy a smartphone you should expect to see the other/additional features that the below  definitions entail.  And, according to PCMagazine's Encyclopedia and Merriam-Webster's this is certainly a smartphone which has what's described.  Now, allow ME to set the record actually/factually straight:  According to PCMagazine's Encyclopedia (which, by the way, contains over 20,00 IT Terms):  A smartphone \"is a cellular telephone with built-in applications and Internet access. Smartphones provide digital voice service as well as text messaging, e-mail, Web browsing, still and video cameras, MP3 player, video viewing and often video calling. In addition to their built-in functions, smartphones can run myriad applications, turning the once single-minded cellphone into a mobile computer.\"Also, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary:  A smartphone is \"a cell phone that includes additional software functions (as e-mail or an Internet browser)\".The above are facts. Not just some opinion or someones' unproven restated opinion. And, it should be noted, above, that PCMagazine's Encyclopedia says that smartphones CAN RUN myriad applications IN ADDITION to the smartphone's already built-in functions...meaning that a smartphone is not, mandatorily, necessitated to be a several hundred dollar application-laden Iphone (that's just common sense).  Now whether this is an entry level, high end or low level smartphone is irrelevant- after all, it's very inexpensive and prepaid: And, smartphones can run a price gamut of only $28.00 to an outrageous $500.00! So, what level of Smartphone is this?? Well, that answer is obvious.  While a lot of the more expensive smartphones do have an OS (Operating System):  In lieu of an OS, this device runs/maintains Internet functionality via Java Apps (programs built into the browser which interprets the instructions for web browsing, etc.). And, this Smartphone is relatively, extremely inexpensive in comparison to other ones- so, the manufacturer's choice for you to use Java in lieu of an actual OS to access the Internet/web browsing functionality is understandable.  And, yes- I have purchased this phone (I really bought it as a back-up phone but, but find myself using it as much as my regular one!):  The functionality- including web browsing and Internet use is pretty good. But, I did take off 1star because I thought that the keyboard letters could've been a bit bigger. So, the keyboard did take a bit for me to get used to.  Anyway, again:  Yes this is, indeed, a smartphone. Ok, emphatically said- THIS IS, ACTUALLY/FACTUALLY a smartphone.  Now, some people are of the opinion that a phone absolutely cannot be a smartphone unless it's in the range of an iPhone or some high end or even low end Android driven devices?? But, that's their OPINION.  That's like saying that my $225.00 Dell D610 laptop pc is not a pc because it's not a $2000.00 Acer laptop or similarly priced Desktop!  Now, if you want an extremely/outrageously overpriced smartphone that can do almost everything except drive your car and babysit your kids, then:  Well, it's your money- so that's a nobrainer.But, in that case- then WHY would you even be on this page looking at this smartphone??That's a nobrainer as well.So, as you can see- what that other reviewer stated is, unequivocally, untrue.My mother always said that if I couldn't tell the truth then zip my lips shut.  So, in the other reviewers case he or she should keep his hands off the keyboard.  I hate to seem anal, but, as a potential customer- It's just annoyingly disconcerting and frustrating to read reviews from someone who insists upon redressing their opinion in factual garb when it is just misleading or an outright lie.

Second, if you love the internet like I do, go to opera mini on the sucky browser on this phone and download that app, you will be 100% more happier.You can keep up with your twitter, facebook, shop on ebay or amazon...etc. If you want to download music to your phone without your laptop, tablet or computer, I advise you get either the $25 or the $50 a month plan. The reason I bring that up is it takes sometime to download the songs, like 5 to 10 mins a song. Not the end of the world, but not the best either. Im still learning things about this phone, im a tech geek. I just figured out how to download without my laptop about a week ago, so thats saying something about this amazing toy of mine. The website to download from is itemvn.com . You will have to use the sucky browser to download from since the opera does not support. Like any phone it has glitches. The phone does not stream, so thats not going to happen, let it go. You spent $40 or less on the phone, its not going to give you the world. lol.Its blue tooth capable, which works wonderful for us safe drivers.

Oh no!  I purchased THREE of these devils and each one of them are almost unintelligible to the person to whom you are speaking.At first, I thought my wife just didn't know how to speak into the telephone properly and that was causing the distortion and horrible audio on the other end.I then switched and I spoke in the phone with her listening.  She missed about 50% of the conversation when I spoke because the microphone built into this phone is so awful.Thinking that maybe I just purchased one phone with a bad mic, I then purchased a second, and finally a THIRD telephone.  EVERY ONE OF THEM produced unintelligible audio when speaking into the telephone microphone.I have come to the conclusion that this telephone is virtually useless for voice communication.  It's pretty decent for texting (though the keyboard could be bigger).This phone was replaced by a Samsung and the audio produced by the Samsung is sharp and clear.  That proves it has nothing to do with the Net10 network, but the perpetrator of the terrible audio is the telephone itself.Too bad the audio makes this telephone worthless because otherwise it's a decent phone.  If you never use your telephone to speak, then this phone may work for you.However, if you expect to use this phone for voice commication, then run hard and fast AWAY from this phone!!!", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, loaded with features!", "Author": "Hao Zhang", "ReviewID": "REQ0LQDBQN3V2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually don't use this phone anymore, but I still have it. So I'll just review it based on my previous experience with it. I got this from WalMart.com for ~$30, it was a bonus pack including a 4GB microSD card, a pair of hands-free earphones, and a car charger. It worked very well for the time I've had it.Let's take a tour of the physical form of this phone. The screen is bright and clear, the images look pretty sharp and crisp. The keyboard is full QWERTY, with a few shortcut keys around it. The left side of the phone has the volume controls and the microSD card slot. The right side of the phone has only the camera button (you have to hold it for about 2 seconds to access the camera). The top of the phone has the micro USB port for charging the phone and transferring files, and a 3.5\" headphone jack. The back of the phone has the 2 megapixel camera and a little self-portrait mirror, and the hole for the speaker.Upon starting the phone, you will see the home screen. You can actually customize the home screen with a few built-in widgets (not many) by going to Settings >> Screen >> Screen Theme. For those wondering what the button under the left soft key does (the one with the two overlapping squares under the Send button), it is actually a multitasking key; it's useful when you're listening to the music and browsing the web or texting at the same time. The keyboard is quite easy to use, the keys bulge out a little bit so you can differentiate between the keys. The phone has most features you would expect from a feature phone, such as messaging, contacts, recent calls, organizer, tools (alarms, calculator, stopwatch, unit converter, world time, etc.), and even a web browser. The phone is also Bluetooth enabled, so you can use headsets and transfer files and contacts from a computer or other phones.The phone is Java apps/games capable, so you can head over to websites such as GetJar and MobileRated for some Java apps and games. Not all of them are compatible with this phone, so make sure you test them. You can also buy games from TracFone/NET10's mobile website by using the built-in browser on this phone. That reminds me, you might want to use Opera Mini (a Java-based browser) and not the built-in browser, because for some reason, the browser almost always \"run out of memory\" when browsing even basic websites. If you want to install apps/games without burning your airtime, copy the .jar files to the phone/microSD card, go to My Folder >> Other Files, and select the file; you will then be asked to install the Java program.The camera is quite decent. It takes 2 megapixel images and records QCIF (176 x 144) videos. You can adjust the brightness, white balance, color effect, timer, quality, and other attributes. You can also take photos with burst shot mode, just in case you have a shaky hand and need some help getting the right one. You can also zoom in for photo taking, but you need to set the resolution of the image to VGA (640 x 480) or lower, or else you will be presented with the \"zoom not supported\" error.You can set your own MP3 files for ringtone, message tone, and start up/shut down tones. Another point of interest is its ability to play SOME flash files (.swf), just make sure they can start playing without the need of interaction from the user, because you CANNOT click on things. One other thing, the phone will default to saving things to the tiny internal memory (less than 50MB), so if you plan on using a microSD card with it (up to 4GB supported I believe), make sure you change the default saving location by going into Settings >> Memory Info. >> Primary Storage Setting and set it to \"External Memory\".Now onto the miscellaneous stuff. The battery has a capacity of 900mAh, which could power this phone for at least 3 days if used moderately. The phone runs off of AT&T; towers. It is a GSM phone, and CANNOT be used with any other carriers because TracFone/NET10 writes their own firmware onto the phone. The data speed you get on the phone is tower-dependent, and the max is around 240 kilobits per second (Kbps), or 30 kilobytes per second (KBps) since the phone's highest cellular technology is EDGE. If you use your phone quite a lot, go with the NET10 version; if you just want to use this phone as a spare/backup phone or you just never use your cellphone, go with the TracFone version.For the time I've had this phone, I was quite satisfied. Although it's no high-tech smartphone, it gets the job done at a decent price. I was using the phone with NET10's $25 a month plan with 750 minutes for data, calls, and text. If you need a basic feature phone with a physical keyboard, this is the phone to go.

I like the idea of easy access to the sd memory card, It's located right on the side of the phone, you dont have to take out the battery to get to it. Currently, I have a 4gb micro sd card in it.  It's bluetooth works very well with my Car's bluetooth. As far as Texting goes, I have found this to be very easy to text with, even using one hand. I also like the way you can purchase minutes for this, either online or buying a card at a local store that carries them. They also have a $15 a month plan too, the minutes carry over, if you talk alot, this one may be for you.  I have done the minutes several different ways. Using the monthly plan is a very good idea, but I do not like having a monthly pay out commitment on a phone. I choose refilling the minutes online. I have not been dissappointed in this phone.

The camera is excellent, the build quality of the phone is great.  But, there are too many quirks with this phone for me to suggest it to others.  One being, adding an external memory card: I added one and my laptop will not recognize the phone unless the memory card is unplugged.  Otherwise, the computer (Windows XP pro) will not see the phone.  Also, I've found that while the unit's battery lasts a long time, signal strength is not enough to allow calls unless the phone is right on top of a cell tower, at least where I live. The camera quality is amazing for a 2 mpixel, I must say.  But there are serious design problems and reception problems that make this phone a 'no buy' in my opinion.  One example is taking pictures.  After you press the camera button on the side of the unit, and then press to take a picture, you can (in error) press the OK button (center large button) to take another picture and will get the auditory feedback as if it's taken a picture---but when you check later, the camera did not take a picture.  You have to press the 'back' button to re arm the camera to take another picture.  That this phone would even allow you to 'think' you took a picture when it actually was not taken is stupid design.

I realize I may have just gotten a bad phone and that this model itself might not be bad, but I can't give it a positive review with all of the problems I've had.I switched from an LG flip phone to this phone because I wanted more functionality. I wish I would have stuck with the cheaper model. The main difference is that I lose service quite a bit with this model. With the basic flip model, I got service pretty much everywhere I went. Now I lose service in places where multiple other people have Net 10 and get five full bars of service (e.g. my parents' house -- my mom and brother both have Net 10 and they have no problems -- I can't even get service in the two miles surrounding the house).This phone also freezes frequently. Right from the first week I had it, I've had to pull the battery out of it several times because it freezes up to the point where I can't even turn it off. The phone is very sluggish and slow to move from one function to another. Sometimes it takes quite a while just to open up a text message (with an empty inbox, so it's not an issue of having too many saved messages).Another major issue is that the battery drains very quickly, but the phone does not give you much of a warning. With my old LG phone, the phone would beep for hours once the battery started to get low. This phone will say that it is fully charged and then all of a sudden shut off because the battery died. Or, it will say it has a full battery, quickly drop to one battery bar, beep a few times, and then turn off.I'm going to see if I can get a new flip phone from Net 10, as I am not happy with this model.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price!!", "Author": "K.

That's compared to a Cricket phone that at first only did about 80%, but was a joy to use.  (That's changed... gotten worse, not better.)  With this one I can install the Opera Mini web browser and read my work e-mail--but have to put up with messages about minutes used and that the application is untrusted. I can use almost any sound for a ringtone or message tone, but the one I use for messages doesn't sound as good as on my PC or the Cricket phone. I can connect a bluetooth headset, but no voice commands. And no GPS, but fine with that as it wasn't very reliable with my Cricket phone and they wanted to charge for using it. No e-mail app, but between webmail use and downloadable apps, I think that's covered.Unlike every other phone I have used that can connect to a PC, this one shows both the built-in storage and the micro SD card.  And unlike most other low-end messaging phones this doesn't have the SD card slot under the battery--though I'd have preferred both the little doors to be absent.  The micro USB port doesn't really need one, and the card slot could have been under the battery cover, just not under the battery.  That way there wouldn't be as many pieces to worry about breaking off.Voice is good, but I found that some voices that have always been properly audible on other phones come through as too soft or unpleasantly loud.  And I find a problem with moderately long texts gatewayed from e-mail:  if they are sent to AT&T;'s MMS address they are not received but no nondelivery is sent, but if sent to the SMS address they are truncated.Basically, I really like this phone, but am looking for something better.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great qwerty keyboard, more than expected.", "Author": "Christien", "ReviewID": "R2K8X0FW6QH4O4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a couple of weeks and am sooooo pleased I got this one searching for a phone without a contract.

About what you'd expect, given the specs.Camera is decent.  Again, about what you'd expect given the specs.Keyboard is for woman hands or small man hands.  I am female and love the keyboard.  I prefer to send text messages over calling folks most of the time, as it saves money and also saves me from having to make bullsh!t small talk.  The keyboard beats the hell out of having to navigate a 0-9 number pad for the same purpose.  It is so easy to type texts now, I have sent a ton of them since buying this phone.Reception is as decent as I have had with any other phone.Web browsing is time consuming, and since I just do the cheap 300 minute Net10 cards as needed, I haven't done much web browsing on the phone.  I can say that as long as you are in an area with decent reception, you can actually manage to do google searches and check your web-based email on the thing.I can talk and be heard well by the person I am on the phone with.  I can hear them well also.I don't give 5 stars for two reasons:  First, you can't use the FM radio without earphones (or possibly some sort of compatible speaker plugged into the jack).  Second, I installed a hard protective cover on the phone, and now I am having trouble finding a belt pouch that the phone will fit into with the protective cover on it.  It's a pain to put my phone in my bag, then find that one of the buttons (sometimes the 'browser' button) has been pushed because something in the bag pressed against it.Something else I didn't care for is the phone is not sold with a usb cord.

After 1.5 hours on my home phone with Net10 customer service (you get numerous countries other than the USA), and repeating my contact information 3 times, they agreed to send me a new LG900 cell phone due to the old phone being under warranty and the determination that it was defective from a red dot indicated near the battery.

I get get the replacement in several days and after trying numerous times to unsuccessfully activate it on line (which I've done easily previously), I called customer service (one of multiple times).  They said over and over, your phone is activated with the same number (confirmed several times).  then I was told to turn off the phone, wait an hour and turn back on.  Finally, after 6 days of this and a new telephone number, I demanded a supervisor.  The supervisor said that my original number was deactivated because it wasn't reactivated within 48 hours, I can no longer get the #back.  I asked why was it deactivated and no one mentioned that?  The supervisor apologized and said that's the policy.I traveled around the world speaking to customer service reps in Israel, Ivory Coast, Philippines and Latin America.

The navigation button is very easily pushed by accident and gets you to the internet (browser) where your air time is being eaten. In order for that not to happen, you HAVE to lock it which takes two buttons to do and two presses to undo. By the time you need it or try to answer a call, seconds have passed and you've lost time. But they make it easy for an accident to eat up your minutes and that's happened every single time I buy a card. Only the last two times, it did it so that I had many more service days than minutes PLUS it ran out of airtime at a very inconvenient time - luckily, right AFTER my car died and I needed to call a friend and have them come jump the battery. If it had run out a minute sooner, I'd have been stuck on the side of the road. I attribute it to God that the second scenario didn't happen. And it ran out because the button had gotten pushed by accident in my purse and internet (that I wasn't really using and never do) ate up all my minutes. IT almost wasn't there for me in an emergency. What if I had broken down in a crime-ridden neighborhood instead of somewhat close to my own home and friends??? Anyway, I got this phone for emergencies and only wanted to pay $15 a month. The last two months though it has run out of airtime way before the days of service BECAUSE of its poor design and the internet getting accidentally knocked on. Poor design, folks. So I called and told them I wanted some air minutes refunded or I'd pitch the phone and get an iPhone, because if I'm going to spend $60 on a phone every month, I sure as heck am not going to use this phone (you can barely see the letters and you have to press two buttons to get many of the functions you use every single sentence of texting). I'm going to get a phone that offers a LOT more!!! So first I get Felicia who stonewalls me with that \"I can't refund you any airtime.\" Finally, with my persistence that she should, she sends me on to her \"support team\" which just gave me a snappier-voiced support person named Shamika. She had a very rude edge (I guess she's paid the big bucks to stonewall me even more) in her voice but finally relented and said she'd give me 20 minutes more airtime. She said I was welcome to pitch the phone in the trash. And of course, she said I could lock the phone so it doesn't get accidentally pushed, but she would not acknowledge my suggestion that the internet should take two presses of buttons, not the lock, which is a SEVERE inconvenience. Also she would not acknowledge that most users would not use this crappy of a phone for the internet. It sucks up minutes! Why would anyone do that? They'd buy an iPhone if they wanted to use it for internet, or at least a Smart Phone or droid phone. Plus battery time sucks on these phones. Nothing recommends this phone except that you pay as you go and you can spend only $15 a month if you use it just for calls and texts. But if it doesn't work that way because they found a way to \"accidentally\" suck up your air time, what's the point of having one? Perhaps they just make a lot of money off idiots like me who buy and don't read reviews first. I am now WARNING YOU as I wish I'd been warned, don't buy this phone. Invest your money in a better phone. Go where you can be helped by a PERSON (a store, like Cricket maybe? or a Verizon booth or ATT booth at the mall) and ASK: how do you get to the internet. If it is really easy to accidentally get your phone to a browser, THINK TWICE. It's a way of sucking up your money \"by accident\" - and \"accident\" they can throw back on you so they don't have to refund any of your money or airtime. Look for one that takes a little work to get to the internet. Because even if you DO use the internet, like I don't, you don't want your airtime being sucked up by its accidental access. You want it there WHEN YOU NEED IT, and it almost wasn't there for me yesterday when my phone died. Luckily the first person I called answered and came to help me. Otherwise, I could blame Net 10 for a really bad day and being stuck without help, which is WHY I bought the phone in the first place. With 20 minutes refunded airtime (not very generous) I have enough airtime to call all my friends and tell them: I'm done with this phone. Done with this company.

I feel like I am speaking to high-school drop-outs who weren't able to get a job and hence are working as \"managers\" at Net 10.If you doubt this, do some internet searching for Net 10 customer service.  If you think you are getting a bargain for a cheap phone or phone plan, it's because you are purchasing something that has zero future value.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "S***TY PHONE", "Author": "Hannah T. \"J.H.T.

The third day I had this phone it went haywire and even when NOT connected it kept taking minutes. So I called on my house phone and for over an hour I put in a few hundred numbers to reset phone and we got it corrected, after we were done my minutes were set back to 750 mins. and was assured that I had 30 days from that point and time....I was happy. So 3 days before my 30 days were up I go to bed with it telling me I have 3 days and 160 mins. When I wake up they had taken my 160 mins. and reset my start time....hence the over hour on hold using their phone and trying to get corrected and change my payment method (I got neither corrected) For net-10 I am posting their service report #'s 1) KMM16269304V49204L0KM 2) KMM16269605V50785L0KM 3) KMM16269955V52375L0KM 4) KMM16270319V54823L0KM .
