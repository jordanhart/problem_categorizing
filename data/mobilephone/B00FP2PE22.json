{"Reviews": [{"Title": "2nd Nokia 620 for spouse - Nice things come in small packages", "Author": "Long Time Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16WJQ1SY7F6E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second Nokia 620 I bought - this one 10 months after I purchased my own - I purchased this for my spouse - she really liked mine.  It is a Windows 8 phone - which is a huge advantage because its interface is SO SUPERIOR to android and apple - which I refer to as icon \"throw-up\" - many, many unforgotten icons lettered so small as to be unusable - except perhaps by those possessing eagle eyes.  After dumping an android droid for this phone - very, very happy.  If you need all of the exotic apps that apple and android offer - then this phone would not likely please you as Microsoft app selection remains far behind the others - but for most normal users there are plenty of apps and the number increases steadily.  Highly recommend - small and powerful - using both with Straight Talk ---- $49.70 total per month (each) with taxes.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A truely amazing phone + OS -- all combined with a great price", "Author": "Malhar Shah", "ReviewID": "R22ZF0XAEUDTLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WARNING : This phone/Windows OS is so good that it'll make you forget the Apple/Android. I bought this as a gift for a family member and she's hooked to it. Because Facebook/IM/photos are \"live\", she actually looks forward to clicking and using those apps every time she turns the screen ON. Unlike Android / iPhone where you have to click each app, this phone makes everything come alive -- and not just social-network-stuff, but also simple things as \"To Do\" list, or Weather-app or News app -- it's all right there on the home page. No need for additional clicking/tapping.As far as the hardware is concerned, this phone is not having a super-large screen -- which in my scenario was a plus. It's an excellent smart-phone for the price. You can't go wrong with less than $150 (including shipping) for a smart-phone with 3.8\" display, front-camera, rear camera (5 megapixel), Wi-Fi, 8 GB memory, SD card slot.Originally I thought the white-plastic case would make the phone less durable, but so far it doesn't seem the case. Phone is solid.Nokia has done a great job in build quality as well as keeping the software updated. There are tons of Nokia apps available. I also was able to download the latest WP8 updates.Cons:* It's not a 4G phone (then again the owner doesn't really need/care for 3G/4G). I also didn't expect 4G/LTE etc for the price* Screen is not retina display quality - found in latest Windows/Galaxy/iOS devices", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Fernando D.", "ReviewID": "R2G4624VP2EH6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone made by nokia. he shipping was fast, I love this phone, I also have a nokia lumia 920 and both work perfectly", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "a1cowggirll", "ReviewID": "R1DNSOJ87HW08I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "runs fast, windows 8 platform, works with xbox music and games/apps, requires a micro sim card, and you can use this phone on the BYOP plan through Straight Talk wireless.  So far I am happy with the phone.  The camera takes good pictures, not great pictures.  Daytime pictures are better than low light or night pictures.  It has a lot of features, but does not work with google play or many popular apps, limited on what I am able to do in certain areas, but I am sure that will change as windows expands is apps.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia has made another great", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3VS6HURYZ646P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used Nokia phones before.

It wokr fine with Straight Talk's AT&T; micro sim and the data and SMS work fine with the info provided on Straight Talks website.So, don't hesitate if you're using Straight Talk, just buy it!!!
