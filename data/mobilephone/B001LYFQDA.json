First you could tell it had been painted and the LCD cover was re-glued on with grade school glue. The track ball did not even work and was defective as in the ball seem to be very small in the housing, and it also had nicks in the housing. The back battery cover was painted by air brush or some other method because you could see the color had a dripping look like the paint had ran during this process. Just the quality of the plastic from the molding stage you could tell it was not OEM. Very low quality over all. The seller did attempt to resolve the matter but was more worried about shipping and his product than customer service or satisfaction. The only resolution made was them replacing the front housing which the replacement was defective also. I purchased another one from another seller.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "wrong one.....", "Author": "S. W.

Hahn \"Gadget\"", "ReviewID": "RZBMVNL59EH6R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I usually don't leave reviews for products but I think this one does require some information.First of all I should have known something was up when I noticed that titanium was spelled wrong in the description ,hey everybody has a bad day at the keyboard every now and then, but that wasn't the only issue. While the product does work and does fit my phone it took a long time to get and when I opened the package and started looking over the product a few things made me wonder. Some of the case parts are quite obviously used you can see where screws had previously been tightened down onto the plastic and the small clip case part that goes on the bottom of the phone actually had T Mobile printed on it. It would almost seem that this company is recycling parts and while I'm all for recycling I also think that that should be noted in the description and I don't think it was mentioned anywhere in fact I'm pretty sure it says the product is supposed to be all new. But in spite of all this the product does fit and does work so in the end I suppose thats all that really matters just be aware that you will in all probability get some used parts in this kit and if thats ok by you then go for it.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Will make your phone look like new, but not perfect", "Author": "Joel F.
