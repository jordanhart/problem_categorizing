The battery would not stay charged, and I was constantly having to leave the phone to recharge.  The final \"straw\" was when the phone went completely black, and unusable.  This was just like taking Eighty plus dollars and throwing it into the wind.  I will never purchase anything \"refurbished\" again, and I frankly think I deserve a full refund from Amazon.com.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003U4PQE8"}}
