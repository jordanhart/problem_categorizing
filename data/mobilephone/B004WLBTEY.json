My company sends about 40 of us out travelling the back roads of northern Wisconsin every day and spent about 6 months testing phones and programs.  This phone through Verizon was the winner. I have used 5 other phones and this is by far the best for reception in weak signal areas and battery life(maybe part of the weight someone complaines about).  I've dropped it from waist height onto asphalt without any effect- not even a scratch.  the big buttons and large numbers on the display decrease the tension level for calls in a hurry.

I read the description of it and it said it may have a few scratches. When I received the phone, it was like brand new. The Convoy u640 is a great phone to start with. It's not a fancy phone to text with - although, you can certainly do that. The camera is nice and takes real good pictures. Most of all, it is rugged and you can make and receive calls on it where most phones don't have signal. So, if you tend to be a little rough on cell phones, you may want to check this one out esp. if u find a deal like I did for $40-  Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged! Also worthy to mention, they are very easy on batteries. I know several people who have them and they say the same things - so, it's not just mine that gives u plenty of talk time per battery charge.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "read reviews", "Author": "4mykids", "ReviewID": "R3H6YMMI5CJ7EN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read lots of reviews for this phone.

We'll hang on to it as long as it holds up.Honestly, the kids use it mostly to take pictures and videos of our pets, and enjoy altering them with the phone's features. My biggest complaint/annoyance is that you cannot move pictures and videos to a PC without having a memory card - I can't move the pics directly from internal memory to my PC. This is a big deal to me as I just want to get them off the phone and go through them later. If anyone can advise on a way to do this, I'd be grateful.

The first spent three years with me and  was used, abused and dropped to the pavement more times than I can remember. It is not water proof. I left it outside one nite and after that, it went south. It ate the battery, got very hot and generally gave me the finger. However, it had been so good to me that I bought another used one on Amazon for a bargain price.So, this is a basic phone with some internet capabilities that I don't give a rip about. It endures drops to the pavement, has great clarity via Verizon and quite simply, works. If you don't need or don't care about watching videos or scrolling through whatever it is you scroll through to make your day (actually, make your moment), and if you need a basic phone that's rugged and not really waterproof, but water resistant, this is an inexpensive choice. Bottom line, if I lose this one, I'll find another \"old\" Convoy to replace it. Hell, I drive an eight year-old Subaru. I need rugged and practical, so why should I get a \"smart\" phone?

It was much larger than my previous work phone, and didn't even fit in my pocket with the snap-on cover in place.

One client received no less than 10 \"In a meeting\" messages over the course of one weekend. I finally deleted all the quicktext content from my phone, but often when I pull it out it says \"no quicktext available\", so I can see that it keeps trying. More recently it has started answering automatically and putting the caller on speakerphone--still in my pocket.Even worse I've started having trouble with the battery charging properly. The phone would be plugged in overnight, and when I'd come downstairs in the morning the screen would be totally black, the phone unresponsive and the battery nearly dead once it did wake up again.

For a basic phone this product is very solid.  First of all it's built very well, and because of that is very durable.  I have dropped my phone many times and I have never seen any effects from it.  I have had basic phones before and whenever I would drop them the battery would fall out; that's not the case with this phone.  There is what looks like a screw head that you turn counter clockwise to open the battery door which is a nice feature, and is thus why the battery will not come out when dropped.  The edges are also lined with a rubber-like material which definitely helps pad any fall.Overall, the phone looks very nice.  As for the internal workings of the phone things are pretty good.  The call quality is good, the texting is ok, and the music player is great.  The outside play/forward/reverse buttons are also a nice feature regarding the music player.  There are also many nice shortcut features on this phone which makes using it very convenient.  The criticisms I have of this phone are the texting and the lack of a head phone jack.  The t9 works alright, but sometimes it seems to predict ridiculous words and it doesn't seem to really \"remember\" past words you have used.  I've had headphone jacks in some of my past phones and it's so handy to just bring your headphones with wherever you go and be able to listen to music, so that would be nice to have.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone is a TANK!", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R2F0OSHFDWEKJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had that many phones so I can't do an in depth comparison but if you're looking for a tough as nails phone that can take just about anything you throw at it then this is it.The first time this phone proved itself was when I lost it outside just before winter hit, it spent 2 months in the mud under a few feet of snow and when it finally melted I found it and it worked good as new.I'm terrible with losing stuff so I lost this phone outside AGAIN on a cemetery lawn. I thought I was doomed because they water the lawns everyday and thought no way would this thing survive getting drenched over and over but once again I was proved wrong when 4 days later they found my phone and returned it to me - albeit with lots of dirt on it, but I plugged it in and viola!

Honestly, I've had some pretty bad phones but this is by far the worst.  Originally I was interested in this model because of its larger buttons, wide display and limited features (I like having a phone, not a toy).  There are so many problems with this thing though I can't justify giving it a second star.The biggest problem I have with this phone is its lag time, even knowing which menu you want to bring up this phone forces you to wait or will inevitably bring up a different menu if you hit a key too quickly- quick texters will also have this problem frequently.The phone is billed as rugged... I'm not sure what they mean by that, if rugged now means \"unnecessarily heavy\" they hit the nail on the head; I suppose they could also mean with its weight it could be used as a low grade projectile weapon but other than that though I see nothing rugged about it.  The biggest problem with weight is that its obviously heavy enough to get damaged if dropped from a normal height- I've never been a person who regularly dropped phones or abused them by sending them through the wash... just the same, I fear this would be destroyed in no time.Lastly there is something wrong with the electronics in the Convoy.  The battery reader is the least accurate I've seen in any phone- swapping batteries doesn't fix this. I've also been having problems with the thing charging recently- sending the message that the phone is not charged after being plugged in for hours, it proceeds to turn itself off and refuses to be turned on... I'd imagine a battery issue on this too IF plugging the phone into the wall (again), turning it on and unplugging it didn't fix the problem and reveal full power. The signal is weaker than the last two phones I've had (read that as \"phones which were technologically backwater 6 years ago\"), I drop calls in the middle of town, regularly.This is a terrible phone, do not waste your money on it.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Maybe I got a faulty one?", "Author": "Artemis", "ReviewID": "RWQIO9R101ZPO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks, (although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking). If you get a properly working phone, it seems pretty solid. The camera has bad resolution, so if you are set on a good camera, this is not for you. Overall it has good audio and is solidly built; not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not. Last night it started acting crazy. When the phone is shut, it keeps activating the \"Voice Command\" function, and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt. Then if there is noise, it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing. I also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode, therefore it is wasting my battery power. I looked into various Settings menus, but it seems there is no way to shut this function off. Secondly, it has recently started pulling up a \"No Caller ID # Available!\" Alert Message in front of every text message I get, even though I can see the person's name attached message before I try to open it. Furthermore, when I try to hit \"Ok\" to acknowledge the alert, it pops right back up, over and over again, so I can't read my texts. It does this even for old texts. I tried turning it off and taking the battery out, I even tried a factory reset function, and I'm still having the same problems. I also noticed that after I reset it, when it was going through the set up, that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all, even when they said they were, I could hear nothing! And I can't hear a dial tone when I call people. Screwed up! Hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone.
