If you are looking for the best bang for you buck on an Android OS, 3G Smartphone, this is it. Although I can't say Motorola is the best hardware available in smartphones they do have value when you consider the screen size/CPU/and other stats on the phone it is the best stats you can get in the under $300 price range. I did a LOT of research before deciding on this phone. My provider is pagepluswireless which is a prepaid cell phone company and they only have a 3G capable network so I needed a phone that was 3G and not 4G. I found this to be the best price/spec/screen size phone for what I wanted. Only real drawback is the stock battery is really bad, goes dead in about 30 minutes of the screen being lit. I bought an extended battery and new battery cover for it for about $17 on Amazon here and that has worked great. Battery life is now excellent. If you are into doing custom ROM's and rooting your phone then this phone is awesome for that as well, there is a lot of aftermarket and custom support for the X2, get it while you can! :P", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "DX2 Much better than original Droid A855", "Author": "AntennaMan", "ReviewID": "RUM7R8GFT8IJU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "DX2 Much better than original Droid A855Rev: 11-29-2012aThe good:-- This phone/pda is much better that the original Droid (A855) that I had for two months, that older phone sux.-- The Droid X2 (DX2) is much faster, seems more refined, less buggy.  The screen is just big enough.-- Hidden treasure: FM broadcast receiver works very-very good. Uses your provided headphones (requires them to work, its the antenna), to receive FM.  This is the best FM receiver I own?  The Bandwith seems to very as signal quality varies, the result is there is much less static. And has very good fidelity.  The GUI need more attention, like push button access to the favorites, signal strength meter (RSSI) and such. Radio work wonderfully...Over all I'm more happy with this Droid X2. It would get 4-stars, if not for all the minor problems (all bad software, related, see below)...The bad:-- I had to clear all cash, 3 times, and reset to original factory setting once (erase everything and start over (this held a lot))...-- Music player skips, at least once per song, some program is interrupting or some thing??? *1-- Phone crashers for no apparent reason. Seems to be excessive CPU usage problem. Just after closing Google maps or other programs.  90% of the time this is only solved by removing the battery, nothing else fixes this problem.-- Clock is completely cell network based. If the battery is removed, the clock cant be set without turning on the cell radio, even if you have WiFi with a clock sync program running (i use airplane mode, at home, so the battery dont die overnight, as I have no cell service where I live).-- I dont like Google, any more.  It seems, I have troubles with them constantly (cant sync phone book as stated on their web site. maps crashing, Goggle application crashing (most of this was on the A855). And no one to report this too and get help (no customer support)).-- After I got the dock, \"Motorola\" tries to force an additional computer (drivers) update (other than the standard USB ones), if you download it, each time you connect to the computer, three folders open.  One is the Motorola drivers folder and this seems to make a browser window open and it connect to the internet, to a Verizon wirelesses backup service, a video self starts, advertising a service I dont want or need. Apparently I have to Root the phone, to remove this nag-ware from the phone, in order to make it stop. Work around (sorta): And and remove programs, and remove the offending Motorola folder. The third folder still opens, after docking, but no internet sales video starts.-- The info area at the top of the phone is supper tiny and there seems to be no setting to make it bigger.-- The signal strength bars, has just 4 bars, instead of the standard 5, and is hard to see.  Having no signal, is common where I live, and the no signal looks, like full bars.-- The info area messages comes and goes, faster than I can read (same area).-- GPS wont actually turn on, when selected (using maps), if the cellular service is turned off.  The symbol shows up, but not worke.  The work around is: Turn on cellular, then GPS, then turn cell back off, to make GPS work.  Even still some times the GPS just wont work.  THen it takes a power off-on reset. Sometimes this dose not work and you need to do the remove the battery reset, and reinstall the battery, to restart the GPS...-- Screen timeout dose not apparently apply to wake up screen and sometimes the screen goes to sleep, as I'm trying to inter the password or shut the phone off, or set it into to airplane mode.-- There is a lot of data consuming bloat-ware on the phone and rooting is the only solution is to remove. This stuff also kills memory and slows the phone as sum of it, starts and runs despite that I'm not using it. There is way too much trash, supplied by Verizon, on this phone.-- Android/ Google. I'm not liking the disclaimers, that accompanies 98% of all the applications. One example: Why dose a mapping program, need to take pictures or record sound, or can even make phone calls, without user intervention???  This is in may of the disclaimers, when you download software to the phone from the Google Play Store - Why???-- Weird battery removal process, and poorly described. A piece of plastic (red) label is used to pry up the battery. It exceptionally unprofessional - a cheap solution. I expect it will fail (tare), making imposable to remove the battery, over time. I use my phone enough, I use several batteries, and even one a separate aftermarket charger, to charge batteries out of the phone. I own 4 batteries, one of the original 1500mAh battery, the other 3 are aftermarket BH5X that is 1900mAh, I got from ebay. All are the standard thin, non-fat (dose not take a different battery door), battery.Inclusion:As you can see, I have many somewhat minor issues with the phone. I hate Apple, so what other choices are there. None.  It's much like Voting, its the choice of the least-bad solution, I guess...Cell provider:Page plus, $55 get you 2 GB data and unlimited talk and text...De:Mr. RF.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "slammer", "ReviewID": "RQUP5SWQN5UP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to connect this phone to my straight talk service via their new bring your own phone program without issue.

I liked it so much that I upgraded to an X2 instead of pricier, 4g Droids just because I liked the X so much. Big mistake.If you love your Droid X like I do, then just keep your Droid X. The Droid X2 is a total downgrade. It is almost the exact same phone only made of cheaper materials. It is a tiny bit thinner but they are otherwise the exact same phone. All Droid X accessories fit the Droid X2.The X is more solid. The X2 just feels really generic. A piece of the battery cover on the X2 broke off inside the phone. Called Amazon Wireless and they couldn't replace it because the X and X2 are now discontinued. They kept trying to push me into taking it to Verizon. I said if I wanted to deal with Verizon, I would have upgraded through Verizon. Ended up switching to a Razr 16gb which I had to pay $80 for even though I got the X2 for free. Just a terrible experience through Amazon Wireless and if their customer support just keeps going on like this, they're not going to be in business for long. Terrible customer service.I wanted the X2 instead of the more expensive phones because it has a battery that you can take in and out and replace it any time it wears down. With the new phones, such as Droid4 and Razrs, the battery is internal and cannot be replaced without sending it in for servicing. With as much as I use my phone, I knew I needed a battery I could take in and out which is why I have never wanted an iPhone.So, don't buy this phone. Buy the cheaper but better more solid phone in the Droid X. I love it. It's my fave phone and I've had Droid2, Droid2 Global, and Droid X2 as far as smartphones go. The X has very stable software. Has yet to freeze up on me or restart.Also, I wouldn't recommend using Amazon Wireless and this is coming from a very loyal Amazon customer.

I have to return it because it was not as advertised, it doesn't work properly, and further research reveals that another one just like it may not do the things I need it to do, either.First, I have noticed that reviews on Amazon can reflect the product (or sometimes a similar but altogether different product), the seller, or Amazon, I want to spell out exactly what I am reviewing in several sections:1 - The Phone Specs:Motorola Droid X2I purchased it after my HTC Inspire went into a boot loop and wouldn't come out. A little research revealed that this was not an uncommon problem, and that loose charging ports were another HTC Achilles' Heel (which may have contributed  my eventual problem?). I *really* liked the specs of that phone.After days of looking at specs and reviews, I almost got another Inspire in spite of the above possible issues. I saw that the Motorola Droid X2 had a lot of similar stats that I wanted: 4.3 inch screen, 8 megapixel camera, 32 gig SD card support, GPS, and FM radio, plus it has HDMI TV out (a perk I wanted, if didn't need) and runs on Verizon's CDMA network, which I hoped would expand my StraightTalk coverage and help me to avoid the annoying access denied http error that frequently occurs on their GSM network (more on StraightTalk later, with tips).2 - The Seller Experience:The good: Shipping was just as promised - Next day arrival. The bad: The box was opened, not particularly new or old looking. Inside was a phone with plastic film on the front which had an arrow pointing to a non-existent camera button. Perhaps Motorola recycled the film from the Droid X, which did have a button in that location. The charger is not a Motorola charger. The battery is not a Motorola battery. When inserted, it gives a battery alert and tells you that it cannot charge because it is an invalid battery.  With the phone off, the battery will charge and hold, but the device is at a loss to know what the charge percentage is. There is no manual or anything else in the box. Now the specs did not say \"New phone, new oem charger, new oem battery,\" in fact they did not specify anything, but one would find it rational to expect that a new phone listing means all those things, not merely a new phone and some generic parts.3 - The Amazon Experience:Some of the above complaint can be possibly be laid at Amazon's door. Often one will get a listing for a product, then descriptions and reviews for the product or the product Amazon thinks it is, but not specifically particular item the particular seller is selling (who makes an \"I can read\" version of an award winning picture book, which then gets Amazon reviewed as though it were the original? But that is another story, a small caveat, if you will).  When trying to contact the seller the decision tree led not to contact seller but to Amazon. That has been a GOOD thing.  The rep immediately took steps to rectify the invalid battery, and still said I could send the entire item if it failed to work beyond that. Hooray for Fulfilled by Amazon. I will be ordering another and taking them up on this offer as soon as a replacement arrives.4 - The Phone Experience (with a StraightTalk tip tossed in):The phone arrived immediately. At first it would not go past the activation screen. If you are bringing your own CDMA phone to StraightTalk, you have to purchase a Network Activation Code from them and register your phone with them before you can activate it. If you get one with a bad ESN, then Verizon will not release it to another carrier like ST or Page Plus. This can happen if the phone was stolen or the previous owner broke the contract by not paying the bill. I bought a new one to hopefully avoid this issue. Further, if you are using it on the StraightTalk network, it can only be 3g, not 3g OR 4g, or LTE capable. The Droid X2 fit the bill, but would not activate using the *22890 code. After about two days of waiting, and calling their limited tech support, I decided why not hit the Verizon activate button instead. Voil\u00e1 - it was activated on the straigttalk network (there's your promised tip).As far as appearance goes, the phone looks nice and fits in my hand well, however, it does not have the solid feel I am used to, but I won't put that in the issues department, which are generally more serious.  A) Wifi issues: While waiting for my activation to go through, I loaded my apps for personal and business use and used WiFi and a VOIP program for calling. The WiFi reception varied from fair to poor, registering from the dot to the dot and two arcs inches away from my personal router, and mostly in the dot only range on public routers which had plenty of signal on other devices. That is the first strictly phone problem, not counting the fact that the battery was invalid. A little more research has shown that WiFi reception can be an issue with this model of phone.  B) GUI: It turns out that a lot of what I liked about my HTC phone was probably related to HTC Sense interface, but that is just a preference thing, I can get used to Motorola's lame weather and notification bar and so forth.  C) Sound Card issue: it turns out that call recorder app makers all state that they can't work with the Motorola Hardware configuration. This can be important if you want or need to record calls. Conversely, if you don't want it, perhaps it can be a plus, hard to say.  D) D is for deal breaker - I must have GPS to accept card payments for my business. The GPS in this phone does not work. After researching a bit online, it turns out that this is a long known Motorola/Verizon issue, though not one highlighted in the reviews here. Some of the reviews would seem to indicate that it works on their devices, as they mention using navigation apps. I tried several GPS tools and some of the folk remedies suggested (tap or hold here, tape there...), but none have worked. Not only that, the device began to get HOT after about 15 minutes or so of trying to get a GPS fix. Ultimately, I was unable to get a location using any combination of location services on this phone. On the other hand, if not being trackable is important to you, it may be a good thing, but I don't know if we can count on it in that circumstance.I am using the phone now, on straighttalk, but as I cannot use it to process payments, it will have to go back as soon as its replacement (non Motorola, apparently) which can use the features I require, arrives.SUMMARY:In general, this could probably be a very good phone, if you have one whose GPS and WiFi work. But these seem to be known issues, along with several others that I did not experience. Be very careful of what seller you choose.  Apparently some are able to skate by on the edges of the truth about what they are selling.[Additional tip: when you select export contacts to sd card, you are only backing up a copy of the list as it stands at the time, not moving it so that all the information is continually updated there, like say your email would be.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3D8U7DLETLNDN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not buy mine through Amazon. I got it through Verizon, and I'm soon-to-be on my third; the second replacement is in the mail as I type this. The first phone was brand-new from the Verizon Store. It would freeze and restart randomly. I had to pop the battery an average of three times a day because it would freeze and be completely non-responsive to any pressing of buttons. I had a replacement sent and it did the same sorts of things but much less frequently.Some of the issues are that it doesn't support the GO Launcher EX app, many games prove too taxing for it -- especially Draw Something, but Angry Birds is another that freezes frequently -- and most frustrating for me is the camera often won't open. A high megapixel camera is really the main feature that led me to get a smartphone. I will press the camera icon and it will just reload the home screen. I have to restart the phone to get it to work, which can be quite burdensome depending on what I'm trying to take a picture of.Lastly, I find the call quality to be the worst I've experienced with any phone over the last 13 years of using cellular phones. With both of the Droid X2s I've had, the calls have been very choppy, with the audio cutting out frequently for fractions of a second, which might not sound like a big deal, but it often makes it difficult to understand what has been said. There's a loss of words that results in me asking, \"What?,\" far too frequently. It's especially noticeable, though, when wait music is playing. It's just in and out constantly, which I find supremely annoying.There are other little glitches as well. For example, the home keys on the main screen will sometimes just disappear leaving little plus signs to add apps or shortcuts. If I restart the phone, they reappear. And periodically, the phone will just start vibrating for no apparent reason and won't stop until I pry off the case and pop the battery. Admittedly, this has only happened twice. But still.Anyway, I don't know if I've just had bad luck twice or if it's the design of this particular phone, but I am completely displeased. I don't load the phone down with apps and I only download trusted apps from the Android Market (horribly renamed Google Play). I have many friends with Smartphones and they do not encounter these problems even while using far more apps than me.[UPDATE] My third one arrived and it was no better. Required frequent restarts, which eventually led to my custom case cracking open (as they're not designed for daily popping). Just a complete piece of garbage. The kicker, though, was when my daughter was having a medical situation and the phone failed. I'll put the tl;dr version below, but long story short, I went back to Verizon, they refused to give me a different phone, so I downgraded back to my old \"dumb phone\" and their cheapest plan. They'd have made much more money if they'd just given me a refurbed smartphone that wasn't garbage. But that would be logical, not business-like.Long story: My daughter had a scooter accident. I made a call to a medical professional/friend who asked me to send a picture of the wound in order to make a recommendation of going to get stitches or just home bandaging. I ended the call and attempted to open the camera app. Nothing. Restarted the phone, tried to open the camera app. Nothing. Gave up and decided to call him back, several minutes having passed by this point. Nothing. I couldn't even make a call! I restarted the phone again. By this point, she's in full freak-out mode and it's been like 10 minutes. Skip to the end, she went to the doc and all ended well. However, if this had been a more serious emergency and my phone failed... it could have been devastating. Completely unacceptable. When I told the salesman at Verizon, he was a completely uncaring. Nothing they could do but send me a FORTH Droid X2. Pass. And I'll try a new carrier when my contract is up.

The phone itself is great when it works like it is supposed to.  I gave it another shot, and the \"new\" phone I purchased was clearly used.

I did some research to find a decent phone that was about 2 years old, that is when prices drop quite a bit.  Everything about this phone looked good.  I did some more research and I found out about PagePlus.  No contracts and they use the Verizon network, so you get the best nationwide coverage.I bought the Droid X2 and activated the phone on PagePlus.  I put in a 32GB memory card and I was a happy camper.  This has a dual core processor, which is good.  The one big disappointment is that it only has 521mb of memory.  That limits which OS you can run on this phone.  This phone could really use the extra RAM to make it fly.The display on this phone is quite nice.  The camera works ok, but that's about it.  The GPS function is pretty good too.  Overall I am happy with the phone.  If you don't need the latest Android OS, this is a solid buy.August 2013 update.I've lived with this phone a lot longer now and wanted to do a quick update.  As others have pointed out this phone will occasionally re-boot itself.  I'm not sure why and I have not noticed any real pattern to it.  It doesn't do it often enough to really bother me, but it does happen.  The other thing I have noticed is that the touch screen is also not always responsive.  Sometimes I touch and icon and it does nothing.  I need to do it multiple times to get it to react.  A bit annoying.  I have noticed that a reboot will resolve the issue for a while.  I really wish this phone had 1gb of ram instead of 512k, I think it would fix many of the issues.

The biggest disadvantage today for this phone is that you are limited to what version of Android your carrier decides to stop at before no longer upgrading. It is well capable of handling the later versions of the android operating system but unfortunately for us, our carrier has discontinued android OS updates for the X2 at 2.3. But if you are willing to live with that then this phone is a good reliable choice. Battery life is good but like most batteries these days, they start to dwindle in lifespan after a couple years and you are stuck at either upgrading or spending a premium for Motorola's replacement battery.This phone is good for a replacement phone that you don't want to pay an outrageous price for or you don't want to renew a contract.

The box and instructions are rather generic to Motorola. This is a touch screen, though the directions say to \"flip the phone open to make a call\" so obviously something ain't quite new in the box.That said, someone did take the time to put the tiny little MEID number on the side of the box because it is totally unreadable on the bottom of the phone. That was a bonus.I was able to activate this phone by calling Verizon from my kitchen table and it worked within about 5 minutes. I like the size of it, and that it is only 3G.Just a little piece of advice: if you are looking for the last good 3G phone out there, get this one. The technology is fine enough and you can still use all the data you want. If you switch to 4G, you will NOT get unlimited data anymore. That's the little 'catch' to 4G.So replace the oldest phone on your contract (that is no longer under contract) with this no-contract phone and you'll have a good option for the next year or so -- or for however long this particular phone works.I will update this review if things get wonky.

Even with the Otter case, although it still worked, often when I hit text, my camera opened.The only difference between the DX and DX 2 are the dual core processor on the latter - and the lack of the physical camera button. Not a biggie as the camera sucks anyway. I have a DSLR for photos.The phone is great; very responsive. I found on my old one, I had a tendency to overload it with apps. Not only did it drain the battery, but too much RAM was used and it slowed the phone down.Found a new battery every year also helps. After a while, they just don't hold a charge anymore. They are not expensive here @ Amazon.All the accessories (charger, Otter case, etc) works from the original Droid.Lots of options with this phone. It has seven (7) home screens to customize. I used one for contacts THE home screen; and other for groups of apps. ...theme pages. One has maps and navigation, one voice command and personal assistants, one Weather, Facebook and text widgets and a calendar and post-it note page each. Like I said - very customizable.This is the GSM version and I use it with Kitty Wireless - a Verizon carrier in the U.S.Much better reception than my old DX as far as signal strength. Three bars in my house. I had one previously (none with ATT).People complain about [most] smartphones not holding a charge - blah, blah - just charge it every evening and you're good to go. I keep an extra battery with me, but also give it a quick late afternoon car-charge on the ride home. No phone will last 24 hours with use. None.All in all, a wonderful phone for about a 100 bucks or so. Not he latest technology but has enough bells and whistles for me and I'm a techie.No way I would shell out hundreds for an iphone when Android works like this and most apps are fee or cost a buck or two.

I try to run several apps and everything on full settings. I did this to my X2 to see response rates and battery life. I got my phone to full charge and played a game. Within 30 minutes the battery was dead. Games will decrease your battery life, I understand, but with my sister's old galaxy (single core) we did the same test and it lasted a couple hours at full settings on an HD game. Battery was not the only issue. With it being a dual core I at least expected it to out-perform the old galaxy, but it didn't. It will lag and become almost unresponsive at times, not just in games, but even with large widgets on my background I can barely switch pages on my home screen. I believe this is no better a phone than the original X. Some even claim it is worse. Only reason I even give it 2 stars is because of the droid name, and the outer appearance.
