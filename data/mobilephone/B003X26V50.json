I truly and honestly advise you all to be careful of who is the merchant of the products you are buying from. I ordered a Blackberry Tour 9630 for my fiancee. First when I order the phone, they sent me the wrong endorsed phone. I needed a Sprint PCS phone, they send her a Verizon phone. After she mailed the phone back, by overnite, to World Wide Distributors, she had to wait 6 days to recieve the correct phone. While my fiancee has the correctly endorsed phone, she goes to the local Sprint PCS store and finds out that the phone she has CAN NOT be activated. The phone came up as LOST or STOLEN! While my fiancee called World Wide, she was trying to get ahold of customer service and the young lady hung up on her. This company should be shut down and banned from any further business with any group, company, or business alike. I hope I have helped many other customers of Amazon with this ordeal.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not truly unlocked", "Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "R2QH2JYTMCJNY8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As other reviewers say, this is not truly as pictured, as it is a Verizon phone. That said, it works pretty well -- with one major exception:  where I am (in Tanzania) the data portion is not unlocked. The handset will not enable data access at all. The cel phone company rep here (Airtel)told me they have had this problem with many Verizon BBerries, and despite their request, RIM has not come back with a solution for unlocking the phones for data.And now Amazon won't let me return it as the 30 days are up.

My fiancee who is currently deployed to Iraq sent me a Blackberry tour 9630 as a gift. I was excited until the phone I recieved was the wrong carrier. I am with Sprint they sent a Verizon phone. Customer service rep ANITA when I contacted them let me know she would email a ups label. It has been a week I am still waiting for the email! I knew better sent the phone out to them over night. Today I recieved the correct Sprint Blackberry. To my surprise when I go to activate is they can't do it because the phone was reported LOST or STOLEN!!!!! I was irrate I called World Wide while at the store, all John could do is give me his email so I could email him!!! I called customer service aka Anita, I was upset so yes I raised my voice, and so did she!!! Can you imagine, your fiancee half a world away sends a present and not a cheap one, everything goes wrong, then you are yelled back from the people who are supposed to be serving you! Anita then proceeded to hang up on me. I called back and told her the money needed to be refunded immediately, she said once we recieve the phone we will refund the money. I know that's how things work, but they didnt wait till we had the phone to draw the funds from the account. This whole ordeal was extremely upsetting! The worse part of it all, is the helpless feeling my fiancee had, not being able to just get up and grab the phone to make it better. Please be careful who you purchase from, I would hate for anyone else to go thru this aggrevation!", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Subpar", "Author": "Hemingway", "ReviewID": "R3FJTS56KC6QGB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I upgraded from the Curve 8320 after about 3 and a half years of using it. I expected this phone to have at least everything the Curve had and hopefully a few new things. After about 2 weeks I received the package (UPS's fault though). It's sleek, modern and flashy looking (if that matters).The texting conversations are collapsed which makes it a lot easier to see your previous messages to a person. Not so much scrolling through the entire inbox. Also, the keyboard is a lot smoother than the Curve one I was used to (in a good way).Although it's unlocked (supposedly) I still think it's fairly neat that there's a sim card option which it has in the back. I haven't used it yet but the phone says sprint and I'm using T-Mobile, coolness. Also, you can add a sim card/media card without have to take the battery out. THANK GOODNESS, you're not stuck waiting for the infamous long startup time of Blackberries.The charger was obviously an after market item and didn't charge at all. I'm stuck using the micro usb to the computer.No Wi-Fi. I thought newer phones were supposed to be better! While I don't use it as often as I used to (now I have a data plan) it's still nice to not have to use my data. Which brings me to my next point,There's no web browser. I'm essentially paying for the data I can't use. GREAT.Also, I can't send or receive picture messages. Uh....I thought it was an upgrade? D:Like many others said, voice quality wasn't up to par and the speaker seems to be fairly quiet. Either that or I'm fairly loud.Overall the phone is better organized (in the programming) but lacks so many things I got used to in my OLD phone. While it does essentially \"Get the job done,\" it's not why people buy Blackberrys. I'm pretty sure I'm going to return it even if it is flashy (looking) and I could use it in Mexico (or something).", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "HUGELY DISAPPOINTING.  $100+ RETURN FEE", "Author": "J.

I was reluctant to order it based on the mixed reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it is NEW, and has Verison embossed on the cover.  I love the Blackberry brand and have been using them since they were introduced to the market.  I am sure I will be pleased with my purchase.UPDATE 03-23......Ok so here's the skinny; some may already be aware of this and others may not.  The phone is unlocked, however it's still not as simple as just throwing in your old sim card.  You need to have your carrier send you a FREE download to make the phone campatable with their specific network.  You will NOT be able to use the email function or internet before doing so, unless you get lucky enough to purchase a phone that was originally set up for your carrier.  For instance; the phone I purchased was a NEW Verizon Blackberry.  I have T-mobile so the Verizon phone would not link up.  It was no big deal really.  The whole process only took about 20 minutes.  I just thought I would share this information before somebody sent a tirade review about how crappy the phone is and how they couldn't get it to work...............", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Less Than 1 STAR: Horrible", "Author": "Sylvester.Andrews", "ReviewID": "RKVYWCOXQ4A8O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1) The picture itself is misleading, it doesn't show that the phone is an Alltel phone, yet it is.2) The Customer Care phone number just rings when you call them and doesn't allow you to leave a message.3) If you buy this Phone it will not function as a blackberry because you can't get the EDGE network only lowercase edge.

NEVER had a problem with either phone,EVER,some people have had problems with the wheel freezing,in the years I have owned this,havent ever had that issue,nor my wife,and we use these ALOT,one of the first things I liked is that ALL Blackberry phones have PIN #'s so you can pin eachother at NO cost,nice little feature,not that it matters these days as pretty much everything is included in a contract.I actually,(about 2 years ago) purchased a FULL gold case for mine,thats full front incl keyboard and full back incl battery door just to look unique and it certainly does,coupled with the chrome hard case supplied by Verizon,looks great.  Features of the phone are great RIM support is awesome too,only thing I ever noticed that was an irritant.....on occasion couldnt get calls or emails,so looking in Service Status it would show emergency only and no service on Blackberry!!!!Each time fixed by simply turning off connections then turning them on again fixed instantly,now this happened rarely but happened.Easy fix.Cant remember how many times I have dropped this phone and it still works fine,never broke the screen either,(most often was in the Blackberry holster,but not always),my point being,have had this phone ALONG time and is STILL going strong,bought a battery from Amazon ($5)other than that,nothing and still go days without re charging.  Cant answer for refurbished phones as bought these new,and have been very impressed with them.Am not going to belabor the point and hope this review helps give an informed decision as reviews on ANY phone are checkered,we owned these phones a considerable amount of time and have both been issue free.Just an fyi,Blackbery tablets sync with these too via bluetooth and work fine.To me,this is a 5 star phone that has given me trouble free service,works seamlessly with my Jensen stand alone bluetooth in the car and seamlessly with my wifes phone(send videos to eachothers phone via bluetooth too)just a cool trouble free phone.ALSO,you can buy a new screen on its own,new wheel IF it stops working,cool outer case(not a protector case) as i didfor a few dollars and videos on youtube on how to install..............again,just options.......wheels are pretty much any color you want as are cases,gold,silver,chrome,blue,yellow,red etc.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Freya Schmus", "ReviewID": "R1ECT3BEMUJQJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first smartphone, so I didn't know how good it was until I traded it in on a droid.  I do enjoy the slide-out keyboard on the droid, but that's about all.  I though I wanted something different because the Blackberry trac ball occasionally slipped (or my finger did), and I didn't get the thing I had selected.  Little did I know how unresponsive and inaccurate a touch screen can be.  The Blackberry actually comes with a fairly complete user's guide as opposed to the 4 or 5 page booklet that comes with the droid and tells you almost nothing.  You have to keep punching things until you figure out how to do something.  The Blackberry menus are great.  They almost always take you right to what you want to do.

The only issue I had with it is that upon initially purchasing it, it had a sprint sim card in it and was not fully unlocked because it had a number already assigned to it.  I bought it to use internationally so I was initially concerned.  Upon using it internationally, I found it to work well with some minor glitches.  The trackball had to be changed out at most once a year starting 2011 which is to be expected with time.  I would recommend this product to someone that doesn't mind using a trackball and wants a sleek looking blackberry for cheaper.  Overall, I am a satisfied customer.

Johnson \"Inside scoop\"", "ReviewID": "R1FCJDECZDJKRB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright, let me just say that I have really enjoyed the Blackberry Tour 9630 Cell Phone (Black) from Verizon. I find the look to be sleak and stylish compared to other square featured boxy looking phones. Its a phone I can definitely set on someones kitchen tops when not using and be proud of it. Course that doesn't mean the phone is the great wonder its sold and advertised as. Now don't get me wrong cause I love this phone, its odd how a simple little cellphone can place me in a room with a few extra hours to kill and entertain me.Positives and Negatives on Web browsing:Despite what some have said I haven't had any problems getting on the web, FB and other sites like Youtube. Mind you I pay for the data package but the phone has gotten me on most websites.-Negative about this: The phone can't handle some of the websites with a lot of graphics. I am not sure what it is about the phone, maybe its the lack of memory space or what but the phone doesn't like websites with a lot of stuff to load. I've had to refresh the phone multiple times to get the site back.-Positive: Funny thing is, Youtube works just fine on the phone and I can watch streaming videos no problem heck even clearer then on my normal desktop computer sometimes. My friends have comments that its like watching a tv screen how clear the videos are.-Positive: Also if your a FB nut like myself and many others, FB works great on this phone. Oddly I've had no problems loading all that is on FB in a fast manner. This phone just doesn't like normal webpages that it has to load up yet FB works like a charm. If your looking for it to use with FB, you won't be disappointed its FB friendly and a lot of fun.Positives and Negatives on calling and texting:Overall I haven't had any problems with the calling and texting. I love the speakerphone option which I've used while driving so I can set the phone down and talk to people and drive without fumbling with a phone to my ear. The speakerphone option is clear, and its become one of my favorite phone features.-Positive: You can set up Blackberry Messenger to chat with other Blackberry users as well which is neat. The texting feature is neat as well, the phone automatically puts your contacts Facebook profile picture as the users phone ID which is kinda neat and list the company they work for if you need to reference that as well. Never had a problem with the text and phone conversation part of the Blackberry.Positives and Negatives on the phone as a whole:-Negative: I wasn't to impressed when I used it for the first week straight from the box unused and brand spankin' new and it froze up on me not even a month into using it. I wasn't impressed that it did that, and I will admit it has frozen on me a few times. You'll also find that as you use more memory and the phone starts to realize this it will be a PITA in letting you work with some websites, and Verizon MP3 sites. So keep your memory in check, use a seperate SIM card or something cause the phone gets a little touchy sometimes and disappoints you on its capability. The unnerving thing is when you have to take the back cover of the phone off and take out the battery to restart the phone. The phones reboot and load up time kinda sucks and can take a few minutes to reload back up.-Positive: I have found the phone takes really nice pictures and videos. I have taken some nice quality photos and within minutes I've posted them to FB. So if your into pictures and FB you'll love this phone, its a fast process as well. It only takes less then a minute to post your pics to FB in whatever folder you want. The videos feature is neat as well, good high quality on the video you won't be disappointed.Overall I gave this phone a 4 star cause even though you deal with a few glitches here and there, and the phone likes to freeze up and be stubborn its still a nice stylish phone you can proudly carry around. If your a net junky and need to be on different websites for work or play this might not be the phone to use, look into Iphones or IPads for something like that. Some websites work well, some don't work so well. And the fact you have to zoom in to see the text is interesting as well on most sites. If FB, chat, and occasional MP3 download like yours truly and a frequent jaunt to Amazon are your thing you'll love this phone. Just be aware if your thinking of using it for net research on a job, it might disappoint you in some aspects and freeze up while loading a page.As I said, some pages it likes and some it doesn't. You'll be surprised at all your phone options and applications as well. Hook yourself up with Blackberry APPS and take advantage of the different free APPS but don't get to crazy cause again the phone will get glitchy with to many apps taking up its memory and you'll be back to opening the back, taking the battery out and restarting the phone. The phone does offer free tools to use like memo pad, calculator, and a few other tools for those people who use it for office purposes. My friend has a blackberry and utilizes it for his office management job and I'm sure he is running a lot more data through the phone for work in his call center then myself and hasn't had any major problems with it.A good phone, go and buy it and enjoy it. Its a cellphone people, not an Autobot upgrade...for you Transformer fanatics...LOL! Just buy it and enjoy it, show it off to your friends its a fun phone to have. I'd recommend also getting the Otterbox protective cover for it cause it adds a nice protective and stylish look to your phone, but thats for another review.

Blackberry Tour is a TERRIBLE phone. I'm on the third piece of Tour hardware, after 2 Blackberry Curves that worked somewhat better. But Motorola phones worked MUCH better than Blackberry.I spent countless hours with tech support and at the Sprint store. Maddening errors, inflexible programming, poor performance.Sometimes tech support is poorly trained and I have to get Advanced Tech Support and spend more time with them. One upgrade was not ready for Prime Time and Synchronize corrupted my 720 contact entries (just before an out-of-town trip) because it could not handle some characters in the Contact Name. What do you do when you can't reload from backup? Aggravating!Sprint's AirRave signal booster on my window sill is a joke too. It gets all garbled when a big email is transmitting on my network because it has no quality-of-service parameter to give it real-time priority over other traffic. It also loses the call due to poor handoff from the neighborhood cel tower whenever you walk toward it. This happens EVERY time.Sprint messaging is a time-waster. They force you to listen to a slow and verbose Date, Time, Number before you can hear each message. You must listen to first-in-first-out and has no options to configure LIFO and skip the date/time. Better phones and cel companies try to make messages quicker, not slower.Even the little details are poorly handled. Designers forgot this is primarily a PHONE! They made the numbers red.

It was a day about a month ago. And I received this phone from BB-123. All was there and well. Intill I put and my sim card from my old blackberry torch into phone.  Now I read other people's reviews and I thought hey why not give them a shot. Ok the phone started acting stupid, nothing like what the description stated. So I contacted seller and was happy that even though It was a few days after the 30 day return policy they were going to accept phone. Ok so I return item, and somehow it was damaged at the postal office.  And the seller took advantage of this and my opinion.  And sent me a email and picture saying that he only received charger.  Now it was suspicious because the charger wasn't worth alot. So for the phone to go missing only.  Was crazy to me!!! I told the seller about my concerns, he didn't care. He said he only received charger so theres nothing he could do. He didnt even offer 5 dollars for the charger. He told me to contact postal office which I did. Postal office couldn't help me because package wasn't insured.  (Now who expects something like this to happen) he told me that I should have been responsible and secured the package.  Now um first of all I was furious because I know customer service and you DO NOT tell a customer to be anything.  And I contacted Amazon who are trying to get the facts. But let me tell you this guy or girl doesn't care about anyone but them selves and I strongly suggest only buying directly from Amazon. Because I'm disgusted with this company.  They don't even deserve a spit of a star. Trust me I don't write reviews but I NEEDED TO WARN ALL OF YOU.  Be CAREFUL, this company isn't worth it.

My 3G data didn't work at all, and I didn't even have Wi-Fi calling available. I had to use my Wi-Fi in order to be able to access the BlackBerry App World, Facebook, The Weather Channel and everything else that I used because the data didn't work; a major hassle. Customer service for WorldWide Distributors was terrible as well. I had to have Amazon intervene because they gave me a hard time. The phone was really good though other than everything else not working. On minimal usage, the battery lasted me a little more than a day (pretty good for its small 1,000 mAh battery life) and it was a pretty quick phone with the processor power it had, except for when the BBAW was doing updates on apps that I had. Texting and sending pictures was easy and the camera isn't that bad of quality being 5MP without Auto-Focus. Overall, good buy on a good phone, but from a bad company.

Most people, especially young people or those who need them, depend on their phones as if it were life and death. In case of an emergency, when a family member is hurt or in the hospital, when you're running late and need a ride last minute, or when you're stuck in that state of boredom, then there's your cellphone to save the day. We depend on our phones as much as we depend on a car to get us from point A to point B. It seems to have become a life line for people, but when your phone suddenly becomes problematic for you, then you can get very annoyed and enraged. The Blackberry Tour 9630 Smartphone model by Sprint, which I've been the owner of for a year and a half, has caused me many problems that I can say have been extremely inconvenient to my life. The features of this phone include a 3.2 megapixel digital camera, crystal clear display screen, 5.0 talk-time hours, entertainment such as music, television and games, 3G and Wi-Fi access, GPS Navigation, and Bluetooth. When I bought the phone it was re-furbished, which meant that it was previously owned and had been repaired and restored to its original state by Sprint Company.Those features may sound great, but there have been a number of issues I've experienced with this phone, however not all are bad. My main concern with this phone has always been the random override it experiences. The hard drive just can't support the phone, though it's considered a smartphone. My phone has overheated on a number of occasions due to charging or using internet for long periods of time and then will automatically shut off and reboot itself. The 15 minutes the phone takes to reboot has become one of the most aggravating problems, because it reboots at the most inconvenient time, such as when I'm talking to a friend about a serious subject. Not only does the overheating cause many complications, but using any app other than texting or Facebook can be very stressful. I've downloaded many games and have attempted to use GPS Navigation a few times, but every time I use either of these apps the phone's hard drive can't take the amount of information being processed. The phone will then freeze and take several minutes before just calling it quits with the app or will freeze and stay that way, forcing me to have to take the battery out and let it reboot itself yet again. Not only is the overheating, freezing, and rebooting causing me major problems, but the features that are not so popular are becoming useless to me now. With phones becoming more advanced and as touchscreen phones grow more popular, it's tedious having a phone with outdated features. Without a touchscreen and only having a \"trackball\" to navigate with, it's a strenuous process. If there is a word in an email or a text I need to change, the \"trackball\" has a mind of its own that it will not move to the word I need. Also, scrolling through endless lists or down an internet page is tireless for your thumbs. The main reason of a phone at all is to call and talk to friends or family. However, although the list of features says the \"talk-time\" is five hours, I've felt quite differently about the amount of time you can talk on this phone. With the phone completely charged, I feel I am only able to talk on the phone for two and half hours before the phone completely dies causing me to have to wait another few hours for the phone to recharge itself.Not all features of this phone have caused me frustration. The simple features such as the camera and texting are actually quite nice. With the phone not being touchscreen, the buttons on the phone are easy to find in the dark and once you get used to where the buttons are, you don't even have to look down at the phone to text. The 3.2 megapixel digital camera takes decent quality pictures. For as many pictures as I take, which is more than enough, I'm pleased with the memory space this phone has on it. Furthermore, waking up for class can be painful, and it's even worse when you hit the snooze button all the time. I'm so pleased that with the calendar feature. I can add as many alarms as I need to and when I hit the snooze button, I'm more likely to wake up with the next ten alarms that go off. If there's one thing I had to say I love about this phone, it is the durability. I've dropped this phone countless times on concrete and although it has scuffed a couple of times on the edges or on the phone case, I'd have to say it's kept up pretty nicely. The screen has never had a screen protector on it and the screen has never cracked nor have any of the buttons fallen off.Regardless, when it comes to the overall product, I couldn't recommend this phone to anyone unless they're a beginner. The phone itself is just out of date, along with the features. The way the hard drive processes apps could cause frustration for any user. With the countless of issues of overheating, freezing and rebooting, it's just not something anyone would want to waste their money on, even $150, when there are so many other updated models to choose from. I can't say it's worth the aggravation. The phone lacks in the areas for what I bought it for.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life sucks", "Author": "W. J.
