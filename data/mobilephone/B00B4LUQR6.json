Adams", "ReviewID": "R3MVUPJBGSID3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to end up returning this phone...  Not so much because of problems, but for mislabeling some specs and it being weaker than I really wanted.  As a whole, this phone is actually quite nice.Build quality is actually quite good.  While it doesn't found quite as well made as some of the well-known brands, it still feels very sturdy.  Some people may not like the feel of the back cover, but I was fine with it.  The texture allowed for plenty of grip but it didn't gather too much lint or get hung in your pockets.The screen was much better than expected.  Colors looks very bright and vibrant with very even lighting.  It was certain just as good as my previous phone (Motorola Atrix).  The touch-screen was a different story though.  The middle was fine, but sensitivity dropped drastically around the edges.  Many times it would require multiple presses before registering the touch.  Very annoying at times...Call quality and audio surprised me.  I had no complaints from people I spoke with, and the ear piece was very loud and clear.  The speaker phone (or playing music/rings) sounded wonderful as well.  By far the best I've heard for a phone not being advertised as having some special \"Beats Audio\" or something like that!Software...well there is none.  This phone has Android 4.0 and that's it.  Unfortunate if you did want other utilities or like the bloatware/demos, but so you can load specifically what you want on the phone.Over-all performance was good.  I was a little disappointed in the scrolling speeds in Opera as compared to my Motorola.  Not terrible, but much more laggy.  And using this phone also caused it to warm up...and when I say warm I mean melt!  Not literally but after about a 30 minute conversation, the phone was quite uncomfortable to hold.Battery life was good.  I didn't have it long enough to really test it but moderate usage should yield a day without too much difficulty.  Still a phone that'll need to be charged daily.So to end... for a good, unlocked, middle to low-end phone, this is a very good choice.  It's far from perfect but still better than other \"generic\" phones I've used in the past.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A phone that meets most of your needs", "Author": "Dixon Vivas", "ReviewID": "R15ZMRE8FCSIYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First thing to do with this device is the amount of benefits it offers in relation to its price making the cost-benefit ratio is one of the biggest.The Android version is one of the most updated, holds dual sim and working frequencies gives the same for most providers.The user experience is exquisite and management software for dual sim works perfectly allowing configure which works by default to send sms, make calls or connect to data.The only disadvantage is that it does not have front camera, everything else around is wonderful.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Guardedly optimistic", "Author": "Elizabeth \"edlp\"", "ReviewID": "R2LRWDUMOGL60P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Touch sensitivity is wonky, sometimes reacts easily and other times not at all-seems worse when trying to dial a number off of contacts as well as in changing ringtones, notifications, things like that.  Downloading apps can be a real chore even with data connectivity and wi-fi on.On the plus side, battery life is great, doesn't come with lots of bloatware, so you can pick and choose what you want.  I have no need of the dual sim, so can't report on that. I'm using AT&T; and phone is always in 3G mode-good and fast.  Ordered from ATC LLC as an expedited shipment but did not come any sooner than it would as a regular delivery and they refunded my monies; ATC is quick to respond and very polite.Phone has a solid feel to it, colors are great. Haven't tried the camera yet. Audio is good, so are phone connections.  No problem getting connected, just slipped in my SIM card, went by AT&T; store for the data plan and the phone was up and running.If anyone can suggest how to handle the download issue I would be much obliged.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "could b great", "Author": "Wendy B.", "ReviewID": "R1W27BXKEQN86Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved the phone and the way it felt and ran, but some of the push points did not act right away and it was frustrating. One of the main reasons I sent it back was because the battery was bad - I would be trying to work with it and the battery would go down in 2 hours. The second reason is because every time I made a phone call, it would heat up -  to an extreme. I almost asked them to send me another phone, but they tried to make excuses as to why it was not running properly - and I saw that as a red flag - so I sent it back.If the phone was up and running like it should have been, I would have loved it - nice and sleek.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great affordable dual SIM quad band 3G GSM phone.

I use it with Tmobile and Exactta Global which worked even in the middle of Mediterranean while cruising. Now Battery time is not great. GPS, WIFI, 2 SIM cards, media player and bluetooth being on simultaneously will give you just about 5 hours on a full charge.The phone is sleek looking, WiFi GPS and Radio are all sensitive. Screen is high contrast large enough resolution with gorgeous colors, pretty much a useful size to watch movies and read news, and easy to use.However in full bright sun forget it. Even in high intensity mode you won't see much. I wish it came with a user manual or a link to internet for me to download. I contacted the seller they acknowledged and hopefully I will get the pdf manual information. I haven't seen a paper printed invoice either in the shipping envelop.I like the fact that it came with Android 4, and very stable. 2 Gig internal memory is just about enough to put some extra apps. 512Meg ram is also not much so I stick to basics and will not tinker with this phone to make it look like a tablet. I see ZTE brand becoming more relevant player on US markets soon.So far this phone is a lot better supported in North Korea, Philippines and in Latin America.
