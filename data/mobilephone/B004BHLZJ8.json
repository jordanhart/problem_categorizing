Jones \"ejones\"", "ReviewID": "R3DVFIPFOVOINS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me say right off... this is NOT an iPhone. But, I LIKE IT.I'm a bit suspicious of a few other reviews here, as many were made within the same couple of days.It has touch screen, and is a tip smaller, but do not expect the ease of an iphone.  On the good side, I can do almost anything an iphone can do.  I can browse the internet, add applications, use it for GPS navigation in the car.  The camera works well, except in low light conditions. It has built in voice commands, for when I'm driving or such, to call, pull up contacts, or hear music.  Wifi works well.  Bluetooth is easy.  Also, I threw in a micro SD card, giving me PLENTY of room for applications, pictures, video and music.The phone has been dropped many times, kicked, and sat on, and it's still chugging along fine.BUT, I am a techie person, so I can install apps easily, use them with ease, and figure out any problems (not that there are many).  If you don't know what a micro SD card is, or how to sync a phone, you might want to get an iphone or android phone.  I wouldn't get this phone for my mom, but maybe my dad.There are a couple of minor annoyances.  The screen is a tip smaller than iphones, and the soft keys are thus a bit smaller, meaning you have to be a bit more precise typing , so if you're an NFL linebacker with huge hands, be warned.(but that's why it comes with a stylus)  The screen is a tip slower than I'd like to orient to the proper 'up' direction. (Like 1.5 seconds to the iphones .5 seconds).  Also, every so often the screen touch alignment goes a tip off, causing me to re-align it... a 15 second process (maybe once a week)Oh, this phone definitely DOESN'T have a 21 day standby time.  I would say max 5 days with NO activity at all.. MAX!..  Maybe 5-6 hours talk, and 2-3 days with normal use. Personally I re-charge every night.The phone is a windows mobile smartphone, so there is plenty of applications out there.  Just don't think it's as easy as installing as apple's or androids' apps stores.I can  upgrade to an iPhone for $50 now [with a 2 year contact :-(  ], but me and my Incite will travel together a bit longer.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst smartphone ever made.", "Author": "F. Moses", "ReviewID": "R2CMMBWNQR78JQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst smartphone ever made.  I've owned quite a few, and thought I would be happy when I got this phone, but things got so bad that it ended up with a broken screen, and to say the least I was relieved.  I thought with an ok processor the phone would be pretty decent, but it is slow, unresponsive, worst touchscreen ever.  Why they made the screen so small for a touchscreen only phone i'll never know.  When my phone was \"retired\", I was so much at peace with a $15 go phone that actually worked, didn't freeze, and allowed me to make and receive calls.  I don't usually write reviews, but when I saw this sale on them and it was getting 4/5 stars I just had to say something.  This is NOT a good deal for this phone.  I would not even get this phone if they gave it away for free.  Run from this phone and any deal for it, and don't worry about looking back.  It is definitely not worth it.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not sure if this was just a horrible phone or if it was defective", "Author": "S. Lee", "ReviewID": "R292ZWUM2D513W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I gave this phone 3 stars because I'm not quite sure if it was defective or if it was just a bad phone. First off, it wasn't capable of taking pictures. I know that international versions of phones aren't capable of MMS in the U.S. but this phone wasn't capable of saving pictures either. Again, I sent my phone back and didn't request a replacement so I am still unsure to whether it was maybe just defective. Also, the touchscreen was extremely hard to use, even with the included stylus. The sensitivity of the touchscreen is probably the deal breaker for me. The features on the phone are great. It's powered by Windows so you get the use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other MS Office software. The phone was extremely easy to navigate and it was easy to organize and close windows/applications because of the drop down menu. Also, new emails and texts were displayed right on the home screen so there's no need to check periodically. Overall, I really like this phone except for the touchscreen and its inability to take pictures.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone is antiquated and inadiquate.  Does not work well.

I bought one last year as a Christmas gift to myself thinking it would be a functional affordable smart phone. but only two weeks later the screen became unresponsive and the phone finish is easily scratched and chipped the volume with earphones is very low and even with the stylus it was difficult to navigate. less than a year later the battery is experiencing problems as it cant hold charge for any time exceeding 13 hours and this is when it is on standby no calls or texts sent or received.

This was shortly after the release of the iPhone 3G, when the App Store was still young and smartphones were still in a sort of infancy. Back in 2008, some people were still using flip-phones and Blackberies - it was very different than the current latest iPhone or latest Galaxy phone atmosphere. Touchscreen phones without keyboards were still something of a novelty, though the iPhone and Droid were beginning to break that perception.The LG Incite is made out of plastic, but it's still very nice looking. When the screen is off, it's basically a polished mirror. Build-wise, it feels nice. Unfortunately, even in 2008 its operating system was dated. Windows Mobile 6 didn't age well - although it was actually never very good. I used this phone for several months, but the touchscreen stopped functioning right, and it would frequently freeze and crash. I switched back to my old 8125, which was sturdier and more reliable with its hardware keyboard, then got a Blackberry, and finally switched to an iPhone. I still miss the Incite, though, sometimes.
