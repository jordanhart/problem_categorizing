Previously, I had the Droid X2, so I was used to a LOT of features.  Unfortunately, I couldn't afford to keep it and the Verizon service once I left my past employer, so I went searching for the things which were most important to me:  a touch screen, qwerty keyboard, full contacts list (has spots for multiple phone numbers, email addresses, full options for a physical address, etc) and basic browser capabilities.  I don't try to surf the web on the phone, that's not important to me ( I have a tablet for that), but I can access my email, which is good.  The LG 505c from Tracfone does all of the above extremely well (well the browser is a bit slow, but oh well...).  It also holds a charge for a week or more with light use and has very good sound quality.  If you are a light to moderate user, you really can't beat the price for the phone or for the minutes purchased.  I would definitely purchase it again.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RKVN1UDU3IAN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works everywhere.

This phone gets much better reception and cooperates with Verizon and USCellular towers that the ATT programed 800g phones don't like.  The touchscreen seems more sensitive on this phone compared to the 800g.  I really like the slider keyboard.  For me the keyboard is much easier to use than the touchscreen keyboard on the 800g.  Screen size isn't much different, but it is slightly smaller.  The phone works great and does everything I need it to.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the camera is only 1.2 megapixels compared to the 2.0 on the 800g.  It also doesn't record video like the 800g.  The triple minute feature is well worth the price of the phone.  One other nice feature is the micro SD card can slide right in to the side of the phone without having to remove the cover and battery to access it.

For the past 3 years Ive had an Verizon LG Octane that was rock solid.  Both phones are real similar in basic task not much of a learning curve other than its a touch screen making things a bit easier to run.  I consider myself a light user doing a few text a day and maybe a few calls each month so it just made sense to get out of a huge contract and use a pay as you go service like tracfone.

Battery life could be better, but on the whole this phone does exactly what I need a Tracfone to do.  It makes calls and texts.  The touch screen is responsive, but it is a resistive screen not a capacitive screen, so no multi-touch or anything fancy like that.  The keyboard is tiny, but much better than than typing on the touch screen.  It has a nice loud speaker and the call quality is good.

It arrived two days later via FedEx.I don't text very often, and I call even less, so I rarely use a cell phone. But when I do, I expect it to work. I bought this Verizon-network CDMA slider phone to replace a Samsung Gravity T-669 slider that I used on T-Mobile's GSM network--which just didn't provide adequate coverage for my needs.The Samsung slider is slightly bigger and more substantial and it has some great features, but it also has its drawbacks. The keyboard on this LG is about the same size as the Samsung's, but the LG keyboard has two distinct advantages. First, it has a separate number row, so you don't have to press the function key every time you want to enter a number. Second, the writing on the LG's keys is all in white, which makes everything much easier to see. On the Samsung, the letters and numbers were in white, but the symbols were in dark red (on black keys) which made them almost impossible to see. You either had to memorize where the symbols were located on the keyboard or use a flashlight to find them. Seriously!As for the size of the keys--on either phone--I have big fingers, so I almost always use a stylus (okay, it's really an ink pen) to press the keys and to navigate the touch screen. If I don't have access to a \"stylus,\" I have to carefully use the very tip of my finger, which can be rather challenging. Regardless, I find a slider keyboard easier to use than, say, a virtual keyboard in portrait mode on an iPhone.I used the Tracfone web site to port my existing number. The process was flawless and only took about 30 minutes to complete.As for texting, the limitation of 160 characters is annoying. My previous phone/network let me type as much as I needed to, then it automatically broke apart the message and sent multiple SMSs, as needed. Note: I've read that you can use the MMS picture message function to send more than 160 characters, but it costs a full minute to send a MMS. If the recipient then hits \"Reply\" and sends you a return message, it'll come back as a MMS, which will cost you another minute, so be forewarned.As mentioned in many of these reviews, the touch screen on this phone is very sensitive. For example, it can be next to impossible to scroll without opening whatever feature your finger touches when you attempt to scroll the screen. Performing a screen calibration does not help with the sensitivity. I've read that installing a screen protector helps reduce the sensitivity, which makes sense, but I've not tried it myself. (Update 12/20/2013: I installed an \"Xtreme Guard\" brand screen protector, and it reduced the touch-screen sensitivity by just the right amount. It is much easier now to scroll, without constantly opening the wrong thing. It still happens occasionally, but a LOT less often.)One BIG plus to this little phone is the \"triple minutes for life\" feature. What a great bargain! Also, as mentioned previously, this phone is smaller than it appears in the picture. Honestly, it's considerably smaller than I thought it would be, but that just make's it easier to carry in a pocket. (Update 12/20/2013: I installed a two-piece ribbed, rubberized hard case (that came with a holster) which makes this little phone much easier to grip, which ultimately makes texting much easier. Before having the the rubberized case, the phone was somewhat slippery and hard for me to hold on to when typing.)The included apps are adequate but could be laid out better and be more flexible. For example, it would be nice if the \"Contacts\" icon could be added to the Home screen or to the Quick Launch bar. Granted, there is a separate screen for frequently used contacts, but I'd prefer to have an icon right on the main Home screen. I also wish the Calendar app would display a list of ALL scheduled events. As it is, you have to tap on the individual date to view any event(s) for that one particular day only. There's no way (that I've found) to display a full list of ALL events.The included web browser works, but I've always found it extremely slow and quite painful to surf on non-smart phones with such small screens, so I don't use the browser function.Just so you know, there's no e-mail app included. Personally, I've never used my phone to process e-mail, so I don't miss it. However, if you do use your phone for e-mail, you should probably consider a different model . . . I suppose you could always use the web browser to check e-mail, but that'd be very slow and expensive.I find that both the \"Lock\" button and the \"Camera\" button, on the right side of the phone, are difficult to push. These buttons are located on the bottom (keyboard) half of the phone body, which has a curve to it that makes those buttons difficult to access--at least for my big fingers. Ironically, the \"Volume\" rocker, on the left side of the phone, doesn't seem to be nearly as difficult to push as those two buttons are on the right side . . . things that make you go \"Hmmm.\"As for the camera itself, I don't use it personally. But, still, 1.2 MP seems kinda pathetic. Also, I understand that there is no video function on this phone.I installed an 8GB micro SD card loaded with music. The phone itself sounds okay when playing music through the built-in speaker. The sound improves greatly when listening through a good set of earphones. BTW: To view/access the micro SD card, when the phone is plugged into a computer, go to \"Settings\" then \"USB Mass Storage\" and select \"On.\"Speaking of sound, the call quality, both incoming and outgoing, are quite good with this phone. I wish the speaker was a little easier to engage during an active call.I call overseas a lot, and Tracfone's international rate to Germany, for instance, is the same as it is for domestic calls. One of the coolest Tracfone features, for me anyway, is the ability to assign a \"1-888\" number to frequently-called international numbers. This keeps me from having to dial Tracfone's 1-800 International Access Number, then having to type in the appropriate Int'l access code + country code + phone number. You can assign the \"1-888\" number to a speed dial, then simply press and hold only ONE key to call overseas (as opposed to finger dialing 25+ digits). Sweet!Overall, given the combined price of this phone and the prepaid minutes, plus access to Verizon's network, I'm satisfied.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mediocre, kind of pricey -- but hey, it uses Verizon's network", "Author": "R.

I just bought 450 with a 70 minute bonus for $80 plus $8 tax and got 450 x 3 + 70 = 1420 minutes for a cost/minute of 6.2 cents.  Since texting costs 1/3 of a minute the price of sending or receiving a text is just over 2 cents.  Experience indicates my daughter can go over 3 months on 1420 minutes, so the monthly cost is less than $30.3) Has a true QWERTY keyboardCONs:1) Touch screen is hinky -- the one time I used it I found it virtually impossible to scroll2) Not a 3G phone; not even sure if it's 2.53) Keyboard is cramped compared to that of the Samsung 404G, but it doesn't seem to stop my daughter from using it4) The phone feels quite solid and not at all junky, but given the other cons I don't think it's worth 90 bucks -- especially since for that money you can get a low-end touch screen Android phone from Virgin Mobile (though, admittedly, by doing so you're giving up Verizon for VM's parent, Sprint -- NOT a good swap)", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't want smart phone", "Author": "J.

Don't buy it if you:A. Must browse the web 24/7/365.B. Must have at least 6 megapixels worth of camera resolution to feel adequate.C. Must have GPS-enabled driving assist; the ability to use Instagram instantly; or a phone that is closer in size to a computer screen and costs more than a month's rent.If you need a phone that doesn't come with a near-triple-digit monthly bill; connects when you dial, receives when someone calls you and has clear call quality when you talk, this is a great buy.Everything is very straightforward as far as functionality. Texting is easy with the slide-out QWERTY keyboard; contacts from my old phone were easily downloaded via Bluetooth; and navigating the phone is pretty easy for a non-smartphone setup.For less than $25 and the cost-effective Tracfone plans, I can't imagine why anyone who just needs the basics from a cell phone wouldn't give it a try.One thing to remember -- this is a Verizon network phone, so make sure Verizon's coverage is adequate where you plan to use it. I had the more smartphone-like LG840G (a phone I actually liked a lot), but AT&T;'s coverage in and near my home is awful.

It's the same for receiving texts. If the characters go over 160 than you'll receive the message in chunks. It can be very confusing and extremely frustrating. My old phone was also a tracfone so I don't see why they could have made this feature in a newer phone as well. If you often find yourself writing long text messages than I would not get this phone. Also, there is no video recorder...:(Besides that, I really like this phone. It has a touch screen which I really love plus a qwerty keyboard.

I've had it for a little over 6 months and the only thing I really have a big problem with is the touch screen is very slow to respond and is also inaccurate.  I have to tap things several times and frequently nothing or the wrong thing happens. I also dislike the unlock buttons placement, which needs to be pressed when checking voice mail to enter the access code.  You can also unlock it using the touch screen but that doesn't always work.

I love sliders but weight and size are always a drawback.  It has a neat little menu bar so you can access any new/current alarms, messages, calendar events and even change ringer volume here.  Plus, a small customizable \"desktop\" to access some of your more frequently used functions.  Some of the built in functions are more capable than I have seen in other \"dumb phones\".  Have not even tried the internet yet, but, at least I haven't accidentally activated the browser yet either.  I will probably never even use internet.  Call quality can be good at times, so, I wonder if when i get bad quality it may be the person I am speaking to instead of my phone.  So far, I have not pocket dialed anyone yet.  It has not been unresponsive or misbehaved.  I can connect it to my Mac to transfer/delete files or send via bluetooth between Mac and phone.  All around a good phone.Drawbacks:  If you use your own ringtone and it is not long enough instead of looping it the phone uses some obnoxious ring tone after your ring tone.  A canned voice announces messages and calls (some may like this feature) I am not sure I like it.  When writing a text message instead of just letting you write and automatically breaking the message up into pieces to send it this phone will not let you send anything over the character limit.  Interface for camera is rather clumsy.  I thought it would run apps but cannot figure out how to make that happen.For a cheap phone it ain't too shabby.  :)", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Time delay on activating", "Author": "Michele G.", "ReviewID": "R1NZRXDR3Z30MQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have ordered many Tracfones and always have had the same problem.

Their service has improved over the years and I have been a very happy customer.  For me, the prepay is perfect - I'm not a heavy user and only use my phone for calls and texting - internet access is very slow but I don't use it for that.  However, my previous phones did not have a QWERTY keyboard and texting was a real pain.  So I was trying to upgrade for that purpose.  I first tried to order this model phone off the Tracfone website, but when I typed in my zip code, it no longer allowed me to purchase this phone.  I thought it was just some glitch on their website and bought one off Amazon.  Then after reading further reviews with people having problems using this phone in their area, I though it might not work in my area for some reason - maybe the type cell towers we have or something.  After I activated the phone, it still said it needed to be activated and I thought it wasn't going to work and I was out $40+ bucks because I had opened it and couldn't return it, BUT, I called Tracfone and they had me punch in a bunch of codes and IT WORKS.  Not sure that would be true for everyone, but it worked for me and I love this phone.  Easy to use and love the QWERTY keyboard.

It uses a proprietary Java programming system which is specific to the service provider the particular phone is assigned to.  In other words, this phone when bought for a Net 10 account will have some different abilities or restrictions from the same model that is built for Tracfone use.  You cannot add any Apps that are now most common for various News Programs or Weather Channels or even Facebook.  This phone runs on the CDMA style networks, most commonly Verizon.  It is a good looking, SMALL yet heavy well-built phone with a touch screen rather than lots of excessive buttons.  Those with big thumbs or weak eyes will not want to use this phone.  This phone, as of the writing of this review is acceptable on the Tracfone sponsored \"Safelink\" program, so Safelink customers that are on an assigned CDMA network can up-grade their phone to this one, but must contact Safelink customer service once the new phone is available to do the change.  It is a good phone, and there are lots of reviews here and on-line about various features.  Use the reviews with caution, many of the reviews 'presume' that the phone will do or have features that it does not have, especially if you are using this phone as a Tracfone or Safelink phone.  It does have the ability to use a Micro SD card, of up to 16 GB some claim that it will also accept a 32 GB  card BUT I have seen no real verification of that and the manufacturer (LG) and the carriers do NOT suggest any card larger than the MicroSD 16 GB card.  One can keep many pictures and much music on that card.  I like the alarm feature, and also the other built-in applications.  I really enjoy this phone, and though not as wonderful as my friends 'smart phones' it does everything I want and more!  I would recommend this phone to any one that was not a Klutz, LOL.

The large screen is very handy for those who prefer a touch screen to move through the menu system.  It is also helpful for larger fonts if your ability to see small fonts is not what it used to be.  The virtual number keypad provides large enough touch keys to make it a very good substitute for a physical number keypad on the front of the phone that would cause the screen to be smaller. Since there is no physical number pad on the front of the phone, it functions better for larger fingers than a half phone sized touch screen that has to make room for a physical keyboard..  For the price of the phone, the screen looks excellent, and the camera works very well.  Texting and calendar work well.  The calendar has some good features for scheduling events that don't occur every week. If you want to take advantage of pay as you go phones, and not go to the expense of a smart phone, this is an excellent choice.Minus:  if you are not accustomed to a touch screen, it may take some getting used to, since it is a small screen.  And it is easy to unwittingly touch the screen if you are fumbling with multiple items at once, but that is true for any small screen of similar size or smaller, so it is a good idea to use the automatic screen lock that helps prevent this.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone for cheap", "Author": "norris", "ReviewID": "R38CAAAHEUI7EV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ordered this phone because of price and was not disappointed--works great does as it says--activation was easy --took about 5 minutes online--wish they made android powered though@ loving the triple minutes also@ oh yeah the reception works great @", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prepaid Tracfone w/ triple minutes!!!", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R25VJVGD2LJPZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!!!!

I didn't realize how \"good\" I had it!The LG 505c turned out to be worthless indoors. Now I had no service at all in the \"cave\" where I work -- I had to go outside to see if I'd missed any texts or calls. And of course when it had no service it was burning a lot of power trying to connect, so the battery life was awful (LG505c around 2 days with very little activity compared to 5 for my old 800G).Even outdoors in a local park where my old phone consistently had 2 bars; this 505c had zero or sometimes one.The 800G would still show signal strength even though it was no longer activated, so I drove around a bit to compare.

If you want a cheap phone for emergency use only, this will suffice. But note, I have had it only for a short time. I have yet to see how long it will last with my minimal use.

It is best for someone who does moderate texting and calling.  My wife and I each have one of these and we love them.

Very few if any dropped calls as compared to our previous GSM phones.  The battery gets charged about once a week unless we have a lot of talk time.  We have been using these phones for 7 months and have no complaints.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a decent prepaid phone without a lot of bells and whistles.

I needed to switch to a CDMA cell phone in order to piggyback on the provider network with the broadest coverage.  I was not able to find a local retailer who carried CDMA Tracfones (I like the pay-as-you-go arrangement, with no contract), so I turned to Amazon.  I did not want a fancy, expensive iPhone or Android.  My phone is mainly for security and emergencies.  I am very happy with my LG505C.  I like the slide-out keyboard, the features, and the display.  My only complaint is that there is no ONE single manual that tells me everything I need to know to operate the phone and use its features.  The phone came with a small instruction booklet from Tracfone.  I had to download a pdf of LG's own manual for the LG505C for more details.  Finally, I had to search the Internet for the specific voice mail retrieval commands (which keys to use to replay, delete, rewind, etc.), given my behind-the-scenes provider (Tracfone piggybacks on different providers' networks, depending on area of country and whether the phone is GSM or CDMA).  I am now on the CDMA network with the most extensive coverage in my area.  It's not perfect, but it's noticeably better than it was before on GSM.

I contacted Tracfone's online service center, but they were of no help to me. I then contacted the refurbisher, but he couldn't help me with the problem either.

I needed a keyboard for texts, and I liked that this has a touch screen and a full keyboard, but after barely two weeks of use I put it in a drawer and bought a completely different phone.  On the upside, Tracfones are cheap enough that it's easy to switch around if you want, but here were the dealbreakers for me:1. Primary dealbreaker - sound quality.  It is just HORRIBLE, which was surprising because my previous phone was also an LG and I was happy with the sound quality on that one.  This one sounds like you're speaking in a tunnel, both on the receiving end and on my end.  I might forgive the other downsides, but the sound quality is just so bad I couldn't take it anymore.2. The phone is THICK.  My previous LG phone and my new Motorola both have full keyboards but are both quite thin, because this is a slider it is basically twice the thickness and feels like twice the weight.  It's just too bulky to be practical.3. The slider part feels \"wobbly\" to me, like it wouldn't take that much to have it fall off.  Not a good sign.4. The keyboard itself is neither easy to use nor intuitive.  The keys are not easy to depress, though they are a good size, it takes more ummph to push them than it should or even than my previous experience with qwerty keyboards has been.  The alt/function key use is not intuitive at all, so I spent a lot of time backing up re-doing to get what I needed.5. The lock feature is just MADDENING.  Even set at maximum lock timing, I've had the lock engage in mid-call, so if you're on anything that is an automated call (\"press 1 for....\") you have to stop, unlock the keypad, wait a second for it to unlock, THEN press 1, and heaven help if further down the line you have to press or input another number in the call!

The keyboard is nice and it is much larger than the touchscreen I am used to, so I really like it.  It's not as intuitive as a smart phone, but it is learnable.  The camera however is horrid, but when I am traveling I have a regular camera with me so it's not really a big deal for me.I did register the phone online and was pleased to see the site offers a variety of bonus minutes with promo codes offered in a pop-up window for most of the cards available.

A memory card must be purchased to push music over---the on-board memory can't be used. Hooking up the phone alone to a computer does nothing; the computer won't recognize it. I also attempted to use the calendar function, so the phone would remind me of events, but the interface is super clunky, and it takes at least 2 clicks to find out what calendar event is pending.

And again, I was shocked that it isn't able to record videos as that has been standard on the last few Tracfones I've had over the years.But it seems to keep a connection better than the 500g, as I don't lose as many texts due to lost signals (which happened all the time on my previous Tracfones). So it has that going for it (along with Triple Minutes).The phone's design is really nice, and the keyboard is easy to use. And it feels really sturdy, and not cheaply made like some pre-paid phones have been in the past.It's also great at playing MP3s, though the process of using them as ringtones is more complicated than on my old LG 500g where I just dragged and dropped the files (at the end, I figured out that you have to make a folder called \"My_Sounds\" on your phone's memory card and put the MP3 files you want as ringtones in it).In closing...If you want any extras aside from playing music -- and I mean even the barest bone of extras like taking photos or short video clips, then stay away from the LG 505c at all costs.But on the other hand -- if you're a young child or a senior citizen, or anyone else who just wants a basic cellphone to talk or text with, then it will serve you well and is better at that than any other Tracfone that I've used in the last decade.

Richards", "ReviewID": "R219K3YE6SRWWG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a CDMA phone so it works with Verizon towers which are what I need. I like that it had both a touchscreen and a sliding qwerty keyboard, because I find touchscreen keyboards difficult to use. There's only one page of widgets, basically using the touchscreen menu is the same as using it with the keys on a non-touchscreen phone.Touchscreen: The screen is kind of small, making it a bit difficult to navigate. There's a calibration so you can make sure you get the touch set right. The screen isn't as responsive as it might be, sometimes I have to touch things a couple times before they open. I use the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate through lists and enter to select items rather than touching the screen. It's extremely difficult to scroll with the touchscreen you end up selecting things you didn't want and having to go back and change them so it's easier just to use the keyboard. Bluetooth is easy to use and works fine.There are 4 widgets along the bottom of the home screen, as well as a non-removable clock that you touch to see how many minutes/days you have left. The 4 widgets are messages, calls, menu and prepaid. When you press the menu button you have the same options as usual on a tracfone: prepaid, contacts, messages, recent calls, games, browser, multimedia (songs and photos), camera, new text message to take you directly to creating a text (pointless), schedule (alarm clock, calendar, notepad), tools (calculators, world clock, unit converter, voice command, drawing panel, stopwatch) and settings. You can customize a few things on the display, such as black or brown screens, 3 different fonts, font size for dialing, different clocks on the home screen. The send, power/end, and clear/speakerphone buttons are push not touch at the bottom of the screen. You can place widgets on the home screen, and there are two quick access pages you get to by sliding the home screen to the right or left: one to your recent texts laid out like a chat conversation, and one to contacts you want to store for easy access. You can turn the sounds off for the touchscreen, otherwise there's a tone every time you touch something.Texts: You can write a 160 character SMS or a 1000 character MMS. You are limited in the amount of messages you can save, only 15 SMS/20 MMS in drafts, 50 SMS/50 MMS in the outbox but you can save 300 SMS /100 MMS in the inbox. One of the things I like with the Verizon-network phones is the ability to see a text was received by a person on the Verizon network. With this phone, you have to open the text, go into the options and look at the message info to see the \"delivered\" icon, it doesn't show it in the main message screen that just shows the text was sent, which is annoying. Every other CDMA tracfone I've had it was instantly visible just in the list when I opened the message folder. Entry can be with the slide-out keyboard, or on the touchscreen with a numeric keypad or pen (writing each letter in a square with a stylus). You can save MMS or SMS message templates, us T9 or regular text entry, and set a signature if you wish.Ringtones: I had several ringtones in my other phone. I sent them to this one via bluetooth. It put all the ringtones in the music folder. You can't set things in your music folder as ringtones. You can't move the things in your music folder to the \"My Sounds\" folder which holds non-generic ringtones. According to the manual, you can set a sound you receive in an MMS as a ringtone. I texted a ringtone to myself from my other tracfone. This phone wouldn't open the message. So the only way to get ringtones on this phone that I can find is to purchase them from tracfone. Which I don't want to do.Music: There is a microSD slot you can use which is accessible from the side of the phone, or you can store songs on the phone. You can make playlists and stuff and it has a shuffle and repeat, as well as lists by artist, album or genre. I don't use my phone as a music player though, that's what my iPod is for.Calls: I've only made one call the sound quality was terrible but I don't know if it was on my end or theirs, it was an automated system. The phone stores the last 90 numbers each dialed, missed and received call numbers. There's auto redial and voice privacy settings available for calls.Keyboard: There's a slide-out qwerty keyboard, and it is really slow to text on, for me anyway. I don't know why for sure, but it's by far the hardest to use of any qwerty keyboard on any phone I've had. The numbers are slightly narrower, and they're also flat so it's harder to be sure you're hitting the right key. They also take more pressure to push than other phones I've used. The numbers do not require you to press a shift or function key to use, but the period is hidden way on the left side about halfway down I keep forgetting where it is.Voice: This phone has some voice functions such as voice dialing, and if you touch a button in a text it will read the text, although the one I tried it with it only read half of it which doesn't seem that useful. And you have to press \"menu\" then \"tools\" then \"voice commands\" or press the call button on the main screen then prress \"voice call\" to get to the voice dialing which also kind of negates its usefulness, to me anyway.Lock: There is a lock button on the side of the phone, the screen locks after a certain time, you can set it to 10 seconds, 30 seconds, etc., then you have to press the lock button or open the phone to use it. You don't have to hold the lock button down, however, so there is the potential it may get bumped in a purse or pocket. You can also set a 4-digit lock code to password protect the phone.Camera: The camera isn't great. There doesn't seem to be a zoom. You can adjust a few things like white balance, color effects, brightness, night mode, resolution, noise reduction, etc. You can also do some editing of photos after you take them. You can open it from a button on the side of the phone, or through the menu. There is also a self timer.Contacts: You can add contact specific photos, ringtones and message tones as well as 6 phone numbers, a fax number, email, street address and a memo. You can also add them to groups or put them on speed dial. This is the first phone I've had where you could assign a message tone, which would be useful to have on a tracfone since they don't like to tell you who's texting you until you open the message. I just wish it had been on a phone that let you add your own ringtones without buying them.Other: There are VOLUME KEYS on the side of the phone. There's a DRAWING PAD if you want to draw something. I don't use the BROWSER but there is one. It's limited and uses tons of minutes.  There's a VOICE RECORDER, but it makes pretty crappy recordings. The sound is pretty loud. I don't know for sure how long the BATTERY lasts with use, this is my back-up phone I basically just use it as an alarm and the occasional text, but it lasts about a week with occasional use. You can set the LANGUAGE to English or Spanish. Also has VOICEMAIL.Bottom line: there are several neat features on this phone but there's still room for improvement. If you don't care about having to buy ringtones or use the generic ones, and you want a touchscreen but would rather use a button keyboard than a touchscreen keyboard and you like the voice functions, then you will probably be quite happy with it.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Difficult to activate, good for calls and not much else", "Author": "Jim \"gearhead4\"", "ReviewID": "R2OF0604AOIJPK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It took me 12 attempts and 3 calls to TracFone to get this phone to send or receive calls.

But there aren't a lot of options for configuring various features like the camera and messaging.

After 160 it won't allow you to write more.  160 isn't very many.  All my other phones have allowed me to write as much as I want, and the note is then sent as a series of messages if it's too long for one.  So I'm feeling very constrained having to limit what I write to 160 characters.  I have not found a way to change that configuration.The other thing that doesn't really affect the usability too much but would be nice to have is 3G or 4G capability.

I checked the phones at Straight Talk and was informed that the initial program for these phones is for Tracfone and can only be used at Tracfone. I checked Tracfone rates and they are very expensive compared to Straight Talk rates. Even with triples minutes at Tracfone, they can't touch Straight Talk. The Tracfone people also own Straight Talk, was led to believe that the LG505C worked on Straight Talk because they are also owned by Tracfone. That is not true. Make sure that you purchase the correct phone. I was led to believe that the C at the end of the LG505C is for Verizon phone towers and work with Straight Talk. That is true. Evidently Tracfone has an agreement with Verizon also for the phones that are programmed for Tracfone.

Not to mention the minute cards don't start with anything under $20 ... If your gonna get a prepaid phone do yourself a favor and pass in these get one that sells a variety of minute cards for those tough days when money is tight!!
