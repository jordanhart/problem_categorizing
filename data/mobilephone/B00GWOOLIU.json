So, be careful if you're going to updatePD: I use this phone in Venezuela, YES IT WORKS with all carriers. Sirve en Venezuela para todas las operadoras.

I recently bought this phone unlocked so that I could put a Straight Talk SIM card in it. I love Straight Talk and it's great that we can finally bring our own phones to Straight Talk. I got it out, and like most people, I didn't read the instructions on putting in the SIM card. I saw this almost unrecognizable slot in the side of the phone, but I couldn't push to open it so I then proceeded to try to pry the back off the phone, which didn't work. haha So I went on Youtube to see how to put the SIM card in. I had to get the little \"G\" lock from the bottom of the box, stick it in the little hole next to the slot and then it will pop open. This is phone is very different from anything I have seen before, but in an awesome way! I also had a little bit of trouble with the mobile data not working, but I was able to google the problem and come up with the correct APN that would work with my phone. I would definitely recommend this phone! The buttons in the back take a little getting use to, but once you do, it is so much better than phones with the buttons on the side and front. I also how to google how to take a screenshot. haha I'm learning how to use it and that is part of the fun. :)Oh, and the battery life is fantastic! I charged it and used it for a day and a half... and by that time it was just on 47%! I was on facebook, the internet, and snapchat all throughout the day. I have no doubt that if it would have lasted me 2 full days without charging, but I like to keep it around 30% or more. I recently switched from a Samsung Galaxy and the LG G2 has such a better battery life. It's light weight whereas my old phone was heavier and I had to charged it two or three times a day. The pictures on the LG G2 are also A LOT better. It takes clear pictures, has a flash, and a great zoom. It gets a little grainy when zoomed too far, but that's to be expected. I would absolutely recommend this phone. :)", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Farewell Samsung Galaxy S's & Note's ..
