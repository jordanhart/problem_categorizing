This phone has been giving me trouble since two weeks after I had got it. The phone cuts off at random times such as during phone calls, it freezes and I'll end up having to restart it. I spent $180 on this phone and to this day, that was a complete waste of money. I'll be very happy going to get my new phone and finally getting rid of this crap.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "good product", "Author": "Blanca Akers", "ReviewID": "R1SONLKMBXV0OW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone.
