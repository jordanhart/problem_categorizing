The mega model 9150 (offered through walmart.com) or model 9152 (the one offered on amazon) with the 5.8 inch screen runs perfectly on straight talk.  All you have to do is purchase the AT&T; or the T-mobile micro-sim card (which has the better service in your area) from Straight talk or Walmart and you are ready to go.  I did not like any of the current Straight Talk phones that were being offered.  Most of the phones were dated technology and most of their cell phones run on Sprint towers (which is horrible coverage) including the new Samsung Galaxy SIII.  I am not a big I-Phone fan so I didn't want to purchase the I-Phone.  I wanted a big screen, fast processor, and good service/cell reception without leaving Straight Talk.  The mega is the answer.  I bought the AT&T; micro-sim from Straight Talk because it has better coverage in my area then T-Mobile and I am loving it.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!  But for US buyers --- IMPORTANT F.Y.I.!!!", "Author": "Karen L Jean-Gilles", "ReviewID": "R1FN7MRP9OJW0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi! I'm in FL and i purchased this cell...so far I LOVE It!!! it's everything i wanted and more and have no complaints. It's smaller than the 6.3 --- which is so much better, as I am only 4\"11 and have small hands. LOLMy ONLY caution is to purchasers who are buying this cell for usage in the United States - this cell (because it is Int'l) has TWO ports for the SIM card - which you have to purchase from your cell provider. That's not a problem, they're like $15 - $20. For my provider, the 2nd port is what works in the US. (that's at the lower end of the battery) But because you are using the 2nd port, you MAY have to bring your cell into your provider store for them to change the settings in your phone to recognize the 2nd port as the MAIN port.And that's it --- outside of that - this cell is AWESOME!

I ordered it as a gift as a person really liked my current Samsung Mega (6.3\" version)  I was unaware there were actually 2 separate models; which translate to different screen size.  I also ordered a case and quickly learned about the size difference not catching it while ordering the phone.  I gave the person the opportunity to return it and get the 6.3\" version, however, they opted to keep it and really weren't too phased by the slightly smaller screen.  They cited the fact their hands are a little smaller, hence, the smaller size is actually a better fit for them.This model also has 2 separate SIM card slots so you can use it with multiple providers without having to power it down to switch SIM cards.  I'm not sure too many people will find this useful, however, I suppose there may be some cases where this is used.  I used the phone with AT&T; service and can say there were no problems whatsoever.  I did have to manually setup the APN for the phone in order to get mobile data.  I simply copied the APN settings from an existing AT&T; phone and 4G popped right up.  The phone is now in another part of the country and the user reports no problems with the device after a couple of months so I'm really happy with the purchase.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super cool phone", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2UG0IIFIMV1AH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Way too many cool features and the digital camera is just awesome!

But I am slowly hacking my way through it and am amazed! Its a great size for the old and 1/2 blind. If it doesn't quit on me, I think it and I will be joined at the hip. The only thing which has happened is that I could not get it to ring on incoming calls. Tried everything. Must have finally hacked my way through it because it rings now.???  But I did not like the store mgr. e mailing me and verbally attempting  to get me to get rid of my seller review. That is unacceptable behavior. I was unhappy when I wrote it because I could not get the phone too ring.
