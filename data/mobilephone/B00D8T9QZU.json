This phone is absolutely awesome.  I am one of those people who HATE big screen phones, so this is a Godsend for me.  It's fast.  Perfect size.  Light.  Built extremely well for a \"mini\" model.  Many many features.  It's the perfect iPhone killer and has a much lower radiation output too.Its SAR rating (radiation level) is hardly 0.33 watts per kilogram of body mass (on a scale of 0 to 1.60!). Phones with such a low SAR rating are very rare, and much lower than the iPhone 5 which is a whopping 1.6 watts per kilogram!The best part, it's UNLOCKED so you can use tethering all you want with no extra charges.  Just be warned, LTE may not work on many carriers so check that ahead of time.  Mine runs on AT&T; HSPA+ and I'm happy with the speed.Don't listen to the bad reviews here.  People complaining about the Micro SIM are just delusional, any major carrier will provide a new SIM for free.  Just make sure you get a SAMSUNG SEALED PHONE or send it back!  The first one I received was not sealed and wasn't even LTE.  Amazon exchanged it for the right one.

I was definitely worried about buying this phone at first because it was an international, factory unlocked phone. But, I really wanted the phone so I decided to go with it. When I got the phone, it looked awesome! The only sucky part was that the instruction manuals were all in French... But, \u00cd can just watch reviews on YouTube about it. No problem. However, when I went to put my SIM card in, it would not fit. It was WAY too big for it because the phone takes a microSIM card. So crap. But I was so determined to use the phone I was not going to let that get me down. I contacted my local provider- I read reviews from other people on here that said to do so- but they weren't much help. This one lady was like \"Oh, you just break open your SIM card and the micro one I inside of it\". I was like umm okay that's not gonna happen. So, I googled it and then found this DIY on cnet that instructs you how to make a microSIM card out of your regular SIM card by cutting it. I felt really adventurous and decided to give it a try because if worse came to worse I would just have to pay $25 for a microSIM. So,I watched the video, followed the instructions, and I did it! It was not hard to do at all. Then, I took my freshly cut miroSIM card and put it in the phone. It fit perfectly. I turned the phone on and first it couldn't find my provider but then I selected a different option in the service section in setting and up popped my provider. This phone is amazing and is so fast and fun to use. Definitely worth the money.

The only one was that i couldn't get it on time and i had to pay another $63 to send it to my country. It took a week to get from CA to NY, which I considered was a lot of time, I had a family member in NY that had to bring it to my country, and because of that delay, my cousin left and i had to pay extra fee to send it by other carrier to my country. (I WROTE THIS REVIEW WHEN I HAD JUST 2 DAYS USING THE PHONE)AFTER 4 DAYS OF USE:When i decided to buy this phone, i checked all the reviews and the questions made to the seller and i found out, it works in my country because it match with my frequency and GHz. I bought it to use it out of USA, but I had a family that was able to bring it to my country. Due to a problem with the delivery, my cousin could not bring the phone when she returned and because of that, my aunt had to send me the phone by UPS to my country. I was avoiding paying extra fees, but at the end, I had to pay $73.30 dollars of extra fees to have it in my country. Because of that, i received the phone 28 days later than when i made the purchase.Anyway, I get the phone and i started use it and i was working very well the first 4 days, after that, the phone start to fail, the screen remained paralyzed  without making any movement, and none of the functions worked up after a while of being immobile, one of the days, the battery overheat and i had to pull out the battery fast and leave the phone off for around 12 hours.I contacted the seller telling the situation, thinking that maybe was the battery, the told me how warranty works with Samsung and the gave the steps to follow. The fact that i was out of USA, in Costa Rica, I had to contact Samsung Latin America and the will give me the places in my Country authorized to cover warranties of the Samsung items. The gave me the numbers and i went to the place hoping the will help out with the problem of the cell phone and of course using the warranty, because the phone was New, only 4 days of use. When I went to the place, they told me they were not able to help me due to 2 things: 1- The IMEI of the phone belong to Europe specific FRANCE and in my country the only cover warranties of IMEI's that belong to Latin America, that way the weren't able to cover the warranty, neither can fix the phone if I was willing to pay for it, because they can not even fix item that doesn't belong to Latin America, that way I had no choices to can fix the phone in my country.When I told the seller what happened, they never tried to help me, they just sent me an e-mail saying they will not cover the warranty and that was it. I had to speak with Amazon customer service to put a complain, and because of that, they tried to be in touch with me again (the seller), but the fact that the phone had more than 30 days since the day of the purchase, they were not able to received the phone back due to the returns policies, even when i explained that I received the phone 28 days later of the purchase and I had just 4 days using it when it started to fail.TO ALL BUYERS: PLEASE BE AWARE, when buy a phone like this one, ask the seller first the  IMEI and double check if that belong to the country you live before to make the purchase, because, i know that most of the buyers think that the sellers have to cover warranties or be responsible for defecting items, but in this case Samsung works different and warranty is based on the IMEI of the phone, and they give support and warranties only if the IMEI belongs with your country. In my case, I received a damage item and now i can't have warranty neither support..... and the seller was not what i expected.. they were not kind, neither polite, very disappointed with the seller.To all Buyers, before to make an expensive purchase, please make sure you know everything about all this issues that happened to me, that way you will not lose the money.

But BEWARE of fraudulent sellers (e.g. S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices)Let's face it. Someone buying am \"UNLOCKED International Version No Warranty \" phone, is doing it for only one reason: To use it outside the US.So a crook seller sees an oportunity to commit fraud: Let's sell them some $50 used cel phone with a sticker that says i9195 for $300 and when they noticed they where ripped off, they'll be out of the country and won't be able to complain.That was almost my story. Luckily I was able to notice ON TIME, that the model number behind the battery was for an used S7562 (a $50 cel) and not a new  i9195 (a $300 one). The worst was that this is a fraud and not an error, since the sticker outside said i9195. They know what they where doing, and they do it on purpose, to criminally cheat us. I tried to contact the seller, but they didn't want to solve the problem, they even  insulted me. Luckly, I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money and I bought it again in another seller, and got the i9195 I wanted (which is great).  But I was almost ripped of by this \"Quality_Services_Best_Practices\" crooks.  Do you want to risk buying from crooks like these?Read the other reviews for this phone. And you'll se some happy people and some angry ones. This is not due to the phone itself. Some sellers are S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices and they commit fraud to people, hoping they can't complaing from abroad.The i9195 is a GREAT phone, just google i9195 review and you'll see.

The phone was in good cosmetic condition upon arrival.Upon startup, the default language was French. This was an alarm as I had noted from another reviewer that the local Samsung repair center (Caribbean) would not service these as they are from another zone.Worse: the receiver speaker was not working! After some digging around, I realised that there was a bad connection at the speaker which would work if the speaker was pressed firmly against the case. This appeared to be an uncommon problem globally and I contemplated contacting the supplier for action but realised that cost of return within warranty period may exceed the cost of the unit since I reside in the Caribbean.I decided to forego the warranty and dismantled the phone and confirmed my speaker was faulty. I was able to pad the space between the speaker and the case and reassemble. It works fine now!This is the risk that Caribbean shoppers take when purchasing directly from the USA but it usually is still cost beneficial.

Here it is my very first review after a few weeks of intense use.When I set out to buy a new phone my priorities were PORTABILITY, power / strength and reliability.The S4 -mini is a very powerful device dressed in a pocket -size) . It is a pleasant one-hand device; I mean you can use it with just one hand instead of its big brothers . It fits easily in the palm of your hand and you can run through entire screen, even in the far 4 corners- with just a simple movement of your thumb  (good point).I run my cellphone 24/7, intensive heavy -duty use and as an journalist I running permanently Internet and lot of social network. The battery lasts a few more than 24 hours of intensive (ab)use and I run it permanently connected to Internet . The battery charge is really fast with standard traveler charger supplied by Samsung ( about 45 minutes or less to full charge).Touch screen is really bright and extremely sensitive. WIFI feature is excellent ( much much better than my previous LG 4X).Even 4G/LTE service is not yet available in my country I am running 3G+ from Movistar with no problem.Its processor is fast and furious; I mean, really fast and no freezings nor hangs-outs, so far (thumbs up!). Another good one? You can go 32 Mb via microSD; so don't worry about about the storage capability for program downloads, music  or even pictures from its digital 8Mb camera.I9095 is an international version; it's means that the device comes with the European plug charger ( round pin instead of the standard American flat paddle pin -up ) . Its a problem? Solve this by  buying a traveler adapter (round-pin-to-flat pin) for some few pennies in your local convenient store, and done!A but (there's always a \u201cbut\u201d), when you work upright (vertical position) on-screen keyboard is a little bit tricky specially if you don't have thin/tiny fingers . I guess the designers from Samsung could have improved a better digital (on-screen) keyboard design by  reducing separation between keys or even put no separation between them at all. Excelent on-screen keyboard use when you tilt the S4mini to horizontal position.My opinion about S4mini? it is an excellent choice if you are looking for portability, strenght and realibity; nice small cellphone with a heart plenty of power.And don't forget: it's a PHONE \u2013I mean you can do calls all day long- with nice and great audio.I will keep testing my S4mini for some months more and then I will go for a second review", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why this language?", "Author": "gladys", "ReviewID": "R2EH191MYIW6QU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I got the phone, it looked awesome!

I'm not going to go through the full specs, you can find that elsewhere. But for the screen, I, like most people, was a bit disappointed that it did not have 1280x720, which would've brought it at least relatively close to the ppi of its full size brother. But I have to say, the 960x540 is really not bad at all, in fact, the 256 ppi of the S4Mini (which, by the way is nearly the same as the ipad's \"retina\" screen of 264 ppi) makes text decently clear. The colors really pop and the screen is very bright, I would argue as much as the full size S4.The processor (dual core instead of the full size's quad core) is pretty much the same story, for nearly all activities it is very responsive, the only times I have encountered noticeable lag is running games like temple run 2. With a standard picture wallpaper, this very rarely happened, running a complex live wallpaper and other apps made it somewhat more regular. For me this is not a deal breaker as I almost never play games, and everything else ran very smooth.Overall the phone is truly a 4 out of 5, the specs are good enough to make it very enjoyable, but some obvious and easily executable changes to the specs (those mentioned above) could have made this an excellent 5 out of 5 phone, which is sad. If you buy it at the right price (which I feel is around/at least $200 off the full size S4), you will be happy with the phone in and of itself. Though, we all compare, so if you hold it next to a full size S4, you can definitely notice the sharper text and zero lag on the S4. Unless you are always holding an S4 in your other hand, I truly think you won't feel like you are \"missing out.\"Some of my favorite updates: I upgraded to this from the S3 mini (which I got to test out the android waters since my iPhone shattered upon first drop). Aside from the screen (which is a huge step up), most of the things I like the best are software related. I've been very impressed with the camera, especially because of the camera modes...night mode is excellent, it removes the grain from low light shots and leaves colors perfect which would otherwise be distorted with the flash. Organizing photos with folders is great. Also the new lock screen is very nice. Swiping across the clock (top portion of the screen) will bring you to the camera instantly, and/or any widgets you define, like the music player. You can also set these widgets as the default lock screen.

I really wanted a new iPhone 5s but with only about 6 months away from the release of a new iPhone 6, I decided to buy something else until then.I have to say that I am really impressed with this phone, it has a nice screen, bright colours etc and feels great in the hands.  I thought that the fact it has a more of plastic build to it would put me off but on the contary, it really looks and feels great.As it only comes with 8GB as standard I bought a Kingston 32GB microSDHC card for it so now I have lots of memory for photos and apps etc.  I also bought the Tech Armor screen protector and the EasyAcc leather flip case which is really great too.I know that many people probably have the same problem as myself trying to find a reseller that actually sells what they advertise.  I do not live in the US and a family member took delivery of it whilst they were visiting friends so I was a little nervous thinking about whether it would work here or not.I am happy to confirm that this phone came UNLOCKED out of the box and I am currently using it in Venezuela on Digitel.  Even the 4G/LTE signal works perfectly.  It does say on the box that only European SIM cards are to be used but that is because this is the European model GT-I9195 and works on the same frequencies as here in Venezuela and probably the same in other Latin American countries too.  I received everything new in the box but be aware that the charger will be a European type (2 round pins), it's multi-voltage and will work with 110v but you will need to buy a seperate adaptor for it to plug into your 110v outlet.

It's pretty much the same size as the iphone 5 (I have made side by side comparisons) except a little bit larger and as powerful as android allows it to be. Due to the smaller screen size the battery life is great but this isn't apparent in the beginning, after a few charge-discharge cycles is that you begin to experience the real capacity of the battery. My use case is mostly this: BT audio during my commute to and from work (about an hour and a half total). Wifi on during the day at work. A lot of news reading and whatsapp. About two hours of gaming (mostly a game that makes intensive use of internet data, Battle Run) and you still have a lot of juice for the phone to last you the rest of the day.For custom roms users: for me the battery life is way worse with cyanogenmod. I have always used custom roms in my previous phones but mostly based on touchwiz. This phone is the first one where I have used cyanogenmod intensively and while I love all the power user options of the rom I was extremely disappointed with the battery life. I just could not make it through the day without having to recharge it at work and I HATE to charge twice a day, it also isn't very good for the battery's health over the long term. Also, the battery life indicator was incredibly unreliable once you reached under 20% levels. You could have 15% battery life (on stock the phone can make it home safely with that) left and after ten minutes the phone will be at 4% and turning off. I was left out hanging because of this more than once and when I needed the phone the most (as I was just going home from work). That was using default cyanogenmod settings of course (default scheduler and governor, no overclock or undervolted, etc) but most of the fancy stuff disabled (location, gps, data sync, nfc, etc) the same way I have it with touchwiz. In fairness some people on XDA forums seem to get good battery life out of this phone on cm but I don't know what kind of customizations they have used (most undervolt) or how they use the phone I'm just talking of my experience here. Me? I happen to like touchwiz, a lot actually, always have. I specially like how it looks (I don't know what all the hate is about). I even used a touchwiz theme on cm (it never looked quite as good as touchwiz though but that is expected). About the cm power options I miss? I can have them using the Xposed framework with the touchwiz-specific Wanam Exposed module (make sure you know what you're doing before meddling with it, but is mostly safe, needs root). I had never used the Xposed framework before and IT IS AMAZING. Glad I found it since I now have alternatives in case I don't find good custom roms (for this phone they're all mostly cyanogenmod-based). PS: I now posted this on my 9190 review also since that was my previous phone and all of this applies to that model too.

The phone is from Orange, France, but in the initial set up I chose English as the language which made all the rest of the set up easy.

First is that my Bluetooth is not working. I googled and I found that it seems to be an usual problem for phones with Bluetooth 4.0 and running Android 4.2.2.  Since the rumor says that this phone is getting an upgrade to the Android KitKat in June, I will keep the phone and hope the upgrade can fix it. My second issue is the battery. It's awful!!

Looks and feels like a Galaxy s4, Funny how a few years ago 4.3 inches was huge and is now considered \"mini\". Its about iPhone 5 sized but still has a bigger screen. Anyway I overall love this phone, the small form factor, its snappy and almost never lags, can play modern games if youre into that. Also has some of the original s4 features like smart watch and some gestures. it DOES NOT have air gesture, smart scroll, airview or S health, (which I think are kind of gimmicky anyways) also no LED notification light. I use the phone alot for work (texting and calling) and occasional candy crushing, and it limps through the day. Will not last a full 12 hour day most of the time, I guess depends on use but you will probably have to bring a charger with you. But if you can look past that this is a great little phone, I get asked about it all the time!

Johnson", "ReviewID": "RH84YTYV1FT6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I was entering into the smartphone world I decided to go with Galaxy because I am an apple hater who listened to everyone who debates their phones and in most debates the Samsung Galaxy won hands down, against all competitors. I am not a big fan of the large interface screen of a regular Galaxy so I decided to go for the mini with the hope that it would fit better in my hand. (I have small hands for a man). Add the fact that at the Sprint store and with current plan it was a similar price to Apple\u2019s year old models and I was sold.  I was not disappointed. I browse the internet in my free time,  mostly social network sites or watching videos or listening to lectures or podcasts. When I first got my phone I did not set the bar high for download speed, but very soon after purchasing the phone I found that it quickly replaced my laptop for my downtime internet browsing. It could load hundreds of pictures as fast or faster, and stream video better than any  computer I had ever owned. At least when I have an an internet connection available to access. I have found few places in Salt Lake that are not covered on the Sprint network.  Since this was my first smartphone I was a little apprehensive about learning to use the interface of a phone, I am so used to a computer that I was afraid I would miss the trackpad. I didn\u2019t. It took me only about 5 minutes of use to fall in love with the touchscreen interface. I had no problems with worrying about what I was tapping or how it would all pop up when I called it. Every program runs smoothly when  I call it up, I have been playing a lot of sonic the hedgehog when I am waiting for my bus in the morning and I have not had a single instance of the game lagging or giving me any kind of trouble due to processor speeds. The 1.5 GB RAM is plenty for my purposes.  The Google play store is great. I quickly got a hold of all the apps I was dreaming of before I got the phone, like Pandora and Google books. As soon as the apps were installed they basically take care of themselves. I get updates for them as the updates come and they run smoothly. I use the lookout security that came with the phone and it is really good. It definitely gives me the best false sense of security that any tech security program can bring (nothing is really secure in the hands of someone who knows how to hack). It even sends candid shots of people who repeatedly fail my unlock pattern. I love it!Also standard is a bunch of Sprint money grabbing apps that are trying to be as good as Google\u2019s. Apps like the sprintzone or internet program I quickly replaced with things like the Youtube and Chrome apps and have no intention of going back. Fortunately gmail and google calender both come standard so all I had to do was input my email and everything was synced perfectly. Even Google maps was standard and it has saved my butt once or twice in the last month.  The swipe entry method is still a work in progress. I have had the phone for about a month and still find myself regularly stopping what I was swiping so I can tap each letter to spell it out. It gets annoying when I swipe the word \u201cwhat\u201d for the 100th time today and it guesses something really different (after getting it the first 99).  The sound on the stock headphones is crystal clear for my music (classical, for study) although I will still disconnect them to answer a call because the noise cancellation technology sometimes just leaves me confused and a little disoriented as I am talking to someone.  The sound out of the back speaker is pretty good despite the lower volume, I can handle it most of the time but if I am trying to listen to some music through that over the sound of a car it lacks the power I dream of but has everything I expect considering the size of the speaker. I did get Jbl Charge bluetooth speakers and they cover all the sounds I need.  The downside to streaming music or videos is that it has a tendency to drain the battery. I can go for several hours streaming music from the internet to my speakers via the bluetooth just fine. I do also have plenty of days when I can go a day and a half without a charge because I will only use my phone for calling (I am not a terribly popular person so it doesn\u2019t say too much).  I did get a Speck case for my phone and it has been dropped several times but has never lost an anything, not even a scratch when it was dropped onto a concrete driveway.

I never had an issue with the battery life. The pictures are vivid and has a much more powerful front camera (1.9 M) in comparison to iphone 5 (1.2 M). The back camera is just the same. If you are not just a blind fond of iphone, you wouldn't throw away all that money in two years!!

S. Rapaport", "ReviewID": "RT2BNCKVZ2TQN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": ".I have just emerged from a nightmare ten days spent with this handset. It almost drove me to suicide!I should immediately declare that I am a middle-aged business phone user - i.e. I only want the mobile for calls, texts and emails plus occasional internet browsing. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini may be the dog's bollocks when it comes to its camera, video streaming, music and/or games (I really don't know) but I don't need any of those features on a phone. I came to the end of my 24-month network contract and was sold this handset as an upgrade from my trusty iPhone 4 which, although I know was now out of date, had nevertheless never let me down. What a mistake I made! The old adage of \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" was never truer.-- COMPARISON of the key features of the SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI vs the iPHONE 4S for a business user:SIZE and WEIGHT: The height/width is about the same on the two phones but not the depth. The S4 Mini, being markedly slimmer and lighter, fitted into my suit pocket more easily and didn't feel like it was bulging my jacket.\u2713 S4 Mini'HOME' SCREEN: The S4 Mini home screen is horrible. It includes annoying and intrusive adverts which constantly appear when you least want them and are difficult to stop. And trying to organise the screen layout is very complicated. The iPhone home screen, on the other hand, is a perfect example of the genius of Apple simplicity and 'visual logic'.\u2713 iPhone4SSIGNAL and CALL OUTAGES:In the few days I owned and S4 Mini I had several calls drop out and unexplained outages, even when the bars showed maximum signal. It could have been a network thing but I suspect it was the phone. The same thing had not previously happened in the same locations when I had an iPhone on the same UK network. Extremely annoying when you are on a business call.\u2713 iPhone4SCONTACTS: The display of contacts on the S4 Mini is irritating. Each one has a (blank) clip-art image frame for you to add your contact's mug shot, but that's irrelevant to me. Contacts are much easier to manage and less annoying to browse on the iPhone. However I did get used to the 'reverse video' (white writing on black background) on the S4 Mini. I'm not sure if I can change the settings on my new iPhone to do same but I keep meaning to try.\u2713 iPhone4SHANDSET LOCK: I don't know why but the screen lock on the S4 Mini kept malfunctioning, especially when the phone was in my pocket. It seemed to disengage at the slightest touch, making the notion of a 'screen lock' completely redundant.\u2713 iPhone4STEXTS: I found texting easy to get used to on the S4 Mini and, if anything, slightly better than on the iPhone 4. I especially liked the predictive text provided by Samsung which is better than Apple's version. However one downside is that I kept finding open (i.e. 'draft') texts in my outgoing messages list. Apparently the phone will automatically register a 'draft' if you accidentally hit the space bar - or for that matter any key - after sending a text.\u2713 S4 MiniBATTERY: The battery charge retention is a famous gripe of iPhone 4 users and I was assured by the store salesman that the battery on the S4 Mini was far better. In reality I found no difference at all. Both phones need charging fully every night.\u2713 equalEMAIL: I have multiple email accounts - business and personal - and the iPhone 4/4S is a dream from that point of view - easy to set them up and easy to manage. Not so the S4 Mini. The setup was straightforward enough but the layout and, in particular, updating of messages was a nightmare. I may possibly have been doing something wrong in the few days I had the handset (I am not a 'techy') but I hated the email experience with the S4 Mini. I felt I couldn't trust the phone and I was missing out on incoming messages. Worse still, some emails I sent were not delivered from the correct account or occasionally not sent at all. As a business user I rapidly lost confidence in the phone thereafter.\u2713 iPhone4SKEYPAD: I hated the screen-touch keypad on the S4 Mini. I never got used to it. Although I have quite big fingers I am a careful typist - but even so I found I had to correct up to 20% of my keystrokes on the S4 when sending emails. The keypad was erratic and unreliable, irrespective of whether the phone was turned landscape or portrait.\u2713 iPhone4SAPPS: One of my biggest gripes with the S4 Mini. It came complete with several (a few dozen) superfluous and useless apps which clogged up my screens and I couldn't seem to get rid of. Many of the ikons were simply horrible and in some cases too small to even decipher (although I realise you can make them bigger in 'settings'). The phone seemed to have been pre-set at the factory for a twelve year-old. Conversely I have always liked the Apple array of Apps, the layout and simplicity. Apple's design style is of course one of their biggest selling points.\u2713 iPhone4SBACKUP/RESTORE: One of the most important things for me - which I had taken for granted and thus hadn't fully considered before my short flirtation with the S4 Mini - is the backup facility via iTunes on my laptop and/or iCloud. I have many business contacts and always a lot of texts in my handset. It would stress me out big-time to lose them. It's so easy to sync an iPhone with iCloud/ITunes whereas when I tried to download the Samsung equivalent ('Samsung Kies') it froze my computer and, worse, came bundled with lots of horrible unwanted software and browser tools - including more bloody adverts - which I couldn't stop. It would not even uninstall via 'Add or Remove Programs'. It sent me into a mini rage and I was left feeling violated and extremely pi**ed off. That was when I decided I couldn't operate any longer with the S4 Mini'.\u2713 iPhone4SCALENDAR: In my line of work I constantly make appointments and over the past two years I had come to rely on my iCloud/iPhone synced calendar. I could enter a meeting into my office PC, setting an alarm/reminder, and the event would ping and remind me on my iPhone. It saved my business life many times! After owning the S4 Mini for a week I missed a meeting 'cos the phone didn't ping at me. I hated the calendar on the Samsung.\u2713 iPhone4SIn the light of the above which, to repeat, was my experience after only ten days' usage of the S4 Mini, I have to say that for me there is no comparison with the iPhone 4/4S. Going back to an iPhone felt like being reunited with a long-lost dearly loved relative. Maybe I would have got used to the S4 Mini in time, who knows? But the stress and frustration I would have had to go through would have most probably killed me.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Jameel Carimbocas", "ReviewID": "R1AW6BY24G1E5Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery dies very fast even when I am not using it.

I compared them back to back, playing exact same song, on exact same setting. Note 2 sounds noticeably better.3) Pictures taken with this camera definitely inferior to Note 2. It may also be 8 MB, but it is not the same 8 MB.4) Had weird issue with SD card. Unmounted my SanDisc 64 GB card from Note 2 and inserted into S4 Mini. No problem at first, card recognized and worked fine. After I turned off the phone and turned it on again message \"SD card removed\" appeared, followed by \"SD card unexpectedly removed\". Phone either saw the card but did not see any files on the card, or did not see the card at all. Tried to re-incert the card - worked well for a while, but once I turned off and on the phone again same thing happened. When the card was back in Note 2 it had not problem, which can only mean one thing - problem is with S4 mini.I can see here the description states that SD card up to 32 GB is OK, but the manual says that it should be able to take cards up to 64 GB. I considered buying another card, but decided not to take a chance. Given overall poor performance I have decided to return the phone and get S4. For 200 dollars extra you get the best phone on the market, superior in every aspect.The only good thing - it is, indeed, amazingly light and small. Applications run smoothly.
