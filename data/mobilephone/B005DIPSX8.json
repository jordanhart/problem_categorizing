{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A full-featured phone in the palm of your hand!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2E9001TVHS9Z2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have always been a fan of Sony Ericsson phones; I had one before the smartphone boom and it was flawless. My carrier (AT&T;) never carries their good phones.  Although I'm tech savvy and love gadgets, I procrastinated joining the smartphone movement simply because I didn't want to have to carry around such a large phone. One day I finally broke down and got an Android and loved it!  However after a year of use I finally had enough of carrying that big thing around. I have an Android tablet when I want a bigger screen. So I looked at the AT&T; store I found that the phones are just getting bigger and bigger! That's so American of us. After much searching, I found this beauty. Thank you Sony Ericsson! It has everything the big phones have but in a tiny package! It's smaller than I could imagine and I giggled for quite some time after unpacking it because it's just so cute!SIZE: Fits in the palm; can do just about everything one-handed with ease and most importantly, fits in all my pants pockets! I have no problem typing on it. When it is in portrait mode, the stock keyboard is set up like the old number pad style with multiple letters on each key. I didn't like that, but I can see how it might be needed if you have big fingers. I just downloaded my favorite keyboard app and surprisingly can still type just fine with a full keyboard in portrait mode. I usually end up selecting prediction words. It feels really nice in the hand; light but not cheap feeling.SCREEN: Looks great. Even tiny text is readable. No complaints!SOUND: Ringer and other media is loud and clear; great for such a small thing. For calls, I'd say it's about average for a smartphone.BATTERY: Average for an Android. Not great. You would think it would be better with a smaller screen. I've never had to charge it during the day. I just make sure to toggle off wi-fi when I leave the house.CAMERA: Great! It's only 5MP but it takes better pictures than my old phone that had an 8MP. This has image stabilization. I noticed sometimes it's a bit slow to take a picture and eventually realized that the worse the lighting is, the longer it takes. This is not a bad thing. It just takes the time to make sure it gets a good focused shot. It will beep right before it snaps. I like the dedicated camera button on the side, but you can set it to take pictures when you touch the screen as well. I love the camera interface - swipe from one side for settings, swipe from the other side access your pictures (where the last 5 pictures are always viewable). The 3D panorama mode is a little tricky; it takes some practice. I viewed my pictures on my 55\" TV (by sending it to the TV wirelessly with DLNA - really cool!) and they looked amazing! As for the 3D, all the pictures looked 3D when I set my TV to 3D mode, so I don't know the difference.SYSTEM/FEATURES: Very snappy. Much more responsive than my HTC Android which has a faster processor. Very little bloatware, most of it is easily uninstalled. This is great because with Android, you end up customizing it with apps from the market anyway. I'm not a big Facebook user so I can't comment on the \"Facebook inside Xperia\" feature, but it seems cool. The swipe to move through the screens is relatively large. You really have to fully swipe from one side of the screen to the other. That's taking me time to get used to, but what is really cool that instead of swiping through your screens, you can just swipe your fingers together and it will float all shortcuts/widgets on the screen. If the widget you are trying to access happens to be floating around in the back, you just shake the phone and they bounce around so you can get to it. There are also corner pockets which hold several apps and can be made available on all your screens or replaced with a widget. You can also chose to take a screenshot of your phone when you hold down the power button. Oh and one more thing... WI-FI TETHERING (using your phone as a wi-fi hot spot) without a tethering plan. AT&T; must hate unlocked phones. HA!IMPORTANT NOTE: I initially could not get this to work for data when I put my sim card in. The ST-15A IS 3G compatible with AT&T;, but the automatic set up kept erroring.  I took it to AT&T; and they set my sim card to 3G (my old phone was \"4G\") and it still wouldn't set up. I was told to call Sony Ericsson, but when I got home I just did an internet search for the problem and found the right settings to enter in manually. It now works perfectly.I've only had it about a week, however, I've spent a lot of time playing with it and testing things out so I can be confident in selling my old Android. If anything changes for the worse, I'll be sure to update this review. As it stands now, 5 stars!UPDATE: There is a screen flickering problem with the Xperia Mini and Mini Pro. In some low light levels, it flickers as if it can't decide what brightness to stay at.  This is apparently a very common problem, which I found out by doing an internet search. Hopefully it will get fixed with some sort of update to the way the light sensor works. It freaked me out when I first noticed it, thinking I had a broken phone, but now that I know it's \"normal\", it's just a minor annoyance. I am still amazed at how awesome this phone is. It hurts me to have to take off a star for this, for now. I'm keeping an eye out for a fix.UPDATE JUNE 2012: I am now on my 2nd Xperia Mini.  The first phone's earpiece stopped working after the first time I used the headphone jack. I received a call while it was plugged in to speakers, unplugged from the jack, and could not hear my caller.  Tried troubleshooting on the phone with SE to no resolution.  Returned to seller (within 30 days) and got another. The 2nd phone's touchscreen started to malfunction when it got warm, greater than about 85 degrees. It would start doing things on its own anytime I was outside (now that it's summer). I was about to send it in then I did an update to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and the problem went away. The new OS is very sweet (no pun intended!).UPDATE DECEMBER 2012: Still using the phone; it still works great.  Never again had the problem that other reviewers complained about (vibrating/unusable when warm) after the system update.  I have been using it on my deployment to Afghanistan and it works with the local cell provider sim card just fine. I am also using my WiFi to VoIP and save minutes.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small and big at the same time, the perfect balance for an Android smartphone!!!", "Author": "James Runner", "ReviewID": "R2ZO08ALXB7HZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the purchase.

It worked fine until late May, when occasionally, the touch screen wouldn't respond right -- such as, swiping to unlock would only drag the unlock thing part of the way where it needed to go, so I couldn't unlock it sometimes.  I noticed that this only occurred when I was outdoors with it.It got real bad in July -- If I were able to unlock it, I would tap an app, or tap a phone number to call (or answer a call), and it would show the call (or the app) for just long enough to see that it was trying to do something, and then it would shut it down.

Tait", "ReviewID": "R36710CW9HFRFW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before selecting this phone I did a lot of research, but ironically the most critical bit of information was not revealed to me until the phone was already shipped. Do a search online at Google, Yahoo, or Youtube for \"Xperia Mini Problem\" and see what comes up. You will find descriptions like \"overheating\", \"unstable display\", \"back button\" and so on. These phones often come with a problem where the back button and the menu button (on the left and right side of the chin of the phone) activate repeatedly all on their own when the phone becomes warm or hot. I read of this issue and dug around until I found a solution, albeit a very involved and complicated one. The option of calling Sony customer care was thrown out since everybody up to that point had tried that and the stuff they had the owners do all failed. So electronic surgery was my solution. I sat and waited for my phone to arrive so that I could carry it out.When my phone arrived, I charged it and then tried to turn it on. To my horror the phone did not wait to get hot. It started acting up IMMEDIATELY! I left it alone for about an hour, waiting for it to cool down (some owners said their problems occurred after the phone was just charged). I tried again. Same thing. I eventually decided to put the phone in the freezer to cool it down. It sat in the fridge for about 30 seconds. That cooled it down enough so that I could at least have a look around. But not enough to keep it stable outside the fridge. I had to keep the phone(and my head) in the fridge the entire time. I needed the phone to be stable while I carried out the surgery so I conjured up a plan to keep the phone cool by resting it on a container filled with ice-cubes! This was late at night so I decided to wait until after I had spoken to customer care about the issue. This was just to satisfy myself that I had no choice but to dig into my brand new phone.Early the next morning I got all my things together and called Sony customer care. I was greeted by a gentleman who identified himself as \"David\". I told him that my phone had the \"common back button problem\". His response: \"This isn't a common problem with these phones, sir\". That was clearly a script because trust me...this issue IS common. Anyway, we eventually got down to what he wanted me to do. He talked me thought installing the Sony PC Companion software on my PC. He then talked me through the update process. After updating the phone how David said, I was SHOCKED to find that the phone was actually fixed! I was NOT expecting that. I was overjoyed though because that meant I didn't have to potentially destroy my phone in a botched reprogramming exercise. Along with the fix came an update to Android 4.04. I have been using the phone now for a few days and so far, so good. It has not missed a beat since the update.Now, would I recommend this phone? I'm not sure. Now that it's working it is a gorgeous little thing. Works flawlessly. But the anxiety that it caused when I just got it has put me off ALL Sony products. This is a problem that Sony knows about and not only denies, but is actively trying to cover it up. There is NO reason why this phone cannot be sorted out by the manufacturer or by the retailer. Insisting that owners go through the hassle of doing an update is unacceptable. The update process itself is actually quite quick and took only 10 minutes or so once I got the PC Companion installed. This could be done while the customer is handling payment at the checkout counter or by the online retailer prior to shipping.I'm happy with it and if you want an inexpensive phone with lots of features, and don't mind having to go through an update as soon as you get it, then go ahead. Purchase and enjoy. But if you want absolute trouble-free phone use, look elsewhere.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Wayne E.

Everything \"just works\" as long as wi-fi is in range. And this phone is tiny. I love it. Had it a couple of weeks now. The issues that I dislike are: the voice dial does not ask for confirmation.

It takes some efforts to make this phone the perfect one for me though. Well, it's not an iphone. So some add-on's needed.1. At&t; 3G prepaid or T-mobile 2G prepaid (California)I started with T-mobile $30/month prepaid unlimited data and text plan, 100min talk time. Bought a sim card on T-mobile website for $1 and port my number online. It's easy. The plan was an awesome idea but the xperia mini can only support 2G with T-mobile. The turn-by-turn GPS navigation still works like wonder-- fast and accurate. It even allow you to enable your mini to be a mobile hot-spot. Yet it took a few mins to load a webpage, which drove me crazy. So I bought a gophone sim card from ebay and registered with a At&t; prepaid plan at the store. The website didn't allow me to port my number.  $50/month gives you 250talk time, 1GB data, unlimited text. I think I have to compromise. Now it only takes some secs to load a page with 3G network. However, the mobile hotspot function was disabled. One more thing, it doesn't connect to AT&T; 3G network right a way. You need to google the APN setting for At&T;'s 3G network. (The sale rep may not help you with that) I downloaded the app, \"Tweakker\" to help me with the settings. It works.2. 32GB Class10 Micro SD cardIt's selling for $18 on ebay for an OEM Class10 Mircro SD card. Shipped from China. You are going to need some external storage because the internal 512MB is too little for a smartphone. Class 10 speed is totally worth it because the photos and music did load much faster than the class 4 (come with the package).3. 2430 mAh batteryIt last two times longer than the regular 1200 mAh battery. I tested and it could last three days with light use. Highly recommended! $12 on ebay.The Android OS supports a variety of great apps flawlessly. My friends all said this little phone takes beautiful photos. (it has self-timer too!). Wifi is just fast like my iPad2. It's much lighter than iphone4. The gesture/voice input method seem to be created for this small qwerty keyboard. You will be amazed by how accurate it is!These are all the things that I could do.

This phone feels and looks much bigger than the x10 mini, but it's mainly a perception thing as it is only larger by 5mm x 2mm x 0mm (0.19\" x 0.08\" x 0\") and by 11g (0.39oz). One reason for this perception is because the x10 mini had more rounded edges, and the Xperia Mini takes up the full dimensions. At any rate, people comment on how small the phone is, so I think at times they are tired of the big phones as well. It's unfortunate that Sony really hasn't come up with a newer model to replace this. The Xperia U is quite a bit larger.One feature left off of this phone is the front-facing camera which makes video calls, like with Skype, impractical. The Xperia Mini Pro has the front-facing camera, but not this one. Another design feature of this phone is the fact that two of the buttons (return and menu) are somewhat extensions of the screen and not physical buttons. With this phone, it's normal to use it in one hand, but have accidentally pressed on return or menu on many occasions.Sony has upgraded the software to Android 4.0 (Ice cream sandwich). I ended up following instructions to root the phone, and just recently, have installed Android 4.1 (Jellybean). To me, the negatives are the battery life as if I am \"playing\" with my phone too much, I may even have to charge it up during the day, the internal RAM of 512MB, and that it has only a single-core processor. But even with these limitations, I am still pleased with the phone and, despite being dated from a processor/capability point of view, I would not trade it for anything else out there.

This phone looked better than I expected once I received it and it performs perfectly , I find myself constantly taking it out and looking at it because it is just a very cool little Android . I upgraded  the OS to ICS right away using the options found at the  Sony Mobile website which was quick and easy using the usb cable that came with the phone and the Sony PC companion software . Love everything about this phone , it pretty much does it all and the price for unlocked is reasonable and worth it . If you want a big device that is closer to a tablet then purchase a different phone but if you are in the market for a nice compact smart phone that has Sony quality  I would highly recommend this mini , I was very happy to still be able to find this model since there has not been a newer version of the Xperia Mini developed , the improvements over the Mini X10 are a awesome and this phone is worth every penny , imho this is pretty  good for being last years model.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "The smallest Android phone", "Author": "Dimitar", "ReviewID": "R3HDM4KJ83FU7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small phone, not bigger than the palm of my hand, which at the same time has all features of a smart phone - WiFi, GPS, multi-touch screen etc.Xperia mini is exactly that.While it is small, the screen is incredibly clear and easy to read.Phone responsiveness is great - no lag, no delay - both with the original Android 2.3 and after updating it to Android 4.The speaker volume is loud and clear.Overall, I think this is probably the best and only Android phone in a small form factor that does not sacrifice on features and convenience.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Phone, AT&T; configuration issues, compatible to Mac", "Author": "A. khan", "ReviewID": "R25JCZ2S29DE3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the phone last night. No issues connecting to WiFi. If you are using AT&T;, and 3G, make sure to have them add your IMEI number in their system. For me it was a nightmare, AT&T; tech was frustrating to say the least. They could not configure the phone after 1 hour of trouble shooting, and told me to get another SIM. Nevertheless, I googled the issue, and found a utility called Tweakker (with 2 k s). This utility is sweet. It configured the internet very nicely, however, it was still showing E (for edge, not 3G). Additionally, do upgrade the OS to ICS (android v 4) as soon as you get the phone. For this, you need to down load the sony bridge application (sort o' like the iTunes for this phone). Once you upgrade, the internet should show \"H (I guess HSPDA+ aka 3G)\". Whooh, that's a lot of work. Finally, you get to enjoy the phone. To be honest with you, all that work was worth the phone. I took off one star for this extra work. The phone's display is very nice, very snappy response, fluid touch interface, and great sound from both XM radio app and Pandora. I have yet to try out the MP3 music.

I was little bit worried about the overheating problem. The phone has a prepaid T-Mobile Sim card with no data plan. The phone works fine with t-mobile so far - calls, vm and texting.

The phone also came with a 2GB micro SD card with a few games loaded on it.I updated the phone with Sony firmware update software. The update of phone to Andriod ICS was smooth and finished in a few minutes. Setup wifi and email accounts. Browser is good as it can be with the given screen size. Phone Settings in ICS are much better organized.The cons so far -The new email notification doesn't work (internet connection is through wifi only). The email is refreshed only when I manually refresh it. I did change settings of how often to check for new email.The battery drains quite quickly if you have wifi turned on and there is no available wifi network. So I turn the wifi off when I leave in the morning.

One day I decided to use the junk Sony Ericsson for a change, just to see what it would feel like to downgrade. Need I even explain my frustration? This phone is as dumb as a 23 year old blonde. Everything is creepy, all the functions, menus, interface, internet connection. I mean everything.And the way Sony monopolizes all their products, creeps me out. Camcorders, laptops, phones, you name it. They didn't even bother adding a shortcut for turning off the data. Smartphone? Crapp-phone, that's what it is.My advice, go for a real smartphone. One that can actually keep you connected, entertained and organized and not the other way around. The phone application in itself is the dumbest of all newer phones.To recap I'm turned off by Sony's monopoly and I'm not trusting this brand any more.
