All the features specified are there and do the job effectively.  Do not ever try to purchase the 2.0 usb charging cable separately.  You are not going to be able to replace it.  I have bought at least eight cables believeing that they were the appropriate ones only to be disappointed time after time because they would not fit the slot in the phone.  Also do not ever try to replace the rechargeable lithium batterys because you are not going to be able to find them either.  If you ask the sellers of these cell phones to sell you any of the accessorys for this phone, you are prompltly told that they are not sold separately.  I now have a useless very sharp looking phone that I lost $100.00 dollars worth of minutes to T-Mobile becasue I can't charge the damn thing.  I keep getting web sites that advertise 2.0 micro usb cables but none of them ever say that they are for a Q8 wrist cell phone.  It is impossible to tell just from looking at the end of the cable if it will fit into the slot on the phone. I am so glad that this was a gift.  I would never buy this cell phone for anyone, especially now that I know that it is virtually impossible to find or purchase any of the accesorys separately.  Thank-you for your time.Q8 Dual Sim Card Dual Standby Watch Cell Phone Mobile Quad Band Touch Screen Mp3/4 with Keypad I am thoroughly convinced that the reason a customer is not able to buy any accessories for this cell phone is because the manufacturer wishes to constantly make money from new purchases.  I suspect that if accessories are ever made available to past purchasers they will be so costly that it would not make good sense to replace any defective parts. If you really love this cell phone you are forced to buy another one. I've noticed that this cell phone is predominantly sold in China. Due to fact that this cell phone is made in a foreign country, any parts or the actual cell phone are usually not shipped to a resident of the United States unless purchased from an American based business.  Again, I would suggest anyone who lives in the United States of America, please do not buy this cell phone. You will simply never be able to buy any of the accessories like the 2.0 usb micro cable or the rechargeable lithium battery should the need arise.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth 60$ But I Like It", "Author": "Girish KG", "ReviewID": "RDJXXB97FT3TT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:All the functions are fine as specified by sellerDUAL SIM is an added advantageSound quality is goodTouch screen response awesome and even better than normal touch phoneGood camera qualityCons:Conversation quality and signal reception is not standardUnconformable in unlocking the locked screen as it always pops up SOSNightmare in searching contacts through menuSide USB/Charger port cap will brake in one or two times usageBelt/strap quality is not at all upto the mark700mAh battery is not at all sufficient, will end up in charging and or changing the battery for every 3hrs conversationNot water proofStylus is not upto the mark as it brakes up in couple of usage", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$82.05", "Features": "This quad-band phone will work on GSM network frequencies 850/900/1800/1900 MHz.\nThis phone comes with Dual SIM technology, allowing you to switch easily between two SIM cards/phone numbers\nA built-in FM tuner lets you tune into your favorite radio station wherever you are -\nEasy-to-use and responsive touchscreen allows for smooth navigating.\nWristband has stylus holder + stylus", "Name": "Q8 Touch Qaud Band Dual Sim Card Dual Standby Watch Mobile Phone With Keypad Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nojxX2b%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00464IAS0"}}
