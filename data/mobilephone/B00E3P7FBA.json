{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Skeptical at first but very pleased at the end.", "Author": "Naycnz", "ReviewID": "R29LM6GSAL959R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first, i was very skeptical about buying an s4 online just because of the concerns such as if the phone labeled is actually the phone itself and concerns like that. However, once i fully convinced myself that buying the s4 online would be a lot cheaper than buying it in person, i searched around amazon till i stumbled upon youngcorp. Youngcorp scared me. It frightened me because i saw that it had no stars, no reviews, nothing. It was \"newly launched\" so you have to imagine my skepticism. But i won't lie, their price for the s4, 530.00 bucks, was VERY tempting. After monitoring that price and noticing that the amount of s4's left were diminishing from 9 to 5 to 4, i quickly made a decision and decided to buy the s4 from them.I read their description of the s4 over and over, making sure that it was i9505, unlocked, purple, compatible with my carrier, and etc. and finally, i ordered it. After shipping and 4 days later, it finally came. My trepidation was over. Nothing bad happened to it; the s4 was in its wooden structured box inside a large shipping bag with bubbles. Perfect.Then once i actually got to view the s4, i noticed that the sim card size is made for micro-sized sim cards. I had the larger version of the sim card and despite that, everything was fine! My carrier provided me with a free micro-sized sim card and i was then able to play around with my phone. It's amazing! Everything's there, everything advertised online, by people, by carriers, etc. I loveee it. I'm greatly grateful to youngcorp for selling my s4 in purple at a cheap price. So thus, in the end of my lonnggg review; i rate the seller 5 stars(:", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E3P7FBA"}}
