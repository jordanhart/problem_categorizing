I find the keyboard easy to use. Slide out works fine. Also like that I can shut off backlight when done which saves battery life. As for battery, lasts a couple of days when on and being used. I plug it in at night anyway. Good basic phone for which you don't need a data plan but can use one if needed. Originally got it with 2 yr contract with Verizon.

It was supposed to be in premuim condition, yet 1-1/2 weeks into use, I have battery issues and turning off issues.  I'm sure these issues were already manifested when this person sold it.

I would however recommend the seller, cell talk, when I had a problem with my purchase, they gave me back all my monies and my shipping costs, that is standing behind their products!
