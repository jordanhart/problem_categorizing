Because I'm not a talker on the phone, if I need to call, I usually call from home which I got a great package deal from local internet provider that included unlimited long distance call, internet and cable all in one price. But I'm a high tech lover, like all the electronic gadgets, even though I don't use phone much, I wanted a good phone, but all the cell phone company provide horrible pre-pay phones, since I'm using sims card on my phone, I was looking for a good phone that is unlocked so I may have a nice phone without signing the contract. After long searching, I decided to give this phone a try. I have to say this phone works good for me, not only I can using at home where I have wi-fi to surf the internet to download my favorite wallpapers, also I upload my own music from my home computer to set as my own ring tones, I can only say I'm VERY please with this phone. By the way, I also use to input Chinese language on the key board no problem, I strongly recommend this phone if you looking for a unlocked phone especially for ladies because it's so pretty in pink:)", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Sony Xperia LT18i Pink GSM Mobile Phone\nFactory Unlocked, International Version", "Name": "Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S / LT18i (PINK) / Unlocked International Gsm Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31An6vNSdwL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006OPSU66"}}
