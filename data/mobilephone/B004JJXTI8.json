It was a hard decision but it seemed to offer all the features I wanted. But I will never know.The phone finally arrived and I called Tracphone to put the time on it, only to find out that it will not operate in my area. Why in the world would someone sell a phone to someone outside the operating area? And why is it no-one, as I was doing the research, ever mentioned it was operationally limited? I am putting these remarks here because I feel that not only the seller, but the manufacturer and Tracphone, seem incapable of communicating with each other about problems ... and they are supposed to be in the communications business.Tracphone says they are sending me a substitute. Since I have not researched it, and was very busy at the time I was prevented from activating it, I have no idea what they are sending or even if it is equivalent. All I know is once again I am without an emergency cellphone. And I am waiting for a resolution.If you are going to sell phones on the internet, please notify the potential buyer that you cannot accept his order because the phone is unusable in his area. All you have to do is set up a simple database, and run the mailing address, and drop a simple form email informing the buyer, and offer options. After all, if you want return business, you need to provide customer service.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung T155G", "Author": "A.
