{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone: Touch screen is a bit lagging", "Author": "E. Estrada \"Single Dad of 4\"", "ReviewID": "R18WTZN9EKGDDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from two different vendors to replace mine and my daughter's cell. I gave the first one (from Masterdeals) to my daughter because her old phone was really acting up. It works really well, so I ordered another from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings.The first phone has been working flawlessly for my daughter, the second phone starting acting up only a week and a half later. I called Unlocked Cell Phone Kings and they emailed me a RMA form. It took two weeks to get replacement from when I sent the defective unit back.I bought a new phone, but recieved a refurbished phone.  It \"looks\" new, but was in a plain jane box and the screen shipping protector was too big, over hanging the phone. However, this phone has worked pretty much flawlessly. The touch screen is a bit \"lagging\", but works well.Obviously, I recieved a lemon. It happens from time to time and I do not blame the seller for that.  But getting a refurb when I bought a new phone and also having to put my SIM card in youngest's phone and use it for two weeks, instead of doing an advance replacement, is why they recieve 4 stars.This phone is set up for AT&T;, but I am using it on T-mobile network. LG did not have any updates or way to reprogram the AT&T; features out. I had to work around the programming to get to the web. I never thought I would say this but Cricket's web browser is much easier and more intuative. With the Xexon browser, I have had to sit in front of my computer to find the mobile sites and manually enter the URL then save the page. And for 3G its really slow. The old cricket was 3G much faster.Also when sending text messages, this phone does not automatically convert to SMS if you only have an email address listed in your contacts. Another text message issue is that some sites (not full phone numbers) you have to enter the \"key word\" in the subject box instead of the text window for the partial number sites to register or read your message.It runs Java, but cannot read barcodes though I was able to download a free app, the phone will not allow it to access the camera. The 2MP camera has an LED flash and takes nice little low res snap shots to post on social media sites. My daughter showed me that there is a basic photo editing features to \"fix\" pic before posting them. I can even access FB (Facebook) and post updates, but I did have to set up my account and phone to talk to each other. I mostly access the weather, maps and gas prices.With all that said, this is great little texting/messaging phone with a touch screen. I like the calender, alarm clock and calculator (for calculating gas milage and cost value of food at the store).  The calculator behaves like a standard calculator.I would recommend this phone for voice, messaging and light web browsing.UPDATE 16 February 2012: Reduced rating to 3 Stars. Battery crashed/shorted out internally. Wonder if battery was a used one because replacement cell phone is only 3 months old and Battery should have lasted one year at least. Sent an e-mail message to seller. Waiting on Reply. Its a Holiday weekend (President's day) so I will give them an extra day or two.UPDATE 25 February 2012: Did not recieve any acknowledgement to the email stating battery had failed. However, recieved a replacement battery today from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings. Customer Service is not good at communicating, but they do try to \"fix the issue\". Returning rating to 4 stars.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG xenon", "Author": "awc", "ReviewID": "R1ZHUE9P6YTOT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to order a phone online, yet an unlocked one, for fear it would not work as portrayed.  This LG xenon from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings was promised to work with GSM carrier, AT&T; and T-mobile.  I have T-mobile, put in my sim card and the service was active, no problems.  Two choices to text, slide out Qwerty keyboard, or touch screen, not Qwerty. Unlock button and lock button on the side, so it doesn't dial out by accident. Automatically locks after a few seconds of no use, but you can change in settings to never lock, except manually when you decide to lock it.  Can be annoying when it constantly locks up after 15-45 seconds.  I prefer to be in charge of locking and unlocking. Many settings to change volume, choice of tones, can choose separate tones/alerts for texts vs. call coming in.This phone does not come with a car charger, which I knew, so you may want to order it along with the phone, sometimes as a package deal, and/or with a silicone cover.  It is on the slippery side like a lot of phones. The only feature I can't get to work is a picture text message.  It says push \"Get\" to download, which I did, and it will not retrieve.  I did not have data on my 7 year old dinosaur phone, and got picture messages, so not sure why a new up to date phone would not be able to retrieve a text pic message.  I will have to take that up with T-mobile to see if we can resolve this issue. Many features on this phone, just takes some getting used to as I have never had a touch phone.  It vibrates everytime you touch screen and move it, but that also can be remedied in the settings, to decrease the vibration, or do away with it.So far the only thing I don't like about the phone is when replying to a text, and when you hit send, it just goes.  My old phone would show me the number to confirm, and then I would say OK and then it would send.  I like the confirmation to make sure you are replying to the right person, but this phone just sends.I would order again from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings.  This phone arrived one day earlier than promised, and it only took 4 days from order date to arrival date. They answered all emails I had with questions prior to the actual order of the phone.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feels like a toy, Works like a phone", "Author": "Wameng Vue \"Wa_Wii\"", "ReviewID": "R38DIVS6XRKQJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was skeptic about buying this phone at first, but it has proven to be workable so far. I would recommend this phone to others, especially those who lose it easily like me. It works well, looks nice, great for txting (except when it takes forever to load), and although the camera is only 2MP the quality is really good. The touch screen is a bit unresponsive, but it's what a first generation touch screen phone should be like so no biggy. I've dropped it a few times, and it has produced a bit of a jingle when the phone vibrates, but according to other listeners, I'm the only who can hear it. Overall, this phone is good for its price.P.S. it comes with phone strap holes so that's a plus (can't find many phones nowadays with those XD)", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Okay for temporary use", "Author": "rauwolfia", "ReviewID": "R2Y0MMGQF7GAI1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone a few days back and it looks okay, just like in the pictures. I don't use a contract so I wanted an unlocked phone where I will be able to use internet and this phone fulfills that purpose. I also got this phone because I wanted QWERTY with touchscreen but its touchscreen works horribly. I have used a lot of touch screen phones before and I can claim that it has the worst touch screen ever. This phone is also not that easy to use so I can say that it's not one of the best user friendly phones. Overall I would not recommend this phone to people who wants it for a long term use. If it is used as a temporary phone with easy text, calling and internet access features then it won't be too bad for that. Also you need to buy separate headphones for this phone. It only comes with a charger and battery.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "missing buttons", "Author": "missygirl", "ReviewID": "R8I9TZF4VDN0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought a \"brand new\" phone and I got it with buttons missing on it.

Then recently I bought this phone again after loosing an evergreen phone, it was used and SUCKED. It came in an indent in the screen which sometimes prevented the touchscreen from working and the battery life which used to last for roughly 5 days was just barely making it through to 2 days (with no calls and a few texts a day). But, as for the phone itself I LOVE to text on it, the keyboard it great and I can text very fast with it and I like the way it displays the texts from one person on a thread. I also like the way the address book is set up and it is easy to find and sent multiple texts to people. Overall, pretty good phone, I recommend it to those who love to text and not much else; those who don't want the distractions of a smart phone and don't care for much except communicating with others.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "this phone is horrible", "Author": "hd415", "ReviewID": "R2JP9HKTPKTT5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when i first got this phone I was all excited. It was exactly what i wanted touch with a full keyboard. Well its like a big toy first off. i can look past that. the menu stopped working no matter what I tried, its unbelievably slow, and the short cuts on the home screen stopped working. All i can use it for is txt and calling. that's not to bad but it's irritating i cant use the calendar, or calculator, music, or even my pictures. the worst is how slow it is. I press view to see my incoming txt then put the phone down and come back rather than wait for it to finally pop up.I'm not sure if its the phone or service issues but my calls are getting dropped, I'm not receiving messages, and i don't get reception.
