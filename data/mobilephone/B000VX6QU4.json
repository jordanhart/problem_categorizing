{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The worst quality I ever had", "Author": "starr12", "ReviewID": "R3P620LKOWRXZ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this Phone because I have really good experiences with Motorola Phones before. This Phone surprised me because the body kit was already loose and it looked cheap.By that I mean that I knew that the phone won't last long and it didn't. The second thing I noticed was that the phone wouldn't charge with the charger. The only way I could charge it was with an USB cable.After 1 month the Motorola sign at the top of the phone came off too.  I also had problems hearing the caller,the call sounded muffled.I don't know if this model of phone has these problems in general or if I have been sold a bad phone. All I know is that I am very disappointed", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great device if you want a camera and mp3 with you all the time", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RVIE3FE1IZ0BV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While many people have said that they do not like this phone because of the small keys, as a female I have not found them to be too small and I have average size hands.I do text, everyday, perhaps not as often as others, but nevertheless, find the texting not to be an issue.PROSI love the camera, my phone came with a USB connector, it is so easy for me to transfer pictures.  THE FLASH is amazing!! it is so bright, i like using it as a flash lightThe mp3 player has amazing speakersI bought this phone so i would have a good camera, mp3 player all rolled into one for me.One thing i dont' like is that it won't take really big memory cards (8gb) i think its limit is 1 gb.Overall  i have been pleased i have had it for about 5 months now.  One thing i don't like is that it doesn't display the date, just the time, but that really isn't that big of a deal.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "J. Decker", "ReviewID": "R182JIIJDD8OUJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace the RAZR that my two year old destroyed.  I like the slider because it feels sturdier.  The only problems I've had have been technical - I can't log on to the internet, thereby prohibiting downloads - ringtones, games, etc.  Of course, this might be user error.Also, the keypad is smaller, making texting a bit slower as I become accustomed to the difference.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good looking, but UI needs improvement", "Author": "P.

For example, you can't even input multiple phones numbers for the same contact person. User Interface can be confusing at first.

After about a month of use the charging stopped and unless you wiggle the connection it would start charging again.  It got to the point to where the contact for the charger got messed up so I stopped using it.It is now Feb 2013, yeah been quite a while but here goes. I was unearthing some stuff from storage and came across the phone and I figured why not open it up to see if maybe contacts inside were the culprit of the phone not working.  Before going at the screws I realized that the phone had previously been opened and after i finished unscrewing it I noticed a piece of masking tape that was making an ill fated attempt at holding up some connections inside the slider.  Too bad it took me so long to realize this but it is never too late to warn people of these types of scoundrels that make money by scamming others. It totally screws it up for others, I don't even have confidence buying on Amazon as a result of this.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb quality ,Features galore1", "Author": "woods", "ReviewID": "RM7QJWSP9NJLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Motorola has a real winner with this 'slider\" phone.

The first one that I had was the best phone that I've ever owned, but after years of tough service my original phone wore our... it survived several months of sub-Saharan heat in West African, then it died. Because I love the design i replaced it twice with the same model but Motorola's quality sucks so badly that both the second and third phones just fell apart.I don't understand how a company with such a great product can allow cheap production to turn an elegant tool into a piece of junk..This is worse than a phone model with no future; this is a company with no future.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
