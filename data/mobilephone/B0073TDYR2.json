{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst phone of life", "Author": "Alexandra King", "ReviewID": "R1F7BPD5X727JB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm not the kind of mobile user who cares about data, apps, or fancy functions on my phone. I'm uninterested in iPhones and the latest 'hot' devices. Really. I just want a phone that reliably calls, texts, acts as my alarm clock and takes photos occasionally, in that order. I should also point out that I managed to avoid owning a smartphone before getting the Motorola Motoluxe, largely due to the fact I'm on a tight budget and phones feature pretty low on my priority list. Of all the phones I've owned in my life, right from my first 1998 brick starter-phone, the Motoluxe is by far the worst phone I've encountered. Amongst the features you can look forward to if you purchase this phone are the following:- It will freeze constantly, often during the middle of composing texts, where the onscreen keypad will disappear and refuse to reappear on the screen more than 2 seconds at a time- Got the fingers of a 2-month old infant? Awesome, you'll need them for the touchscreen- Don't think about charging this badboy during the night and expecting it to work the next day! It will freeze at 5:57am and your alarm will fail to go off. Every. Single. Time.- Oh yeah your battery will also die for no apparent reason, mere hours after charging it fully- Accessing your camera is clunky and slow, and accessing your photo gallery even worse. Good luck keeping that carefully selected photo of that beautiful haircut to show your hairdresser up on the screen longer than a few seconds!- Predictably, receiving texts is often unreliable. Expect to be accused of ignoring your friends.- Calculator works pretty greatThis phone is the worst. I should have stuck with my 1998 brick. FYI I got this phone in May 2013.Phone manufacturers, PLEASE design phones for longer use than 6 months. Some of us aren't planning on upgrading twice a year!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE", "Author": "twoods", "ReviewID": "R2NULDWJPBPH6T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not but after three weeks started having problems first ,signal started dropping then started cutting itself off then I hade to start taking the battery out to reset one time a day  then two times a day now two till three time at one time I hate this phone DO NOT BUY.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone!", "Author": "BigBadWolf \"Howl Often\"", "ReviewID": "R38VU23NMD8ITV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife wanted a smart phone but did not want to add anything more to our t-mobile bill.  The phone was shipped fast and really looked new to me.  I took the back off of the phone, inserted the battery, the sim card from her old Moto Krazr and a micro sd card I had laying around.  Put the back cover back on, charged the phone, and placed under the tree.  My technically challenged wife loves her new phone and has called me.  Wife's happy. ;-)", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "motoluxe", "Author": "alejandro", "ReviewID": "R241HKFSES72BM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "too disappointed stopped working 3 days after receiving was my first Motorola in 5 years I move to Samsung galaxy s3", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Robert Whichard", "ReviewID": "RGBZLGLD2USY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good phone good price.
