{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phone has everything I'd need.", "Author": "Ivan JJill", "ReviewID": "R2U1VJBNYHSNC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this phone since January 2013.I use it as a main phone.I had Samsung Ace with android before.I chose this phone because it looks better than any other Android phone with top level hardware.Samsung Galaxy S3 had plastic body, lower screen resolution and lower specks. But the price was 20% higher.Of course it was a certain risk - unknown make from China. But it was worth it.Never had problems with a phone not software nor assembly quality.Phone feels firm and solid in your hand. Only thing is that it's quite slippy, so I've ordered a cover from ebay.Flyme OS which is installed above Android is great. It has tons of helpful stuff and tricks.But still - the main advantage of this device is it's outstanding exterior. On my personal opinion it's on the same level with iPhone or iPod.I often use it as a music player, and it sounds great as well.Phone has also felt several times - on asphalt and at mall - not a scratch, no rebooting. like nothing happened.I do not regret buying this device and I still can't see competitors. I'd swap it for newest Nokia, if it'd have Android on-board.That's it.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Meizu MX2 16GB 4 CORE 1.6GHz Unlocked Smartphone 4.4\" Screen 16:10 Android 4.1\nCPU & GPU: MX5S 1.6GHz quad-core, 32nm HKMG, Adreno320\nMemory: RAM 2GB LPDDR2  , ROM 16GB\nScreen: 347PPI, 4.4 inch(New Mode2) , 1280\u00d7800(WXGA)\nNetwrk: GSM / GPRS / EDGE+ WCDMA / HSPA+, 8MP,Bluetooth 4.0 battery 1800mAh", "Name": "Meizu MX2 16GB 4 CORE 1.6GHz Unlocked Smartphone 4.4\" Screen 16:10 Android 4.1", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FcGNf6bvL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AT5O3AO"}}
