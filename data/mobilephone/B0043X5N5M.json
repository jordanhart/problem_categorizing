{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Feature Phone but No WiFi", "Author": "SirStinky", "ReviewID": "R19ZLA4TU5URR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was purchased in 2009 with a contract renewal with T-Mobile for $250 (with rebate). This is the Samsung SGH-T919 or \"Behold\" as it's known. This is the American release of the Samsung F480 Tocco handset released in the European and Asian markets.I was very impressed with this handset. I had been a faithful Motorola and LG consumer in the past, but when my fiance (now wife) got this I was so impressed that I sold my LG KU990 \"Viewty\" and got a Samsung M8800 Pixon, similar to the Behold but with an 8-MP camera and 3.2\" screen. Handling is excellent. It feels weighty in the hand and makes it easy to hold on to. It's high quality and good-looking too. It's made of metal and plastic, but feels hefty. The battery cover is made out of aluminum with a brushed finish. You can get it in different colors: espresso and rose pink.It's a TFT touchscreen \"bar\" handset. It's compact at 4.1 in. high, 2.1 in. wide, and .5 in. thick, which made it one of the most compact touch screen devices of the time. It weighs about 4 ounces.It has a 3 in. TFT touchscreen with 240x320 pixels and 256k colors. The screen is very responsive (for a resistive type screen) and has haptic feedback (small vibrations when you tap the screen). The screen has good resolution, is bright, and doesn't wash out in direct sunlight as some others did.The feature set is impressive:Quad-band GSMUMTS 2.1 GHz.HSDPA 3G 3.6 MBps. and WCDMA connectivityClass 10 EDGE 2GFull QWERTY virtual keyboard with predictive text input/T9, alphanumeric input.Accelerometer for auto-rotate portrait/landscape modesHaptic feedback vibrationMP3 polyphonic downloadable ringtones1000 entry phonebook with photocalling capabilityMicroSD card capability up to 8GBA2DP V. 2.0 BluetoothUSB V. 2.0MIDP Java 2.0 compatibility5 MP camera with autofocus, dual LED flashQVGA video recordingFull HTML supported Web browserWAP 2.0/xHTMLMultimedia player plays MP3, MP4, WMA, WMV, AAC, and WAV formatDocument viewer Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Adobe PDF filesDigital organizer, calendar, voice recording/memoand a lot more...This phone isn't a \"smartphone\" so you won't get a full email client with Outlook or document editor software or other features, but you do get a great multimedia device that will do just about everything you want it to do. the 5 MP camera takes great pictures with a lot of color, clarity, and details. Macros are also good. You get a great user interface for the camera functions with a ton of adjustable functions. You get a digital zoom, autofocus, multiple scene modes (sport, night, and others you'll find on a digital camera). However, low-light shots are very noisy and the flash overexposes them (it's too powerful at close range, which is what it's meant for). Videos are good enough to be useable, but don't expect much. This isn't D1 video recording.Texting is very easy and fun because the screen is sensitive and the keyboard is large and well laid-out. The full HTML Web browser with 3.6mbps 3G is one of the Behold's highlights and it works great. Web pages loaded fast, but there's no Flash support and the interface is less than smooth. The media player is simple and easy to use, but it's hampered by the lack of a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. You get Samsung's proprietery jack with an adaptor for a 3.5mm jack. There's no MicroUSB jack either. You use a supplied cable with Samsung's own connector.The user interface is Samsung's TouchWhiz, which gives you customizable Widgets that can be accessed from a pop out sidebar or by dragging them onto the \"desktop.\" It's a good UI, but it limited by its lack of customization. Thanks to Java 2.0 support, games worked great and there are a lot to choose from on T-Mobile's T-Zones.So there it is in a nutshell. After 2 years of use and abuse (went for a swim in a toilet the camera died but everything works great!) this is still a great phone. It's durable, high quality Samsung hardware with useful and practical features.The only gripes I have is the lack of WiFi connectivity (a BIG one in my book), the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, and a bigger screen.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "easy to use", "Author": "Theresa Zielinski", "ReviewID": "RQUB5J6EHSI4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "sleek and stylish phone very easy to use. only problem is when receiving pics it warns of roaming charges if i continue. im not getting charged but its a bit annoying.great camera and easy to use if you prefer an uncomplicated devices as i do.all in all good phone for the price.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Behold T919", "Author": "DJackson", "ReviewID": "R1BVTUO7722BF9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recieved my phone rather fast was very excited about that but once i turned the phone on and started playing with it it would power off than would turn back on so i contacted the seller and he offered to send me a new battery I have emailed the seller a number of times sence than and have heard nothing from them the phone now will not turn on what so ever i am very upset with the product and more so with the seller I would not recommend this product nor the seller to anyone.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS!", "Author": "Nichole", "ReviewID": "R1UQFWC0V6L4ZI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone in speedy time none the less i'm not impressed...This phone says it's unlocked but really it's not...now i'm stuck with a phone that is not unlocked and t-mobile nor att will unlock it...I'm also stuck with the accessories...Don't buy this item or any item from OEM...They're nothing but liers...I thought this phone was a good buy but after this i'm never buying anything from amazon again. these guys are nothing buy rip off artists...They'll sell you a phone alright but it won't be unlocked!", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be warned, this is NOT a durable Phone", "Author": "T.

Seriously the phone started turning off the first day I got it an the screen freezes sometimes. by the way the phone doesn't come with a memory card but I had one an when I put it in at first it worked but the second day it started forgetting the songs on the memory card so you have to restart your phone to listen to your music each time it stops working.

The keyboard does work quite well, but certain buttons/controls/widgets on the far left do not react to input coordinates correctly and often result in the wrong letter being hit on.The overall user-interface (UI) is very slow and many the important customizations like putting shortcuts (which they call \"widgets\") on the home screen just are not available.This is a prepaid phone that works on T-Mobile, the cheapest pay-as-you-go plan around I have come across, and it does feature GPS with a program called Telenav (which is not entirely free). The Telenav GPS Navigator is basically a road map system that is NOT suitable for real-time driving situations. It features address lookup, favorites storage, and 2D/3D maps which can follow you as you walk (not drive or even if you are a passenger/navigator, because it is just too slow). It also requires a paid contract subscription to work, the free version only has map and GPS no route plotting.There are customizable ring tones for calls and text messages, with 5 different \"sound profiles\"; normal, silent, vibration, vehicle, and outdoor. You can customize both calls and text message ring tones separately from sounds files (mp3's) from your computer/memory card.E-Mail support is nearly non-existent, none of the carriers work and dosen't even support basic POP3 or any of the more useful carriers. Prepaid plans on T-Mobile also do not support data so e-mail is even more out of reach.The 5MP camera took terribly noisy and blurry shots, this is one of the worst cameras I have come across. It also did not have manual white-balance setting, and color temperature matching seemed to be one of its biggest weaknesses.It does have a (rather long 1 second sustaining) flash to help in dark situations (which is virtually all indoor situations) an even then it produces a radial gradient highlight in the center of the picture and does not look like a true flash/strobe on the picture..It also uses a proprietary USB cable to connect to your computer, and you have to buy that separately. The phone also has no on-board memory, you must buy a separate Micro SD memory card. The memory card also can not be unmounted/ejected without turning the phone off, removing the cover, removing the battery first.You can play audio MPEG layer 3 mp3's, h264 or MPEG-4 videos in mp4 containers and swf flash videos, but not flash games. All videos must be 320x240 resolution or smaller and the accompanying audio stream must be in AAC encoding (not MPEG layer 3 or anything else).Physical-wise, the body of the camera looked very cheap, almost like a disposable sardine can, it does come in a few metallic colors in addition to black. I got the rose pink one. The edges are kind of slippery, which makes the whole \"Beholding\" process kind of tricky, you may want to get a rubber/tacky case grip.There is an embedded latch in the body for a leash/lanyard, which I like, but I didn't like the latch being in the corner.The USB input is also proprietary, which means you have to buy a Samsung T919 USB cable if you want to connect it to a computer or any device with USB input. The phone does support Bluetooth as an alternative, but no WIFI.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Phone", "Author": "william cardinali", "ReviewID": "R3CDUNBPIK4D6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is not a smart phone, this is a wanabe smart phone, and it failed miserably.

I realized I wasn't getting anywhere with the seller, so I set out to purchase the unlock code, for which some info is required besides the make and model and the IMEI # available from the phone, namely the name of the carrier the phone is currently locked to which only the sewhich an supply, which by the way seems to be a touchy subject since so far I have not heard from them again which makes me suspicious of the origin of these phones, although branded Samsung but made in china.

I am surprised that Amazon hasn't pulled the plug on this seller, since I noticed others voicing the same complaint about some of their phones not being unlocked.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy for a great phone!", "Author": "Silvia", "ReviewID": "RR0TU3TM9TKWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so glad that I found someone who still sells this phone!I am extremely happy with my purchase!Phone was brand new, I didn't see a USB to connect the phone to the computer tho, bummer!", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not impresed", "Author": "Starsky", "ReviewID": "RCWYBXVZ771CI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked this product when I read the reveiw on line but, when I got it was not all that.
