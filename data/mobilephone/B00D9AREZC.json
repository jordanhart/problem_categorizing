{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Phone! Truly Flagship", "Author": "GamerGuy", "ReviewID": "R2GKBO5BNE5D6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon because they, for some miraculous reason, sold me this phone brand new for $317. How, I don't know, considering retail on Virgin's website is $399. The point I'm trying to get across is if Amazon drops the price of this phone substantially, believe that it is no scam. It's just flat-out generosity.Now, on to the phone.Even though I had large savings on this device, it is well worth it even if you pay full price. I came from an HTC Evo 3D which I thought was a fantastic, capable device, but there truly is a difference between a flagship and non-flagship. The Evo had great specs, despite being non-flagship, both on paper and performance-wise, and on a scale of 1 to 10, I would gladly put it at an 8.5 or 9. However, this Galaxy is a 12 on that same scale. It really stands out as a true flagship because of its performance and build quality. This phone is plastic vs. the Evo's half metal/half rubberized plastic build but I still appreciate the Galaxy's build quality more. The phrase, \"you get what you pay for\" could never be more true than here. This phone is unparalleled on the Virgin selection, as of the time of this review. I can only see it bested by the Galaxy S4 or Note 2, but surprisingly, not by much. Plus, let's remember this is a no-contract device on a $35/month plan. Unbeatable.The ProcessorThis Galaxy is not the Galaxy S3 i9300 version (international quad-core 1.4GHz version, 1GB RAM). This is the US version (dual core 1.5GHz version, 2GB RAM). I haven't had the international version so I can't make a comparison, but I can say that this processor is extremely capable, unsurprisingly. You will not notice lag, even if you intentionally open a lot of apps to test its performance. Everything, including all transitions, are smooth 99% of the time, which is pleasant to the eye and makes it a competitor with iPhone's fluidity when it comes to operating systems. The processor will easily handle all games on the market, photo editing apps, etc. It will handle anything the hardcore or simple user will demnd because this phone was made to multi-task, hence, the multi-window feature, a feature you'll have to explore when you purchase this phone. I think the processor helps a lot with the internet as well. I put my Evo and Galaxy on 3G and tested the speeds in loading videos and webpages. On the same 3G network, the Galaxy bested the Evo significantly every time. Bottom Line: Fully capable, fast processor.CameraWhat can I say? It has an 8MP sensor and acts as such. I can't make comparisons because this is the first phone I've had with an 8MP camera, but I can say that from 5MP on the Evo to 8MP on the Galaxy, there is a big clarity difference. Obviously the Galaxy's camera would be better, but I've always thought the Evo had a great camera for only being 5MP. Still though, the Galaxy's 8MP does the job. Very nice, crisp, clear pictures, good low-light performance, vibrant colors. First phone that has truly allowed me to leave my point-and-shoot at home. Favorite feature (even though there are tons of awesome features, such as Burst Shot & Panorama): Zero shutter lag. The camera is so fast!GamingLike I said before, no problems. Run Asphalt or some other heavy game and it'll perform well. P.s. Graphics look fantastic. 306 ppi screen is quite impressive.BatteryOkay, important topic here to many users. From my Evo to this Galaxy, the battery life of this Galaxy is far superior. However, I know that some others may not find this battery that great if they compare it to other devices with better batteries or simply because they are heavy users and the Galaxy barely lasts a day with them. However, for me, the average user (I chat on Messenger almost all day, so internet is always on, the occasional texting and picture taking, sometimes need GPS Navigation, occasional web search) I found the battery to be just fine. It lasted me all day, plus, it actually charges pretty quickly. And this while I had a live wallpaper. This battery should be fine for almost all average users, but if not, invest in a slim extended battery. No big deal.Call Quality/NetworkNo problems whatsoever with texting or calling, I always seem to have a signal and 3G service that isn't drastically slow. The 3G is fine, but I'm still excited for 4GLTE coming to my city this year. The call quality was great, there's a feature that amplifies the voice volume. Other people were clear to me, and I was clear to them. No issues.MemoryYou get approximately 11GB usable internal memory out of the 16GB capacity. Fine with me. Evo only gave me 1GB usable space out of the 4GB capacity.OSTouchWiz didn't bother me. I actually like it and all the transitions, better than HTC Sense. But that's a personal preference issue.Bottom LineSo I think I've covered all the essentials people need to know to decide if they should buy the phone. The price, undiscounted, is high, yes, but personally I find the investment well worth it. It'll keep a user satisfied for 1 to 2 years until the Galaxy 7 or whatever comes out. If you need more info on the device, I suggest searching the internet since this is a popular device. Many reviews out there.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Recommended phone and service provider", "Author": "Aces and 8s", "ReviewID": "RJCXH0UQY0J37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So since this ad listing is for the Galaxy S3 on Virgin Mobile, I am going to rate the phone and the provider. I moved to Virgin from Verizon, tired of paying $$$$ for data, messaging, and minutes (which I hardly use). The $35 plan with Virgin is great, 300 minutes (more than enough for me) with unlimited data and messaging. I was skeptical at first, but now I am a believer. Since Virgin uses the Sprint towers, I get reception in all the same places my Verizon phone would, granted I don't have 4G in the same spots, but I hardly used 4G before because it killed my battery life. If you're thinking of switching to Virgin, I say give it a shot.On to the phone, the Galaxy S3. Awesome. I upgraded from an HTC Rezound which was a great phone when released, but it started showing its age. Granted the S3 was released some time ago as well, and the new S4 is available, but not on Virgin. For my uses and purposes, the S3 works well. The AMOLED screen is vibrant and crisp, the speaker is great, the phone feels solid (for plastic), and the battery life is decent enough. I can get about 16 hours of heavy use out of it before it dies (messaging, internet, streaming, gaming, etc). If I don't use the phone much during the day, the battery last all day, and then some. The Virgin model comes with a lot of unneeded apps which can't be deleted, but that is to be expected. That said, the \"bloat ware\" was much less than what Verizon forces on their customers. I haven't encountered any glaring issues with the phone, but will update if I do. So far, 5 stars for Virgin and the Galaxy S3.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samung Galaxy S3", "Author": "G. Book \"Biomedical engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R29LFK4PU8VFR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy S3 is awesome. No complaints whatsoever.A little background: I got my very first smart phone last fall, which was the Kyocera Rise, through Virgin Mobile. It was a great change from the LG nV2 I had before that. During my childhood the rotary phones in people's homes were still leased from AT&T; and no one had a computer in their house. After resisting for so long to get a smart phone I got that Kyocera last year. It was great at first, but I learned to do much more with it than just check my gmail and use the web browser. And so the Kyocera got slower and slower... and that's when I decided to get something better.The Galaxy S3 is the best phone I have used. Compared to rotaries, payphones, and the Kyocera Rise, it's the best. Call quality is excellent. It's fast. No lag at all. I used to wait up to a minute for the Phone keypad to show up on the Kyocera, which was irritating because I'd assume the ability to call people would be the most important feature of the phone... But after loading all my applications onto the Galaxy S3, I still had no lag, everything was fast.Display: The display is amazing. You cannot see any pixels. It's bright, there's really no glare. I've read reviews that say the screen is dull or dark. I didn't see that at all. Maybe they turned on the auto-brightness. Even in bright sun, I can still read the screen just fine. Also, having a 4.8\" display is great.Speed: The speed is incredible. The GUI is fast, and as I mentioned many times, no lag. You touch a control on the screen, and something happens immediately.Calling: Call quality is great.Size: It has a huge screen, but its light. It's much lighter than the Kyocera. As a person who always preferred the heavy handsets of the old phones, having a larger cell phone feels more appropriate to talk on. It's a strange preference, but I find it easier to talk on something where the speaker and microphone are actually near my ear and mouth.Battery: battery life is fine. its comparable to the Kyocera. I notice the worst battery drain at work where I barely have a signal, so its always burning power to boost the radio. But I have a charger there, so who cares.Camera: It's great. Better than the first digital camera I had. It won't replace the DSLR, but it does replace a point-and-shoot camera when going places with the kids. The panorama, HDR, and other features are great. Plus its fast. Did I mention the Kyocera was SLOW. I'd often wait so long for the camera app to load that what I wanted to take a picture of had changed. Colors are vibrant too.Network: We don't have 4G LTE is my area yet, so I'm stuck with 3G and wifi, but they work fine for me until Sprint rolls out the LTE here.Overall: It's excellent. Seeing that the S4 is only a marginal improvement in hardware specs over the S3, I feel confident that the S3 will not become outdated for a while. I'd absolutely recommend it. I was also able to get it on sale for $319. I noticed that Virgin Mobile has random 1-day sales on the S3 on their site, and thankfully Amazon mimics those sales.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price I LOVE IT!", "Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "R1S6DIVUUJJFA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best investment for a prepaid phone! I have had many of crappy Androids with old systems and old query slide keyboards in my time. This is the Mother ship of great investments! I pay $45 a month for unlimited texts and 300ish minuets. I use my WIFI connection mostly when I am at home and get to enjoy my radio/music apps when I am at work.This phone doses it all. I have opened over 30+ applications at the same time and it still ran like a champ. Now mind you I have a 16 GB micro SD card within this phone so it runs a tad bit faster than everything. But I am a serious gamer when it comes to apps between my racing games, candy crush, fashion story, the Sims, e-mail, music and YouTube this phone can handle it all!Super-fast, slim, pretty, and well worth the money. I hear a lot of people complain with the battery power. Here are my tips in order to handle that. I let my battery drain till it\u2019s almost at 1-10% battery left and then charge it. I fully charge it until it\u2019s at 100% guaranteeing me good usage for most of the day. If I uses this constantly for YouTube or Music all day expect your battery to drain faster than normal. I dim the brightness whenever I can in order to save my eyes from frying and save power. I turn off the GPS capability unless I need to use my Google maps or navigation. I use my WIFI connection whenever I can. I make sure the lock screen comes on within 15 seconds of not touching the phone and turn off some system options in order to save the battery.I have purchased a case and a screen protector so the phone is mint highly reccomend doing this. I also carry around with me the included USB charger cable to charge my phone just in case I need to. It uses a standard android charger. The box that I received is the typical Virgin Mobile box, comes with a phone, usb charger, electricity plug, and instructions. I did not see a 2GB micro SD card so make sure you get one or a higher GB card if you a gamer/music nerd like I am.Make sure you register and turn on/activate the service on your phone before you start downloading and registering your phone for everything. I made the mistake of starting games on my apps and then got my service activated had to restart and reset the phone and lost everything. Great gift for anyone or for yourself! Hope this review helps you out! I truly enjoy this phone =)", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great in some ways. Not so much in others.", "Author": "B. Elmore", "ReviewID": "RS7UCHKNLCO39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I noticed that Amazon was selling this phone for the same price as Virgin Mobile on their web site. At the time of my purchase (which I believe has changed or soon will), I saved the cost of sales tax by purchasing it here. However, in the end, it cost me more because Virgin Mobile's $70 bonus for new subscribers only applies if you purchase the phone directly from them :(For the most part, I like the phone. Android is smooth and runs well on its hardware. It's a huge step up from my LG Optimus V, in almost every conceivable way. The resolution of the 720p display is more than adequate. I really wonder if a 1080p display is just overkill (I did try out a HTC One briefly although I didn't compare them side by side). That said, the display is one of the phone weaknesses. By default (in auto), it's generally too dim. Worse, it's more or less completely unviewable in direct sunlight. It literally appears almost black. In the shade of tree cover or in a car, it's fine. I wouldn't consider this a deal breaker however, since I'm not certain any phone performs particularly well in direct sunlight (maybe the iPhone?).I've read many reviews comparing the S3 and S4 with the HTC One. Almost every reviewer praises the build quality of the HTC One while bashing the Samsungs. If this is weighing heavily on your decision when comparing these phones, I'd recommend that you watch some of the videos showing a tear down of the HTC One. I'll summarize it for you. Any kind of user repair of the HTC One (such as broken glass or battery replacement) is impossible. With the S3 the opposite is true. IMO, the build quality criticisms are grossly overstated. True, the S3 is made of plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap to me at all.I've used the S3 as a GPS using the app, Oruxmaps, and it works wonderfully. The GPS appears to be accurate when I compare my recorded tracks with the routes that I used when planning my hikes. If I put the phone in airplane mode while on my hikes (I'm outside of cell range anyway), I've had no issues with the battery lasting the entire day with the GPS tracking my every step.The most significant complaint that I have with the S3 is its camera. In a word, it stinks. It might take decent shots when your subject is bathed in abundant direct sunlight, but it yields terribly blurred photos otherwise. On my hiking trips, I've used the camera to record photo waypoints of camping sites, etc. In general, these photos lack anything like the detail you'd expect from an 8M camera, given they were photographed in the middle of a sunny day (but under the canopy of the forest).Because of the camera, if there was a better phone option for Virgin Mobile, I might be returning this phone. If you can overlook this weakness, you'll likely be very happy with the S3.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Phone!!... Lives Up To The Hype and Then Some", "Author": "A. Silva", "ReviewID": "R363KW42A11QOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone absolutely rocks!  Let me just say that first and foremost, this phone just flat out works well and has had no real problems so far.  The initial activation of the new phone was easy/quick and it has worked flawlessly from day one for me. After coming from an HTC EVO 4G, the Galaxy S3 beats it in every way and by a wide margin and I couldn't be happier with it at the moment.  I used to have a lot of issues with network connectivity, reception, and dropped/lost text messages on both of my previous Virgin Mobile phones and I have not encountered any of that with the S3.  The Galaxy S3 has improved cell and 3G reception in comparison to my previous phone, particularly in locations where my old phone would struggle such as in my basement or other low-reception areas.  The real-world coverage useability is improved to the point that it is now somewhat close to what Sprint/Virgin's coverage map says it should be both in terms of LTE, 3G, and Voice range.  The LTE speed is a remarkable upgrade from 3G and is functionally almost the same as using a broadband WIFI network. The new Android 4.3 Operating System is faster, smoother, and much more intuitive from a users perspective than its predecessor and just generally offers you features that you want in a mobile Operating System such as a built-in power-saving mode, the option to choose between a simple Desktop (for a novice) or the more complex desktop(for the more experienced Android user), as well as the ability to multitask using the floating and configurable pop-out taskbar.  The screen is big, bright, clear (720P) and generally awesome while the sound output from the speakers is above average and automatically switches from front to rear for you if you place the phone down on the table while playing music.  The Galaxy S3 takes gorgeous pictures with the rear-facing camera as well as having an abundance of useful camera modes such as \"Panoramic Mode\" and \"Burst Mode\", and the zoom feature is very easy to use.  The processor and phone responsiveness in general is very snappy with very little delay in processing webpages or bringing up and switching between apps. This phone has also never encountered the infamous \"hanging text message\" problem that used to regularly plague all Virgin-Mobil EVO 4G owners as well as a few other older VM phones. The S3 is surprisingly thin and lightweight in comparison to other modern phones on the market.  The GPS and built-in navigation software seems to work much better than my previous phone and my friend's phones and I'm easily able to navigate the city on foot amidst tall skyscrapers without the phone getting confused and losing track of where I am(works just as well in a car too).  The Samsung Galaxy S3 also lets you browse the internet while talking on the phone regardless of whether you are connected to the internet by 3G, LTE, or WIFI.... which is pretty rare for Sprint/VM devices and is a huge bonus.Battery life could be better, but it's not bad in comparison to other phones out there of similar size and performance specs. I can mostly get through 2 full days on a single charge with light to moderate use (not much talk, mostly web browsing and texting with some MP3 playing) and GPS turned off/low-screen brightness,black desktop wallpaper, and the built-in power-saving mode engaged(except for CPU-throttling).  There is minimal bloatware installed on Virgin Mobile's version of the S3 from the factory in comparison to many other devices on the market from other providers.  It comes with 16GB of internal storage of which you will have about 12 GB usable to you from the factory (the rest is used by the Operating System/drive-formatting and preinstalled applications).  The Galaxy S3 is also one of the few remaining phones that supports an add-on MicroSD card that you can use to expand your available storage capacity, but do your research before buying just any old card because there are some known compatibility issues with certain brands of SD Cards (as well as SD-card format types... recommend formatting any new card to FAT32) and Samsung Galaxy S3 phones.And now for a few minor negatives about the Galaxy S3.... I would have preferred the home button be a soft button instead of a physical button because I always worry that these things will wear out(never actually had this happen though)... especially on a phone that I purchased outright and plan to hang on to for a few years, but you can install free aftermarket apps to give you a transparent on-screen home button to help account for this.  It would also be nice if it had infrared Transmitter (for remote controlling TV's) as some of the other cutting edge phones have, but this isn't too important in the grand scheme of things.  Virgin Mobile also does not provide Mobile Hotspot capability using 3G or LTE even though the phone is physically capable of supporting it.  Virgin Mobile should have offered the S3 in black instead of just the white faceplate/backplate version. Samsung/Virgin Mobile should also include a better set of default ringtones and notifications to choose from, because I could not find anything that was loud or attention grabbing from the default list (easily rectified by making or downloading your own sounds). Some people would also prefer that a phone have an external camera button, which this phone does not, but this is a personal preference thing.As with any modern phone, MAKE SURE YOU GET A CASE AND SCREENPROTECTOR FOR IT IMMEDIATELY!  This thing will get destroyed if you drop it, as many people can attest to, so do the wise thing and protect your investment with a high-quality case (I recommend the Ballistic SG Case) and screen protector.This phone overall is a phenomenal deal for the money when you consider all that you are getting with this package compared to what others are paying for phones and monthly plans from competitors and it really improves the quality of service that you are getting from Virgin Mobile's network in comparison to some of their older phones.  The Galaxy S3, in my opinion, is the phone to get right now if you're using Virgin Mobile. With a few minor modifications to the default configuration that you can do yourself in a matter of minutes, this is a nearly perfect phone.Hats off to Samsung for engineering such an amazing phone and and to Virgin Mobile for bringing it to us and at a reasonable price.Pros:-Phone just flat out works great-Huge screen and slim/lightweight chassis-Smooth and stable Android 4.3 operating system-Fast processor/fast app loading-Great cell/data/LTE reception for Virgin Mobile-Supports micro-SD cards-Very little bloatware-Adequate battery life-Supports Virgin's LTE network-Can talk and use mobile internet at the same timeCons:-No mobile hotspot feature-Only comes in white, home button is a physical vs soft button-Poor default ringtone/notification sound selection (easy to fix by downloading your own)-No external camera button-No infrared transmitter-Easily damaged screen/exterior --> GET A CASE IMMEDIATELY AFTER BUYING THE PHONE!!", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better that the II", "Author": "Lorrie Rutter", "ReviewID": "R1VL39OSBPQOG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Samsung Galaxy II and I constantly had problems with it freezing up on me and draining the battery before the day was out even though I didn't make calls most of time. the S III is much quicker and sleeker and the battery doesn't drain as fast as the S II.

Both completely different networks but with very similar devices (practically identical, mind you - networks were still different) and I was pleased with both devices.Why I'm going to immediately give this a 5/5, is the fact that it comes preinstalled with the most up to date that Samsung has to offer on the device. I didn't have Multi-Window or the extra nice shooting modes (like Best Face! C'mon, samsung! I probably would have kept the S3's in the past if I had Best Face mode then! I have a 3 year old, after all). And the rest of it is because of the obvious - the very reason you're looking at the phone.1.) it's a proven quality handset2.) call quality and speakerphone quality set the bar at the time of the S3's release - S3 is better than my iPhone 5 was.3.) the screen, it's a 4.8\" screen with 720x1280 resolution4.) the software; albeit taken with a grain of salt, TouchWiz has user friendly options such as an easy way to increase the FONT size. My father with farsighted vision is thankful for this!5.) LTE network on a no contract and unlimited data plan - so what if after 2.5GB of usage it's throttled speeds - it's UNLIMITED. Plus, on my personal 3GB (limited) data plan, I get charged a lot extra to keep my same speed. I'd rather have unlimited amount and have the reduced speed than have to pay more to keep my current speed. My opinion, YMMV.6.) expandability - the S3 has such a good track record and is essentially up top with stupid iDevices in the kingdom of Smartphones and you can get any accessory under the sun for this thing.And overall: it's still a very viable smartphone. Dual-Core Snapdragon 1.5GHz processor with 2GB of RAM running Android Jelly Bean, you are on a smooth and pleasant experience from the time you turn the phone on to the time you turn it off.

I'm not going to write detailed review of all the pros & cons as that has been done, but this is by far the best & smoothest running smartphone I have ever owned, and at the present time the best phone on VM, by far Sorry Apple fans, even though VM has the IPhone 5S, this phone beats it by a mile, and also has expandable memory as well as a removable battery, 2 things which Apple refuses to include on any of their phones, even though they have been standard on most other smartphones for years. This is apparently because they have not figured out a good way to increase profits by including them(without seeming too obvious i.e. their lightning cable). I won't ever buy another Apple product again anyway. The manipulative way they conduct business, and the methods they use, in an attempt to control & profit over as much of the entire ownership period as possible, seems as though it should be more apparent to a larger number of people. I digress though.The S3 very rarely, if ever acts \"buggy\" like all of my past phones have on a fairly regular basis. It is very intuitive to use on a basic level, which will be fine for most people. But, there are also so many other useful features that you should explore.

I hope I don't get Carpel Tunnel.  The other problem with the home button is the lag issue that others have mentioned.

Great battery life.LG Optimus Elite:  Fantastic value for an android phone.  I was grandfathered on the $25 a month plan so I held on to this one for a while.Now for my Samsung Galaxy S3:  Spectacular screen.  Smooth screen transitions.  Average battery life.  LTE performance is great now that sprints Network Vision is rolling out (great time to \"get in\").  Camera is very good (much better than my Optimus Elite) but probably not as good as Iphone 5. Phone is a bit slippery and this is a bit tough for me since i prefer my phones \"naked\".  I'll just have to deal though and hope the gorilla glass screen will give me adequate protection in case I get a bout of the dropsies.  Wifi performance is good.  It is noticeably faster surfing web pages vs my optimus elite.  Not sure if it is speed increase over wifi, or just that the phone can render so much faster.I have absolutely NO regrets for buying.  I have only had it for a few days, but I am glad I chose this over the much more expensive Iphone 5 through virgin.  Even if they were the same price, I would have still taken the S3 based on screen size and configurability over iOS.

While not quite as sleek as Siri, the S Voice search and commands worked pretty good when i tested it. Results were produced really quick and the device had absolutely no issue in picking up my exact commands spoken by word.Basically you just open S Voice via the icon and say \"Hi Galaxy\" then proceed with a question or command. \"open facebook\" or \"play music - Lenny Kravitz\" and the S Voice will open the folder and ask you what song you want to hear from that artist. OR you can ask something like \"what is the weather like in London England?\" and a weather page will open with graphical details and information.Overall, VERY impressive. I tested it fairly thoroughly when i first got my phone and it rarely ever came up with an error or issue.Using the phone itself presented the fairly similar Android Jelly Bean experience with Sony's few additions but overall very familiar to the other flagship devices on other carriers.  Loads of customization options and a plethora of app store apps to load up on the phone. Also, plenty of space on the hard drive for apps AND you can actually save apps to the sd card. (up to 32gb micro sd cards expansion) All that allows you to load your phone UP on all the apps you want.If you cant afford the newly released Galaxy S5 on Virgin Mobile, then DEFINITELY buy this phone instead.

Since this is my first smart phone, I had some difficulty choosing a phone from the ones on sale but finally settled on a known brand, Samsung.For reference, Mrs. Spudman has an LG Venice phone and almost all of my tutoring students own iphones. To help me learn how to get around the phone, I picked the brains of my students , read the Samsung owner's manual ( printed  from a download), and read a Kindle book about the Galaxy.The biggest learning tool was simple experimentation and exploration of the buttons and features.Sound - I think the sound is good, just as good as our landline phone's sound. The speaker feature works well, the clarity depending on the phone and the human on the other end. Music played on the phone is acceptable quality; music played from the phone on bluetooth speakers is excellent.Display - Very clear and richly colored display that compares well with the phones of others. It's very easy to read text on the phone, and photo displays are terrific.I've rarely texted before buying this phone because my generic phones didn't have keyboards. It's still a challenge for me to hit the tiny keys on this phone, but voice commands to text are very convenient.The camera is far better than I expected and some of the photos taken are as good as those taken with my stand alone camera. You'll need to download a photo editing ap. Some excellent programs are available. My favorite is Pho.to Lab Pro. It's a full featured, easy to use, powerful program that'll cost you only a few dollars. The free version has annoying ads, so I quickly got the pay version.The battery life is OK. It lasts me an entire day even with moderate use. I have noticed that battery life has improved since the first couple days I started using the camera.I especially have fun using the voice controls: dictating text messages, asking the phone questions, giving it commands, telling it when to take a picture, and even telling it when to answer or reject a call. The phone even reads text messages aloud to me when they come in.Bottom line - I like this phone quite a bit, and even many iphone owners are impressed with its features and large display. I wouldn't want a smart phone with a smaller display.Note - The Aduro Shell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy is terrific, protecting the Galaxy on both sides and all around.

I previously had an LG Optimus Slider.  I am not a smart phone maven so there won't be a lot of content here for people who really use their phone to the utmost, I'm just a common phone user.It is thin, light and slick, get a case or drop insurance.I use mine as an ebook, I moved my memory card over taking my books with it and have added a few since.  I use FB reader and really enjoy the reading experience on this fantastic screen.  Web access is very quick compared to 3G, pages load fast enough to not be annoying.  I am sure that as phones get faster web pages will get busier and slower so we will all be motivated to upgrade, but for now hitting the news sites is quick and painless.  I read for hours a day, this phone makes it effortless to the point that I cleaned off my Kindle Fire HD and gave it to my wife.If you read one handed the back button (bottom right) takes some time to get used to, I keep hitting it by accident.  I seem to hit it with the meat of the base of my thumb pretty often while reading.Lots of apps and lots of network activity.  Various Google apps used 17% of my bandwith so far, more than the Android OS or even my surfing.  Everything wants to update.  Update early, update often.  Google seems to auto update, the rest at least ask.  I'm still working on the app settings and I may well remove a number of items when I know more about what they are, what they do and why or why not I should want them.  As it comes there are three pages of apps.Camera is great, I use it for fun and to record pages of parameters on machine tools, part numbers to order replacements etc, so far every shot has been clear and easy to make out details.  Sticking a phone inside the back of an electrical cabinet to get a picture of the part number laser etched on a PC board is a real test, poor lighting, limited access, dirt and grime.

The S3 just feels much more modern than the S2 - the S3 was released only a year after the S2 but it just feels leaps ahead of the S2 (faster, slimmer, lighter, better looking, better screen, more accessories, etc).I can't say about service and dropped calls because that depends on your coverage.

This killed two birds with one stone- I got a device that had 4G LTE, a better camera, and USB OTG (which I covet for purely business reasons, of course) and my wife got a phone with a front facing camera and better signal strength. For a pretty long time I was seriously considering the Galaxy Victory and S2 instead. Both are significantly cheaper than the S3 (as of now $200 vs $340+) and smaller. They are undoubtedly the two next best Android handsets in Virgin's lineup, but I decided against them for the following reasons:Victory: Spotty USB OTG support, camera shutter delay.S2: No LTE, No Jellybean without root.Don't get me wrong, both of those are nice devices, but I decided these features were important enough to me to pay a bit extra for something that had no obvious deficiencies. You'll have to see for yourself and determine what feature set vs. cost you want- it's worth doing some research since none of them are cheap. I'll readily admit if the Virgin S2 was an LTE handset, I'd have chosen it without a second thought, but alas it isn't. That said, I'm very pleased with my S3- it really is a handset without comparison in the Virgin Android lineup, and arguably better than any of the iPhones to boot.Package design is a very slender body, though a bit on the wide and tall side. It has a physical home key flanked by a menu and back softkey. Volume buttons are on the left top, power on the right top. I like the physical home key as it's easier to activate by touch and doesn't require the screen to be on to work. On both my old Android phones, you had to wake up the screen to even see the home key, since it was part of the UI. Double-pressing this also activates S-voice, which can take most simple commands. Overall the phone feels very light for its size and feels almost TOO light when you hold it. For a while I thought it was lighter than my old EVO V, but when I actually compared them it turns out they're about the same. The S3 just feels lighter because it's wider and taller. I should also note though that it's razor thin, and when combined with the smooth plastic back I was actually scared I might miss my pocket someday when putting it back in. You can hardly feel it going into a pants pocket- that's how thin and smooth the surface is. I got a snap-on shell for it immediately to remedy this.The hardware is robust and very responsive. This is the dual-core version of the S3, not quad, but it's really quite sufficient. It's rounded out with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB onboard storage (expandable with SD). The 1.5ghz Snapdragon is very noticeably more powerful than the older-gen 1.2ghz in the EVO V. The GPU renders 3D handily and the handset can easily run any Android game you can throw at it. They look great as well, on the excellent and large SuperAMOLED screen. Of special note are the cameras, which have amazing quality and near-instant shutter speed. These are the fastest and crispest Android handset cameras I've seen- in fact, I think they're even better than any of the iPhone cameras. You can shoot in all the same modes as the aforementioned iPhone, including panoramic and burst. The front-facing camera is surprisingly good quality too. Either way, it is a huge huge improvement over the EVO V, which had a good sensor but such a bad delay that you often missed shots or just got a huge blur. LTE speed is superb when you're in coverage zone- fast enough to stream HD video, and the signal is very strong- gets even through some double story buildings I've been in, whereas the old 4G WiMax or 3G would get nothing. Due to the beefy hardware, realtime apps like Maps navigation work very well- no more missing turns because it didn't know you were there! Call quality is great, and the speakers have some serious power to them- even if you're hard of hearing this should be no problem. Battery life kind of varies depending on what features you have on but is generally very acceptable for an Android handset- I can easily go a whole day on one charge, even though I usually don't. The battery is replaceable and supports NFC (used by things like Google Wallet). You can get spares pretty cheap if you're worried about juice, but I wouldn't be unless I was out in the wilderness.Software-wise, it starts with Android 4.1 and I believe an update is due out soon. Android 4.1 is quite a bit nicer than 4.0, mainly due to the streamlined UI. I will note that the default Samsung home screen customization is a bit weak, but you can always get more skins and screen savers if you want. I liked the stock assortment of widgets and lack of tons of bloatware which many other VM devices have. The S3 does support USB on the go, and works with flash drives and many other USB devices if you have a cable or adapter. It's also very easy to root compared to some of the older VM handsets such as the HTC ones (which require unlocking the bootloader first and other irritating things). If you don't like some of the set features, like the always-on camera shutter sound, it's a pretty painless task to root it and turn it off. One note- if you like playing tons of heavyweight Android games, 4.1 no longer supports move to SD card. So just be aware you have 16 gigs of memory to store apps (minus OS and other things you need).The S3 has included gestures, e.g. tilt phone while touching to scroll pictures in gallery. It also has some Siri-like features in Samsung's S-voice. I wouldn't say these additions are particularly amazing, but they are quite handy once you get used to them. If you don't care for them, just turn it off. One neat feature is a setting that lets the device use its front camera to detect if you're looking at it, and keep the screen on. The Samsung customizations also include a form of multitasking with a pop-out application tray, but there's not too many apps that support it. S-beam allows you to share files between other Samsung devices, and Kies gives you wireless PC connectivity. Generally speaking, these added features are cool but not exactly great, especially in this day and age of cloud storage and due to the fact that not everyone has a Samsung smartphone. Still, it's an interesting feature and if the S4 proves as popular as the S3 it might actually be somewhat useful.Standard feature-wise, there's nothing much to report. It has everything any other device has- bluetooth, speaker, camera flash, gyro, light sensor, etc. It shoots full 1080 video from the rear camera and has micro-SDXC for camera/video storage or putting other files and documents. To summarize, the Virgin S3 is easily the best Android handset in the carrier's lineup and arguably the best handset period. It's also expensive though, and as with anything it can only go down in price and be rendered obsolete by newer devices (the S4 is already out). However, any way you look at it the S3 is a very attractive and versatile device and will remain so for some time.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'd give it Ten Stars if they'd  let me", "Author": "P.

I previously was using a 3 year old LG \"smart\" phone that wouldn't work half the time because the internal memory was full and I couldn't transfer enough stuff to my 32GB card.  I was able to transfer my card from my old phone to this one without issue.  I was able to dl a bunch of apps that I would NEVER have been able to use on my old phone.  The phone is much bigger than my last (which I initially didn't like) but I actually am happy about now!  I was able to find a leather case with a clip so I can clip it on my pocket and don't have to worry about having a huge phone in my pocket!  I can toss it in my purse or carry it on me without worrying about cracking the screen, etc.  I have a tablet that I previously would use every once in a great while for the kindle app but since I didn't have it with me all the time, I didn't really use it that often and when I would think about it, it wouldn't be charged.  I use my phone all the time with the kindle app!  I use it for the grocery shopping app too.My old phone - I purchased for the ability to do voice to text but it would NOT recognize ANYTHING I said!  It was horrible!  I don't have a thick accent (just a nasally mid-western one) and it wouldn't work.  I have been more than impressed with the Samsung voice recognition!  It is able to put everything into text that I say!  I tell it to text someone and what I want to say and it transcribes it!  When making my grocery list, I click the mic button and just tell it what to add to the list and it does!  I LOVE it!  Makes my life so much easier and much less frustrating that my old \"smart\" phone!  There are a lot of features that I haven't even touched in the month since I have upgraded but I am so happy that I did!  As far as porting from my old phone to this one, I was able to simply bluetooth my contacts to my new phone.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "love every thing about this phone!", "Author": "Trina Beck", "ReviewID": "R2JQBETL6YDJ7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love, love, love my phone... world of difference between this phone and my old Motorola Triumph!

The Samsung Galaxy S III along with Virgin mobile was the perfect match for me. With  easy to use set up and adding airtime was a breeze. The Virgin Mobile web site account page makes it so easy to re-up your air time minutes. The unique look and cool style of the phone has everyone asking me where I purchased the phone. It is exactly how the picture described this product. I recommended The Samsung Galaxy S III to all my friends. This truly has been a great experience with no let downs.

This is a great little device that fits in my pocket. I love it more than any laptop, desktop or anything I have ever used, ever. I love it especially more than my laptop mini that made me feel claustrophobic every time I even think about it. My Galaxy, named Carmen, for the helpful GPS lady that reminds me of Carmen San Diego, is convenient for reading kindle books, watching YouTube videos (I even do yoga with this baby), checking my daily I Ching, tarot, timing meditation practices, photographing my inventory, blogging [...] my creative process, promoting my shops on twitter @WomanlyRoots, FB, tumblr, instagram, pinterest, pretty much everything under the stars (there is even an app to star gaze with). I love the direction this technology is headed.I would like to  warn you that using these LCD screen devices late at night can created insomnia. I had trouble sleep for a month before I figured this out. So limit your kindle book reading to the day time and enjoy a good night rest. Also, after long periods of holding the phone (usually when I am blogging), it gets hot and my hand will start to shake. So limited use is key.The phone is somewhat durable (definitely get a case for it though), the screen doesnt scratch easily (again, get a screen cover), it is lightweight (heavier than the larger screen s4 that my boyfriend has), and super simple to navigate after you get used to druid instead of window (though windows 8 is such a wannabe andruid dont you know).I gave this item four stars instead of five because it has horrible phone coverage. I DO NOT recommend this if you are looking for a cell phone. It is very difficult to hear incoming voices (though the music from media player plays nice and clear). It also feels like I am holding a radioactive laptop up to my head. The virgin mobile network uses Sprint towers, which are non existent (no matter what they say over the sales line) coverage in my wooded area. I am running off wifi at this point and have no plans to pay my cell phone bill. Went back to an old fashioned land line and just rough it between wifi spots in town where I use the FB app like texting to message peeps.Thank goodness there was no contract when I paid the huge bill on this device. Anyway, all those business cards with my long standing cell phone number will at least make good fire starter.On the bright side, I havent been without a cell phone for almost 15 years. Now that I have lived an entire month without one, Im totally OK. I didnt know I was ready to ween myself away from cell phone service, but this little device has surprisingly converted me. With its poor virgin mobile network platform, I have been introduced to the world of a cell phone sized tablet. Im not looking back. Goodbye texting and constant phone availability. Hello modern networking.There are certain features I am waiting for android and the WWW to sync up. Like sharing buttons from sites. Its like a warzone between desktop sites and mobile sites out there at the moment. Certain flash player functions are incompatible still and there are some things I still cannot accomplish with this little monster. However, the camera is waaayyyy better than the point and shoot I was using for years and it is super simple to edit photos with filters on instagram and bam! put em up on multiple social media platforms with the click of a button.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best on virgin mobile", "Author": "Timothy Nixon", "ReviewID": "RZY4LMQR7YR1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though ive had it for less than a year and i had to replace it (under warrenty so its free) still 5 stars being its the best phone on virgin mobile and i love the split screen aps samsung lets you do so nice..", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quick to get here and works fine", "Author": "conor mills", "ReviewID": "R141HPQFLRYF6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is in perfect condition and arrived in new packaging that was undamaged.

This one is so much thinner & that makes me nervous. I bought the white Samsung cover for it. Love it too. It looks great & fits perfectly. I'm also going to purchase some screen protectors for it.

Everyone and their mother seem to rave about how great the Samsung Galaxy is (I mean, it started with the first one and the clamor has only gotten louder with each new generation). Even my brother, who is a techie I trust implicitly, sang this phone praises, mainly for its android roots but still. For my first smart phone, I wanted nothing but the best, and it came down to this phone or the iPhone 4 for Virgin Mobile, and even though I have more experience with Apple products, namely the iTouch that I can't bear to part with, I chose the Galaxy. And it was a very stupid mistake.THE GOODDon't get me wrong, it's a decent phone. Here's why:(1)Its larger screen makes browsing the internet or reading or even playing Candy Crush a better experience. It's fairly light and thin.(2)The display is crisp and clear, and it takes decent pictures.(3)The audio is loud and clear, even though the speaker is on the back of the phone and therefore you can't have it lying face up if you want to hear your alarm or the phone ringing.(4)The best thing about this phone is how *fast* it is. I guess I've gotten to the point where I'm used to touch screen devices (NOOK HD, iTouch, etc.) that take an hour to load facebook, so I was in shock about how quickly this little guy can load a web page.(5)Beyond that, it's fairly easy to use.(6)It's easy to put itunes songs on it! If you look online, there are hundreds of converters that they tell you are necessary, but they aren't. It's far simpler than that!(7)Access to far more decent and free apps than the iPhone.It's sounds pretty good, right? Well...THE BADNow the ugly.(1)The battery. Omfg the battery. Even when you do all the little battery saving tricks (i.e. running only one program at a time, closing the others by using task manager, keeping the brightness at the lowest, turning off the wireless when not using it, turning off the GPS, using power save, etc.), it still doesn't last more than 18 hours. It's such an awkward length of time. I mean, you can't charge it every night when it's at 40%, but then if you don't charge it that night, then by morning it will be at like 2%. Now I understand why people are always charging their smart phones everywhere they go. The battery is inconvenient, true, but that's not the worst of it, either.(2)The worst of it is the overheating. All it takes is 15 minutes on your phone, and the stupid thing will get so hot it will just shut down. Randomly. Or freeze and then shut down. Really? 15 minutes? And I wouldn't recommend even checking your phone for messages when it's charging! I'm surprised it hasn't blown up yet. And you need to be careful about what case you put on the Samsung Galaxy too, because it will overheat even faster!The rest of my complaints are me just being nitpicky.(3)The fact that the phone doesn't turn on automatically when you set your alarm (which would be useful since if you want the phone to last 2 days, you need to have it off at night).(4)The volume control is ridiculous. There's an individual volume for everything. So if you turn down the volume on the phone (pressing the side bar) to silent, and then you open an App, let's say Farm Heroes, then instead of being silent, the game music will start blasting. So you have to turn that down too. Really? Why wouldn't there be a master volume control? If the ring is silenced, don't you think everything else should be on silent, too?(5)Also you can choose individual tone for a call, but the alert sound for text message, facebook message, email, etc. is one. You can't change it to differentiate between what kind of message you are receiving. I mean, you can, if you download something and do all this extra stuff that doesn't involve just opening settings and going to audio, like you should.(6)The brightness. Unless you are always outside, the display brightness should be on the lowest setting, and even that is too bright. That's probably why it overheats so much and why the battery drains by the second. Why is it so bright? It's completely unnecessary.So there you have it. It's a good enough phone as long as you don't \"overuse it,\" as my brother says (playing Candy Crush during my 15 minute break at work shouldn't count as \"overusing it\", by the way but it does with this phone). It serves well as a tiny, pocket sized computer when you're out and about. Amazon usually has it for a decent price, and Virgin Mobile has good service in my area. I don't talk on the phone much, so the $35 a month plan is pretty darn amazing for unlimited data.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Reginal Belizaire", "ReviewID": "R2L7RB5AMY4RAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy S III is a very good phone for virgin mobile.

Be an educated consumer!  The Samsung phone is great.  But Virgin Mobile as a wireless carrier is absolutely useless.  I'm trying to save you the troubles I went through.  I switched from my pay-as-you-go program with Tracfone, because I was seduced by the Virgin Mobile tv ads, for a $35.00 plan with an i-Phone or this Samsung Galaxy.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and what I learned within the first 3 days of having a cell phone with Virgin is that-----****** VIRGIN MOBILE DOES NOT YET HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO HANDLE BASIC CELL SERVICE******In a few \"pockets\" of San Francisco, and throughout the Bay Area (in URBAN settings!),  I could make NO calls whatsoever on this phone.  I kept getting the message,  \"Mobile Network Not Available\".  Seriously?  I'm in the middle of a CITY, and no mobile network is available!!  So basically, I was given the opportunity to pay $35.00 a month for a phone that I will never be able to rely on, to actually make calls.  I had a  \"spare\" $40.00 Tracfone that I got at Walgreen's for a 2nd \"just in case\" cell phone.  It works EVERYWHERE.  In fact, the $40.00 drugstore phone works everywhere the Virgin Mobile phone does not.SAVE YOUR MONEY and save yourselves the grief of signing on with Virgin Mobile.  Luckily, I was able to get out within the 14 day \"grace period\".  I'm going back to Tracfone.
