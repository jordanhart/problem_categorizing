{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best screen on any phone period, very fast hardware - probably best Android phone to date", "Author": "int19h", "ReviewID": "R7MO3IXVOOGHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good things:- Awesome screen - all the greatness of OLED (perfect blacks, high contrast, looks good in direct sunlight) without the ugliness that was PenTile. Here you just get the bright, popping colors. Oh, and at 4.3\", it's a pleasure to look at from any distance. The resolution is still 800x480, though. Wish they'd up it to match iPhone.- Very light. I mean, VERY light. Samsung wasn't kidding when they stressed that point. Considering the size of this thing, it's very hard to believe. When you put the phone into someone else's hand for the first time, they usually are confused because they expect it to feel more \"solid\", and not so featherweight.- Fairly thin. Good if you wear your phone in the pocket of your pants.- The UI is buttery smooth, with no hiccups that are common on all other Android phones I've seen. Not sure if it's Samsung's new powerful GPU (Exynos), software optimizations that they did, or a combination of both, but overall this thing is just as slick as iPhone 4.- It can be rooted, and custom ROMs already exist. No signed bootloaders or other similar malarkey.- It comes with Android 2.3. That means better perf, WiFi tethering/hotspot out of the box, and the ability to tilt and rotate the map in Google Maps - among other things.- It comes with Polaris Office. It is a very nice Android office suite - from what I've seen so far, more full-featured than Docs to Go, QuickOffice etc - especially when it comes to supporting advanced MS Office features such as charts. It cannot be purchased from the market, and only comes bundled with select devices, such as this one or Asus Transformer.- MicroSD card slot, for all those gigabytes of music.- It has CyanogenMod. They've finally got Bluetooth working, so you can use it for everything.Bad things:- Battery life doesn't seem to be so good. It gets through the day, but if you forget to charge it in the evening it won't last you a second day (except if only on standby). It seems to be purely a software issue as people with (unofficial) Android 2.3.5 report much better numbers. Likely going to be fixed when 2.3.5 officially rolls out for XEU models.- It heats up quite a bit when in active use. More so than any other phone I've used. It's not exactly a surprise considering 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and a powerful GPU, and I suspect that ultra-thin form factor makes cooling less efficient than it could have been otherwise. Overall it's tolerable, but very noticeable.- Some applications seem to be showing images in 16-bit color rather than 32-bit (particularly the browser). This leads to nasty dithering artifacts, especially on bands of clear colors and gradients. Head to XDA-developers forum for Galaxy S II for more details on this. It seems to be a software issue, so future updates may solve it.Things to be aware of:- Front is full glass, back is textured plastic. I love the back for the texture, which looks pretty nice and gives a good grip when held, but it's not as \"oh, shiny\" as iPhone 4. Lack of metal seems to be what makes it so light, among other things. On the other hand, I didn't notice any creaking, so assembly is high-quality.- It runs Android 2.3.4 (as of this writing). However, there is no voice/video chat in Google Talk. Google Voice can be installed (in US) and works fine. There's no clear schedule on official updates so far, but 2.3.5 has been released in some countries and is likely coming soon for XEU version.- Android is not stock, but Samsung's TouchWiz. This is much less invasive than what you typically see on HTC Android phones, and some changes are fairly nice. But many people prefer stock.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Display, Awesome Phone", "Author": "Robert P. Seaton", "ReviewID": "R3OEQTMQMM5XO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome. As far as appearance goes, it's *thin.* Like, 8.49 mm thin. Much thinner than the iPhone 3G that I owned previously. Although it's thin, the curved sides allow for easy gripping. The casing itself is plastic, so it feels cheaper than other all-aluminum phones, but its absolute thinness prevents if from feeling cheap. It's a classy phone.The screen is massive (4.3\") and beautiful. It's probably the best single feature of the Galaxy S II. You can view the display from all kinds of angles (good for sharing pictures of cats) and the colors really pop. This is all due to Samsung's patented Super AMOLED Plus technology. It's the secret juice that makes the Galaxy S II's screen really stand out when compared to other phones. One semi-downside of the display is that it's resolution is 800x480 and NOT qHD. This means when watching HD movies you have to deal with annoying black bars around the film to maintain the viewing format.The awesomeness of the screen, though, really can't be overstated. It's vibrant. Pictures and video are vivid and really pop off the screen, even in direct sunlight. The viewing angles and contrast are great. Really, a superb screen. Blows my old iPhone 3G's screen out of the water. It's a beauty to behold. Web pages render stunningly.Samsung's S-AMOLED Plus technology also helps with battery life by selectively powering down black pixels to maintain battery life. This means that even though the phone has an impressive two cores clocked at 1.2GHz each and that beautiful 4.3\" display, battery life is still impressive. I manage to go two days between charges and that's with fairly frequent usage. I do notice that taking a lot of pictures seems to drain the battery life, though, so you'll want to keep that in mind if you have cats. You should be able to get at least two days of battery life, I'd say. The Galaxy S II is certainly no slouch when it comes to the battery life department.When it comes to internet, this phone supports 21.1Mbps HSPA+ speeds, so downloads are blazingly fast. This is another area where it blows my old iPhone 3G out of the water. Downloading apps feels almost instantaneous and web pages load very quickly. You might want to check if your area is covered by 4G, as coverage isn't that extensive.Camera quality is pretty decent at 8 megapixels. Of course, any professional photographer will want to carry around a dedicated camera, but the Galaxy S II more than suffices at Facebook pictures. One complaint I do have about the camera is that the flash tends to be a little strong and people end up looking like ghosts. Maybe Samsung will do something about this in a software update, I don't know if that's possible or not.One interesting feature regarding photography is that the phone comes with a photo editor app. It's rather lightweight and I doubt anyone could use it for professional touch ups, but for simple things like cropping or stylizing images it's very convenient.The phone can also record video in full HD (1080p). Quality is excellent, like nothing I've ever seen from a phone before. This will eat through battery fairly quickly though, but I'd wager you would still get 4 - 5 hours of usage even if you were recording video the entire time, which you of course wont be doing.As far as software goes, remember that this phone has a powerhouse dual-core 1.2GHz Exynos processor that can handle *anything* I throw at it. The phone is always very snappy. It flies through homescreens, menus, and applications. In Quadrant, the phone scores between 3,000 to 3,400+ and in Linpack it gets about 47 mflops.All in all, this phone is excellent and I'm very happy with my purchase. It's a real upgrade over my old iPhone 3G. It supports blazing fast 4G downloads, has a stunning 4.3\" screen powered by Super AMOLED Plus technology, and with two 1.2GHz processors, it can handle any workload that I throw at it.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone, even for the price...", "Author": "C.

But if you can afford to shell out $700, then the SGS2 unlocked is perhaps the only phone that can justify it.**Camera---best i've seen on a smartphone (barely beating iphone 4)...**Screen---vibrant colors on the samoled+ w/o the pixelated effects on the regular samoled. the 4.25 isn't too big or too small for my taste. although i must add that it looks bigger in real life than it does in the video reviews.**Form factor---Very slim, incredibly lightweight, takes a little getting used to bc the size-thickness ratio. almost feels like holding some type of card...really wish they would have used a smooth battery cover instead of textured.**Build quality---despite the fact the its form and plastics make it seem cheap, it actually feels pretty solid. the batter cover is made of some type of material that makes it very flexible w/o snapping.**Dual core cpu---smooth. but what can I say for 1.2Ghz dual core? other than that, you wouldn't really notice much else difference from a 1Ghz single core...for now anyways.**Media---Codecs that let you play DivX, Xvid, among others is great. Havent really tested games on here, so cant comment on that. DLNA is cool, but I miss the HDMI out.**Battery---I've heard horror stories about the 1650mAh battery life, but I honestly havent seen any worse performance compared to other HTC/Samsung/Moto android smartphones. YMMV**Software---GB 2.3.3 on there with touchwiz 4. TW4 is really starting to grow on me, but I wish it had more and better widgets like an rss news feed, or a friends feed that blends twitter and fb together. Although TW4 widgets look really pretty, some stuff like the keyboard needs more refinement. idk why the call log would display sms sent/received...weird stuff like that are found here and there on the UI...also the app tray SUCKS.**Storage---got the 16gb. VERY HAPPY that it has 16gb internal with a micro sd slot for more. i threw in an old 16gb in there for a total of 32gb. allows it to be a media powerhouse.**Speaker---very loud, yet crisp. HUGE step up from my nexus s 4G.All in all, i'm satisfied with the purchase. not VERY satisfied, but satisfied...however considering the price i paid, that says a lot. this phone is definitely the best android phone out there right now, and if they touch up TW4, it will be the king of the hill until the next generation of sgs launches...4 stars only bc of the price and UI isn't complete...sorry for the lengthy review ;-)", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Up-to-date Review: I9100 Released in May 2011, Unsupported by December?", "Author": "R. Chapman", "ReviewID": "R2ZGWKTWBXPREX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Will this phone even be updated and supported after the next two months? Android fragmentation and lack of updates and support plague many users and it's an absolute nightmare for developers. This issue can't be ignored in a review of this phone because it is probable that it will affect your experience, but maybe this issue won't affect you as much depending on your needs and technical ability. Feature phones and other smart phone ecosystems have suffered from fragmentation before(such as WinMo 5-6), and  most users hardly noticed or cared for years as long the phone worked and its features were suited for task XYZ. Admittedly, I am speaking from the perspective as an avid technophile, early adopter, code tester/sometimes active mobile platform developer, but before I digress too much I'll speak mostly about this phone which I've been using nearly everyday for the past 2-3 months.---edited: 10/27/2011(Day later)---Update: 10/29/2011 (See below)---Update: 11/15/2011 (See below)---Update: 01/12/2012 Very important (Test Driven ICS - See below)--- * Background * ---I am no fanboy. I've owned a LOT of smartphones that ran different OS's with the exception being BlackBerry.  Starting with Windows Mobile 6, to the original iPhone, Nokia N79,  and working through to the iPhone 3GS, Motorola Cliq, G1, cherishing the Nexus One, maintaining an EVO 4G, using a Samsung Captivate, an iPhone 4, HTC HD7, Infuse 4G and I've used and sold a few others. This phone has been the most satisfied I'd been with a phone to date, so... with over a 100 reviews on Amazon alone and millions already owning this 5 month old phone here goes my 2 cents.--- * Overall * ---Overall, the phone itself is fantastic. As of today, this phone easily garners 4 out of 5 stars. I believe if you already have this phone or simply can not wait to upgrade from a feature phone or older smart phone that you would be satisfied with this phone. However, if you can afford to wait a couple months then I highly suggest you wait until the holiday season of 2011 or even into the first quarter of 2012.---  * Hardware Pros * ---- Form Factor: Simply put this device is the best device I've held in my held. It's deceivingly light and after using it everyday for the past few months picking up other phones feels weird. The \"old lady\"  had been using the original EVO 4G and I almost felt sad for her that she was even carrying it around. It felt like a brick in comparison. This is at the borderline of the size range for what I'd want in a phone that works exceedingly well for both portrait and landscape. I don't have big or small hands, and I don't think I would want to do any prolonged typing/messaging on a virtual keyboard with s device that has dimensions any longer or wider.- Screen: Mentioned many times that the screen is amazing. I wish the resolution was set higher using qHD or better.- Dual Core Processor/16 GB Storage/SD Card: Compared to every other Android Device I've used this thing is a speed demon. It has 16GB of storage and an SD card slot. Check.- 8MP Camera: I'll list this here.  Megapixels don't mean everything. Samsung did a nice job with the optics and rendering on the camera app for this S2. 1080P video recording is okay. It's almost on par with a cheaper point and shoot camera I got almost two years ago that does 1080P.  You might be fairly impressed recording video and with the quality of the pictures given good lighting and a steady hand. If you're trying to capture something more than 15-30 feet away depending on the lighting conditions or while you're moving and panning around or recording sporting events you'll still realize that it doesn't perform well enough to replace an HD camera or HD camcorder.--- *Hardware Cons* ---I don't like that the power button is opposite the volume buttons. It sometimes leads to accidental presses of the button on the opposite. There have been a few times when the phone was on silent/vibrate mode, I hear the phone vibrate, pressed the button to check the message, put the phone away, and then I hear the next message because I accidentally hit the volume up button. Also, it is true that the phone does get hot. It doesn't get so hot that it affects using the phone. I would say that it gets alarmingly warm. I only experience this if I'm using polling GPS while streaming data over 3G or using the Wifi Hotspot feature.--- *Hardware Neutral* ---- Home key/button is a physical button. This was definitely different than any other Android phone I've used that had capacitive buttons. I liked it for the convenience of not always having to press the power button to turn the display on. This was something I grew accustomed to doing by pressing the trackball on the Nexus One and the home button on the iPhone, but Samsung was definitely not helping their case in their disputes with Apple and I speculate it may partly be the reason the US versions all use the traditional capacitive buttons.- Plastic material is fine for me. I've noticed some micro abrasions that occurred on the rear below the battery cover before I ordered and received my case. It's not noticeable. I just feel that there is always some sort of compromise between weight, scratch resistance, ruggedness, etc when OEMs use different materials.- It lacks a search button. I sometimes miss the convenience of not having to press the menu button to search through Gmail and other applications. However, I understand it was sacrificed for the physical home button which makes the device more unique. Also, because this only has 3 hardware/capacitive buttons vs the more common 4 button configuration in most US Android devices I am not sure how this phone will incorporate some of the newer features of Android 4.0 such as application management. That is when/if this is updated to Android 4.0 (see gripe below)- Well, this thing is a phone. Call quality is good for me using AT&T.; It's not great. Reception is probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. The speakerphone is just okay. The sound seems thin to me. I never had any issues with bluetooth pairing/connections out of the box aside from using a couple headsets I later faulted after realizing they were crappy refurbishments. I also haven't any experienced any problems with data. My service won't come anywhere close to the theoretical speeds on the device(not its fault).- Out of the box battery life is good enough to last you throughout the day. Evening/overnight charging is required like nearly every other smartphone used moderately throughout the day for phone calls, web surfing, checking email, apps, etc. Don't expect to be able to do substantial video playback/streaming or gps without access to a charger.--- * OS / Firmware / Software Pros * ---- Obviously, this phone being an international version means that it is unlocked. That is a big pro if you travel and means that it's one less phone call to your cell provider if they even support unlocking your device. Another obvious pro for me is that this runs a sanctioned version of Android 2.3.x which permits a lot of powerful customization and the typical Google services Android is known for out of the box. If you've never used a smartphone before you will be very impressed. If you're coming from another smartphone you will appreciate the customizability and the ability to quickly access certain features/settings via widgets, notification bar, or your own custom shortcuts. Some users can be overwhelmed, and a lot of times I've helped people with their Android phones only to hear them say, \"Oh wow I didn't know I could even do that.\"- Because this is the international version Wifi tethering is available for use out of the box. You can bypass paying your carrier extra for data you are already paying for when needed for the occasional Wifi hotspot. This is something that shouldn't be abused. You may feel guilty later if caught or when you receive your bill. There's no need to root/hack/jailbreak your device with this.- Touchwiz: The newest version is a major improvement and has been noticeably lag free +99% of the time. Some of this is due to the dual core processor but much of it is likely due to the fact that this version of TouchWiz is partly hardware accelerated. Features like using the virtual keyboard within the Dialer / Phone App to type the name and quickly find a contact (a \"feature\" that should've already been part of vanilla versions of Android 2.3.x) and some other things are welcome additions that can eliminate the need for 3rd party software and just add a nice touch to the device.--- * OS / Firmware / Software Cons * ---- A big negative for me was finding out that you have to register for a Samsung account to get push notification updates for your phone. I barely tolerated this crap from Apple with them and iTunes, and I see no reason why Samsung feels that they are a distinct name-brand or deserve the trustworthiness of my user information (even if it's just an e-mail). I think the excuse may be due to OTA updates not being done via the cell carrier. You can still download and install the OS / Firmware updates from online or use Kies from your desktop, but I feel like I'm being strong-armed for information or into installing an application on my PC.- Out of the box Vlingo is used as the default voice search and anytime you press the home button twice the app is launched. That can get annoying.- I don't mind UI customizations. TouchWiz isn't bad like it was on the Captivate, but I don't like crapware installed on my phone. Samsung includes their apps for you to use like SocialHub, MediaHub and Kies which I detest because some are only useful when integrated with your Samsung account.  There are apps available in the market that can do what Kies does but better and work on multiple platforms and devices. You don't have to use these things. You can use a custom launcher and hide these apps or simply ignore them.--- * The real gripe * ---Everything below knocks off a star from my perspectiveFive months after its release this is still the best Android phone IMO. Yes, it would have been nice if the phone had a higher resolution at release, but the resolution is still adequate. My real gripe for any prospective buyer today is with the OEM and Google's treatment of the Android ecosystem. It's simply a mess. Almost three years ago to the date Android was introduced with the G1. A little over a year into its existence as a proud Nexus One owner I joined a growing enthusiastic Android user base with the original Droid owners (a Verizon marketing blitz that's still associated with all Android phones) and was excited by its features and potential. I remember the HTC EVO 4G being featured on Oprah before its release in mid 2010. There were probably a couple dozen Android phones then. There are over a 100 different Android phones/devices worldwide and despite user advocation about the \"openness\" of Android right now it can be a complete open mess. Fragmentation is absolutely horrendous and suppert, interoperability and compatibility varies wildly across devices. If you want to video chat someone using something popular like Skype then you need to know if your device and their device is supported. The EVO 4G has had a camera bug since its release. It's been poorly managed because of poor OEM support. You could use Google Talk if your OEM has released an update for your device. Sorry, EVO 4G you're not included even though you were the most popular smartphone on Sprint. There are a lot of new and very good games being released on the Android Market lately. Some of them are only compatible targeted at devices with Tegra 2 chipsets, so this device (Galaxy S II - I9100) is not supported. I played Madden 12 on the iPhone and saw it in the Android Market. I figured I'd try it out but the Galaxy S2 is not supported. Ironically, the Galaxy S Captivate is supported.Google will patch some of these issues with the upcoming release of Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) but after reviewing the software developers kit I can tell you that 90% of the problems concerning fragmentation will remain. Documentation, and compatibility testing tools still leave much to be desired. The kernel API's still does not unify support for the most popular modern and soon to be released chipsets which means availability from the more demanding games soon to be released will still vary wildly from device to device with varying chipsets. This will still be a nightmare for game developers. Google developers are encouraging developers to use unsigned API's to take advantage of features that may or may not work! As a contributor to various devices in the Android developer community It's as if Google is content with incrementally releasing (sometimes half-baked) new features to keep the community interested all the while knowing that much of their gains in market share of mobile advertisement is coming at the expense of feature phones being cannabalized by lower end Android sold for cheap. It creates multiple ecosystems. One for the lower end Android phones sold for cheap catering to the feature phone market, a market for the enthusiast wanting a premium device, and those who are casual buyers wanting a premium device. It is the latter group that gets screwed when their device is left unsupported roughly 6 months after its release. There is no focus on building a coherent Android ecosystem that addresses this issue that would satisfy expectations and the broader user experience (I'd go so far as to split it and improve the market so that app compatibility is further addressed). Nothing dampens an experience more than a new user who starts to research their new phone and its capabilities, hears about so-and-so app, realizes he can't find it in the Market and discovers his device isn't supported. It doesn't matter (help or hurt) that there are other marketplaces for apps. A year ago the ecosystem was wildly split between Android 1.x and Android 2.x devices. I see a complete repeat of this occurring again in the near future with Android 2.x devices and Android 4.x devices.The OEMs are only concerned with increased hardware sales and are poorly trying to differentiate themselves with their custom UI's (e.g. TouchWiz) which creates a more fragmented user experience regardless of the adoption of Android 4.x and beyond. OEMs have a less vested interest in upgrading your current device versus luring you to upgrade/purchase a newer one. The S2 has been out for 5 months and the US versions have been out for less than a month and there has been no official statements that even hint that this device will be updated to Android 4.0 which has been in development now for over a year and the first device to be released with it is made by none other than Samsung themselves.  Though, there is no roadmap for device updates that include a device that's not even 6 months old but they have a product release roadmap that includes an HD version of the Galaxy S2, the Galaxy Nexus, and the Galaxy S3. That's not very encouraging to a prospective buyer.The reason this long-winded gripe is included is because it is frustrating if you are a prospective buyer not knowing which camp will you fall into two+ months from now.  That is roughly 7 months after the device was released.I went through this before for almost two months after getting the Motorola Cliq shortly after its release. After being stuck on Android 1.6 searching the market for voice navigation apps and watching Google Maps Voice Navigation being shipped on a phone made by the same company called the Motorola Droid with Android 2.0 I got irritated, sold the phone, and upgrade to the Nexus One upon its release. It wasn't until many many months later after many devices were already updated to 2.2 that the Cliq was finally updated to Android 2.1 and I am glad that I made the decision to abandon it and got the Nexus One. I can only imagine the frustration for users who signed 2 year contracts to get that phone. I imagine my view on Android would be completely different if I were in a different situation.Maybe you don't care about all of this. Maybe you just want a good phone for your personal use and you are satisfied with this feature set and you don't really care about app or game compatibility or for interoperability with other devices. This phone is sold without contract. Thankfully, if you make the decision to get this phone you won't be stuck into a two year contract but considering the price range this phone is being sold for right now you may just as well be stuck with buyers remorse another 2-3 months from now. I am speaking from experience.Of course, there are those who would say that you could simply root the device. There are various ROMs available out there. Problem solved, right? They aren't living in reality and are completely ignoring that over 95% of phone buyers aren't enthusiasts, tech geeks, etc. Mostly everyone who uses a has a life that very likely includes an occupation, kids, other reason for lack of time or motivation/comfort to dedicate an entire evening downloading and installing Samsung Kies, USB Drivers, ODIN, ROMs, other root kits, etc on their computer, carefully following instructions in sequence while risking not being able to use their phone the next day.Hopefully, this review helps you. It was written for potential buyers in mind. If something changes I will update this below. Thank you for reading.---Update: 10/29/2011Reports from Samsung Italy state that the Galaxy S2 will be updated to Android 4.x (Ice Cream Sandwhich). No release dates were given nor confirmation of which Galaxy S II variants/versions would be receiving the update. Let the OEM games begin. If you were interested in this phone today I want you to know I still believe that for a device being sold today with a dollar sign before a number north of 500 that you are better off waiting a few months if you can for the Galaxy Nexus(the Google supported device series) or the coming refresh of the Galaxy S series or something similar.---Update: 11/15/2011Starting today, Google will begin releasing the source code for Android 4.0.1 which will allow the OEM developers to update their devices. Still, there is no word whether the I9100 will be updated. The report from Samsung Italy has not changed but reports from carriers in Korea are stating that the Samsung Galaxy S II HD will be updated. The Galaxy Nexus is expected to launch in certain regions later this week with more carriers in other regions expecting to begin sales by 11/25/2011 which should mean that a lot of update and developer news should begin sometime next week. Side note: There is a security flaw in the I9100 that may affect some users using older firmware.---Update: 01/12/2012Hopefully, within a month you should see an ICS update for the I9100. I've been using/testing a couple Android 4.0.3 ROMs based off leaked builds by Samsung (CM9 the most) for the past few weeks. Let me tell you, ICS doesn't just breathe a breath of fresh air into the device it gives it a whole new life. I don't care for TouchWiz 4 being skinned on top. Touchwiz is far less meaningful now thanks numerous improvements, but I understand the OEM's need to keep familiarity for those less inclined to modify.It's been dull. Development across the board from the major players has been slow and hard release times scarce the past few months. In the meantime, I've had the chance to play with Windows 8 and be one of the rare users of a jailbroken iPhone 4S. Let me tell you that Android 4.x is one of the most impressive OS's I've seen and CM9 is probably the most impressed I've ever been with any OS for any platform. Numerous small changes have resulted in a big leap for the Android platform. I didn't think a change in what font was used would be a big deal but the added clarity from the new font on the S2's beautiful AMOLED screen makes it that much more impressive. Even with its lesser resolution in a side-by-side comparison with a Galaxy Nexus the S2 still holds its own. One of my original concerns was task switching. Holding down the home button to bring up the new task switcher. The ease of use for swiping and navigating the notification tray and the task switcher make operating a small device that fits in your hand as easy as navigating your desktop. It's not as easy as the Galaxy Nexus virtual buttons, but this has been seamlessly addressed for the S2. Every single Android device with 1GB of RAM and a 1Ghz processor needs to be updated to Android 4.xWhen a stable release of Android 4.x is finally released my chief complaint in this review may not be as valid, but my argument remains when it comes to value. I can't recommend a nearly one year old product being priced near the same price as when it was released.

I have had an iPhone 3Gs prior to this Phone and I will say it is such a huge!!! improvement as far as specs go...this phone is ultra fast that I couldn't believe it. I will say that this isn't my first Android Device. I have had Dell Streak, A7 tablet, and Galaxy Tab and while all of those are \"OK\" Devices None of which made me completely switch to Android until I got this phone. I don't even pick up my iPhone 3Gs anymore. another perk of this Phone is that it is Unlocked from the start and no hassle with Carriers. I took out my AT&T; simcard popped in in this and it was ready to go and getting good speeds up to 7 Mbs too.GPS locks on so fast, record 1080p, Kies Air, Watch Flash videos, All share works flawless, Changeable batteries, Speedy boot times, Very good call Quality, Should I even go on? Its too many to name for an out of the box experience. I'm not to big on Rooting devices but it almost feel there is no reason too unless you just wanted custom roms. This is hands down THE best phone I have ever used Thus far. Which brings me to my next point this is very VERY THIN, place it in my pockets and I have to keep checking my pants to make sure my phone is there. Amazing job Samsung!Two things I wish Android had is a Better Ecosystem, Which it ain't bad but I do like iOS app store better just do to the fact of sheer fact of Number of Apps and Games but by all means Android market isn't bad at all. Another thing is I wish I could find some Accessories from Samsung itself, none are out and most of which you will find is Aftermarket Accessories. I would really like a Battery case for it whenever they release it.Other then those Two facts it doesn't take away from the Phone, Samsung has really defined themselves in the mobile market and finally made a phone the way Android was meant to be especially in terms of speed.

Before buying this smartphone, I made a list of what I wanted when I would make my next smartphone purchase.  I had a Sony Xperia X1, which I didn't like moments after I purchased it mainly because the Internet was pathetically slow, the camera was bad, etc.  This Samsung phone is not perfect, but it's as close to perfection as I could hope it to be.  In fact, I can't imagine a phone in the future that could significantly improve on it; although, I know that will happen.  The Internet is lightning fast--faster than any computer I've used and I have the latest desktop and notebook computers.  Streaming video never needs to rebuffer.  It's always 100% at the beginning.  The camera is amazing--probably not as good as stand-alone digital 8 megapixel cameras or 1080p HD camcorders, but almost.  I've popped recorded HD video onto a 46\" HD screen and it looks great.  I don't have a lot of games on it yet, but those I have work flawlessly.  Those using the built-in gyroscope respond perfectly.  FM radio works great as well.  That's a big plus for me.  No 3G or wi-fi is necessary to listen to its FM radio.  It has voice commands.  After programming the voice commands, they work perfectly.  Sound quality from any source is excellent.  It's a very thin and light phone, but in no way does it feel vulnerable to breakage even if one would sit on it.  There's no sensation to carrying it in one's pocket.  The battery does need to be recharged every day with what I would consider to be normal use--that's with fairly heavy use of the Internet.  Of course, the video quality of the screen is perfection.  That's been covered in most reviews here.  I'm not going through all the features of this phone, but there hasn't been one feature I've tried that hasn't worked nearly perfectly.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "In this case, you get what you pay for - excellent all-around smartphone", "Author": "ltnorham", "ReviewID": "R1AMC3008XD1FX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Others have ably covered the phone's technical specs. This review will be from a practical standpoint from a user who's not super-techy.  Coming from a \"stupidphone\", I wanted a device that would consolidate many of the gadgets I like to carry around: phone, digital camera, GPS, PDA, MP3 player. I did *not* want to sign up for a monthly service plan (currently using T-Mobile pay as you go, plus their Web Day Pass for data). I wanted a pocketworthy phone that wasn't too bulky. After much research I settled on the Galaxy S2.This phone fits the bill perfectly. It is a pleasure to use, sturdily built yet thin and light, with a bright, vivid display. It is intuitive, fast and responsive, with apps loading quickly and no frustrating delays. The camera, an important point to me, is 8 MP. The picture quality is quite decent for a point-and-shoot, rivaling in sharpness photos from my 10 MP Canon Powershot.I purchased this from FGS Trading, fulfilled by Amazon. The phone I received was a French version. Don't be alarmed when you see a European plug on the charger - the US adaptor is included. You can Google up an English version quick start guide and manual. One of the first options after initially turning on the phone will allow you to change the language to English.Two problems I initially had: 1) the wi-fi connection would drop periodically;  2) there was no way to disable the camera's shutter-click sound, even when the phone itself was in silent mode.These problems were solved after 1) upgrading the phone's firmware to Gingerbread XWKDD 2.3.3;  and 2) rooting the phone and renaming the shutter-click sound file.I was hesitant to root my shiny and expensive new phone, but the camera sound annoyed me so much I decided to go for it. There are detailed instructions available on the internet. It was not difficult but it took a while, mainly due to the Samsung Kies software taking forever to install on my PC.  Also, before rooting the phone I read that you must update the firmware to XWKDD. This step wipes your downloaded apps, phone contacts, and all the customizing you have lovingly done so far.  But after the phone is updated and rooted - sweet success!  Silent camera!One downside is battery life. All this awesomeness requires battery power, and I'm finding, with moderate to heavy use, this phone needs to charge daily.All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone, which is high praise considering its hefty price tag.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does Not Support T-Mobile 3G or 4G or future 4G-LTE", "Author": "The Jazzer", "ReviewID": "RFF7AKXGBFIV4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This unlocked Samsung Galaxy S II phone does not function on the T-Mobile 4G network in the USA.This is an INTERNATIONAL phone made for the UK/Ireland market.  It supports Quadband GSM/GPRS/EDGE frequencies of 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz, only.  Unfortunately, T-Mobile offers only 2G service on any of those frequencies (850 MHz and 1900 MHz).T-Mobile uses UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ frequencies of 1700/2100 MHz for 4G, and for the future implementation of 4G-LTE (needing both frequencies for uplink and downlink).  This Samsung Galaxy S II does not support 1700/2100 MHz.  Therefore, this phone cannot operate on T-Mobile's current U.S. 4G network.So, while a T-Mobile SIM card does work in it, currently (as of April 28, 2012),  T-Mobile supports this phone at a maximum speed of only 2G.According to Wikipedia, \"T-Mobile's LTE network will be rolled out on the AWS spectrum, and their HSPA+ network will transition to the PCS band, in order to achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA.\"Regarding the 1700/2100 MHz speeds, Wikipedia states that T-Mobile is the \"First carrier in the U.S. to deploy services on AWS frequencies. Markets HSPA+ as '4G.' Will be used for LTE in the near-future. UMTS frequency band IV\".Further, regarding the 1900 MHz speed, Wikipedia states, \"According to reports from users, T-Mobile started to use PCS for UMTS in some areas. Will be expanded during LTE upgrade. UMTS frequency band II.\"  Relatedly, Wikipedia also shows:  \"Band II (W-CDMA 1900) in North America and South America (ITU Region 2).\"  Band II (W-CDMA 1900) refers to 1900 MHz.So, hopefully in the future, if T-Mobile has any sense, this \"flagship\" Samsung phone will work worldwide at 1900 MHz at 4G speeds;  but currently it is stuck at 2G, maximum, when using T-Mobile in the USA.REPEAT:  This Samsung Galaxy S II does not currently work on the T-Mobile 4G network, in the United States!", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "You know why you're here!", "Author": "Jose Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R3NDDDXQUREX59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are reading this, you probably know at least from word of mouth that this is THE BEST PHONE available, so I won't work you up in this direction.  Instead, my experience with it:I got the Chilean version, but it is pretty much of no consequence:  Android can be displayed in many different languages, so don't sweat it.  Actually, I believe the phone started up in English (don't remember right now as it has been like 6 weeks now).Out of the box is (at least mine), Android 2.3.3, UHKE2 kernel (the KE2 part is the more important part).  This version is flawed!  In my case, the com.android.google.phone (or something along those lines) process would periodically crash!  Sometimes as fast as 1 or 2 minutes from the last crash.  Some days, on the other hand, would crash only once or twice.  The good news:  You can download the Kies software for PC from Samsung and plug in your phone to the PC.  It will immediately tell you there's an upgrade.  At the time of this writing, the most recent kernel is UHKG7, which is Android 2.3.4.  This kernel fixed the phone process issue.  It also fixes the fact that you must say \"Hi Galaxy\" instead of \"Hola Galaxy\" when you configure voice command in Spanish.And speaking about voice command:  It works beautifully!  I use it in Spanish and pretty much understands everything except one thing (and this problem is present in KE2 and KG7):  It doesn't understand \"enviar\" (translation: send) when you are dictating a text message.  You are therefore forced to click the Send button to complete the text message operation.  And yes, a data connection is needed for this to work, but then again, which one doesn't?  And this is more a question than a rhetorical question because I don't have much experience with voice command applications.Continuing with voice recognition, the KE2 kernel comes with Google Search for your phone, but it doesn't come with Voice Search installed.  If you're in the USA, this probably isn't a problem, as Google Search will direct you to the Voice Search page inside the Android Market for you to install when you hit the microphone button.  BUT, if you are outside the USA, chances are you won't find Voice Search in the Android Market.  Again, the good news is that the KG7 kernel provides Voice Search, so one more bug down.People are very interested in battery life:  It sucks!  But then again, what smartphone with these specifications doesn't?  My data plan is unlimited data, but restricted bandwidth, so I run Twitter, Hotmail, GMail, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, Office Communicator sometimes, 2 news tickers, you name it!  Ah, the Shazam widget and a few others that periodically connect to the Internet.  I get between 8 and 12 hours of battery life.  Coming from a Motorola phone that could work with one charge every other night (sometimes more), this is a big change.  It's like going back 10 years to the time where it was common to have a desktop battery charger and 2 or 3 spare batteries.  Not nice at all.  The good thing is that you can have your phone charged via a PC's USB port.  So that buys you some time.Probably one very big thing if you're not into custom ROM's and such:  Even though kernel KG7 is Android v2.3.4, Google Talk does NOT offer video chat.  Could it be my region??  Maybe.  I haven't investigated about this.  What I can tell you:  I got KG7 via Samsung Kies and my Google Talk doesn't have video chat.  Why did I introduce this talking about custom ROM's?  Well, chances are that you can probably find out there a v2.3.4 kernel that does offer video chat via Google Talk.Regarding custom ROM's:  I haven't tried any.  The procedure to root this device is pretty simple.  You just need the Odin software and a rooted kernel.  You can have your phone rooted in 4 minutes.  I haven't done it!  Feel free to comment if you have and share your experience.Finally, Samsung TouchWiz 4.0:  I love it!  But then again, my opinion is probably a naive one because I have never used stock Android in the past.  In fact, this is my very first Android device.  So I don't really have a comparison point.  Still, I have compared a bit my phone to an HTC Aria running Cyanogen MOD and I prefer my user interface.

The screen is absolutely Vibrant & Crisper looking then advertised, The Colors pop and are not over-saturated like the first Galaxy S. I'm using this phone in Kuwait and there has been no call quality issue whatsoever. It is the thinnest phone on the market which explains the lightweight plastics they use to make it so light. With that being said I don't recommend you use this phone with out a very good protective case like an outterbox. I bought 2 extra Hyperion batteries (because they have the smart chip that wont let you overcharge the battery), 1 USB EVO sync Dock/Batt. charger, and an anti scratch Zagg shield (because it will keep all scratches away from the screen and the body of the phone so when the next model comes out your current phone will be resaleable in like new condition :-) with the Dual core processors on the Galaxy S II you get the fastest phone in the world. This will probably remain true for another year or two until Tegra 3 processor phones come out.

Probably one of the most anticipated devices of 2011. A phone that breaks all barriers. One of the first phones of its class, sporting a 1.2GHz dual core processor, 1GB of RAM and a Super AMOLED Plus 4.3 inch touch screen. The phone stocks 2.3.4 Android Gingerbread, and boy does this phone run it good! Phones like the Evo 3D that have similar specs just can't keep up with how good of a phone this is. It has no lag what so ever, no problems with multitasking and just runs everything perfectly.The Screen is just gorgeous, nearly impossible to see pixels, and colors are bright. The phone uses new technology that instead of back lighting the whole screen, it only back lights the parts of the phone that need to be. If half the screen is black and half if blue, then only the blue side of the backlit will shine. Which results in incredible battery and truer blacks.Screen: 9.5/10Next comes battery. Most Androids struggle with battery, especially phones with large screens. This phone has a large 4.3 inch screen, damn fast processor and a ton of RAM, yet the battery is incredible! The phone can last a full day of 'all day long' use. And up to three-four days of just moderate calls and emails with the brightness level at about 65-70 percent.Battery: 9.5/10Now we shall talk about speed! This seems to be *no* problem with the GSII, as its incredible 1.2GHz Exoys processor doesn't lag, jam up or slow you down. Everything is perfect with it and thats why there isn't much to say.Speed/Processor: 10/10Here comes the look and feel of the phone. This phone is the thinnest smartphone in the US.

This is also one of the sexiest devices we have seen, the screen, the back everything!Design/Look/Feel: 10/10The camera on the back is an 8MP auto focus point and shoot while the one on the front is 2MP. Usually we only see VGA on the front, so it's great to see a 2MP one. The camera is unreal and zooming is a dream.Camera: 10/10Finally comes call quality. The phone's headset speaker is extremely loud, so even if the person is whispering the call sounds clear and loud. The microphones is also very good so the person on the other end can hear you just as well.

It works like a champ and the 4G works fabulously too.I saw one review where someone didn't like the home button; this is the sole reason that I bought this one. The carrier versions will not have it, which I think is a shame. It's great to have that home button front and center and easily accessible.As for the size, this is much smaller than the AT&T; Infuse 4G and just a little bigger than the iPhone 4. It's a great size because you can hold it and do one-handed functions with it that the big assed Infuse made impossible, unless you have extra long fingers.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!Update: The new hardware improvement that Samsung did for the Microsoft Exchange Server is sweet, as well. Finally, an Android phone that plays well with MS Exchange. I was always frustrated with the lag time from reviewing emails to show up as such on the server, a problem that I never had with the iPhone. Well, it's still not as good as the iPhone, but it's sure better than any other Android that I've tried to date.I just unearthed a sweet nugget: The WiFi hot spot works, with no configuration other than turning it on!! I was powering my iPad at 4G speed. Because there's no carrier bloatware, and nothing is locked down by the carrier's build of the software, everything just works.

As has been mentioned by another reviewer, the Samsung Galaxy S II GT-i9100 device doesn't start-up in English. However, once I figured  out the right language settings, set-up was all smooth sailing from there. The Samsung Galaxy S II GT-i9100 is highly 'customizable', in its factory unlocked state. After spending ~24hrs with it, I suggest (1)Charging up the battery (~3hrs+; if phone is off, press volume button to see charge state), (2) Initial setup completed via wi-fi , (3) Having a Google account; configure-able on device (4) Having a Samsung mobile account, which is also possible to do on the device (5)If you plan to use it on a GSM network, pre-obtain confirmed, compatible, working network internet and MMS settings ::Wink, wink::.That said, if you're still reading this comment you're intelligent enough to figure out the device. Google is your best friend.The goods not already mentioned, this device comes equipped with 1.2GHz dual-core Exynos 4210 chip (confirmed), already pre-loaded with Android 2.3.4.; no need to worry about how to get an update :), and will update via apps store to Adobe Flash 10.3 so you can stream flash video like you do on your desktop computer.The device also comes preloaded with Swype, Google talk (with voice commands like voice search) and video chat capabilities, download your favorite apps (Skype, Yahoo messenger, Qik) and you're set.One thing worth mentioning is that there are detailed manuals for the GT-i9100 in English via Samsung UK support. Download the adobe files, open, and read to continue to amaze and amuse yourself.That's all for now folks... I'm off to continue enjoying my new device. Can't believe I waited this long to make up my mind about the purchase, I guess my main concern was not being able to get an update to at least Android 2.3.3 since I live in the US; I don't know what that's all about but it appears I'm on the receiving end. I thought I would have to write new codes and edit web sourceable ROMs and software, imagine my surprise when I checked the stats and it has Android 2.3.4!

Before getting into details about a few of the amazing features of this excellent phone, here is a summary of what I really liked about the Blackberry Curve and how the new Galaxy S2 compares:1. It was easy to type text on the Blackberry because it has a physical keyboard which even a user with big fingers can cope with. I was put off on-screen keyboards a couple of years ago by the truly appalling and virtually un-usable Blackberry Storm, but the Samsung is really OK in this department even though its keyboard appears on-screen because the key points are so large, and when you finger a key a larger image of it pops up to confirm which key you have activated.2. The Blackberry's party piece was very easy and intuitive email management, which I need to use all day long for business messages. Well, the Samsung is surprisingly good here too, with the added bonus of a huge screen and the facility to enlarge or reduce text size with a sweep of the fingers, iPhone style. The text clarity is first class.3. The Blackberry has very long battery life and typically I'd only need to charge it every 4 or 5 days, even with heavy usage. The Samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an iPod-like music player is important to you, then this Samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).4. The Blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the Galaxy is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screenFor a really comprehensive techy overview, please look to other excellent reviews of this product. Here's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my simpler perspective:* The AMOLED screen on the Galaxy is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iPhone or iPod. Designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length* Despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iPhone for example is around 20g heavier)* All functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the iPod4 with a similar feel* Calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is OK. The ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls* The quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)* The Galaxy has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-USB port located on the base-edge of the phone. Finally manufacturers have chosen (not before time) to stop ripping-off their customers by making them buy new chargers with every new handset and begun to standardize - FINALLY!In summary I'd say if you're looking for a smartphone, the Galaxy S2 is a very serious contender. It's beautifully designed, its screen is absolutely amazing - you need to just use it for a couple of minutes to appreciate how good it is - yet it's lightweight. The menus are intuitive and easy to master; it has loads of optional software and aps (mostly free to the user, unlike with Apple); making calls and managing email is a breeze. It's a weather forecaster, a GPS street-finder and a web browser with astoundingly clear screen definition unlike anything I ever used before.Possible cautions include barely acceptable battery life, and for this it drops a star: if you're a current Blackberry user you'll really notice this, and especially so if you use it as a music player. Also the Galaxy might be intimidating if you're a technophobe who just wants a simple phone to make calls. But it compares very well in all essentials against the iPhone: it's lighter, cheaper and the screen is better, and most of the aps for which Apple charges you, you get with the Galaxy for free.One final point: make sure you buy a good robust case and a screen protector for it; there's plenty of choice and most of them do the job OK.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung i9100 Galaxy S II", "Author": "Miguel", "ReviewID": "R6XOXN6LL5M60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's everything I heard about and much more.

I was a bit afraid at first but in the end I bought the cellphone from eXpansys Inc.. They were extremely courteous in responding all of my trivial questions about the delivery. The cellphone arrived in perfect conditions but unfortunately they gave me a UK charger but they included a US transformer adapter in the box. Overall, I am still very exultant about this phone because I always yearned for it. I am very perspicacious when it comes to technology, specially cellphones and computers. Oh! Also, I'm not sure if it was FedEx or eXpansys Inc. itself who did this but they were altruistic enough to include about 10 chocolate Hershey's bars in the box protecting the Galaxy S2's box, which was quite awesome.---Samsung made a really ingenious device which is the Galaxy S2. Although I am not completely satisfied with the build quality, I am aware this had to be done to make the phone so slim though. The phone is made almost entirely out of plastic and it is so light in weight, which is somewhat good and bad in my opinion. When I first got the FedEx delivery, I honestly thought the box was empty because it was so airy! When I unboxed the device and held it for the first time the phone was EXTREMELY light, so much that I feel like I'm holding a child's toy, this quite vexed me.The phone is a screamer when it comes to speed. With the dual core exynos chipset Samsung packed into this state of the art device, I have not had any lag whatsoever! The browsing speed is splendid and also I love that it has Flash Player.. you know... to watch some stuff on the internet..... . Also, the phone re-heats a quite bit when I play 3D-ish games, but nothing too much.The battery isn't so satisfying for me.  It only lasted one day with about 1 hour of internet browsing and about 40 minutes of gaming and about 1 or 2 hours of just fooling around (downloading apps, listening to music, etc), which I guess is not TOO bad but still something I thought I should mention. Nevertheless, for less insatiable customers like me, the phone is most likely to last you for 2 days (if you have WiFi off and other battery sucking stuff).The screen of this phone is AMAZING. It is truly amazing. The colors are flamboyant and lively anddd the black... ITS BLACK OK? ITS BLACK. Sometimes I cannot differentiate from the phone's black color from the screen.For me, having a camera with me at all times is definitely a compulsion for me. The superlative 8MP camera with flash is one of the best I have seen on a cellphone yet. Although it's really good, it probably will not replace your Kodak, etc. Still is a true pleasure to have. The phone also packs a 2MP front facing camera which I must not so fecund. The pictures come out blanched most of the time but still good enough for video calls and self portraits.Lastly, I think Samsung did a great job on the TouchWhiz 4.0 UI on top of Android. I love the capable and momentous UI better than any other UI I have ever tested (such as HTC Sense). TouchWhiz 4.0 provides a very intuitive and relishing experience. I love the ability it has to re-size widgets and ample amount of features Samsung has generously put into TouchWhiz 4.0.Overall, a BEAST phone. I absolutely love it except perhaps for the battery and built-quality. Moreover, you should not let that keep you from buying this phone unless you're just looking for luxury to show off to your friends. I am sure the fast performance will be enough to leave your friends talking about your phone for weeks.I am very satisfied with this cellphone.I also strongly recommend you buying it from eXpansys Inc., they were really nice and such.

Super AMOLED plus is one of the best and brightest screen you can get now. Great screen in outdoors as well.Android 2.3.3 - well i don't care much abt this, since i rely on XDA for software updates. But if you don't want to mess with your phone, 2.3.3 is good enough and there will be a 2.3.4 update in the near future (Although don't count too much on it)Dual core processor - Well now a days this isn't that important as we may see quad core phones end of this year. But still dual core phones should be good enough for atleast next 18 - 24 months if you are not looking to change phones frequently.Negatives:Battery life is low, it will last 12 - 16 hrs for moderate use (5 email accounts synced, brightness set to 50%, 1 hr of bluetooth music, web surfing for 3 - 4 hrs). Again this depends on personal use, you may get 2 days or even as low as 6 hrs depending on how you use your phone.

Chinese version is a lot cheaper than the international english versions, bummer.Installed a 32gb micro sd card for most of my multimedia.  the internal 16gb has been eaten by the android and only around 11gb available for consumption, also, direct usb access to the internal memory is a hit and miss, sometimes i can transfer, sometimes I'm barred.  downloaded a third party file manager to augment this shortcoming.Kinda missed the FriendStream widget of HTC, Samsung's social hub feels slick but lacks some of the features of FriendStream.Has yet to use AllShare and Kies air apps, hopefully when i do it would be useful and not become crapware.As of now, totally enjoying every moment with my new phone.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "A worthy upgrade from Iphone 3GS", "Author": "M.

Physically - it's beautiful and as it's the European version, also unique in the US. (AT&T; and TMobile versions seem thicker and rounder). It's so thin and the surfaces so smooth, it sometimes literally slips through my fingers... though nothing a nice Zagg screen protector won't fix to enhance the grip. (paid over $500 for a thin phone, am not going to bulk it up with some case!)2. Hardware - on the Wifi it's lightning fast browsing, animations are smooth and seems to work fine with loads of apps and services running in the background. (I'm on TMobile at the moment so it only works with EDGE, but am switching over to AT&T; soonish and will get 3G then)3. Android Software - Not the iOS/iphone killer I expected, hence only the 4 stars overall. The touch screen responsiveness seems a fraction of a millisecond slower than my 2nd Gen iPod Touch. The open platform nature of Android means there is a huge range of configurable options, but also seems to result in clutter and various overlapping stock apps. (e.g. The note widget, the memo app, the diary app and the task app could really be rolled into one super note taking app, in my opinion). Configurations and settings are also all over the place, instead of being in a centralized location thus giving it the whole MS Windows 98 File->Properities feel...I got this phone because I wanted a beautiful, thin and powerful smart phone that wasn't an iphone.

First, taking a new phone out of the box and having it already unlocked is a HUGE bonus! Put my sim card in and had no issues.Having just retired my HTC sensation, I am not new to Android smart phones (phone prior to HTC was T-mobiles SII). But being in east Africa, I thought poor cell reception was just the norm. This phone has proven that theory wrong. I get 2 and sometimes 3 bars in areas where I previously had zero bars.In our rooms, the cell coverage is even worse! Last night, the strangest thing happened. My phone rang from inside my room!

It's less than 1 year later, and my phone is dead and won't turn on anymore.  It's not the battery, it's not because I flashed it in anyway (it's the stock OS it came with).  I plugged it in one night and it wouldn't turn on ever again.  A few techs looked at it and even tried the recovery micro USB jig to get it to boot to recovery mode, to no avail.  It was dead.  Samsung support said the phone is a European (UK) phone with sold via gray market, and thus no warranty.  I'm still a bit annoyed that I'm $660 in the hole less than a year later, but this was a risk that I acknowledged was a possibility.

I chose, and am happy with, the Body Glove case for mine Body Glove 9241301 Samsung Galaxy S ll and Epic 4G Touch Fade Cell Phone Case with Hideaway Stand- 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black. The other slight disappointment was the lack of an SD card. It states the phone can handle \"up to a 32gb\" card, but there is no card included with the phone. I used the 2gb card from my Moment, but saw a very significant change when I upgraded to a 16gb Class 10 SD Card...be sure to get the \"Class 10\"...it makes a big difference!!Pictures and videos are great! The ability to adjust the quality levels for high quality shots or compressed for upload or email is invaluable. The voice command works very well and makes life much simpler in many cases. I have seen many user reviews with low ratings on the battery life, but I do not understand why. If you know how to use a smart phone, keep unnecessary apps and features turned off, and use an app like \"Automatic Task Killer\" (search that name in the Market), you can get 35-40 hours out of a charge with no problem. I consistently use mine for pictures, video, a lot of facebook time, and a considerable amount of texting without battery life issue.

Since the new iphone is timed to replace the millions who upgraded to the 3gs I imagine many may wish the comparison points I will make here- 1st you can change the sim card when you travel so this huge ! To have a smart phone that is on par with an iphone to take wherever I go for very low cost is great. Also iit has internal storage of 16 gig and you can add an additional 16 gig card for very low cost. As well I was told you can bump it up to a 32 gig card. Apple wants a lot of $ for the extra memory in all its devices clearly a rip off when memory is now cheap. Ok the new iphone still has no ability to read flash...What is up with that?? I guess there was some feud with adobe and apple (yes everyone hates adobe for incesant udate prods and price gouge but to restrict cuttomers from navigating to certain sites will in the end hurt apple.It is obvious apple does not want you to shop on amazon so they restrict the abulity to fully use the site.It seems un-democratic and petty not to mention a pain in the ass not to be able to listen to music or watch certan videos. I dig previewing music on amazon which has so much more eclectic and rare downloads with better bitrates. Also I can read adobe pdf files perfectly. Also there are all the same apps for the phone, available on amazon or marketplace. I use Stitcher, Sonos music system, Netlix,etc  all the apps are the same which I really had no idea since I have used itunes .I know the battery use has improved with the new iphone 4 but this phone lasts incredibly longer than my 3Gs .Using an iphone during a call and your battery dies is  the most maddening thing, is, as after you plug the phone in, it takes the phone a minimum 5 minutes to re boot. This phone starts right up-The camera is fantastic it has a good processor with rich color and good in low or bright light situations.  I  use an in camera hdr processor and it is so fast with the dual processors that it turns out  great results. the iphone 3Gs was Very Slow w/HDR However the new iphone has the similar flash and 8 megapix I found the light meter very good, night shots are surprisinglygood.I have a Lumix LX5 which is one of the top cameras and the auto flash in the same scenes were very close. The sound chip is better in this than the iphone the speaker while mono is much better than the 3gs and as well the ear buds given with the phone are leaps ahead of those horrible standard issue white apple ear  buds that sound really bad and never fir your ears. I just returned from costa rica and have a very remote jungle home. Imagine my joy at being able to stream a netflix movie on the much larger screen on this phone! I did not intend this review to knock the iphone as I love the iphone, I just feel that since the new iphone came up a bit short of my expectations  no flash same size etc) this is at least as good and better in some areas. I was planning on buying the new iphone for my wife and I, as our contracts are up, but since lackluster iphone 4 reports are in, come on apple all you did was fix the lousy atennae and add voice prompt which this phone has.... Put in 2 processors which this phone has.I cant see how the new iphone is an improvement over this. The only downside for an ex iphone-ee is there is a learning curve and you have to set everything up with a google account and somehoJw it keeps wanting me to \"synch\" everything so I finally did, not knowing what I was doing , lost ALL my phone numbers and gained 1000 skype contacts with invalid numbers.So there you are,the last statement explains why this not a technical review!! I promise however, my 5 year old and I will be using the 2 cameras on this phone to do 2 way international video skype for pennies/minute. Finally, the greatest apps for international travellers are skype and stitcher which lets you listen to essential podcasts at your leisure.Netflix once you get the app with your account in the US has an app to tweak for overseas useage .The wife may want the familiarlity as will many blindly line up to order the new apple phone. This may be the one to break the chain . I am ready for a new mac but phones drive their profits so I think we just saw a major mistep.

Then try to drag and drop a folder from the PC to the memory card. Yes? No! The folder is there, but the sequence of your pics runs like: 1-11-130-16-170-19-2-246-26-3- and so on. List by Date Taken? No, S2 only registers the moment of the transfer from the PC. Exasperated, you launch a slideshow and watch your pics in the reverse order of the folder, just to complete the mess. My memory card is useless.\u00ab A thought for business users. Sync Outlook works except  for Calendar: about 20% of modifications are not synced and S2 cannot handle alerts over time zones. Yes there is a special button, but no, it does not work for alerts. Word and Excel: use Quickoffice or another app, it is a pain everywhere: to type, edit, save and find back your file, serious complications at every step. Consolation prize: once you get it right, sync to the cloud works well.Update: in the last 4 days I had to reinstall KIES 6 (six)timesI find out that a computer technician of HP in Singapore also had the S2 and uses it for games, this is his comment:\"my batt only can last about \u00be day only and it will go flat. ...., therefore if I have program at night I will carry a empty batt phone. for the over heating issue is when Im using to play games , it will heat up very easily and the batt die off even faster . But for email sync I've not try because I try to keep my phone as empty as possible to save batt life.\"Last update: I abandon the party. Bought the Lumia 800If you do not believe me, buy one. This phone is a phony. I am convinced that reviews were written by Samsung personnel to create the buzz. How much did Samsung spend on free gifts to journalists and other Youtubers? All they did is rewrite the company\u00a1\u00a6s press releases. If I lived in the USA, I would consult a lawyer to initiate a class action against Samsung for swindle.PS: You care about privacy?

I often couldn't use it at all as it would instantly shut itself off.I took it into the Sprint store and the guy took the battery out and put it on the counter and spun it.  He said it was warped and they do that when they go bad.  (A new one won't spin.)  For yet another $50, he could get me a new battery.  Screw that - why didn't they give me a good battery in the first place???I bought 2 batteries from Amazon and now - finally - I think I have the phone I bought.  It's a GREAT phone.The screen is lovely.  I do not believe it has a rival.  Google ops vs. IOS - they both win (and lose) on different factors (I use an ipod touch daily) so that's not really relevant in my opinion.

The screen itself was nothing impressive, it was what I was used to, and it's nothing better than that of my iPod touch. TouchWiz 4, was just as dumb and ugly as it's predecessor. I can't help but pity Samsung for trying to copy iPhone's application page. Yeah, using the phone was SLIGHTLY faster than my old Vibrant (which I HATED as well), but it's not worth switching because of. The Camera, Browser, and all of the other apps it comes with, are flops. I have no clue how people can say this is any better than phones that came out 1-2 years ago.
