I have owned lots of Android phones and this one might be my favorite yet.  I NEVER thought I would say this about an LG phone.  To put it in perspective, I have owned the Galaxy Nexus, S3, Rezound, Razr and Razr M.The one area where this phone really shines is reception.  The Galaxy Nexus literally could not pick up a signal at my house, the S3 was not much better and the Motorolas had a solid 3G signal but barely picked up a 4G signal.  This phone has been on a 4G signal over 90% of the time.  Calls are crystal clear too.  Not sure why the LG has a stronger signal at my house than any of the other phones but it does.The IPS HD screen is awesome too.  Much better screen than some of the more expensive phones...It comes with some delivered themes.  The Thor one is especially cool.It runs fast too.  It had some delays when I first started using it but that has cleared up.  I deactivated quite a few of the delivered apps that I do not need.The GPS locks on fairly quickly but not as fast as the Razr M did.The battery life is average but good enough for me.  I am constantly around a charger if needed.  If you need great battery life and do not have access to a charger regularly, this might not be the phone for you.  On the positive side, the battery is user replaceable if needed.  There might be after market options for a different battery but I have not seen one yet.  It also comes with a micro sd card slot for expansion.  So many phones these days do not have either of these options.The overlay that LG uses does not bother me.  You could always use a launcher if needed.The phone would be even better with Jelly Bean.  Hopefully this will happen sooner than later but I doubt it since the sales of this phone will be small and not likely a priority for Verizon.  Plus LG has not been known for quick updates in the past.In my mind, LG has come a long way since even last year.  If you want a great HD screen and excellent reception on a budget, this phone is a great option.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "One Week Later...", "Author": "Classical Steph", "ReviewID": "R32XP8LK1W1CDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this new phone one week ago today from Verizon (not Amazon).  Unfortunately, had to return to Verizon store today to exchange phone.  There was a problem with the camera/software.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the phone.  I LOVE ICS!!  I upgraded from a Motorola Droid X, and am very impressed with the lightweight Spectrum II.-The touch screen is super responsive (sometimes just hovering over a letter while texting is enough).-Not too impressed with the face lock, I prefer not to look at myself every time I want to unlock the phone.-Many apps that are linked with your Google account will automatically load onto this phone (with ICS).-There are a lot of pre-loaded apps (56 total apps), many that I could live without, but most Amazon apps are pre-installed, with a wonderful widget included.  Amazon App Store is not pre-installed.-Smileys are difficult to use in many apps (if you can loacte them at all).-Predicitve text seems to be only available when texting.  Have not seen it in the browser.-I use Google Voice a lot & messages don't seem to be transmitted as fast as with my previous phone, arrive within minutes instead of seconds.-In the app drawer, preloaded apps are on first few pages, then apps you downloaded.

I expected to \"settle\" for it and find it useable but I'm surprised how nice it is. The UI is pleasing to look at and very very responsive - I don't miss Jelly Bean and its project butter. It's well rounded and I'm a bit disappointed with some reviews it's getting from CNET and other sites because it doesn't have an advertising campaign with it or catchy features that hardly get used (like on the S3-which is still a great phone!)I came from an HTC Rezound which I liked a lot, but the bigger screen and thinner body of the Spectrum 2 make this a VERY nice upgrade.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first smartphone...", "Author": "Just Mary \"a4ofspades\"", "ReviewID": "R3TDMQ43VVLJNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Please refer to the title of my review and do not spend time reading it if you are well acquainted with smartphones..I am writing this for someone like me who is very new to this technology. The phone I switched from was an LG Chocolate and so I am used to a touch screen and some of the similar parts. I just wanted to note some aspects which took me some research to solve and thought it might save some time for newbies like myself. Verizon gave me this website which has several videos with simple demonstrations and some good, basic information. verizonwireless.com/workshops1. I chose this phone primarily for the superior camera. My first niece was born less than 3 weeks ago and I plan to take a multitude of photos. :) So far, I love the camera and I really haven't had time to explore it's many extras which look great.2. I wanted to load some of the photos from my computer to the phone so I connected with the USB cord that comes with the phone and copied them from Windows Pictures onto the phone's memory. I wish I could be more specific with how I did this but I don't recollect but I do remember it was relatively simple.3. What took me the longest to learn was how to put the pictures in files. I really wanted to stay as organized with them as possible. In researching this, I learned that you can place your \"widgets\" into files so that your camera appears less cluttered. You simply click and drag one on top of another and they are placed in a folder. You can place many items in these folders, create multiple folders, and title your folders. Your widgets are actually laid out in a grid and so I was able to narrow it down to 2 folders plus a clock and have this at the top, a personal pic, and then the bottom row of icons.4. I finally learned that to organize my pictures, I needed an ap, which, yay, is free. It's called ES file explorer and the video I watched regarding it was how to use your own music as ringtones. I was able to create personalized files for my photos and, so far, am extremely organized. Unlike my pics on my computer..which, to put it bluntly, are a clusteryouknowwhat. :)5. About that whole music as a ringtone aspect...worked on loading music the other night and it was a nightmare...tried to sync with Windows media player, which I had done many times with the Chocolate, and it downloaded ALL of my music and most of my pictures from my computer before I learned what it was doing. After lots of deleting (my cousin told me the same thing happened with her iphone) I just copied and pasted the songs and finally got what I wanted. Ugh...and that would be the reason I am writing this review...to hopefully save someone else the wasted time.6. This is a BIG phone...about twice the size of my Chocolate. But the pics look great on this large screen so I am going to adapt and get used to the change in size. I have had people comment on the size followed by how great the pics look so...Anyway, I hope some of this info helps and I really am enjoying this phone although it's been a huge learning curve for me.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Smart Phone.", "Author": "mandajane07", "ReviewID": "R2L4AY83SLL8BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this phone when I was due for an upgrade.

I'm so pleased. The screen is big and bright, it's powerful enough to let me play any game I like, and it's never failed to perform any function I desired. The battery life could be better, but it's nothing you couldn't solve by replacing the battery if it really gets to you, and it's more than enough to get you through the day unless you're a huge gamer with a long commute. It also has a built in power saver mode, which I've discovered isn't standard on many smartphones. The camera takes gorgeous photos and the touch screen is perfectly responsive. The little options button being on the bottom bar of buttons is an absolute blessing; it makes getting to the settings a snap. I previously had a problem with Home crashing if I tried to open Apps, but this issue was solved with the latest Android upgrade.

Before this phone, I had the LG Spectrum.  Not one problem with it over the 20 months I used it.  Before that, I had the LG Env 2 & 3 phones and never a problem with them.  I agree with some of the people on here that state that their reception with this phone is better than many of the other phones.  The main thing to do with any smart phone is to set it up properly.  There are a few things you can do to make your battery last longer.  With the Spectrum 2, I have more than half of my battery left at the end of the work day after using it to do many different things like FB, e-mail, text messaging and phone calls.  Instead of drinking the Kool-aid of Samsung, where their phones are way over hyped and less quality, do the research on each phone.  I did that and found that this phone is one of the best out there!  I talked to Verizon techs before I bought this phone and they stated that the Motorola phones had the most problems, followed by the Samsung.  I am a very picky person!  Everything I own is of very high quality, and the Spectrum 2 is no exception!  In my opinion, a great phone!An update: I got rid of the LG Spectrum 2 less than two weeks after getting it. Developed many problems. When getting into my email, a pop up would appear that said \"Network unavailable, please try again later.\" I would back out once and then go back in and sometimes it would be fine. Another problem was the charging port became loose so that when I put the charging cable in, it would move around. There was other things that went on and my daughter's Spectrum 2 did it too. We both have the LG G2 now and love them! Not one problem!

Having tested all aspects of this phone for over a week, the only minor problem worth mentioning is a noticeable audio video sync issue with the current Netflix application.  I've run identical videos from Netflix on my PC and my tablet (which also runs ice cream sandwich with an inferior processor and half the RAM) and had no audio video problem, but when the Spectrum 2 sees it the audio lags behind.  This problem does not occur when watching mp4 or avi stored on the sd card, just Netflix streaming.  I hope LG will get to the bottom of this problem and fix it soon!If anyone else has this problem with the netflix app with this phone, please post your review as well!UPDATE 5/12/13:  I just applied the latest update, bringing this phone to Android Jellybean 4.1.2.  I'm happy to report that LG fixed the Netflix audio/video sync problem!

I am 6'5\" so I tend to like the larger phones. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get something close to the Galaxy S3's size for much cheaper. This is my 5th droid phone so I am pretty familiar with them.  For the most part it works just like any other phone running on droid. It currently comes with ICS but will hopefully have Jelly Bean on it. For specific spec's you can read the product's description. It has a front and rear camera, but of which work great. The camera app also records right before you press the snap button allowing you to select the exact frame that you want. Instead of having multiple LED's on the phone for notifications, it just has one around the power button on top for all notifications.This is my first phone using NFC and I love it. it is great to be able to swipe the phone over n NFC tag and have it auto perform task/settings. I like that the NFC is in the back of the phone and not the batteries themselves like the S3, because that means you can get replacement batteries online for fairly cheap if need be (have not needed to yet). It comes with 2 NFC tags and I purchased some more online for about a buck each that work well so far.Audio quality is great. The the processor is fast enough to play ps1 roms without any issues.There is only one thing that I absolutely hate about this phone. When mounting to a pc it uses MTP which is painfully slow. Unlike with my other droid phones, MTP allows you to access and use your phone while transferring files, but it is so infuriatingly slow that I would rather just not be able to use the phone while it is transferring files. Other than that the phone is great and I would have no problem with giving it a 5 out of 5 especially considering the price.Pros:-Decent Price-Size-NFC is awesome-Can upgrade storage with up to 32gig micro SD cardCons:-MTP file transferring is slow-Notification LED is only 1 color (not a huge deal)-Comes with bloatware (as pretty much all do)Overall this is a great phone. If it wasn't for the MTP it would be an easy 5 star phone. if you are looking for a large phone and don't want to spend a lot on the s3 this is a great option.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Free cases", "Author": "Ann Walker", "ReviewID": "R16AGQWDFXTOGO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If anybody is interested I have a bunch of cases for the Lg Spectrum 2 and I don't need them anymore because I'm getting a new phone.

I just sold my Galaxy S4, bought this Spectrum 2 , and pocketed over $200.  And so far the only thing I'm missing from my GS4 is the ability to read USB thumbdrives via OTG,  something most people will never even use or even know about.  Let me be brief:  Build Quality- feels just as solid if not moreso than other battery repaceable phones, Battery- seems on par with GS4 though I am a power user, Screen- pretty nice!, and I feel I can see it a bit better outdoor compared to GS4, Camera- definelty more responsive/quicker to snap shots than GS4 though keep in mind that faster sometimes comes at the expense of accurate autofocus... different camera app like CameraMX can improve this and pics look pretty decent for a cell camera, Overall User Experience/speed etc.... - if you are a lover of 'Bling bling specs on paper' then I guess you'll be disappointed.??... but for real life usage this phone is just as quick and I dare say moreso in some instances than my GS4!  Not to mention I have not had to download as many 3rd party apps due to LGs interface(example; SMS pop-up notify is built-in) including nice features out of the box.  And if you don't like the LG 'skin' then just simply download a different home launcher like Apex, voila!  IT'S AN ANDROID PEOPLE!  CUSTOMIZE HOW YOU WANT IT...MOST PERSONAL TASTE ANNOYANCES CAN BE OVERCOME WITH A FREE APPLICATION!All in all, this is a great phone especially considering the great price you can get it for(got mine for $144 off-contract) due to the marketing hype for 'flagship' phones stealing all the attention of many buyers.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the money!", "Author": "Harold R.

The cost was Free with a 2 year upgrade. This is like the 4th Android phone that I have had, plus a number of Iphones. I have this phone because the last one which was a Motorola Razr Maxx started having issues.I have had good Android phones, starting from ICS to JB.I live in a area that doesn't have reception for any carrier except for Verizon when it comes to Lte, fortunately I have a unlimited Data plan. Lte has been my internet source for over 2 years. Believe me, my Maxx ran 24/7 but died 3 days after warrenty. So why did I not go for a Galaxy or DNA. I found that I do not use the phones for much more then casual browsing, I am not much of a game player, at least on a 4.7 inch screen, I leave that for my Asus Infinity Tablet or Laptop. I guess why I am telling you this is to give a general understanding of where I am coming from and that I do have some experience with Top of the Line Phones.Ok, let's talk about the Phones build, nice, maybe not as good a build as the Maxx or Iphones, better then a Nexus 1st Gen. My take on build quality is that I would like to have my phone last for 2 years, but that might not happen, so keep it insured. Under normal circumstances I really think this Phone will stand up to any physical abuse that I might throw at it, but then again I am easy on phones.Screen: I was started when I first turned the phone on, The Screen is amazing, the pure brightness and clarity is truly a marvel, I am not kidding! Sure, not the pixal density of say some of the phones that came out at the same time or today, but I am half blind I fear, and I can say that this display helps me to actually see the screen better. Its not as good as the newest technology, just saying.Android: This phone had some issues when it first came out, but most reviewers (Cnet etc.)at the time blamed it on I.C.S. and said if this Phone ever got JB it would rock even more then it already did, well guess what, it came out of the box with I.C.S. but updated to JB 4.1.2. Ya, a free phone with JB! Any issues that I read about while on I.C.S. are solved, which was mainly Lag between screens etc. It couldn't have been the Processor or Memory...Processor/Memory: First lets do a quick review of what I have mentioned so far: Free, excellent Screen, JB 4.1.2, good enough build. This thing has a 1.5 dual core processor and a good enough memory to blaze through what little I have put it through so far.Now, for me one of the most important things, the radio reception: No joke, it rocks at that also, easily out doing download and upload speeds then on the maxx or just wasting the Samsung Nexus built phone, was lucky I could a 3g on that thing, nice display though. I have 3 solid Bars of 4g, using speed Test, average down load speed 4 to 6 mbps, upload around 3, the Max 3 average download and 1.5 upload. If you are on Verizon and beyond their coverage area but within their extended coverage area, you need this FREE phone if your do for a upgrade and not in the market for the best of the best.Other items not yet mentioned: Voice quality excellent. I used the Speaker talking to my Son, I had set the cell down. I moved around talking and listening, the speaker was clear and loud, my Son never complained about sound quality and actually never knew that I was using the Speaker. Removable Battery, Textured grip on the back, never felt like it was going to slip out of my hands if I was holding it and awake. NFC, with programmable stickers, Beam, external Memory Slot, 16 gb in internal, who needs the \"Cloud\" with this phone other then for Backups. 8 mb Camera (taken two pics so far), 1.3 forward Camera. Oh ya, how about being able to be charged using a optional charging pad, (You can get the bundle for around 47 bucks with a 2 year plan).So, ya, its a great phone so far and think it was a top off the line phone at the time but was under marketed so little noticed by most including me, at the time being focused on the hype of the other Manufactures.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now has support for 4.2 (Jelly Bean)!!!!", "Author": "ty", "ReviewID": "R25YMR2GFOIOYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "although im not really going to review this product, as i believe other people have covered this subject very well, i would like to state that this phone has an update now available to remove Android 4.0 (AKA: Ice Cream Sandwhich) and is now updated and repalced with Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) i will be experimenting with this new OS for this phone and will complete this review within a month.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "A decent phone just got better!", "Author": "MarkRS68", "ReviewID": "R395440DUJ1VQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not sure what all the bad reviews are for, the Spectrum II is a serious contender in an over crowded market. This phone has really impressed me. I was anxious to dump my.iphone 4 and was all set to.get the HTC DNA, but realized in the store  that the DNA is a beast,much too big to carry around so thats when I stumbled on this little gem from LG, i went home and did some research. Yes the spectrum II IS ONLY dual core and has less internal storage and a smaller screen than some new smartphones but it has all the makings of a super great smartphone nonetheless: zippy performance, great build quality and a unique look. The spectrum II wont be confused for any other phone with the exception of the sony xperia ( maybe). I believe its unique shape helps set it apart from the rest. The screen is one of the best in the industry, abeit not as clear as vibrant as the nexus but much better than the iphone 4s and even the 5 in my opinion. I have had no issues with connecting to wifi or 4G, and syncing to my car's bluetooth was easy, as was connecting to my wireless air printer. Get yourself the Spectrum II you will be pleasantly surprised what this underdog is capable of.  The recent jellybean update was pushed to the phone and downloaded without any issues! Im glad I traded my iphone 4 for Spectrum Ii. The only caveat so far, is not with the phone per se, but with the lack of a good quality accessories, meaning the selection of cases available.for this phone is small. I purchased a rubberized case to temporary protect the phone until find something better. Get the spectrum you will NOT be disappointed but rather impressed.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nasty", "Author": "Luarfl", "ReviewID": "R14H2SD3ETMZXI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this phone from Verizon for my sister and I when our contract was up.

I would not get this on a new/renew contract, better to get the Apple i5 and resell that one. Anyway, the screen looks great, it is a little \"tall\" but I like the design. Verizon bloatware is all there but it's not too crazy. Lots of amazon apps included which are easy to take off.Battery life is surprising good. I can leave the wireless on almost all day (no 4G) and not have to worry about it dying. Even with 4G, it was surprisingly good, much better than the Droid charge.THE GOOD:(+) Verizon released 4.1.2 update in mid-May (Jelly Bean)(+) Awesome screen(+) Good Build Quality (some minus points below)(+) No slowdowns scrolling between screens or apps(+) Fast bootup(+) Decent battery life, usually 18-24 hours of moderate use(+) Easily rooted with motochopperTHE BAD:(-) Lots of cracked screens on dropped ones...  So, get a case and hope you don't drop it(-) Minor gaps between body and around screen trap dust(-) I have the same reception problem with 4G inside my office, but only there(-) Being on 3G and searching for 4G kills the battery(-) Some apps don't work on it...LTE switch, for example(-) Wifi hung on \"obtaining IP address\" in my office until  I rooted & did a file mod, totally unacceptable to see thisTHE WEIRD:(.) Resale on this phone is terrible, maybe because of the cracked  screen, or LG's lackluster history of VZW Android phones(.) It doesn't make sense to buy this from Verizon with a new  contract; they can be bought new or slightly used for a great price(.)

When sending text messages it often takes a very long time to send out and occasionally will take hours to send a message without me realizing. The NFC feature (one of the reasons I choose the Spectrum II) is horrible and compleatly dysfunctional and continuously needs reprogrammed defeating the purpose of the feature in the first place.

But that's something else all together.As far as this phone I'm not impressed when on t-mobile i had the my touch 4g (old Smart phone) In comparison there is none . This phone the screen is cool but likes to freeze on me out of nowhere. I use my phone for business and when I need to call a customer or my office I don't have time to wait 1 or 2 min literally to unfreeze itself. It has frozen on me like 5 times since I h have owned it (only 4 days). I already had to take one back because the wi fi wouldn't connect the way it is supposed to. i hate the fact that all the preloaded amazon aps kill my battery. It has no flash light stock on the phone. Added flash light app. That works but kills the battery really fast and uses data to run (the flashlight). Overall I would give this phone 2 stars and that's only because I like the screen. It sucks trying to use the phone while driving(again I use it for business) it's hard to dial a # when driving you have to press like 3 or 4 buttons to make one call. (Phone Button, call log or phone #, select contact, touch contact phone # to actually call.) My old phone I simply pressed the contact and dialed ) Not recommended if you use this phone as a business phone or have to use it while driving (too dangerous ) .
