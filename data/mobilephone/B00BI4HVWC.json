It has speak to text and it can read your text out aloud. It is a great phone I have been through so many phones and by far this one is the best for the money and the plan.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Phone!", "Author": "Miles B.  Dyson", "ReviewID": "R34QZF7JHV7TYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a refurbished Nokia x71 which was a good phone but it was refurbished and the charging got out of whack. So someone gave this phone to me brand new and I have had an iphone, S3, evo 4 & 3D and i didnt find this phone bad at all. I have big hands and i was worried about it being way to small with the 3.2\" screen but it works and the stock keyboard is great, i can fly on it! its a $60 phone and you cant expect much at that price but i think it lives up to that price and more.PROS+-Great Keyborad-Front Facing Camera-Runs on Verizon Network-Good Resolution-Call Quality-Speaker/Speakerphone-Battery-Design (has a really good grippy feel to the phone, with a nice shiny gunmetal accent around the device)-Charger port on the bottom.-No Battery Removal to place the sim, it has a side slot.-Notification LightCons--Camera-Screen & Phone Size-On-board Memory-ProcessorI still gave the phone 5 stars because this isnt a $300 2 year contract device, its a $60 device and it works well.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "High Priced for Little Features", "Author": "ocsnetworks", "ReviewID": "R1H1XFXJUSW3J0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just purchased this phone from a Shopko in our area and I have to say the price was too much for this cheap looking phone. Internal Memory on this phone is only 186 MB after the updates are installed for Google's apps, the storage is full. I had to remove the updates to install my own apps from the Play store and then move them to the SD Card in order to re-update my phone. I have 5 personal apps from the play store and the rest are updates and internal memory is constantly telling me it is low. The speaker in this phone is also cheap, volume control is all the way up in order to hear phone calls, and notifications. You cannot upgrade the operating system to anything else as this is a Proprietary Operating System build from some out-of-country developer. I cannot find drivers for my Windows computer so I can move any pictures from my SD Card to the computer period. I have to use an adapter that allows me to take my Micro SD Card and make it into a Standard SD Card just to get the pictures.I would not recommend purchasing one of these phones at that price. I paid $79 for this and it was worth a $10 tracfone.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this phone ANYWHERE", "Author": "L.

Fully 75% of the time it won't program, it won't activate, it won't do anything. It's useless. Buy ANY phone, even a tin can with a string, instead of this utter waste of time.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "hate it.", "Author": "Cathleen", "ReviewID": "R3NU4MR92RTESY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have had this a little over 3 months and it won't charge 90% of the time, and no it has never been dropped. thats the main problem. the front facing camera is terrible unless it is SUPER bright where your at.
