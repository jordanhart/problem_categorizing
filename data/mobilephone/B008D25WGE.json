Speed hasn't been a problem, however, There are a couple of features that I would liked to have had.-There is no Auto Focus! No QR or Barcode scanning!-The Back, Home, and Recent Apps buttons ARE NOT LIT!-There is no flash-Screen sensitivity could be better-It smaller that you think! Draw out the dimensions!-Lack of internal storage (Only 2G NOT including pre-loaded programs)-No Corning Gorilla GlassBut don't stray away from this phone yet! It's a GREAT phone for these reasons!-It's small and fits in your pocket-GPS Feature ROCKS-Good battery life compared to other smartphones-Works GREAT with Straight Talk Service-Just a FUN phoneThis phone is great beyond what I can explain in this review, but just take note that you might miss out on some features, but all in all, it's a GREAT phone!", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good entry level Android phone", "Author": "Mala", "ReviewID": "R2PXZVHBVZBURD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If it weren't for the Ice Cream Sandwich, this phone wouldn't have too much to recommend it. That, and the price, I suppose. The HTC Desire C is about the size of he iPhone at 3.5 inches, but oh, how different. It's a quiet sort of design, for those who don't look to make any statements through the gadgets they carry. That probably isn't me, I must admit. It has a nice rubberized back and at first I thought it was a unibody phone that was refusing to get switched on. I prised open the back and found a red battery sitting inside a red interior. Funny place to put in a design touch -- where it'll rarely be seen. The battery is a 1200mAh. Other important specs are that it has only a 600MHz processor and 512MB RAM and 4GB internal storage all of which is not available to the user. Just as well then that it has an Micro SD card slot. It doesn't take a micro sim but a normal one.The Desire C feels very nice in the palm. It's just the right holdable size. The screen is nice enough with no ugly hard-hitting glare. It's a good Android entry level no-fuss no-frills phone. It's amazing that the device is fitted out with ICS and HTC's Sense 4.0 at a time when phones are still beng launched with Gingerbread!My device was strictly a review unit.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not State-of-the-Art, but Meets My Needs", "Author": "M. Waltrip \"calhorn\"", "ReviewID": "R1X3X6DLXDSAE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone at the Hong Kong airport for use during my frequent travel within China.  What attracted me to the HTC Desire was the industrial design and Android ICS operating system.  I really like the Android interface and am considering trading in my iPhone (for use in US) for an Android device.  My HTC is unlocked and works with my China Mobile pre-paid SIM card.The HTC Desire is small and fits easily into the palm of your hand.  Mine is white, and I prefer the soft touch finish on the rear cover over the metal and glass feel of the iPhone.  Certainly, the page transitions are not as smooth as a higher end smartphone, but it doesn't take away from the functionality.  It has a microSD card slot behind the battery, so you can easily and inexpensively add gobs of memory for you photos and music.  The rear cover is removable, which most users prefer. Inside the back cover, HTC Industrial Design chose a red finish and it looks pretty cool as well, even if you don't see it often.  It's a nice detail.  The front window is plastic and has an air gap design (not fully laminated), so the display isn't stunning, but so far no scratches and I've had it for about 10 months now, with regular use for about 2.5 months during my travels.  The camera is fixed focus without a flash, so pictures are limited to good lighting conditions. It has a long battery life for my usage profile and re-charging during the day has not been an issue.  I charge it overnight only.All in all, I think this phone is a good value for my purposes.  I recommend it to others who want the current Android ICS operating system, can live with less than a state-of-the-art smartphone, and who want a small form factor with long battery life.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "aoc46", "ReviewID": "R1696O4MGFXDNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nearly ideal for my needs, especially the compact size, good feature set and relatively current OS (compatible with most newer apps). Battery life could be better, but not a problem for me.Also, this phone apparently was originally made for an international market, so the charger supplied has a European plug; I had to replace the furnished (not-too-good) US adapter with a more reliable one.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works fast in UK. But, not with ATT (slow Edge=2G speed)", "Author": "HL \"Laughter brings happiness\"", "ReviewID": "R1MP94XBKUNTZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this unlocked phone in UK(actually one from Carphonewarehouse, they sell unlocked phone at the same price as any network version. And the other from Amazon.co.uk), hoping that I could use it when I return to USA.The phone is light, and COMPACT. I can walk without any silly bulge in the pants. It works in Android 4.0, with a clear call quality, and its the Beat sound, left on the tabletop, is loud enough. In UK, it works on 3G network; whatever the signals UK networks(3 network, virgin, vodafone UK) send, it worked  fast to guide me to anywhere with travel/navigation apps. And, I was told this would work with T-mobile and AT&T; in USA. I was re-confirmed by a verizon store staff that this will NOT work with Verizon as their network phone comes with no sim card.It is not a shabby phone at all. I give 4.5 star for their compact yet full features I have enjoyed in UK.___________________Upon returning to USA, I searched for the network that would work with this phone.As a decade of AT&T; (former Cingular) customer, i could pick $20 data plane that simply adds 300mb/month for a quick tryout(call plans, separate, and unfortunately, no sim card only bargain plan was availe like T-mobile) but this one gets registered in 2-3 min phone call, but the data is only awkwardly slow. AT&T; technicians tried to help further but, they repeatedly say \"since this is NOT one of our network phones, we cannot provide further...\"The only signal I get is E(Edge=2G speed) signal. How disappointing!The representative said 'GSM acceptible' in the HTC production info means Edge(2G) connection. And their 3G signal in USA won't be the same one as UK networks carry. Even though it says 3G, it is not quite compatible. That is a big bummer.Anyway, to get connected to AT&T;, you will need regular-size(UK size) blank sim card from AT&T; store. If you ordered a sim card, there will be $3-7 extra charge.As I was long out-of-contract AT&T; customer, there was no Activation Charge($35). Once you accept the smartphone sim card, you can still drop the data plan and go back to non-smart deal(I doubt I will) and it will require another sim card, the company says.The next best option is go phone with $50 Unlimited everything plan but they will have to honor Desire C, which I didn't try yet.____________Alternatively, to get connected to T-mobile, there is a sim card only plan, starting from $70/$90/$110. And, they require 2 year contract. Not for me yet.You can also try their pay as go plan at the competitive rate. But, my search just ended there to try out this AT&T; 300mB at additional $20. And, I can change it to 3GB at $30 whenever or vice versa.I set the connection priority to Wi-Fi vs. AT&T; network so that it doesn't consume the data plan I joined much. And, that is cheaper way to use Smartphone on AT&T; instead of $40 smartphone charges and further $45+ monthly fees  they are introducing with Shared Data Plans. Greedy, I must say._______________________Final thoughts.I am still satisfied with Desire C's speed on my wifi (thanks to Comcast plus internet service at home). And my 2G connection in anywhere else is barely acceptable with spotty downloading speed(Google Navi locator took 30sec-1min to pinpoint where I was. TED(streaming) would never play on my screen with 2G).So, even though I like the handset, this 2G connection speed in USA should be your key consideration before considering this phone.If you are outside home all the time, never near wifi, this is not going to be your best buddy, unless you find a good use of it in other countries like I do.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Regret Buying This Phone and From This Seller!", "Author": "M. Van", "ReviewID": "R12KW1VG71EG4M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is not as I expected. The resolution is disappointing especially for videos, it's horribly pixelated . I also had a bad experience when the product instructions tell you right off the bat to charge the phone before you do anything else, so I charged it a full two days, without any response from the phone. I later found out they had not cared to inform customers to remove the plastic lining from the battery in the instructions. A mishap on the manufacturer's or HTC's part. Also, when I finally first turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, and some text still stay in Chinese even after I changed the setting to English, I'm still not fond of the huge foreign charger with adapter that came with the phone. This phone was also not sent to me within 3-5 business days of ordering, which was when I needed it before my trip. I also saw this phone online now for a lesser price and twice the storage. Not only that, but the seller was also upsetting when I told them I wanted to return the phone, they rudely said they were going to charge me a ridiculous restocking fee of 30% not including the shipping and handling fees to return the phone. I would not recommend this phone nor the seller to anyone. I would actually advise people to avoid buying from this seller if you don't want to be ripped off. L2D2Online was the seller name I dealt with. Now I really regret my choice of buying this phone and from this seller.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unreliable device", "Author": "Beth H.

About once an hour the phone restarts itself after crashing.  Sometimes it just dies without warning and I miss calls not knowing that it has turned itself off.
