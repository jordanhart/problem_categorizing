Being an android there are many ways to get it to do exactly what you want. If you aren't technically savvy there are several Android Forums you can scan and get info on how to root this phone and many other apps that can make it the perfect phone. I purchased from Ross Cellular and although it didn't come with the extras that would normally come stock it was brand new and in perfect condition. Within a few hours I had the phone rooted, apps installed for maintenance, and running pretty nicely. I am still tinkering with it but find I am actually using it more than my laptop these days. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase! And happy that I chose this particular phone over many others :)", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Thrive-Honest Review", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R2CXZKXQ9UR9F3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone about a year ago and was impressed immediately by it. Of course, this phone makes it a great first timer on smartphones. Everything you read on the good reviews is the honest truth. Occasionally it may glitch up, but there is certain apps that you get to fix that problem. Do the research for it! The only bad part for this phone (the reason why i put 4 instead 5 stars) is that i dropped it out of my lap getting out from a truck and it hit the ground with the case on and the screen to this day is black with lines running through it. I was so lost when that happened, but i am thinking about purchasing another one of these phones because even though it did not work after that drop, i did drop it quite a few times and it still worked. Anyways, people this is the phone to buy. I've looked at several other phones, but the reviews and the phone itself just doesnt match up to this one it seems like.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone.", "Author": "Alecio", "ReviewID": "R2SY67WLYDC96R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had over 4 phones and this by far is my favorite.

Wilson \"train manic\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y3UEWPMBAXBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as my first Android SmartPhone, it seemed like a reasonable priced phone, so I bought it. About 6 months after I purchased it, I dropped it into a glass of milk. I took it out and dried it off, ( putting it into a bowl of rice helps ) it still worked! I have also dropped this phone MULTIPLE times but the screen never cracked. Scratches do show up on the phone itself, but not the phone screen. But then, I made a bad mistake for leaving it in my pocket when I went swimming. I finally realized that I had it in my pocket and took it out.  I looked at the screen and it said: \"Emergency Mode\" I didn't know what that meant, but i did the same thing as before.  I left it in the rice bowl for a week, and it still worked!! It's an amazing little phone, I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for their first smartphone.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I Was Looking For", "Author": "Rocketman", "ReviewID": "R3KZYZNYWOWG6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent entry level smart phone. Just enough features and functionality for someone who doesn't want the commitment of a contract with AT&T; but is satisfied with basic phone, texting, games, and Internet access. Not fancy, but just what I was looking for.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Android Phone", "Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "R3OVFU3PXAMOPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these phones two years ago, since it was the only Android prepaid phone I could find under $200 (all others at the time without a contract were outrageously priced at $500+ and in my opinion still aren't worth $500+). I paid $150. Once I started using the first one I bought for me, my wife used it a few times and well I had to buy a second. We've never had a problem with either phone.The phone (calls) works well and I've not really had a problem with reception and have never had a dropped call. The speaker phone is okay. It isn't the most powerful I've owned, but it good enough for most situations.Browsing the internet on wifi is quite good, but not as fast as newer phones. 3G was good while I had it, but AT&T; dropped their prepaid by-the-KB plan, so I haven't used it since (year or so). When traveling, wifi hot spots are so prevalent today (hotels, restaurants, etc.), I found 3G was not really necessary (convenient yes, but not enough to warrant the current cost). If you are impatient and have to have the latest smartphone, this isn't the phone for you.The screen is responsive and provides good display quality, including watching movies.Each has been dropped multiple times, and aside from the small dings in the case, they function as the day we bought them.The GPS works, although I haven't used it a lot. Just a few times to get my bearing in new locations or the outdoors/woods.Phone memory is limited, so the app quantity is limited, but I bought it for basic Android functionality, and it has exceeded all my expectations (Angry Birds works well on this phone). I don't update to the latest versions of applications and memory capacity is fine (newer versions of things like Maps are 10-15MB vs. 3MB). As I didn't really see any value while using the updated versions, I uninstalled the updates and kept the base versions.The camera takes decent pictures, and when there isn't another camera available, the quality is acceptable (just understand you aren't going to be making high quality large prints, but will get high quality small prints). It's much better than missing the picture in a pinch.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cant hot spot or tether", "Author": "Darktown Pagan 1%er", "ReviewID": "R39Q0N2S4VZ4RF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked phone but being a unlocked ATT phone I was not able to tether or use as hotspot.

I really like it. I haven't had any problems with it. If you use your home's wifi or hot spots you won't burn up your data. Just turn off your 3G... It will automatically turn off to when connecting to your wifi.I have listened to Pandora for hours through my wifi.I find the phone easy to use. Once I read the manual. I am also on it more than my computer. I have a few apps on it from the Android market. I find them very useful. The camera also takes excellent pictures! The only thing negative I would say is I would like to delete somethings (apps) on it that I will never use. It seems I can not...
