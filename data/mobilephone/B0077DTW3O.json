Perhaps it is because my old phone slid open and was ready to use that this bothers me. I also find the keys a tad small even for my small hands.

Walden \"Candybrie\"", "ReviewID": "R15KJ1WI94ICNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I broke my last one of these by kneeling on it, so I needed just the phone. I bought this one and it came pretty nice. Its just the phone though, so if you need the charger (its a really weird one) you need to get it elsewhere. I'm pretty sure this phone came with a screen protector already installed, which was really neat.The most frustrating thing about this phone is there is no headphone jack, only their ridiculous proprietary charger plug. You can get headphones for it, but they'll only ever work for that phone, they're usually cheap crap, and you can't charge it while listening to music.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "AC Adapter not working", "Author": "Diane Van Slyke", "ReviewID": "R1JD8NSFNCNKLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is everything as described.  Does not come with car adapter or instruction manual, which I found online.  Packaged well and received on time. Just tried to charge the phone with the included charger (AC/DC Adapter), and it won't charge....have to wiggle the cord around at the otherside of the usb plug, so it's not the phone, it's the adapter.  AT&T; no longer carries this adapter, and Radio Shack also does not have it.......don't know what I'm going to do!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "dk", "ReviewID": "R3TQUS2O21L7PT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone before Christmas for myself. Order came delivered as expected. I got this phone because of theqwerty key board. Very nice phone, easy texting! I ordered the refurbished for a price of only $29.99. It has the AT@T logo and I have T-Mobile, but no big deal. Phone looks like knew. Refurbished usually means they change out the outer casing which does look like it is brand new. It came with battery, and charger. I put in my sim and memory card and I was off and running.One thing with AT&T; is that they have a lot of their own programs loaded on the phone that can't be used or deleted unless you have their data plan. That being said, there are things you can't use. The quick link to browser on the menu you can't use, also the email center on menu you can't use. So, to setup email to push to phone you can't. However, the work around I used was using Internet email. I have gmail and aol that I setup as a bookmark, and can go right there without signing in each time. All you do is click the box on the email site to \"keep me logged in\" and it works fine.Good sound quality on phone. Just love it!", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "multi funcional", "Author": "edwin", "ReviewID": "R2A1QIZFP38QJQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Es un aparato total mente funcional siempre y cuando tenga Internet podr\u00e1s disfrutar de sus diversos correo electr\u00f3nico. contiene gps funcional c\u00e1mara de 1.3mp y muy buena imagen n\u00edtida. para el precio que tienes es un super telf.", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "finding keys", "Author": "Stephanie Kassulke", "ReviewID": "R1Q53FTY7CHVK1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Needed a method for finding lost keys.
