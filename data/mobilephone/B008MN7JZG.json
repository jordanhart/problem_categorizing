I have a hearing disability and this phone has tele-coil capability which allows me to hear better on it.  It has a M3, T4 rating. It is a good phone for texting which has a QWERTY slider keyboard. A lot of features I cannot use because I am not an AT&T; customer even though it is an unlock phone. The only feature I do not care for is the thread capability of texts. For this reason, I did not give it a 5 star rating.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!  Just like the one I had for three years.", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "R28FWM67KGCBMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Samsumg Strive for three years. Loved it. Had the opportunity to upgrade. Chose not to. The screen on that phone began to malfunction. I looked for a long time for another phone. Finally found and decided to buy this phone - same model as my old one. I have had no problems whatsoever. Quick delivery. I would recommend this phone and this seller to anyone! I hope this one lasts for another three years or more. I'll let my kids have my \"upgrades\"!", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Old Friend...", "Author": "Michael Davis", "ReviewID": "R1SK5QBOOXIBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Strive when I first started with my current carrier. About a year ago, the phone failed in its attempt to mimic a floatation device, so I got a loaner from a family member until it was time for my free upgrade, a Pantech touch screen phone that had a habit of ignoring the fact that the screen was locked. Getting a replacement Strive was a no brainer.Overall, it's a great workhorse phone. Quality sound, good signal strength, texting, video and pictures do a better than adequate job. There is, however, one failing with the phone, though in the end it's a minor inconvenience: from within the texting system, the file structure breaks down, with all files of a certain type lumped together rather than structured in their individual folders - annoying if you want to select one photo to send from the hundreds on your SD card. You can get around this by going into the file structure directly, selecting your file, and choosing to send it via message.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ugh!!!", "Author": "Biagio Cuomo \"Biagio\"", "ReviewID": "R3PPBFOCA3R284", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First phone did not work.

I was even considering paying the full price on Amazon despite being eligible for a free non-Strive replacement phone on my plan.Pros:-Fantastic battery life: even texting and calling all day long it never died, the battery would last a WEEK on low/average use.-Indestructible: on multiple occasions I have tripped and launched it up in the air for a six foot drop onto concrete, there was at most a slight scratch on the corner.-Nothing went wrong: no one is buying this phone to get the best apps/features/camera, it's to have a functional calling and texting phone, three years of constant use and I'm not sure if it ever even turned itself off by accident, call quality was fine, alarms went off when they were set, texts were sent, etc.Cons:-Again, this phone does not have any features: you can set alarms and make clunky calendar notes, there is a camera but it's not worth bothering with.-Screen is a little dim: it's often very difficult to read in bright outdoor light and it looks oddly dim/distorted if you look at the screen from the side instead of head-on.-Minor oddities in programming: the phone has a couple of odd control quirks, but nothing major, if you're using the phone closed (not slid open) it will lock itself after a few seconds of non-use, the phone can automatically clear texts but not \"conversations\" (ie you will have \"You, Jim, and Fred: 0 messages\" listed in your inbox until you manually remove it), some other stuff, but none of it impacts the functionality.-Slight heating of the phone: if you are calling someone while charging the phone, the battery area of the phone will get warm. It's not so hot that you can't use the phone, and since the phone holds charge for so long anyway it's not a big deal.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Customer Service", "Author": "Bunz", "ReviewID": "R2QABSXCGVTR1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This company has very great customber service help..

I'm very disappointed because I really like the phone, but is it the phone, battery or charger that doesn't work? I'm sending it back and trying again.
