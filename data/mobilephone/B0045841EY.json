Easy texting with the Text button and nice, clear screen. I have no problem with the small buttons and all of the free ringtones I've downloaded from a website have played very nice.I can check my FB and bank account with no problems, however when I try to upload a picture to FB, it posts as a link in a status so that was disappointing. So I send the pictures to my email and upload to FB from there.The phone also has voice commands which is pretty nifty to me.I gotta say the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the signal quality isn't as good as I was expecting. Also, if you take pictures in the highest megapixels, you can't use the fun frames or edit it. But go one step down in the megapixels and you can do fun frames, add stamps and crop the picture.All-in-all I'm a girly girl and I love this pink phone. Does everything I need it to and then some.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "love phone", "Author": "rebel20lax", "ReviewID": "R3CICKQCFMN7E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!

Depending on the size of the file, you may be able to receive some pictures. You can't receive videos though. You can't even record a video. There's no slot to insert a memory card, so listening to music is out. The phone only has enough memory for about 50 pictures so storing pictures is a headache. Then again, the camera takes such crappy pictures (since there's no flash) that you probably wouldn't want to save many of them anyways. There's no voice text or touch screen...strictly keypad operable. There's no cool apps to download so to check your Facebook or Twitter account you'd have to go on the web, which may take a while to load and then is a mess to navigate on the small screen. Online games (like Words with Friends) are non-existent on this phone. You have to settle with the old school games like Brick Breaker and checkers. Even if you try to go on the web and play them it still won't let you.Bottom-line: this is a decent phone if you're just wanting the basics, but if you're one of those \"Facebook checkin'...Twitter tweetin'...Youtube watchin'\" junkies then spend a little extra money on a 4G/Android type device b/c this one will only leave you frustrated. Hope this helps someone out there. :-)", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Charge stopped working after a few months ...", "Author": "Allan M.

For calls and texting it is/was great, but the charger stopped working (I'm not the first user that this has happened to).  Then, I spent too much time tracking down, calling (on hold) then talking to tech support (BTW - Sanyo uses Kyocera which uses MCS Service Partners to handle repairs).  They told me I had a defective charge port.  Send it back and they would repair it.  About 3 week turn around.  I got about 5 months of use and then had to go through the hassle of having to provide documents and packaging and cost to send back.

I have never had any problems with it until recently. It was damaged when I was in a very bad car accident, it had been in my pocket and got crunched by the seat belt. While it maintained its structural integrity (and didn't crack or smash) it now intermittently does not receive phone calls or texts. While this isn't a normal problem, it was caused from the accident I'm on the market to buy a new one. I love this phone the keys are really nice for texting, the screen is big and brilliant, and (before the accident) it brought in phone calls that are clear and good quality.

R. Billings", "ReviewID": "RF239G1GYVI51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Pink Juno is a great bang for your buck. Being one of the lower end options available from Boost - I wasn't expecting much. However, after receiving the phone, I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing that most people will notice is this phone's appearance, namely the pink. The first thought I had when taking it out of the box was that it's got a definite toy phone look and feel to it. It's much more lightweight than I expected, which makes it very comfortable in the pocket. I would give the keyboard a 5/10. It's great to have it (I'm not a big touch screen fan), but the tiny buttons take some getting used to. However, I've adjusted to them and am really enjoying the dedicated \"text\" button. The software on this phone is very intuitive. All menu options are easily accessible and laid out in default grid style. The camera is okay - not really a replacement for your digital camera, but it takes good enough pictures to use as backgrounds for your screen. Web browsing is also okay - obviously it does not have the speeds of a smartphone but it will get you where you need to go in a reasonable amount of loading time. Battery life is great: I can go 2-3 days without charging.My biggest issue with the phone is how it handles media. DO NOT buy ringtones. Downloaded music is muffled and scratchy. It is not worth the money. I tried making a few and downloading them from Mixyr. However, the end results were always the same. The songs are quiet and static-y, not really ringtone material. The phone comes with a good list of generic ringtones, but you're pretty much stuck using one of them.This was my first Boost Mobile phone after switching from ATT. (I had a very basic cell phone on ATT, and was paying double the price.) This is a great phone for the money. It's stylish, perfect for frequent texters, and much more advanced than I would have expected.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Cell Phone to date", "Author": "Louise", "ReviewID": "R224K9HREK2ZO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best cell phone I've owned to date....so happy I don't have a contract but have all the extras that I was looking for.

It was a major disappointment in the battery life. I am used to being able to go up to 4 days on one charge if I was conservative in what I did. This phone requires daily charging, less than a day if you receive a lot of text or emails.It does not have a mini SD compartment for any additional storage. Picture quality is ok, but good luck transferring it to places, generally its a hit or miss on if it makes it to your email address or to another cell phone.This phone is also a fan of pocket dialing. Even when locked apparently it will dial at random, I cant tell you how many times this phone started pocket dialing 911. Troublesome? Just a little bit.Call quality. At first it was great, I could hear clearly and it never dropped a call no matter if I was in a \"dead zone.\" Now when I call out I am repeatedly having to check to see if I am connecting, it is dropping several calls. Not placing them even on full bars.The alarms and such are fairly decent, but if you receive a text at night and you don't wake up and dismiss it, forget about having your alarm go off in the morning.Overall unless you had no choice I would personally skip this phone. Or maybe just get it as a start up for your kid or something along those lines.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Abysmal Customer Service", "Author": "Columbus OH", "ReviewID": "R1CONJGWUU5DKP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?
