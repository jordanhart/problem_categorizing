One black and one white, and they are brilliant for what they use them for. They feel and look like a high quality product and they have worked without any problems since they arrived. The screens are clear and bright and is fast enough to handle my childrens games and Apps. They can get on to the Internet. I have a Samsung phone (not the top end one), which costs a similar amount to this, and the DJC phones outperform in almost every way. If you are looking for a quality phone that isn't too expensive, I wouldn't buy any other.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F6TRKWG"}}
