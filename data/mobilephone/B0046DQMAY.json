So I looked for a none contract phone and found this one. Looked at reviews and info ordered it and I have to say it is one of the greatest phones to have. Its like a Blackberry and iphone combined but better. I recommend the phone for a replacement. Though there are a few conditions.Cons.Slow Web Ram systemNo Micro card import. (my previous phone had it)Hard to get the charger to connect due to the case. Recommend the wireless Palm Charger.overall, The phone is a great device to have. :)", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Karalynn", "ReviewID": "R1YGGJ0OFVRJG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone to keep me occupied until my contract is up. It's an incredible phone! Once you play around with it, you'll find that it is very easy to use. When I was phone shopping, I kept skipping over this phone because it said that it did not have video recording. It does, indeed, have video recording.A couple of things that I do not like about it: It doesn't have a slot for my memory card. I guess it was time to spring clean my photos and music anyway. Also, I tend to use text messaging for Twitter and Facebook, and I do get a lot of posts. I do not know if there is any way to delete multiple messages at once. (If anyone knows, maybe they can let me know?) It's kind of annoying, but overall I don't mind too much.Everything else about this phone is wonderful. It came with a usb charger so I can plug it into the computer and transfer photos and music. It comes with some good premade ringtones and wallpapers if you don't like downloading. It's small but has a good screen size. The buttons on the keyboard do not stick like some other Palms I have used.If you do get this phone, don't make the same mistake I did. When you first get your sim card inside and get the battery on, when you turn it on it will be loading and look like the phone is frozen. I thought there was something wrong with it, since I did get a refurbished phone. But it turns out I'm just not patient, and once the phone gets turned on there are no other problems.Overall, great phone. Five stars from me.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really nice phone", "Author": "michelle bozemon", "ReviewID": "R2I5KRBE9LYSZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised by this little phone. I really didn't expect my 14-yr old to like this phone after having access to my smart phone, I was wrong. It's touch screen and net accessible. She can facebook and picture mail away with no problem. Its lite weight and easy to navigate. Its a very good buy for an introduction to smart phone useage.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Joyce A.

But ATT sent me a message saying that a data plan was required and ATT had kindly added a data plan I did not ask for.Needless to say I am very upset. I only wanted a phone with bluetooth that I could use without the data plan.
