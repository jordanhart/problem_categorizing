{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally a Straight Talk smart phone that uses Verizon!", "Author": "Ratchet&Spank;", "ReviewID": "R7TZJH7PR1ZH2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as an upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Precedent, which was also through Straight Talk.  It used the Sprint network and reception was very spotty to say the least.  The Proclaim is one of the first ST Androids to use Verizon's towers and it makes a world of difference!  3G is faster then ever and, so far, I haven't been in an area where I didn't get a signal.  The Proclaim comes with 1 gig of internal memory and a 2 gig card that can be upgraded.  I've downloaded a dozen apps off Google Play and it's barely put a dint in the memory.  The 3MP camera takes great photos outside, but the quality inside will depend on the lighting as there's no flash.  It's also much faster at running applications then my previous phone and can play Netflix and Youtube videos off 3G with little buffering.  It's just an all around good phone.  If you're looking to get an Android from Straight Talk...please...make sure it's one like this that uses Verizon (They have the red coverage map on the front of the box)  The ones that piggy back off AT&T; and Sprint can have horrible reception if you don't live in the right area.$45 a month for unlimited talk, text and data on Verizon's network is an absolute steal.  Verizon offers this very same prepaid phone (they call it the illusion) and it cost $80 a month with a 1 gig data cap.  You would be crazy to not get it through Straight Talk instead.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "my first Droid as well", "Author": "daninboulder", "ReviewID": "RZCMACBN4GE15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was literally on my way to Wally World to get a Straight Talk Android phone. I was already aware it used the Sprint coverage. I checked the web-site one last time and entered a friend's farm zip code (rural Iowa) since coverage is very spotty (no Sprint that's for sure). And lo, this phone pops up! They then verified that it will indeed run on Verizon's network. Took it to the farm, even into the woods, and could still get 3g, surf, text, take pix and post to FB etc. Awesome. Now I see they are all sold out, but ST is coming out with an LG Android that will also run on V's network. I may snap one up as a backup just because I love the 45 dollar pre-paid plan and great coverage.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great service with Verizon! Hate some features of phone.", "Author": "T. Harbolt", "ReviewID": "R1ZMTQJTL6191M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me say, the signal with this phone (on Verizon network) is unparalleled to AT&T; I was with previously.  I never have dropped calls now.  By the way, I live in midwest Missouri. This is Net 10 Service and had bad beginning with them for a week in transferring my number (as most reviews state about Net 10 service), but now that I've been with them for 2 months, I can say they ironed out my kinks and I have no issues since.  The phone is great, reliable, looks good.  But the qualms I have with it are the texting options are limited...to the point, I've almost given up texting.  It takes so long to compose a text due to horrible calibration and also the lack of frequent word prediction.  It has T-9, but I've never been a fan of it and I miss my AT&T; htc Inspire that would save my frequent vocabulary (and suggest those words first, even if typed incorrectly).  I also do not like the calendar and I'm a huge user of this feature.  The layout is poor, and yes, I know I can download other versions, etc. But not impressed, for the money, with the design of these features that comes standard on the phone.  Internet's great, fast. Only downside is the browser jumps around alot and is sensitive and can take you back three pages immediately for no reason.  This only happens sometimes but it is frustrating nonetheless, to have to start over with searches, etc.  I cannot figure out either where the history for the internet is.  I used this function a lot on my other phone to refer and browse and I do miss it.  Camera is not user friendly and has horrible image display. I hardly use this camera because I carry my htc to use for this instead (which is excellent)! Having said all of this, I think I should note I'm finicky about things, but I can sacrifice some for the money I am saving each month.  That takes away the feelings of the inferiority of the phone...and makes me realize all the stuff I mentioned is just \"stuff\" when it comes to the world and value and necessity today! I will use this phone until I find a better...and only then if it gives me more headache than what it's worth.  Hopefully, that will be atleast a year form now.  I'm not completely for or against this phone and it serves my purpose.UPDATE: March 7, 2013-I've owned this phone for over 6 months now.  Yes, I've gotten more used to it. I use the voice recognition/speech-to-text for texting and internet searches and my life is MUCH easier (the little microphone next to the browser and to the left of the space bar). The calendar is growing on me as well. I never have problems with the browser being sensitive anymore and jumping around. Idk why it behaves now, but I'm happy:) I finally figured out where the history for web searches were. I initially thought if I pushed the little star to the right of the browser bar, it would only bookmark the page.  Lo, and behold, one day I did it & my web history was there!  Camera still sucks in every possible way, but overall, I am satisfied with this phone and love that it doesn't break the bank every month.  Net 10 service is sooo simple and Verizon's still the champ as most reliable network service provider.  This phone & service is highly recommended for simple, yet savvy people.  It's a dependable phone, but maybe not a \"my-life-depends-on-it\" type of phone.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a bad Android", "Author": "Aurora Danes", "ReviewID": "R1A4X372WR4TUZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this phone it does a fantastic job with apps and calls are clear, easy to hear. The GPS navagation is just amazing and I only paid about 160 for it from Walmart here in town. Would of bought here but no real price difference and needed to get the unlimited plan card for 45 too.Looking around most people give this about 3 stars stating it freezes up a lot. I did experience this the first day or two but for the past month only the camera a couple of times under heavy use. Took a two hour boat ride and only used my phone did about 100 pictures. and maybe 10-15 min of video. The phone did freeze then like 3 times during this in which case I did have to restart it but otherwise it has been fine.Games are a bit weird. I have Style me Girl and Top Girl which seemed glitchy when I first installed them. After a re install they have worked fine. Other apps like my Rift Mobile app, Facebook, and of course Amazon have had no troubles at all with. Video has been great with a nice clear picture.Oh! Yes this will shorten the life the phone can go before needing to recharge. Battery seems fine for me. Sure I want more but who don't? If I only had to charge it once a month I would want one that goes longer but the battery seems to do fine. Even with a hour or so on the web and 30 to 40 min on a game Im fine. Though I will need to charge it when I get home. Just talking with people here and there I can go a couple days without charging but don't get in that habbit.I don't know if its the phones fault or just it being a Android. They have a reputation for being buggy which is why most favor the Iphone or a Windows, so do I, but hard to find that in this price range and the 45 a month unlimited phone,web and messages blows the other plans out of the water!I was thinking of swapping phones when the windows 8 ones come out, now, I'm not so sure. Yeah, they will probably be a bit more reliable and have some nice features this don't but much more in price this is fitting my needs perfect. You will have to decide for yourselfThis is my first phone review. I am no expert at all but hope people find it helpful.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problem in the beginning but working pretty well last 2 months...", "Author": "Y. Chu", "ReviewID": "R24SIURLB2GSLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I bought this phone from the Straight Talk website and not through Amazon.  I wish I had bought it on Amazon but I wasn't sure if it'd work with Straight Talk since it said Net10 for the provider.  If this works for Straight Talk as well, you would save a lot more money buying from Amazon instead.On to my review then:  For the first week or so, it was working pretty well.  Being my first smart phone, I was downloading a lot of apps.  Then all of a sudden a week later, the phone would just kick me off the data plan which means I kept getting my 3G connection dropped and it continued that way for another 2 weeks until I was ready to give up.  I even tried calling Straight Talk to see if they could help me troubleshoot but if you're lucky enough to reach a representative, that person most likely is a total idiot.  I think my rep was just rattling off some pre-printed instructions and couldn't help at all.My next step was going to send it back before the first 30 days expired.  Of course, I'd have to pay for the return shipping so as a last resort, I figured I would try rebooting the entire phone altogether so I reformatted/reset and went back to default factory settings.  Wow, what a difference! I'm thinking one of the apps I installed caused the phone to crash but I still don't know which one.  I ended up reinstalling most, if not all of the apps and have not had a problem since.  It's been 2 months now and for the most part it's working pretty well.  Call signal-wise, it's strong even though I live in a valley neighborhood that usually kills most cell phone signals.  However, my 3G signal does get dropped when I'm inside my home except in the living room.  There it works well or okay, but in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, the 3G signal will get dropped.  That's a little inconvenient at times but I'm willing to live with it for now.Compared to my previous Samsung which was a semi-smart phone, this phone has a lot more capabilities.  Sometimes download can be slow but that's probably because I have a lot of apps installed already or the signal isn't that strong.  Having the option to add more memory with a microSD card is really convenient for all the songs I download and the pictures I occasionally take.  The picture quality taken with the camera feature is just okay, image isn't very crisp and there's no flash so can't really use it except in daylight.  Youtube videos play without a hitch but I've noticed other streaming videos have some freeze frames from buffering.  I don't play games or watch that many videos so it's not a big deal.  I just love being able to use the internet to search for practically anything.  Really useful when I don't have my laptop with me.  I do charge my battery daily but if you don't use it much, it might last you a whole 2 days.I bought the 1-year plan already that ends up costing me less than $45/month.  If I had stayed on Verizon, it would have cost me a minimum of $85 per month with max of 1GB data.  I don't even use 10% of that so it's not a big deal but saving 50% a month is.  As long as the phone keeps on working and I don't have to talk to any Straight Talk reps, I'm fine.I would recommend this phone to people who do not need the latest smart phones but who want the convenience of smart phone capabilities for a way cheaper price than the big carriers.  It still uses the Verizon network so if you like Verizon, this is a great way to save a lot of money.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Test of Time", "Author": "lookouts", "ReviewID": "R4PC7U2CH82US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical initially about this phone.  But it has stood the test of time. I have had it 4 months now and I have never had it 'freeze up'. Not once.  I have excellent reception and enjoy all the apps available.  Pretty good voice to text...but likely would be better if I didn't mumble so badly!  Battery has made it through the entire day for all 4 months except for 2 heavy use days.  The battery is definitely drained at the end of the day and needs to be recharged...but it lasted until I returned home.  Typing on the key pad is not that easy for my large fingers...but doable. I send 20 to 30 texts a day with only minor irritation about the size of the keyboard...I can live with that. I have recommended this phone and straighttalk to most of my friends.  No complaints about the phone or straighttalk from a guy who was previously with Verizon for over 15 years.

I was a prepaid pioneer.  I loved the cost but hated the network - Sprint.  I switched to Net10 when I read they offer prepaid on Verizon.  Personally, I have the Samsung 355C which I paid $10 for from The Shack - super sale and have had a great experience with it for the past 7 months, both the phone and the service, which I pay less $17/month (just phone/text).I bought this phone, when I read it was a Android phone on Verizon through Net10, for my wife.  It is so much faster, smoother an OS version than her old LG Optimus V on Virgin/which has good reputation already.  Most importantly, she has solid service anywhere now, especially in our home which she used to have to go outside to make calls.  Activating had a slight hiccup (1) you have to buy a card from a dealer/even if you buy online (2) the number ported fine from Virgin but somehow the phone didn't activate without a call to support... which was surprisingly not bad (Virgin support is awful, both seem to be in the Philippines).Buying a prepaid monthly card is not a big deal b/c you can go to Best Buy and get a immediate e-card which sends you the code via e-mail.  One thing I noticed is that Net10 does not push their Verizon offerings so you have to know what your getting.  So the Net10 phones with \"c\" at the end of the model are Verizon.  If you search on their website for your area they often mask the \"C\" phones even if coverage is available in your area.  The way to get around is to buy from Amazon like I did and activate it anyways.Great phone, great/fast stable OS so far, great Verizon service, tolerable Net10 support - super cheap price.

After 11 days of use and four conversations with ST Customer Service and Tech Support, here's what you should know.  When you subscribe to ST you will give them your ZIP code. This defines the area your ST service will have priority on the Verizon towers for the best service. OTHER AREAS, EVEN AREAS WITHIN 4 OR 5 MILES OF YOUR DESIGNATED ZIP CODE, WILL HAVE A LOWER PRIORITY THEN MAY BE ACCEPTABLE FOR GOOD OR EVEN ACCEPTABLE PHONE SERVICE! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH DROPPED CALLS AND SPOTTY RECEPTION... We live in a suburban area of Minneapolis, population 3.2 million. We frequent a neighboring community just 5 miles away - a community of 100,000 (Shakopee) which includes the state horse racing complex, a large outdoor amusement park, one of the largest Indian casino & entertainment complexes in the Midwest, and a major wholesale car auction. Both communities are on level ground and served by major state highways. Unbelievably, in this area our two Proclaim phones consistently suffer from repeatedly dropped words in conversations - a dropped word or two every 5 or 6 words - making conversations frustrating and basically unusable. We also dropped calls. Straight Talk told me on three occasions this is because we're outside our designated ZIP code and therefore receive a \"low priority\" on other Verizon towers, and there's nothing that can be done about it. During our 11 days with Straight Talk we traveled 200 miles to our cabin in rural west-central Minnesota... the phones and ST service never missed a beat! The Proclaim itself is a great phone for the money. It's a nice size and easy to use. The audio is crystal clear & we had no freeze ups or glitch issues & battery life seemed good. I would assume it will do well on a normal network. (Incidentally, I'm told the Proclaim must be purchased for the network you will use it on - A Proclaim for Net10 can not be made to work on ST, and vise versa). Unfortunately, we need a network we can rely on when we're within just five or ten miles of our home in a major metro area. We've now moved on to T-mobile (Walmart Family) and the Galaxy S IIs and are very happy.

It is a basic entry android.  No sense in over gaming, over apping here the phone just wont take it.  The thing that saves the phone is a one gig processor with out it I wouldnt have even considered it.  I researched alot (into cheap andriods) and was about to go optimus zip route but figured the previous reviews were bad enough for the zip to go proclaim instead...glad I did.  All in all Id give it 3.5 to 4 stars (outa 5) like I said, this is an entry level android.  Apps-  your gona want a different keypad try swift key or smart key board (I bought the full version for smart keyboard.) The predictive text feature for smart key board isnt to great but I can type alot faster on it and It works good (way better than the keyboard that comes with it)  I also got \"avast\" (more for the on line web shield than anything.)Also an app called \"juicedefender\" (battery saver apps that helps)  Oh yah I ordered a cool couple things the face protector and two 2050amH batteries from amazon (youll want these heres the link:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M23NWU/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) this will not solve the problem of the battery draining quick if you are on line alot, but, it'll help.  For $150 plus $60 for the better batteries and $45 for the card it works fine...way better than the blackberry curve days, plus I'm on version (straight talk) towers.  Dont expect it to be an i-phone or GS3 though.  If your smart buy the insurance at walmart its only $15 and dont believe the crap reviews about this phone, more than likely there people who think there proclaim should run like a $6 or $700 andriod or iphone and its just not made for that.

While this phone does use the Verizon network it is the \"pre-paid\" network not their regular network. While the pre-paid network is very broad, and much better than either T-mobile or AT&T;, it does have some holes in it. Do not expect the full featured Verizon network, there is a difference. I have been in some remote areas like Northern MN and Northern NM - in each area I lost service while a friend that had a Verizon phone and service was completely connected. So before you buy the Galaxy Proclaim take a look at Verizon's pre-paid service map and make sure that you have coverage in the areas you will be using the phone. Over all this phone has all the features that I need and use on a regular basis. My only complaint would be battery life... This phone eats up the battery when you use it - you best have a charger handy at all times!

Its just become available for Net10 but its not available directly from Net10 yet. I only found it here at Amazon and for a great price, $40 less than anywhere else. Got it Amazon Prime free shipping in two days. The user manual is as bad as people complain for Tracfone. I mean bad. Get the manual from Samsung and its just slightly better. Fortunately, there is a good manual at the Straight Talk site. Just enter galaxy proclaim in the site's search box & go to the proclaim picture.Straight Talk is run for Walmart by the same company that owns TracFone and Net10. Walmart must have had something to do with Straight Talk having a decent manual. Wish I had the Straight Talk manual two days ago!The Net10 manual is seriously bad on setting up voice mail and on text messaging & on the main reason i buy any Android phone, the phone! An Android phone is more complex and less intuitive than using a basic quality flip phone. A person needs decent user documentation. For the other Android mini-tablet functions any Android user can figure out his way with any Android smart phone.TIP: Ignore the Net10 manual's instructions for setting up voice mail. You'll pull your hair out with what is missing. Instead, follow the simple instructions on the Net10 website. Do the press \"1\" and \"#\" key and enter a password and you'll just get an error message telling you that you have a symbol that cannot be used. When you figure out that the system sees the 1 & # key you pressed to activate setup, you then notice the backwards key disappeared after you pressed the # key. Instead press *86 then \"send\" symbol and follow the instructions. This setup does ignore the *86 that still shows.Forget the support phone number in the documentation 1-877-836-2368. (Be ready for the net10 telephone answering computer to tell you your serial number is not legitimate.) I activated through the online net10 website process.  Use the Net10 number at net10.com: 1-877-836-2368.Do not let the wack crowd tell your this is an inferior Android phone. Read the section in the Straight Talk manual on how to improve speed and function of the Proclaim. It is a quality Samsung Android 2.3 phone.The Proclaim is my first Android phone but certainly not my first Android touch screen device. I have the better-than-IPod Samsung Galaxy 4.0\" Player, the new Samsung 7\" tablet and two models of Novo Advanced 7\" tablets. All excellent quality Android devices.Like my other Samsung devices, the Proclaim charges and connects by way of a standard micro USB and a USB adapter wall plug. This is the customer friendly way to do it as that makes accessories and charging simple for you.I recommend the Proclaim. Its quality design and make and the price is right.

My contract was up with Verizon, I was using a Kin1 slider phone with wifi.  I've always had iphone envoy, but refused to pay $150.00 a month for my husband and I to have them.  I tried this (Amazon price was $80.00 cheaper than Walmart) after doing a ton of research both between Straight Talk and Net 10 and the phone itself.  I went with Net10 because with my husband and I we get the $45.00 per month ea on family plan and the less I have to deal with Wal-Mart the better.  Another big reason for trying this no contract was that these newer smart phones work on Verizon towers.  I live in a semi rural area and have always had good luck with Verizon, so I didn't want to mess with that.First the Good - It's a Samsung smart phone for $45.00 UNLIMITED EVERYTHING!  I've really become addicted to checking email and web sites out and about now.  I doubt that it is as fast as the latest and greatest thing out there, but it's fast enough for me.  I can stream Youtube videos with no problems at all.  Don't think I'll be watching a 2hr movie anytime soon, but if you look online you will see people review that it works great.  So far Android market has worked well, got pleanty of apps for me and some for my son!  Feels very good in the hand.  I put a skinomi protector on it which I do for all my devices, you can not beat them.  Very intuitive and I have no complaints.The Bad - Of course accessory shopping is difficult.  I would like to get a case for protection as it is very thin and I'm afraid I'll drop it.  Pleanty on line to choose from, just can't go to your local store for one.  If you do anthing online a lot it does wear down the battery.  Make sure you have a usb adapter in the car to charge the battery.  It's not a deal breaker, but I'm not used to it.  They do sell a longer lasting battery which also comes with a new cover, due to the thinkness of the battery for $22.00 here on Amazon.  I'm thining of getting it as I think handling the thicker phone will feel better, but then I've lost all options for a case.  It can be glitchy - today I had a hard time making a call and got a recording, I just powered the phone down and back on and it was fine - only thing that has happened to me in 2 weeks.  Comments about customer service are a little scary to see, never used them, hoping I don't have to.  You really need to just play with it to figure it out.  Samsung does have an instruction manual on line for wierd things.  I guess I should be used to that by now.  You should also know that there isn't a forward facing camera, and speaking of the camera, it's not the greatest, but adiquate for me.  Last little pet peeve is that the buttons on the bottom that take you home, back, search or menue go dark so you sometimes have to swipe at them before you can find them.  I'm sure I'll get used to where they are though.overall - If you want to save some money and your not currently in a contract, you have nothing to loose by trying this.  I figured if I didn't like it I could ebay the phone and move on, but so far I'm very happy.  If you're going from, a very high end smart phone to something like this, you may find it slow or buggy, but for me going in with no expectations I'm getting a smart phone for the cost I was paying for a \"dumb phone\" from Verizon it's a no brainer.  My only concern will be when I'm traveling.  I've heard outside your area you can get dropped calls as you priority on the tower drops.  I have gone 30 radius and have not had any problems.  I vacation a couple of times a year, so we'll see.UPDATE:  Have traveled now as much as 600 mi from home.  No issues at all with reception or quality.  Heading to Canada soon and though I could purchase the interational call to make call from Canada, but it will not work outside the country.  International is only for making call TO other countries.  That's a bit dissapointing, but livable.  I'm sure if necessary I could look for another sim card in Canada to pop in for a week, but again, not necessary. I have used the 3g a lot while traveling now, even just watching funny youtube videos.  After never having a smart phone, don't know how I would live with one now.

D LaValle", "ReviewID": "R3CT3XPH9RX2TS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my second android phone in the last 2 years - a step up from my bargain basement ZTE Merit, but a slightly small step.  I purchased this phone as \"refurbished\" from Net10 in February of 2013 for $59, so this kept me in the category of \"under $100 android smartphones. I was excited about getting into the \"galaxy club\", but as you will see below, this is not like the higher end galaxy models.  In my opinion, most users will not fall into the \"speed and upgradeable comfort zone\" for an android smartphone until you cross the $300 barrier.  Other than that, there seem to be major downfalls to lower price smartphones, however this may change soon.  I'll make some references to my old ZTE Merit for comparison.What I liked about this phone:Runs on the Verizon network (CDMA), which comes in handy when I travel upstate NY. Verizon seems to have the best coverage where other carriers may feel it's not worth it to build cell towers in lightly populated areas.It has about 1GB of onboard memory to install apps as compared to half that on my old Merit which ran out of room to install apps very quickly.  I have come close to filling up the onboard memory, however, I Just moved some apps to my SD card.Speakerphone works pretty good.Call quality is good.Most apps work fairly well with this phone, such as Pandora, Yahoo, Facebook, Yelp, Nook, Kindle, Lowes, Homedepot, Greendot, Paypal, Meetup, Twitter, and Dropbox to name a few. This is nice especially when reading reviews on Google play store on how some of the apps don't work other user phones (like Galaxy SII, SIII and such), but where others have problems, I haven't had much of a problem on the Proclaim.What I don't like about the Proclaim:  The old gingerbread operating system on this phone can not be upgraded.  I feel Ice cream sandwich would greatly help the speed and efficiency of this phone if it was available, but so far, I can't find a way to upgrade.  Apps for your computer to manage your Samsung phone such as PC studio and Kies do not work.It appears that Net10 disabled the ability to use management software - so the only way to back up is through syncing with google - no firmware upgrades : (  These programs may recognize the phone, but that's about it.  Battery lasts about 4 hours.  This includes checking email, a 5 minute facebook browse, and maybe using the gps for google maps for about 10 minutes - no video games or video streaming.I purchased 2 spare batteries with a separate battery charger to help with this problem, so I just change batteries halfway through the day - it's a pain, but it goes with the territory of cheap phones.Wi-fi is not sensitive.  If I'm more than 15 feet away from my router, the internet connection is pathetically slow or non-existent.GPS is so-so.  It has a hard time locking in when you are in a metropolitan area (tall buildings).  This is where better GPS sensitivity would help greatly.  Despite the 1Ghz processor, the phone is painfully slow with everything. This could be due to the 20+ apps I have loaded so far, but that's what an android is all about. The phone seemed a bit faster when I first purchased it when there were only the default apps pre-loaded.I'm using 3 different browsers with this phone - Firefox, Dolphin, and Google.All are fairly slow, except for an occasional quick page load.  Many times, there is a delayed reaction to all the button presses.When dialing a number sometimes, the phone will not start to dial until about 30 seconds. This would still occur after rebooting the phone, and happens randomly. Camera does not have a focus.Photos are hit or miss with this phone.  Sometimes they come out fairly well - other times the focus is off.  You can not use barcode scanner software because it needs focus adjustment to work - only QR codeswill scan with the right software, however no bar code scanning, which would come in handy if you wantedto do a quick price check on an item you may be considering to purchase in a store. Small screen size.  This is a little extra challenging when you have large fingers, especially when using the screen keyboard totype in entries, however it's ok when using to view apps and such. I'd rather have this small size than the huge tablet size phones that some put to their heads when on a phone call - looks funny - almost like they have a laptop next to their ear : P.  My girlfriend just bought an Virgin Mobile LG Optimus F3 for just over $100, and after playing around with it for a few days I have say that it's way faster than the Proclaim I have and the service prices are similar, so you may want to consider that option.As for my next android smartphone, I just moved into the $200 club - my Galaxy SII is on it's way from Net10, however, it's shipped with the old Gingerbread OS, maybe because I'm still in the sub $300 club : )LJ Elevias", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone gets hot and battery won't hold charger", "Author": "Amy Jean Harman", "ReviewID": "R11HZ0M53NMX7K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The first 6 months I loved this phone.

For $99 you get a very good Android phone with a very low priced service. This is how good the value of this product is - after watching my wife use it for a month, I sold my iPhone 4 and bought this device and I couldn't be happier with it. It does everything my iphone 4 did at 1/5 the hardware price and 1/2 the monthly service charges.The complaints I have are -1. Button placement is not great. I am getting used to it though.2. Lack of a flash on the camera, 3 MB is fine for quick snapshots but the iPhone flash was surprisingly effective and I miss it.3. Battery life is lackluster. Plan on charging it basically every night. They make an extended battery. I haven't needed it.4. Call quality is slightly worse, but totally acceptable compared iPhone. (Not sure if this is the phone or the \"verizon prepaid\" service.)5. Data speeds on the \"prepaid verizon\" seem slightly worse, but totally acceptable as compared to full-blown verizon service. Maybe I am imagining this or maybe it is the phone that makes it feel slower.6. Net10's website is bad and none of their support people are native English speakers (that I can tell) which makes support slow-going. They are pleasant and eager to help, it just takes patience.What's great about this phone is -1. Unshackle yourself from the apple proprietary ecosystem.2. Unshackle yourself from your cellular contract.3. Great build quality from Samsung - gorilla glass, nice textured back. I am shocked at how nice this phone is for the price. Feels great in your hand (button placement notwithstanding.)4. It is a great size (I'm not fan of the mega-screen phones out these days) and is very lite-weight.I wasn't sure if Android 2.3 is a pro or a con. It is the most common Android version, but not the latest and I expect support gets worse over time.Basically, across all dimensions this phone is slightly worse than an iphone 4 but it is dramatically less expensive. Overall it is very, very good phone and a really great value.If you want latest-greatest, this is definitely not it.

This is my first smartphone, and I've been a NET10 customer for about 3 years. I've used my wife's IPhone 4s and it's not for me. So, I bought this phone because I didn't want to be in a contract, I wanted an Android phone and I wanted to get unlimited everything at good price.When it comes to NET10, as long as you don't need to call NET10 customer service, it's a great service. You can do almost everything from their website. I've never had a bad experience calling them, but for $45/$50 a month, you have to cut some corners.Activation was very easy and quick from the website. I didn't transfer a number, so I was assigned a new number. My old NET10 phone number was previously used. I was sick of the collection calls for the person who had the number before me.  So, I would suggest transferring your current number if possible.First the Specs on this phone states 5.5 hrs talk time. I would say 5.5 is accurate, if you're using it with the screen on. I used the navigation for about 2 hrs and then some music for about another half hour and my battery was at about 50%.I believe the 16 day standby number is a little off or not stated correctly. When not in use, the phone uses about 1% an hour. If you put the phone in airplane mode it greatly improves the battery life, but no calls can go in or out. Battery life has a lot to do with the display and what's running in the background.I would suggest getting an app killer app and battery life meter that shows %. You'll be able to kill apps running in the background and know your battery life in a glance.I didn't buy the phone for its camera and that's a good thing if you own this one. The camera is acceptable, but in lower light it becomes useless if the subjects are moving. I was pleased with the video camera in the same low light. Remember no flash and I think the camera was more of an afterthought on this phone.I did buy this phone to use as my MP3 player. I had some question but I wasn't able to answer them until I used the phone.  I have a Windows computer and I use Windows Media Player for all my music. You can use the provided cord to hook the phone to your computer. Once you're able to get WMP to see the phone you can sync the music over. BUT, if you're using a playlist, you must manually move it over and drop it in the Music folder.  It comes with two music players, if you use the Google player it plays you music in the order of your playlist, but the other player puts the music in the opposite order.Overall I have to give this phone a 5 star review because of the value for the price. If I spent over $150 for the phone I might consider giving it a 4 star review. Besides the initial cost, if you sign up with NET10 to charge your account each month, it's only $45 (plus tax), and no major carrier comes close to that price.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Help??", "Author": "Abby", "ReviewID": "R13QDFH6TSW0AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Samsung Galaxy Proclaim because of all the good reviews.

Net10 customer service has been good, actually great compared to Straightalk!  Nightmare!!  But this is supposed to be Verizon towers.  I do live in a log signal area but usually not matter if it was a Verizon phone, Straightalk phone, 2 miles down the road full signal.  Nope!  Half a bar to one-half bar and my hubby phone a flip one at that, had full signal and all my phones have had full signal.  Also will not change screens at times no matter how many times you tap it!  Then the timer as to how long screen is to stay on, set at 2 minutes, more than half the time would only stay ONE second!  Annoying!  Would suddenly just change to a screen and you have not done a thing to prompt it.  So went to Net10 site and it had me put in my zip and a list of phones came up.  This one was not one of them.  Did it twice but yet on bringing up the exact same site 2 other times, it did not ask for my zip on any of the phones!  Tech said no SIM card, it should get reception as many Verizon towers and Sprint around me.  He agreed the phone was faulty.  I just ordered an LG Optimus Extreme Net10, will be paying about $40 more as although cheaper than the $140.00 at Net10, $132.22 (I have Prime) but it is one suggested for my area.

The camera is pretty good, It is 3 megapixel and it takes very decent photos for a phone camera. The screen is nice and bright and very detailed, it is not high resolution but its small size makes that very unnoticeable. I have no problems reading small text on it. The build quality it decent, it is plastic after all, but it doesn't feel like it will shatter if I drop it. The phone performs like you would expect being only a single core processor at 1 GHz, it struggles with tasks such as 3D gaming and anything that takes a lot of power to run, but it will play any 2D game fine, Cut The Rope runs perfectly smooth. This phone only has 419 MB of RAM, but I haven't had it run out on me yet. It runs Android 2.3.6, which is getting pretty old and it definitely feels like it. I purchased an app called \"Next Launcher\" for it and it makes it feel like a brand new phone, as you can see in my product pictures. It has enough storage for many apps, as I have installed a lot(15-25)and its only half full. Adding a Micro SD card will give you more room than you will need. The battery life is great due to the low end specs, I can easily go a day off of a charge and with the extended battery (for the Samsung \"Illusion\" same phone different name) I can go way longer, an app called \"JuiceDefender\" really extends the battery. I have rooted this phone and it has made it so much faster, if you don't know what I mean by \"Root\" you will not need to worry about it, If you do know, then I can tell you this was pretty easy to root (it took around ten minutes) All in all this is a pretty fast cheap little phone that hasn't caused me any problems, and that's what most people ask for in a device.

First the Pros, it has a good interface, it has a good bit of apps, good internal memory of 1gz, it has over 800 MB of storage, which can be expanded easily with a micro SD card. Now for the Cons, it freezes up, needs battery removed, constantly needs charged, for me, it's every day, and every night. I keep my wi-fi on all the time, plus the the media on and apps running. I do turn off wi-fi periodically, dim the screen too. It sucks on signal. Even in the boonies, I get a half a bar to one bar, some days I get no service. It does drop calls like crazy. Calling voicemail sucks! The phone is terribly slow if you have too many apps on it too. The phone itself runs off of Verizon towers. I talked to Verizon salesperson, she said it would never be at full signal because it's limited on it. I left very confused, I'd say if you want a smartphone, don't invest in this one. I wish I had thought harder on it. I've dropped mine numerous times on accidents, the phone comes apart easily. The battery overheated on mine too. I got a warning it was. It was just laying on my bed. It does overheat way too easily, even with rubber cases on it, it can overheat. I also had to go buy a 2400 MaH battery pack to charge mine. The cord is too short on it, I ended up buying a 6 foot cord to reach farther, and mine has frozen up a lot on the screen too. The phone screen goes black when calls are made. It's a very nice phone, but, very frustrating too! I'd rather of gotten a samsung galaxy S2 or an IPhone 5. Both are out of my price range though.

As a relative newby regarding smart phones at the time, I ordered a phone that specifically stated in its description would work with Net10 or Straight Talk (which was my provider at the time). It came in a Net10 box, and first I tried to activate it with Straight Talk, and when that didn't work, I called their customer service department. They ASSURED me that they and Net10 were \"sister\" companies, and even transferred me to Net10's customer service department...without having given any real answers (so I guess I'd have to say that I now have a problem with Straight Talk, too). Then, after eleven calls, over four days, for a total of sixteen hours, it became clear that I wasn't going to get any answers from Net10, either. The phone did get activated, and seemed to work fine, but I had other questions, over simple things such as downloading ringers and apps (I did say I was new at the time, so had a lot to learn, and asked lots of questions)...and kept getting the exact same answer: \"Ma'am, I'm so sorry you're having a problem, but I have the exact same phone as you, and I can assure you that this works,\" without then explaining HOW to make it work.

Stover", "ReviewID": "R2P31DHGE6ZEJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are plenty of mixed reviews on this phone. I have had mine for a couple of months. This is thorugh Straigh Talk & this phone uses Verizon towers. I've read there's two versions of this phone. One uses Verizon, the other uses Sprint. Mine uses Verizon.First: Customer Service.I have not had any problem w/customer service. I have purchased 2 of these phones(1 for me, one for my spouse) and each time they had no problem w/transferring my phone #'s from AT&T.; Secondly they're very mannerly & repeat everything to make sure they have it correctly. I have not spoken to one that English is not their second language, but they all are polite & got my service correct the first time. My service was connected within 4-6 hours each time. I activated my phones at night & by the next moring they were ready to go!Second: CameraThis phone is easy to use. It has a tutorial function that makes it easy for someone who is not familiar w/a smartphone. Browsing is easy. Texting & chat is easy. Everything is a breeze w/this phone. And the camera(which a few reviews are poor) is plain & simple- use your options! It takes AWESOME indoor photos if you use the low light feature. I take great indoor pics when selecting the scene mode. there are 12 different options here that work for all different things(fireworks, backlight, night, etc). Think about it reasonably; isnt the lighting dimmer indoors?? Yes, it is. So you use the nighttime/low light option & your indoor pics will turn out just as good as the outdoor.The camcorder option is basically the same as the camera.Third: ReceptionWith the Verizon towers, it's great. I can be in timbucktoo(the boonies) and still get at least 3 bars. Which is totally awesome and the clarity of my calls are great. I use bluetooth alot & it was easy to set up. Not to mention everyone tells me I'm \"loud & clear\" which is great!Fourth: Internet useageIf you're using this like you would a laptop, go for the $60/mo plan as it is unlimited everything. Otherwise if you are a casual user & set it up to work off any wi-fi it finds(hotspots, gym, work, restaurants, home, etc) then you wont run out. I dont & I use mine ALL the time & I'm on the $45/mo plan.Fifth: Everything elseNavigator(gps) is great. I like the speaking feature so if your driving you just tell it the address & you're good to go.Texting is a breeze. And the voice activated messaging feature is awesome. It rarely gets it wrong.\"Screen freeze\" well, this is plain & simple: GET A MEMORY CARD. This phone is a 2gb phone. If you are downloading games & other apps on this phone you MUST invest in one(other wise it freezes up). It will hold up to 32mb microSD card. Getting one is a necessity. You can get 4gb to 32gb for $4 to $25 on Ebay. I've seen them just as cheap at Office Max & Wal-Mart.Like I referenced above, we have two of these phones & I am planning to buy a third one for my teen. It's much cheaper & great phone & service than what the other providers have. I was an AT&T; customer for over 12 yrs, their $45/mo plan is unlimited talk & text but only 300mb of internet(which is nothing). So if you're trying to make your mind up on this phone, get a NEW one from a wholesaler online($60 max) and check it out.

I overall really liked this phone, it seems very steady, yes pictures in side can dark, make sure do have lighting,but not THAT bad.  I couldn't get the phone to do streaming radio, I thought it should & would? Maybe it was my own limitations? However, sometimes when someone called if you bumped it wrong, it would have the reject screen, that was hard to get rid, until I learned how minimize it. I never watched movies, did do all share with my computer and all the music came over. In the beginning I didn't notice the battery being that short, but as time progressed, yes it really got that way.  Lots of google play aps to get,a I never had dropped calls that weren't explainable at all. When things might stick, I would take the battery out and put it back in. Overall I have been quite happy with this phone, it had maps just like a Garmin, with voice, it seemed to stick, and I guess that might something the company is fixing? Anyway, I was pleased to be saving what I considered enough money, to get a smart phone with all the whistles and not having pay twice as much a month. The main that came up at 1 year and 4 months, a few weeks before this, the phone started to not charge well, it would beep alot more in the like chargers do when they are old, You'd plug it at night and in the morning it would be dead, it would charge a little, in a blink it wasn't charging. I babied it for a couple weeks, trying different chargers to see when it would load. Did see on Andriod boards that this happened alot to some of the phones. It harder and harder to keep a charge and flash the screen for no reason, and now is pretty much done. I did talk with Straighttalk, and since out of warranty, I'm going to Walmart to see if they have battery tester to see if it the phone. The battery I noticed today, has swelling at the bottom, so I do think it is bad, but we'll find out.

After owning this phone for 6 months I can firmly say that there are some awesome things about it, and some maddening things about it as well.The Good:  This is a Straight Talk phone that works with the Verizon network.  I have experienced only one dropped call in 6 months, and I even get reception at work (I'm one of the lucky 10% of my work mates that do). Internet is really fast and seamless.  The GPS navigation feature that's pre-installed is pretty awesome.  I forgot my car GPS when traveling to MO for work, and my phone took me 3 hours from the airport to the hotel with no issues at all.  The ringtone is certainly loud enough for my needs, and the sound quality of the ringtone and for calls is pretty good.  Apps were easy to install and I've never had an issue accessing any of them.The Bad: Texting on this thing SUCKS.  The predictive text is calibrated weird and I find myself constantly having to fix words (easily 5 times in a 2 sentence text).  The voice feature for this is a good work-around, but sometimes I feel stupid talking into my phone to text so I don't have to deal with the horrible touch pad.  Battery life on this thing is pretty bad as well.  I installed Juice Defender which helps a LOT, but if I didn't have it the battery would go from 100% to 10% within 12 hours with minimal texting, a few short calls, and no internet use.  I also really dislike the calling features on this.  When I want to call someone, I have to click though multiple screens to bring up their number.  Again, voice recognition helps with this a lot.  Calendar features weren't great, but I synced it to my Google Calendar and I'm happy now.The What the _____??: For a cheap prepaid phone I expected some glitches, and I got them!  Even though there are \"technically\" sound levels for my ringtone, there's really only one.  It's either \"on full blast\" or \"vibrate\".  Also, when I miss a call and click on the missed call icon my my homescreen, the missed call comes up.  But when I call \"call back\", about 75% of the time my phone starts calling the last number I actually talked to (which is usually my husband so it's not so bad, but still really weird).  Also, sometimes my phone doesn't ring at all and I simply get a voicemail message.  This doesn't happen often, but it occurs no matter how many bars I have, or whether I was currently using the phone or not.  And about 10% of the time voice recognition goes crazy.  I ask to call \"John Smith\" and my phone will say \"Call Carlina Holzbrook\" or some other name not remotely close to what I asked for.  I can repeat the request multiple times and get several more weird suggestions, no matter the absence of background noise.Overall, I'm fairly pleased with this phone.  There are definitely some quirks and drawbacks, but not enough to deter me or frustrate me so much that I'd consider getting rid of it.  If you're looking for a phone with all the bells and whistles, this is NOT the phone for you.  If you're looking for a phone that will be decent with calls, make it easy to access a few apps, and jump on the internet, this isn't a bad choice at all.

Upgrading my wife's LG Env3 with a shared plan for more money and losing my unlimited was not an option.This phone works fabulously for us. I activated it Saturday evening and had to wait till Monday to actually activate it. Apparently Net10 only works weekdays for activation with porting. They actually called me and we corrected my Verizon account number and ported my wife's number to the phone that moment. I activated the phone when I got home and it has been working perfectly so far. The Net10 representative's English was very good as well.I added a few applications, Handcent for texting and a data monitor app. I doubt my wife will use all the 1.5GB data allotment per month. Before porting my wife's number I went to the Verizon website, saved her contacts to a file and uploaded them to her Google account. Like magic all her contacts and addresses were there. I moved her pictures to the supplied micro SD card as well.The voice quality has been good and YouTube works perfectly. Other video streaming works with only minor issues as well. With the data limits it would be best to do your streaming video and music on wifi only. I selected a Net10 phone because they stated 1.5GB of data allowed per month. Straight Talk claims unlimited but in reality they throttle or cut you off after 1.5-2GB.If you are willing to be your own first level of tech support or have a friend or spouse to help, then this is a great little phone and the savings keep coming each month. If you need someone to hold your hand and or want to walk in somewhere, hand you phone to someone and say, \"Fix it.\" Then this is NOT the phone for you. Me, I hope this phone lasts 3 years or more like her ENV3 did.

They had me \"troubleshoot\" the phone for 4 days straight, with the exact same steps, before finally deciding that the phone was defective.  On 12/3/12 contacted Executive Resolution Department and return shipping instructions were sent to me with the label to follow from Fedex.  By 12/5/12 no label by Fedex emailed to me.  Called Executive Resolution Department again and another ticket was created and return shipping instructions sent to me on 12/5/12.  Again no Fedex shipping label.  On 12/6/12 called them again and was told physical address label would need to be created and sent to me by mail which would take 3-5 business days. To put is lightly I was not pleased and asked the rep what I was to do for the next week to 10 days without a business cellphone.  No response.  By this point I had been out of a business phone for 7 days so I told the rep that I was through dealing with Straightalk.  I promptly went to MetroPCS and bought and new phone and ported my number.  On 12/7/12 two Fedex labels finally showed up in my email box each within 5 minutes of each other.12/6/12 I cancelled my Straigtalk service via email.  12/10/12 I got a return call from Straightalk and was left a message to call them back.  I called back just to make sure my service was cancelled.  I was informed that the cell service was cancelled and that the phone was inactive.  I then asked about the last 8 days of the service period when I didn't have cell service and when that would be credited back to my credit card.  I was informed that no credit would be made by her or anyone else at Straightalk for the 8 days of no cell service that I had.This is the type of company you are going to deal with if anything goes wrong with your phone.  Both Straightalk and Net10 are owned by Tracfone.  Buy at your own risk because if anything goes wrong with your phone you will be SOL.

Activation was simple and initially (my first \"smart\" phone) I was pleased with the phone and thought the service was adequate. My encounters with NET10 tech support were a mixed bag. The online support board is a complete joke. There is no visibility of how, or if any technical questions are answered by the mysterious tech support staff. All issues are \"taken offline\". My experience is offline is where your issue goes into complete ignore mode. Phone in support was actually pretty good, though the path to solutions to questions was always circuitous.I ended up abandoning this phone after 2 months use because of quirky keyboard problems that seemed to be related to certain locations where I made calls. Keyboard (ie number dialed would not be recognized and calls could not be initiated) input would not be recognized in certain areas, but the problem would go away when I moved a few miles to another location. It was all very quirky and nearly impossible to debug or fully explain. I switched to another carrier and phone and am quit happy.In summary I cannot recomment this phone or NET10 as a carrier.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Net 10 sucks~", "Author": "Stella Koch", "ReviewID": "R2LOH6T8KCYXV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is the 5 net 10 phone I have had since Feb of 2013 it has been a constant battle getting service, and getting my phone to work period.
