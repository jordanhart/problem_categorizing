Also, it is entirely made of plastic. For both of those reasons, if you are delicate, this phone is ideal.Because of these issues I will take of one star.  If it was made by Apple or Motorola I would have taken off two stars since I would have expected more.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sansung Flight 2 is a terrible phone.", "Author": "kellycs", "ReviewID": "RDXFO4Y0UKL4G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The only good feature is the keyboard, very easy to use.  The touch screen is horrible.  It is not responsive, it has to be touched repeatedly to do the task.

I replaced it twice (this is my 2nd replacement), but only this phone had any misfunctions (after being left out in the rain for a whole weekend! I'm lucky only a bonkers ringer/ external speaker was the only problem!). Anyway all my phones did all I told them to with little to no fuss, I HIGHLY suggest this phone to anybody who does not have a stable income like mine (is NOT stable), don't think you HAVE to deal with a hefty smartphone fee! Anyway here are my pros and cons (well only cons since I'm sure you know all the pro's)-well first off the battery life IS PHENOMINAL it'll last about a day under heavy use, more than half a week IF YOU CHARGE IT RIGHT! Luckily I always turn my phone off before charging and that is what I suggest you do. The charging meter is unreliable, the final bar is like 10x as large as the rest so it seems like you NEVER charge your phone enough if you don't turn it off first. You CAN charge it when it's on, but it won't last more than a few hours under normal use.the screen when talking on the phone is VERY un user friendly... I'm not experienced with other touchscreen phones but DANG this thing is aggravating! Everything else is fine I just can't stand looking at my phone and UNLOCKING IT every time I have to do something while in a conversation. I just wish there was a button for that.I don't use the GPS so I can't comment but there IS one... I think. If ATT still supports it. Many of the software functions of this phone is starting to become unsupported and that sucks... Not that I use any of them anyway butYes the screen is a dinky 4.5\" but everything from youtube to a variety of message board forums work just fine! I don't play any facebook games but... well the processor is ancient so I'm not expecting much.There are no 'apps' sorry it's NOT a smartphone, just the basics. OK there may be some basic programs you can d/l but probably nothing special. Just sayin' it's a phone not a game console (though it CAN youtube- I didn't try hulu, netflix and the like... I doubt they'd work BUT good ole' youtube!). I don't play music on it but the 3.5\" headphone plug is right there xD.The internal (phone) speaker has never been SUPER easy to hear. It's not bad just... I would not give it an awardDon't bother if your paranoid, there is NO security on this phone, the locking feature is only there to annoy you not to keep bad guys out :x.sliding the KB out is rather tough some times, it can snag on a stubborn gear, a grain of sand or a rock if your phone is dirty. I usually keep my phone in a clean environment, I work from home so it rarely leaves the house anyway! but yeah, if you live on the beach or on a swamp or something this may not be the phone for you!Overall though, I LOVE this phone! And maybe I'm just too scared to make the step to a smartphone (it's just like 30 bucks extra a MONTH!) but I'd rather use that extra $360/ year on a new PS4 or something thank you. This phone does everything I need it to do with very little fuss.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "this is a good messaging phone", "Author": "PLS \"pls\"", "ReviewID": "RW3R8Y1OMPP6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "By early 2014 there aren't too many messaging phones left on the market by name brands that we can trust.  If you aren't going to get a smart phone and the big data plans then this phone is a good phone that both my wife and teenage son are happy with.  My wife has no patience for difficult to use technology and she picked this up and used it immediately.  Their Flight 1's both lasted over 2 years and worked reliably and the 2 has a few minor improvements that they have mentioned.  My wife likes that it isn't quite as slick and easier to hold.

I purchased a go phone that I though would do well until contract with ATT was up but the key board was to small.  The key board on this is great!  The touch screen seems to be reacting better than the previous one that got washed in washing machine by accident.  Needed new phone before contract ended.  Advantage is I know how this one works so learning curve.  Still not a perfect phone but for texting excellent.  Just with the touch screen would see me and react when I need it.

For over 9 years, I have struggled with phones that drop calls CONSTANTLY and lose network connection when I simply went into most buildings. I'd have to go outside to get the phones to reconnect to the network. This was not the answer, for many times, the network would not connect unless I turned the phone off and on.  However, this did not work everytime. In my house, there are only two places I could have any type of conversation. If I was talking on my phone and tried to send of receive a text message, my phone would disconnect. I'd begin looking for and researching phones within months of purchasing a new phone.  I've read  hundreds of reviews for cell phones and was dismayed to read all the poor reviews for ALL phones.  If the reception and connection is so poor for people with the big city, what catastrophe awated me in the piney woods? But, after my phone disconnecting my calls 65 times in less than 10 minutes, I knew I HAD to upgrade.  I hesitantly chose the Samsung Flight 2. To my amazement, when I got home, the phone worked.When I went to work,I was AMAZED when I was droped NOT ONE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've had the phone for about 6 weeks now. I know there are things about the phone that are problems; the touch screen being quirky, the battery life, the inability to perform some functions when talking.  But the simple fact is: these are really trifling and can be easily resolved.  The bottom line is, the best phone is the one that works.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!", "Author": "Crystal Monsaw", "ReviewID": "R3GKU51GQXZL0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy my phone, I also got one for my daughter.

Hau \"Larry Hau\"", "ReviewID": "R3E6MWQ6X98TWW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is ok except that, due to a defect, the battery life may be wildly inconsistent.  On my phone, the battery may last 4 or 5 days without use, but at random intervals, it may drain in about 3 hours.  This also seems to affect the long-term battery life, so that it will have to be replaced every 3 to 4 months.Most of the time, the battery works fine.  Only problem is that you never know when it will suddenly drain quickly.  As a result, you can never depend on this phone.  When it drains, you have to remove the battery, put it back in and recharge the phone.  Normally, it will then hold a charge... but you never know when it will suddenly drain again.I see there are several complaints about the touch screen.  I have also had this problem but found that sliding the phone open and pressing a number on the keypad makes the touch screen work.  As a result, I could live with this problem if it wasn't for the inconsistent battery life.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slow with a bunch of random problems.", "Author": "Kensuke Nakamura", "ReviewID": "RCLVF2JAG6OBL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this phone. Here are the problems I've had:Battery is wildly inconsistent, the battery charge indicator does not help in determining how much time you have left. Even with bluetooth off and making very few calls, a full charge can last a few days or less than 24 hours.Sometimes trying to read certain text messages will cause my phone to restart.The alarm clock will randomly turn itself off, as in the alarm doesn't sound, and when I check the alarm settings, it has switched itself off. This has happened on many occasions.The touchscreen is inaccurate and noticeably slow. This is really irritating when trying to navigate menus, because I will press one icon and then wait a second to find out it hit the wrong icon and wait another second to go back. It's menu structure can also be counter-intuitive. Sometimes, even the physical keyboard gets so lagged that it will only pick up 4 letters out of a sentence.The shortcut icons that you can move to the desktop move around on their own randomly and sometimes overlap. It will also sometimes drop other shortcuts you didn't ask for on the desktop. It's a minor inconvenience, but irritating nonetheless.I highly recommend not getting this phone.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow I just got this phone", "Author": "Jay Ulitsky", "ReviewID": "R2GMNMV18Y1QMZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi yea i recently had a pantech laser GREAT phone but it broke and it wont carge so my warrenty they cant gimme the laser cause tehy say they dont amke it anymore they gave me a choice between flight 2 and rugby 2 i picked flight 2.
