Love the fact that its dustproof and water resistant and comes with scratch resistant screen. My problem when I got this phone was that it's headset didn't work with the phone which is both odd and frustrating since I use the headsets alot when I'm on the go. That alone makes this for me at least, a bad buy since the accessories should be compatible with it. Factory unlocked is great since I can use this phone with any carrier and it is a fast phone, haven't seen any lag times in switching screens and apps.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the phone but...", "Author": "Janzen", "ReviewID": "RBANTG8I9OAOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is great for my needs, the water and dust resistance is amazing! But these guys sent me the Chinese version...I now own a Chinese wall plug for my phone...compleatly worthless. At least it charges via USB as well and it wasn't difficult to change the phone to English settings, the other plus is I now know how to use it to text Japanese, but really wish that they would have at least specified on the page because now I have to wait a week for a USA friendly plug that I ordered to come in and had to pay some extra cash for it. Other than that, this phone is gorgeous, came in great condition, and meets all the specs.

About the phone, is all you heard about it, im happy with my purchase.EDIT: 2014 More than a year have passed, the actualizations mess up the phone, forums are full with problems little help from Sony, the thing i hate the most I can't have a long conversation with it it reaches 40\u00baC and is uncomfortable to hold it next to your ear, and just 512mb of Ram... yes is water proof but it have usb conectivity issues after upgrade, camera is slow, i have to wait like 30 sec to make a call.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely LOVE this phone", "Author": "D Lowe", "ReviewID": "R2VNLX5JI5WVVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is hands down overall the best phone I've ever had.  Being an active person I've taken this thing mountain biking, paddleboarding,canoeing, skateboarding, and running and it's still going!  It's been thrown around quite a bit and has survived many falls where I expected to pick up a shattered screen and it didn't even have a scratch.  The camera takes high quality pictures and videos.  Android runs really well and is definitely the way to go with all the different apps for all I do (cars, bikes, finances, music, knitting).  I don't use data too often but when I do it's always there when I want it and it looks very sleek and elegant (not what you'd expect with this level of durability).  Definitely unique as well, I haven't seen anybody else with an Xperia and I've had 2.  If you're active and looking for a phone that won't slow you down this is it!  My only minor gripe is Sony's weird female jack they use which isn't always compatible with the controls on some headsets.  Just find the right one that has an adapter like I did and you're good!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone | Good battery | Fast processor | Really water and dust proof", "Author": "HOMERO ALMEIDA", "ReviewID": "RN4P0OIVVHFXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is great, i really have no much to say about it.

Basically, at an angle, you can see a horizontal light leaking at the top edge of the screen.  According to Sony support, this isn't normal BUT several other users have noticed this issue with the screen.Sony really needs to focus on quality control instead of releasing 10 different phones every few months.The phone itself is pretty good for what it is.  Perfect \"fit in your pocket\" phone.  Thin and very light weight.  The rubberized backing is nice.  No need to slap on a tacky case to protect the phone.This would have been a great phone if Sony decides to ever fix the screen issue, increase the ram to at least 1gb, and make it a IPS screen.The phone comes with Gingerbread.  Runs pretty smooth with it.  When upgrading to ICS, several users complained that the phone is now lagging.  Not surprised here since the phone has about 512mb ram.  There are talks of Jellybean coming to this device.  But not exactly how sure it will work with such as tiny amount of ram.Sony really cut corners on this phone.  Corporate should realized that consumer are willing to PAY for a good phone.  Instead of using a cheap screen with light bleed issues, 512mb ram, low res display, etc etc.  Also the camera is crap under low light conditions.  The camera doesn't have to many features from what I can see.  No burst mode, no effects, just point and shoot and call it a day.I returned both phones due to the light leak issue.  I will be waiting for the Xperia Go 2 and see if Sony implements some major upgrades.This phone is not with $250.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3Q0GKG2U9EK6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shipped quickly.
