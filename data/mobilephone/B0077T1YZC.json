It's probably the most portable, cost effective personal safety device on the market.As a lifelong allergy and asthma sufferer who's had a few close calls, I had considered purchasing a medical alert button before but I found every other service far too expensive (and just a little bit uncool... hey I'm only 29). Then I found the 5Star Responder. 5Star is so much more than your typical medial alert button. It's really like a personal emergency concierge or an On*Star for people.5Star isn't just for medical emergencies. You can call 5Star for any urgent or potentially urgent situation. You could be afraid to walk to your car alone at night, run low on gas and need directions to the nearest station, or hear strange noises in your home. At the push of a button a friendly 5Star agent will come on the line and offer assistance. Thanks to the unit's built in GPS the agent on the line will know exactly where you are and where to send help if you need it.The responder device retails for under $50 and the monthly service fee (after a one time activation charge) is just $14.99 with no contract and it works anywhere on the Verizon network. This means that unlike a traditional medical alert button that's fixed to your home, the 5Star responder goes with you and is ready to provide assistance anywhere you happen to be. The device is small and weighs just 1.8 ounces. I keep mine clipped to my belt and I hardly notice I'm wearing it. When traditional medical alert companies charge $30-45 dollars a month for a service you can't take with you, 5Star is definitely a bargain. As an added bonus, 5Star even offers a LiveNurse service that a 5Star agent can conference in for you to answer any of your health or medical questions.Best of all, GreatCall's 5Star Response has rock star customer service. I had a little trouble getting my device to activate due to a technical problem with a Verizon tower in my area. As a techie I usually hate calling tech support or customer service centers but Great Call connected me with the best customer service agent I've ever worked with. Not only did he seem concerned with my service... but he seemed concerned about me as a person and by the end of the call I felt like I was talking to a trusted friend or colleague.GreatCall also offers a 5Star Response app for the iPhone. I tested the app and it worked well too but I ultimately decided to go with the 5Star Responder as a standalone unit because if you're like me your iPhone is never charged when you need it or perhaps you don't carry it around with you in the gym. The standalone unit has much better battery life and is a lot easier to keep with you. It might be nice if 5Star offered some sort of combination where you could have both the stand alone device and the maybe the iPhone app for just a few dollars more (it never hurts to have a backup) but so far that's not an option.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my service and my purchase and I would highly recommend this device to anyone who is concerned about their personal safety.Update: GreatCall now lets you use the mobile app for no additional cost if you have the 5star Responder. You just need to download the app on your smart phone and use the same email address you used to register your 5star responder.  The mobile app will share the same profile as your 5star responder.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Peace of mind - I bought 2 for loved ones", "Author": "mentatchris", "ReviewID": "RHDG9IQRT567E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two.  I think this is a great product - particularly for women.  Real people answer when you call, and they are very helpful.My mother in law is in her 50s, drives an older car, and often works late doing photography.  She's very independent, but my wife and I worry about her. She travels all around, often to urban locations, to take photos. We're particularly worried about her walking to her car, or walking by herself in the city.I bought her one of these.  She has a cell, but there's no way she's going to get to it in an emergency with the camera and bag and all the other stuff she often carries. With this thing, she can clip it to her bag, and call for help with one button press.  Pretty cool.So, I also bought one for my wife's grandmother.  She's 80, and lives alone (also independent).  She had a scary incident a couple of months ago when she was sick with the flu, and couldn't get to the phone.  A neighbor found her.  This thing would have helped.My mother in law is very happy with the gift.  She called me later to tell me how much she liked it, and how much safer it makes her feel.Very glad I bought. For $50 a piece, it's cheap enough to try. The monthly is $15 for 1, $9 for each additional.  $25/month isn't much to know they're safe.

I purchased this unit only to find out that it is cheaply made and not \"waterproof\"...something that is essential, especially in the bathroom when taking a shower or bath.

At the end of March my credit card was charged for $20.00....$5.00 more than the monthly fee of 14.95 that was due. This payment should have covered me from the end of March to the end of April. WRONG!!!!I called on April 10th to cancel but was told that, although my account presently showed a zero balance due, that I was going to be charged an additional $14.95 plus tax at the end of April in order to close out my account. After 1/2 hour of going back and forth about the extra month's charge, I was told that this was the company policy and that they bill at the end of the month for the previous month.....which made no sense at all. I understand that $14.95 plus tax doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you multiply it by the number of customers who are attempting to cancel.....it starts to add up and become a real profit center for the company.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not work for me", "Author": "Brad Friske", "ReviewID": "R2KM8FO0SN4ZGR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even after verifying coverage in my area on the First Call website in reality I had little to no coverage.

Having a tool for \"Urgent Response\" that only works part of the time is like having none at all. Amazon's return was easy and no hassle at all. Getting back my activation fee from First Call was tougher. Even after their own tech support people said I should return it because I would not be able to count on a reliable signal I had to wait for an answer from accounting to see if they would refund my activation fee of $25.00.  I don't understand why in a city of 55,000 people and a larger community of over 100,000 the antena of these units is not enough to maintain a signal.

In October, 2012, I purchased a 5-Star Urgent Response for my mom since she is almost 90, lives by herself, and had just recovered from a broken pelvis. Although the product carries a manufacturer's warranty for one year, they do not honor it if the device is worn into a bathroom. Note I did NOT say WORN INTO A SHOWER, BUT WORN INTO A BATHROOM.Back in February, my mom's device starting beeping and randomly calling for help without her even touching the device. When she called to ask to have it fixed, they refused to honor the warranty saying that she must have gotten the device wet.She had admitted that she wore it into the bathroom, but I had installed a hook for her to hang it on when she showered. Plus since she wore the device on the outside of her clothing on a lanyard, she had to remove this device first before removing her clothing to shower.Today I called customer service and they confirmed that they will not honor the warranty because the symptoms shown by the device indicate to them (without any type of examination) that she got it wet.They admitted that just moist hands or a steamy bathroom would be enough to make the device not work, even if it is not taken directly into a shower or tub. According to them, this voids the warranty. IMAGINE IF SHE LIVED IN FLORIDA OR IF IT WAS THE SUMMER TIME WHEN HUMIDITY IS HIGH AND REAL PEOPLE PERSPIRE!PLEASE... DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE!! Most senior accidents happen in the bathroom. Having a device that cannot be worn into the bathroom and hung on a hook outside the shower without breaking is NOT something you want for your elderly relative or friend!This device should not be worn by seniors since it is unreliable and is not made for real people!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Device & Service - But Security Concern", "Author": "Careful Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1QI0U1RA8M6R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We've used this for over three years now. It is highly reliable and allows you to travel anywhere in Verizon's network (which is almost everywhere in the US). It is better to think of this as a cell phone device that has specialized people ready to help you as soon as you push the big button in the center. You talk with them almost instantly. You can test it by pushing that button (they encourage you to do it now and then) and that gives you a feeling of confidence. Their people are incredibly friendly and effective.If you lose your connection, the red light tells you so and you just turn it off and back on, like your cell phone, as long as you're in Verizon's massive US service area. If your home has a weak Verizon signal (like mine does) get a cell extender (Amazon and Verizon have them). They cost about $200 and will give you reception throughout your house (for you cell phones, too).With the locator function, you can authorize anyone you want to be able to go on their website and locate EXACTLY where you are, at any time, either using a map or satellite image. Basic GPS functionality and it works easily.Other reviewers have posted some negative reviews, which I will address:- Ours holds a charge. Never had a problem. Remember; it's like a cell phone you leave on all day. The battery will last as long as your cell phone battery does. They encourage you to charge it by your bed every night, although it can go days on a single charge. It remains functional while it is charging. More than three years now and it still holds the charge.- If you think a $35 one-time fee is too much, you probably don't own a cell phone. I doubt that there are any free services like this. We'll have to wait for Obamacare to give us everything free (I wonder how they are going to pay for that).- I must have forgotten that it's not waterproof. In three years, though, I've never had a problem. I leave it outside the shower. Remember: it's like a cell phone and you can't go swimming with your cell phone, either. However, it would be a good idea for 5Star to provide the option to pay more and buy a waterproof device if you want it. I can see how this could be a significant shortcoming and is the only reason I give it 4 stars. If you need it, and it gets wet, you may end up dead.Security Concern: In order to access your billing information and, therefore, have access to your account, Great Call requires you to verbally establish a pin number with them. You cannot do this online utilizing the layered security which you previously set up on their website. This is extremely insecure, as anyone with a voice could claim to be you.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pitiful - Couldn't Even Locate My Device in My Kitchen", "Author": "G. Cox \"Shanghaied\"", "ReviewID": "R3OG8ZEW21Q283", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update:  Canceled ServiceI can't find my 5 Star Responder device anywhere. If it is still here in the house, I cannot find it. And their device locater doesn't work it appears. And if they can't find the location of the device, then it can't find me either. Cost over $140 for the device, setup and barely over two months service and I wasn't even in the country for three weeks.  Customer service put me on hold forever and I finally hung up. They didn't even bother to call me back.  Next thing I got was an email saying I was disconnected from their service. Their solution was for me to buy another device. It they can't locate my first device, why would I want to buy a second one?Second Update:I finally found it in my upper kitchen cabinet drawer where it blended in with something else. So if it could not find this device in my kitchen, how could I ever depend upon it in an emergency? I will never ever consider this device again in my life.Original Review:This is a compact urgent response device that you can keep strapped to your belt or keychain.  It has adapters for each way. The manual leaves you with conflicting uses for this device.  They make a point it is NOT to be used for critical emergencies such as heart attack, stroke or fire. I think this part must have been written by their corporate lawyer. I learned this after I had already spent $29.58 ($25 plus $4.58 of taxes) to sign up via the internet. That was after their internet signup $10 discount - rather exorbitant taxes. Then with tax on the $15 monthly service fee, it cost me over $20 the first month. They seem to promote emergencies of inconvenience versus medical emergencies. I bought it for emergency medical purposes.They collect all kinds of information during the internet sign-up that took me two hours to complete. They say it only takes 20 minutes, but that would be for someone with no medication and no doctors and no relatives. After I finished the very detailed information data entry, I will say they should be well prepared if I should ever need assistance.To test it is generally a one-way test. You enter a test call via the internet (not this device) and wait for them to call you with an automated dialer saying your device is configured correctly.  And then it said I was located in a city ten miles away. Well, that isn't exactly narrowing down to anything useful. I hope in a real situation it pinpoints my location exactly. Otherwise, I could have saved a lot of money and depended upon my cell phone which displays GPS coordinates for free.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "luvtoshop", "ReviewID": "R3G15MZ10BY1KC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased mine from Walmart and thought it would be just the right safety device for me, however, it did not hold a charge.

Granted, I did a lot of reading of reviews from many sites prior to my purchase.  The price and the GPS feature were the deciding factors for me.  Here's the question I'd like to ask.  Has anybody posted the possible purchase of a lock box for an extra key for the emergency responders to gain entry into your home without damaging your door?  Three years ago I took a fall and couldn't get back up.......wasn't sure if it was a heart attack or stroke.  The nearest phone was up on the wall in the kitchen.  I had no way to call 911.  To complicate matters, I live alone.  I tried getting up 4 or 5 times with no success.  As I was laying there on my back, it finally dawned on me, I had my cell phone in my jeans pocket (duh) and called 911.  I was asked if my front door was unlocked and I said no.  They said, \"don't do anything, we'll get it\".  Not knowing what they meant by \"we'll get in\", I crawled on my stomach for about 25 feet, reached up and unlock both locks, rolled over on my back, and waited for the emergency responders.  I spent two days in the hospital.

So, I made a test call to  5Star to see how quickly they could find me. In this video you'll discover what I found out.So far I value the unit highly. Just a few points. It charges in about an hour. It's easy to use and understand. I wear mine on my belt and when I made this video/audio I did not move it or put it near my mouth.Also, keep in mind that when you hold the button for five seconds, you'll get 9-1-1. So, you can bypass the call center.Finally, at one point I used the name \"Onstar\" by accident. I meant 5Star.UPDATE: 6/4/2014 -- I know this device is not \"waterproof\" but I accidentally dropped in in the toilet nonetheless. I immediately took it out and dried it off. I used the hair dryer to dry it out as best I could. I let it set awhile. I was making arrangements to buy a new one. Well, I put the charger in just to see if it would charge or do damage. Long story short, it's working as well as it ever did.I don't recommend doing something this stupid with the device and I understand they do have a totally new unit out called \"The Splash\" that is in fact waterproof.

Several days later I purchased one for myself since adding a second person was only a few extra dollars.  I live in bear country at a high altitude, so the device was a back-up to my iphone.  Their service is exceptional when you need assistance, or when you feel uncomfortable walking alone to your car behind the office building at night.  I have to deduct two stars for the hardware itself.  The battery wore down quickly and I found myself charging it at home AND work just to make it through the day.  One day the device stopped taking a charge.  The green light indicated the unit was charging, but the unit never turned on/off.  Their hardware technical service department representative was very condescending and refused to replace the device.  It's a $50 dollar device that brings in $20+ dollars a month from me.  I was dumbfounded by their unwillingness to stand behind their product.  Even if it's made by Qualcomm in China.  It's still your hardware with your logo.Needless to say my opinion of them has changed.  However, they are the only company providing this service at this time.  What can you do?FYI. It's been a few days since I wrote this review, as well as emailed 5Star in addition to a voice mail message. I have not heard back from this company.

Since that time, my sister and I have had occasion to check on my mother's whereabouts on a couple of occasions to reassure ourselves that she was OK.

It may sound trite and melodramatic, but if you're the person who has fallen, if is frightening - as it is to a relative many miles away.  The first thing I checked about 5Star is which cellular network they use.I asked on their Facebook page and had an answer within two hours. Verizon. Had they used Sprint, I would have moved on.Sprint currently has the worst network of all the carriers - and I'm a 12 year customer of Sprint. Sprint is awful.  I ordered the unit and tried it out. It works flawlessly. Follow the graphic instructions and you are up and running within a few minutes. The online registration is simple and gives you the opportunity to provide special instructions, such as the location of keys so emergency service responders don't have to break down doors and such.  5Star technical support which I called primarily to test it was readily available and well schooled, not only on the product, but network operation as well. 5Star customer support was quick to answer as well. Fortunately we have not had to use the 5Star in an emergency situation - and I frankly hope that remains the case.  The GPS is phenomenally accurate right down to the street address. I suspect they use nt only GPS but cell tower triangulation as well.  5Star recommends that the battery be charged every night and I agree. You never want to have a dead battery on this kind of device.  By the way, you can use this unit not only for summoning emergency help, but for less critical situations as well.  Overall, I am please with unit and am very glad my relative has it. Makes me feel that he can summon help when he needs it, no matter where he is.

Well, it was one of those cases where you get a product and don't test it out right away, because its just one button - right.  My mistake.  After a couple of months, my wife and I were at my grandparents and the wife (the smarter half) wanted to see this device in action to ensure that it worked.  Fair enough. So...My grandmother presses the button and a person comes on - the next couple of minutes did not go well (to put it mildly).  The agent, following company protocols, started asking detailed (and I mean detailed) questions about my grandmother's location - in the process confusing her greatly.  I ended up taking over and tried to work with the company to see if this procedure could be modified to shorten the time for this action.  Well they did - for me - but I think about other folks and they ought to be considered to.I thought that I performed enough research (perhaps not) but I do believe there was some level of bait-and-switch.  The videos produced from the company show a person pressing a button and the agent determines location (via their special GPS technology) and Great Call can then assess the situation.  Ok.  Well, I felt that the actual assessment was way too long and focused on too many details - eating (unnecessarily so) minutes into the call.Again the people (and I called their customer services line later) are stellar - but they must follow a business policy that I just don't think is wise.  Because of this, I really would caution folks into buying this service.My grandparents come from a different time and their definition of an emergency is way off of today's accepted norms.  E.g.  Earlier this year my grandfather had a heart attack and waited until the clinic down the street was open (it was before opening time) and then drove himself there - he was about to drive himself to the hospital, per the doctor/tests at the emergency clinic, but staff refused him and got him on an ambulance.  So for my grandmother (or grandfather) to press that 'emergency' button -well,  the s* not only has hit the fan, it went through the fan, on the fan, all over the room, and ceiling - time is important, this company probably needs to consider this for at least this demographic of their user base.Maybe this company could fix this in a modification within their 'production system' - I spent a good hour putting into their database every piece of information that I thought would be useful.  Perhaps they could have a sign-off if you would like the company to give a shorter assessment cycle to the end user due to concerns about the user's abilities to answer any questions under normal/typical conditions?", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best on the Market", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R1PD6LHXDXZB0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 81-year-old mother had been dropping not-so-subtle hints for quite a while about wanting a \"life line\" caller to carry with her.

She is the caregiver and I worry just as much about her well-being. This past spring she had the flu and I was trying to reach her. After several no answers from the land line or cell phone I contacted 5Star who was very professional and direct with me. They located the device in their apartment and attempted a call with no response.  They had me on hold and professionally related their attempts and their recommendation.  On my (thankfully) brief drive to my parents I tried the land line one more time and my Mom answered and was embarrassed. I told her I was happy and then advised her to press the button on the unit and to speak with a representative to clear this call.  She said the professional on the other end was polite and related they were grateful all is well.I will say setting things up for the service does take someone comfortable with setting up an Internet account of some kind (Amazon, Facebook, etc)and it not for the non-Internet savvy person. Installing the app on a smartphone (Droid in my situation) was as simple as any other app to install.I am happy that it worked as advertised, was as precise a location finder as I could have hoped, and the representative was as professional as I would have expected.  The monthly service charge is reasonable. The piece of mind is priceless.I am very happy that this device is portable, but I now read it does require access to sufficient cell service towers to be reliable.  In my situation that is sufficient.  I like the fact that it is cellular and a response could be summoned at home or away from home, as long as cellular reception is available.The unit talks or ques when it needs charging or has an issue. I don't have experience yet with how many times the battery can be charged - and I hope 5 Star sends out a replacement without the unit going inactive.I have recommended this device and service to many others due to the cellular nature and the reasonable monthly cost of the service.

The monthly service for the device is $14.99 plus tax (I pay a little over $18 per month with taxes). LifeAlert, last I checked, was over $30 per month. The unit is priced around $50. LifeAlert is around $90 last I checked. The device give you two contact options:  1) GreatCall Center Dispatcher 2) Direct to 911. This is really good as sometimes you aren't sure if you need 911 so the trained call center rep can help with basic emergencies or uncertainties.

The fact that you don't need to have a base unit and can take this with you wherever you go is a huge bonus over those home-only base-unit systems. It reminds you when the battery needs charging but if you plug it in each night like you would your cell phone/smart phone, you won't have any problems keeping it charged.We had to have the charger replaced within the 1st 2 days of having this unit in our home. When plugged into the wall, it hummed and buzzed -- then it started to smell like burning wires so I pulled the plug on it. They sent another one and, fortunately, in the interim I was able to use my phone's micro USB charger.After about 2 months, the unit began failing to hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. Yes, HOURS. I tried over a period of a week to get the thing to top off the battery but it wouldn't and it started to get really \"old\" being woken in the middle of the night by the unit alerting us that it was low on power and needed to be recharged... if only it would do so...I called 5Star/Great Call and they offered to replace the unit immediately. But I had to pay shipping. That just sucks -- if it's under warranty, they should be bending over backwards to provide good customer service and making me fork over more money to get a replacement sent to us didn't do it for me.The replacement unit worked properly for about 5 months and then it, too, starting to refuse to hold a charge. I didn't wait a week this time -- I called the 2nd day. I got a customer service rep who very simply asked me: have you rebooted the unit? What? Rebooting the unit... imagine that.... No where in their instructions does it say that if the unit fails to take a charge that you should reboot it. To be honest, I didn't even realize there was an off/on switch on the darn thing because it NEVER gets turned off. EVER.Long story short, he told me to hold in the little tiny button on the side of the unit until it shut down and then repeat that to turn it back on. Then he told me to plug it in and charge it until the light held solid (no flashing). It worked like a charm and the unit is back to behaving properly at it's been over a month since that re-set. It's a good thing because I was about to move on to another system -- if you're ordering this because you need someone to have instant access to help and it can't be trusted it's not worth keeping. And it doesn't matter if $15/month is the best price you've ever seen for this type of service -- no trust, no keep... priceless person needs to be safe.My overall impressions:The unit is kind of big and bulky compared to others we've used with the base-unit home-only systems we've had previously. That makes sense because it needs to perform the functions of the base unit in something that's wearable. We can live with the extra size but it's not a subtle unit. Unless it's under your clothing, people will see it. Not a big deal but something to consider.I had to purchase a lanyard because my hubby needs to have that type of access to the unit when out and about. When he's in bed, we just leave it within reach on his bedside table. The lanyard is perfect when we're on the move.It's not waterproof or water resistent and while an optional waterproof pouch is sold by the company so that you could wear the unit in the shower, it's $20 and that's pretty ridiculous. But if you need to be safe in the shower, unless you want to pay that price, you'll have to figure out some other way to keep the unit dry while you take care of getting clean.The fact that you can use this unit anywhere there's Verizon cell service is a really big deal. I also appreciate that they market this product for non-elders who would benefit from being able to access help with the push of a button. Think about a dark parking lot or street and feeling unsure about whether you're being followed... what a blessing to have one of these on your key ring and be able to get someone on the phone who can call the authorities for you while you keep your hands free and concentrate on getting to the safety of your car, office or home. How about the Alzheimer's or dementia patient who is prone to wandering and manages to leave their home or facility without someone seeing. The GPS chip in this thing would allow the person to be tracked by the authorities or the person who sets up the account associated with the unit.

I got this item to track my 5 year old, the GPS maps shows him standing 8 blocks from school IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY! When I called Tech Support, they deferred to the team of engineers and they basically said, based on the triangulation and where the satellite is picking up, that it was \"acceptable\". REALLY!!!! So if he were to go missing where do you even start looking? It logs him arriving places about 1.5hours after he's gotten there, the iphone app used to work but they've since done an upgrade and since then it's been a mess. For a device that's meant to give you some peace of mind it does nothing but fill you with anxiety because it appears he's wandered off and you have to make sure that it's the GPS that's actually wrong and not that your child has actually wandered off.Their customer service is extremely poor - they are incapable of handling any issues and they don't even know when their service departments are open. After waiting on hold for 12 minutes to get through to customer service, I was on hold an additional 5 minutes waiting to be put through to tech support only for the rep to come on and say tech support wasn't open yet.The app on my iphone to track my device stopped working about 2 weeks ago - every time I've called they've told me they were working on updates and the problem would be resolved shortly. Well it's not. I've been transferred to technical support about 6 times to address the same issue - the same issue has been escalated to \"the engineers\" 3 times and after another 30 minute session with technical support it still doesn't work.The icing on the cake was the tech support rep saying \"it's not really working, I completely understand if you want to disconnect the service but why not give me till tomorrow to see if the engineers get back to me\".Not sure America's Most Wanted should still have their name associated with this product.UPDATE: Well, I waited another day, they still can't seem to make it work. They feel that the service I'm getting is acceptable. If you're looking for something that notifies you that your loved one is at the wrong place at the wrong time then this is the device for you. The contacted me today to say that my son had pushed the alert button but they were able to determine that he was safe. When I looked at the map he was 8 blocks from where he was supposed to be, they couldn't give me the name of the adult that came online and told them my son was safe, they couldn't say for certain that he was actually at school and told me to call to the school to verify.If I want to call the school on a regular basis to make sure my son is where he's supposed to be I certainly don't need a Great Call tech to disrupt my day, worry me needlessly to do so.Save yourself the anxiety and trouble.

I bought it both as a safety device when I'm out alone and as a medical device because I have asthma.  It is small, lightweight, unobtrusive, and holds a charge for several days.

She's very new device-phobic, and basically was unwilling or unable to learn how to charge it (it requires using a USB charging port on  the device.) So it just sat around, unused, in a drawer for quite a long time (and I foolishly kept paying the monthly service charges.) I finally decided to get her a different device that doesn't require recharging, so I called GreatCall today to cancel. (They don't allow you to cancel on their website, for reasons that soon became obvious.)The person I spoke to clearly didn't listen to what I was saying (he kept repeating that I had a Jitterbug phone, which I did not, and he also seemed to think the device was for my use, when I clearly told him it was for my mother.) And then I had to go through exhaustive questioning about why I wanted to cancel. I made it quite clear that the device had not been used and was never GOING to be used, yet he persisted in asking irrelevant and unnecessary questions. Then he had to go \"speak to his supervisor\" and he put me on hold. (I felt like I was buying a car!) When he came back, he gave me some canned speech about \"how much we care for our customers and want to make sure they're safe\" and offered me a free month of service, etc. I interrupted him and said that this was NOT going to happen and that my decision to cancel was not up for discussion or negotiation. STILL he persisted on trying to keep me as a customer. I finally said \"If you care so much about your customers, then why don't you do what they ask you to do and LET THEM CANCEL!\" At that point he became very businesslike and curt and just gave me the official info about when my service would terminate (they won't let you cancel in the middle of a period you've already paid for and get a refund for a partial month).If he hadn't taken this tack, I was planning to ask him about re-activating the device in some point in the future for MY personal use (or for another relative's or friend) but after this experience I'd never do business with them again under any circumstances.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 star  Urgent response could be improved", "Author": "Bettye Tarin", "ReviewID": "R34KWHLJYXDUBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would like it were waterproof and would stay charged longer.Also, I was supposed to get the first month free by purchasing it at Amazon.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice  features, especialy the  GPS system", "Author": "Alfie99", "ReviewID": "R34DQDBFE37HU3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I haven,t  had ocassion to use it yet but  I especiallly like the GPS  feature and its light weight.

Recently, my dad, age 90 and with lots of health problems, has started to have memory issues,  and my mom fell and broke her back 3 weeks ago and is also needing pretty much full time support. We are in the process of helping him let us take over the bills, as this is a newly emerging issue. Last night, I checked both their 5 stars and neither worked; I got a recorded message from verizon (not 5 star) telling me to buy a calling card. For my parents, that would have been hopelessly  confusing, and they wouldn't have had no help if they had pressed the button in an emergency. I called 5 star, and they were nice, but said that the notes on the account were unclear, they couldnt understand them, and that there had been a payment 2 months ago, for 2 months worth, so even if there was a problem with the bill it was too early for it to have been cancelled normally. They told me to call financial services today. When my sister called them from across the country, assuming that the credit card info hadn't been updated by my Dad and eager to make a payment, the 5 star person wouldn't speak to her as dad is the account holder, which is understandable, but beyond that the 5 star person was extremely rude and unhelpful, which is not understandable.My concern is, that they shut off the 5 star devices without notifying the emergency contacts on the account. If they notified my Dad, he would not remember. Regardless, the night time 5 star person had told me she didn't know why it was shut off right now, as it was too early for it to have been shut down even if there was a non payment issue.Anyhow, I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't happened to check the devices just by chance.

I purchased this product from a Walmart store for my elderly mother.  I was unable to activate device.  Called customer support and this is where the real nightmare began.  After a long wait, the first rep was unable to fix the problem.  So, she put me on another long hold for \"technical support,\" who was also unable to activate the product, doing nothing more than the first rep to attempt to remedy the problem.  After a total of 2 hours later, I was told I must call back the next day because the would need to check with Verizon to see if there were any issues in my area with coverage.  Now keep this in mind, I spent all this time with them on setup and the phone on my VERIZON wireless cell with 5 bars of full coverage, of which they were made aware.  After over 2 hours of setting up online and dealing with reps who did nothing more than the manual suggested, I decided to return the defective product, as the rep told me maybe the product was defective and I agreed.  I returned the item to Walmart for a full refund.  I called the company to inform them to remove my mother's credit card information from their system and remove the activation charge of $26+ (since they were unable to activate the product) and I was told there would be a $10 RESTOCKING FEE!!  I told them Walmart does not charge a restocking fee and that is from whom I bought it.  They told me Walmart will send the item back to them and since they have my mother's credit card info, they would only refund the activation fee less the RESTOCKING FEE.  This is theft.  I never bought the product from them so they have no legal right to do this.  No matter what I said the rep told me 5 Star would deduct this fee from the activation charge.  I was absolutely infuriated and stunned.  This was one of the biggest scams and ripoffs I have been a part of.  The rep tried to force me into receiving another device by mail at a $10 discount (the same price as online vs. in-store).  Because of the terrible experience with the reps and the activation, I was concerned this device would not function properly when my mother needed it.  Now this isn't over because I will be forced to file a dispute with my mother's credit card company in order to receive the full refund.  NOTHING LESS THAN SCAM ARTISTS.  The reps have been trained to be sweet and smile while they kick and push you to the ground, acting as if everything is wonderful while they scam you.
