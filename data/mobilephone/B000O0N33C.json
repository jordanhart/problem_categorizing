The battery life is awesome, the phone is sturdy and very well made, and the flashlight and alarm clock come in very handy! I love this phone. Oh, and I am addicted to the little Snake game. But this phone isn't about extras, it's about phone calls. I can go a looong time without having to recharge it, too.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Old Reliable and Just Works", "Author": "Mark Byron \"markbyrn\"", "ReviewID": "R200XCFTZEAP7M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I still have my Nokia 1100b (circa 2006) for use as a backup prepaid phone and it's extremely durable and reliable as compared\ufeff to my app filled but fragile iPhone.  While the Nokia has never dropped a call or been in a bad coverage area, the iPhone routinely drops calls and the coverage is like swiss cheese.  Excellent battery performance even after many years of use, and when you need a phone that \"just works\", this old school phone is the only one to have.  That said, I'm rarely using the Nokia except as a backup - playing Snake is fun but not quite enough.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000O0N33C"}}
