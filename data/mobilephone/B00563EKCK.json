I looked at all the phones available, including the smart ones , and this one meets my requirements the best.  I really like the slide mechanism, and that it fits easily in my pocket and that it always works.  I honestly haven't found a phone that I like better, and so I continue to use this one.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00563EKCK"}}
