{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love the phone . . . highly recommend this vendor through amazon!", "Author": "Michelle Anton", "ReviewID": "R3BSRWSOJNNBRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone before and loved it .  It has features I hadn't even learned how to use yet but just when I wanted to add the web to it, the hinge cracked.  I'd had the phone for years and really liked it so when it cracked, I was on the hunt for a new one only to find out that I couldn't replace it through any Verizon stores any more.  They told me to try third party vendors but to be wary of  those with bad reviews and mindful that some phones are stolen.  So, Amazon was my next search and with its A-Z guarantee, I took a chance with this vendor with whom I am extremely satisfied and would definitely recommend!  I got my phone much sooner than the estimated delivery date, the condition was new, as promised, and it works great!  I love it and have added the web; it's a great phone and am very happy to have found this vendor who helped me replace my original.  Thank you!", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything works but the bluetooth", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R22BRB2CE6JB23", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Would not connect to blue tooth devices.
