My previous flip phone which still works is the Motorola Tundra which I am considering going back to but not for reasons you might think. The major reason is that I am on a limited income and the cost of a flip phone vs. the smart phone is the difference of night and day. I pay about 45.00 dollars a month for my flip phone and the service price doubles to triples depending on your data plan with my \" Major \" service provider. So for 80.00 dollars or more per month I can keep my Smart phone running as long as I pay the bill. But with services like Straight Talk Net 10 or other compatible service provider out there the cost could be cheaper although you get what you pay for and sometimes that might not be a good thing. Now the better news. I have no complaints about the Samsung Express phone but keep in mind this is my first smartphone so I am very smartphone stupid. It is a nice phone and I do like it. It serves the purpose for me as I don't text that much or use the data as I am still trying to figure out just how to run this contraption. If you want or need more memory, then you can but one o them new fangled chips and put in the slot built for it. This phone is relatively easy to use if your knowledgeable with the smart phone world. The main reason I bought it is that it is an unlocked phone so if I finally get pissed off enough with my current carrier, I can take it to another GSM carrier of my choice that has the same system type that I am on and WHA LA, I have a cheaper bill with the same amount of service or more service for less price and bear in mind that this is an option that one has when they buy an unlocked phone.I have owned 3 different unlocked phone. The Motorola Razor, the Motorola Tundra, and now the Samsung Galaxy Express. I have never had a problem with the first 2 with the exception of the age of the phone vs. newer technology. I am very happy with both of the first 2 and both currently work well to this day.  But technology changes so one must at least try to go with the flow of things.If you like the Smart phone, I would have no problem in recommending this phone. For a person like me who is not smart phone savvy, it might take a few times to get hold of the ropes of figuring this new fangled contraption out, but that's why we have you young'uns around to help use older generation old timer folks out. LOL But if your knowledgeable in the smartphone world, then I say go for the gusto and get one if you don't need all the bells and whistles.I also purchased an HHI Hybrid Dual Armored Case that has a flip out piece on the back of the case which helps the phone stand in an upright position and it comes with a stylus pen which attaches to the phone and I put a \"invisible Shield\" screen protector by \"Zagg\" on the front of the phone to help protect the screen.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely Recommend!!!", "Author": "Dominic Pereira", "ReviewID": "R2GBNZBAMPJ2HK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.Pros:  Good price, good battery life, 4G LTE, good signal strength, good call quality, good features.Cons:  Cannot remove unwanted ATT application.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "For my wife", "Author": "Jaross \"jaross\"", "ReviewID": "RYWAR1V2RQ3T4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "She likes it very much. However, 4 stars as it does not have the FM radio built in. Battery life is very good. She is using it for gps tracking when she skies and it lasts for the entire day.
