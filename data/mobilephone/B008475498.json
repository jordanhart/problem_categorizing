{"Reviews": [{"Title": "iPhone or Galaxy S3? no way!!", "Author": "Luca Cascianini", "ReviewID": "RKMS3QXY5STII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the S3 yesterday, since I owned a iPhone 4S here the comparison:DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users. You wont regret, there is a world outside iTunes :)", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Linda Torres", "ReviewID": "RHM42SN4A52W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an iPhone 4 and I thought that was the ultimate phone.  When I saw a friend of a friend using the Galaxy one evening...the screen was brighter and bigger, and it was doing all the stuff my little iPhone could do.  I decided to purchase this phone and give it a try....I am now hooked.  It is superior to the iPhone in every way.  Bigger and brighter screen, S Voice commands that can open apps, text messages, take dictation, open the camera, etc., customizable vibration notifications, (intensity, duration, pattern).  If this phone gets lost or stolen, not only can you find it...there is also a sim alert...meaning that if someone takes out your sim and puts theirs in, you will get an email that tells you what their phone number is.  There are seven home screens to which you can add widgets.  You can also open and see two apps at a time on the same screen.  The alarm can wake you up in briefing mode...meaning that the alarm will brief you on the weather, the news, and your schedule for the day instead of just an alarm tone. This phone is amazing.  I've had it for about a month now and would never ever go back to iPhone.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The seller sent me fake article.", "Author": "Judi", "ReviewID": "RL4PIKYOC8Q81", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have not received the original Smartphone, I have received a copy with the following characteristics:- Battery life of 4 to 6 hours (without use of phone features).- The phone turns off by itself suddenly.- No connectivity to my local supplier of telephone services (although the bands are compatible): signal reception is intermittent.- No data connectivity.- The phone has several differences in design when is compared with other originals Samsung Galaxy III.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!!", "Author": "Terrie", "ReviewID": "R31MYUTHKZD66F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GOT MY S111 in no time at all & just as described but even better!!!
