The transport speed was amazing and the phone itself has in my opinion almost no cons. (Brilliant screen, amazing sound  ,  very fast , good connectivity )The only con I can think off is the lack of LTE support.But my overall impression is fantastic about this item.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F5QI4L6"}}
