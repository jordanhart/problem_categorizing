The phone was cool and worked well except one thing. I purchased a 16gb miscorSD w/ this phone hoping I could put more music and my audiobooks on it. After adding 1,000 songs on the phone, it always froze the phone everytime I try to play my music. It just pissede off, so I ended up having around 300 songs left only on my phone. Why do they advise customers to buy a 16gb miscorSD along with this device if the phone processor could not hold it?On the other hand, picture quality is so cool...same as iphone camera quality. My jaybird sportsband bluetooth headphone also works with it and my audiobooks can also be stored here.For the price I paid of about $190 together w/ the microSD, its not a great buy but at least no either bad at all.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "POS", "Author": "cook3284", "ReviewID": "R1PEWZPYNO7L8R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "POS, I used the headphone jack 5 times now my phone thinks that there is always a headset plugged in which means i can't hear or say anything  when making a call. I tried everything on the forums to remedy the problem so now after only a week in a half i have a $150 paper weight. If you think I am full of it go online and search for stays in headset mode and read all the forums. Only difference is theirs happened while there was still a warranty on this phone.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a good phone", "Author": "No service", "ReviewID": "R1B3Q72IY2LYGP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone last year in August, and only had the phone for a couple months this phone do not work properly and no good service  in the country please buy with consonance", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Life made simple with HTC", "Author": "Wajid Hussein", "ReviewID": "R1WLA1QUPPRPU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was offered a BlackBerry before and I got rid of it, cause so costly to maintain and very complicated to use indeed. With this HTC it's like having a little laptop in hand. I am very content with it. If you use it for simple purposes and you are not too demanding then you will enjoy this phone. Now everything is made so simple and right at your fingertips. Everything my BB use to do, it does it in a very simple manner and frustration free. I can now use my phone professionally and without having BBM popping each seconds I am reading a work email or having issues installing a very needed application... I can now focus on my work instead of the screen of my long gone BB. I sure am HTC convert now, I cannot imagine myself using any other brand.

Here are my thoughts:I saw that one reviewer said they weren't able to get the internet working on this phone.  We didn't buy from Amazon but bought an unlocked version of this one, elsewhere.  We were able to get the internet working but I have to be honest and say that I hate this phone.  I am an Android user so I'm not used to Windows Mobile, but I am an IT savvy person and this is so difficult to navigate it's just down right frustrating.  I messed with it for 2 hours last night and finally figured out how to change the theme on it.  I am trying to put apps on it and the Windows Marketplace was closed last year so getting apps for this thing is very difficult.  It is mostly Verizon user friendly, and we are on Cricket, so that doesn't help.  We were told all features would work (Cricket's fault), but we can't get pics to send in text.  You can't upgrade to Windows 7.0 mobile from the 6.5 that's on here.  It's the slowest phone I have ever used but I am used to a Galaxy Nexus.  Most websites don't work and tapping to get to anything (links) is impossible.To sum it up, I DO NOT recommend this phone.  As I stated above, I used this phone as a cheap way to get my gf into the smartphone world.  I can honestly say that I wasted over $100 buying  this thing, then flashing it, and activating it, just to get on Cricket.  I could have used that money towards a new Android phone by the time this was all over.  She doesn't know it yet but I'm going to the store to switch the phone this week.  They said they'd waive the activation fee, yay!", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "An okay phone", "Author": "Cassie Blount", "ReviewID": "R3O2OP0J3PV8A2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone was just okay. It's very unique with how the menu works and looks. My problems i had with this phone was that it would freeze every now and then and some of the buttons began not working towards the end of my times with it. I ended up having to order a new phone after about maybe 8 months to a year. I was super excited when i got it, but it wasn't all i thought it to be. I wasn't able to get internet with it because it's one of those phones that even though it's unlocked, this one HAS to be used with it's carrier (verizon wireless) in order for ALL of the features to work which are talk, text, internet, and picture sending. i was able to get talk and text, but no internet which bummed me out. so i was careful with then next unlocked phone I bought so that i would b able to use all of the features. but all out it's alright. i would only reccomend it to people who plan to use verizon service.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice deal", "Author": "Marco", "ReviewID": "R1I5ISQXP0KXAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC Imagio XV6975 Unlocked Phone with Windows Mobile 6.5, GPS, Wi-Fi, 5MP Camera and Touchscreen - No Warranty - Black HTC Imagi", "Author": "tina", "ReviewID": "R1DJN3YD75B5EN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought \"HTC Imagio XV6975 Unlocked Phone with Windows Mobile 6.5, GPS, Wi-Fi, 5MP Camera and Touchscreen - No Warranty - Black\" approximately 10 days ago and would like to thank the seller for the on-time shipment and great mobile phone that I got for a great price.
