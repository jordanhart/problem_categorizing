{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive", "Author": "Jeantet Fields", "ReviewID": "R1BWN43Q1C1SOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you're saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don't do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it's not as loud as an office phone's speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It's a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day \"trial\" period during which you can test the network's performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models \"quad-band\" GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they'll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola's recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don't use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn't get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a \"Phone Tools\" application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone's contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here's the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn't caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn't differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you'll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking \"icky\".In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it's a good phone, it's solid, it's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.", "Date": "September 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Cool New Phone", "Author": "Andrea K", "ReviewID": "R3TJU54FCXKIZ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got the PEBL and I love it. I had been waiting for its release for several months and it was well worth it. Many of the ticky-tack features that I didn't like in the Motorola RAZR have been corrected here. While not as thin as a RAZR, the PEBL is lightweight. The black cover has a rubberized feel and the oval shape means that it sits comfortably in your hand. The hinged mechanism to open the phone is great - and one of its most distinctive features: One flick of the thumb and the phone gently flips open. The sound quality is great, from video clips to HiFi ringers to speaker phone. It's loud and clear. The camera and video features are decent. Overall, it operates like any other Motorola - the menus are standard. If it bugged you that the Call and End buttons were flipped right to left in the T722 models, Motorola has returned to its senses and placed the Call button on the left and end on the right side. As for fingerprints, they do show up on the cover and key face. The PEBL is still no v60, but it comes pretty close. If nothing else, it definitely has the Wow factor.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very slick, but not the best phone.", "Author": "mhnstr", "ReviewID": "R3BXV8X5UFDT5F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the PEBL for two weeks now and it really is as slick as everyone says.  Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say \"name dial\" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "--Hubba Hubba! Style, Substance & Sweep... It's One Heck of a Phone", "Author": "Yvonne \"yvonne333\"", "ReviewID": "RM3U2Z44NN6Y2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hmmm? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want?The Motorola PEBL phone itself, is indubitably eye-catching.  It offers exceptional operation & premium features.The PEBL is one of the most charming phones.  Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4\" x 1.9\" x 0.8\"; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand.As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser.  You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider.Ok, now the bad.  The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb.  The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards.Would I buy the PEBL again? Yes.  Would I recommend it to others? Sure.

I will have to say first the design is very nice and small I wanted a small phone so I did like this phones size and it does look sexy2. Great screen color.3. Decent navigation through the phone4 Picture quality is average  could be a bit better my friends nokia 6101 takes better photos.5. Great phone ringer sound quality and battery is very good 2 days with use6. Speaker phone so-so the speaker is on the back so its a pain to listen and talk to at the same time.7. the keys are a little cramped have to get used to using them and they are shinny yes they get smudged all the time.8. The reception for me was average sometimes spotty cutting in and out of conversations at times.9. The other big problem was that if your keep this phone in your pocket or put pressure on the clam design the keys begin to etch themselves into the screen so you can see the outline of the keys from being in the closed position so do not put a lot of pressure on the clam when closed because over time you will see this problem.Overall I think its a decent phone but for the $250 I think it should be cheaperI paid $150 with contract upgrade dont really think it was worth that much $50-$100 would have been better", "Date": "November 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Looks cool... but not much else.", "Author": "David Roberts", "ReviewID": "R25CISU8LXW16N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "With the unique design, seems like this could have been a really cool phone, but some of the problems I experience, make it fall short.GOODLooks damn cool and not many people have it.The automatic flip open looks cool and is convienent.  I really like this option.Fits easily in your pocket.Rubberish coating makes it easy to grip.Lazor etched keypad doesn't wear out.Uh... not much else for me!BADThe action of sliding the top down causes physical wear and tear on the phone.  I've only had the phone a few months and am not someone with the phone glued to my head; however, the metallic coating over the bottom directional button is already worn off from rubbing against the screen. The screen has a permanent imprint of the directional pad on the screen from the sliding as well as a quarter inch scratch caused my the screen sliding over the center directional button.Not sure if this is related or not to the above problem, but I'm slowly loosing the bottom of the screen. Not the physical screen itself, but the image.  It's tricky to describe but it reminds me of when you scan a picture and abruptly pull the picture from the scanner right at the end.  Right now, I've lost 2/8\" inch of visibilty on the bottom of the screen.As someone else mentioned, the automatic opening works by pulling down the top with your thumb and then letting go.  Essentially, the phone pops open while it's resting on your hand.  For a moment, you are not really holding the phone at all.  More the once, the phone has popped out of my hand when opening.Impossible to read the screen in sunlight.It is difficult to read time accurately on the analog clock.  There is no option to change it to digital.Camera quality is poor.When my bluetooth headset is enabled, I cannot change the ringer or ringer volume.I cannot get the phone to send text messages.  I had the same problem with my Razor.If this where a $100 phone, no problems. But for this price... not worth it.

Rudel", "ReviewID": "R2LRSL9MD32FJ8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved this phone.  It was the best purchase I ever made.  For four months.Now it randomly turns off (despite being fully charged) sometimes in the middle of calls.  Often, when I flip it open, the screen is crazy (cut in half or bright green or only showing part of the functions).  When it started to do this it was a lot worse, now it's mellowed out a bit (only happens a couple times a week instead of multiple times a day).Apparently this is a problem with all PEBLs, hence the discontinuation.  A woman in front of me in line at the store asked me whether or not I had the same problems with the phone blacking out as she did.  A week later mine started up.  I've also heard bad things about the RAZR too, so I don't think I'll be purchasing a Motorola phone again, despite how cute and trendy they are.I loved all the features when they worked.  I could sync up my calendar and contacts with my mac with bluetooth (altough iCal and the calendar program don't work fantastically together), and the quality of the photos is great.  Also, I really like T-Mobile, their prices and their costumer service.

I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one.

I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with.

Physically it's not bad - it's a decent size, has a nice display and an external LCD. However the battery is very prone to slipping lose from the internal contacts causing the phone to turn off randomly; simply putting it in the pocket of a pair of jeans can be enough to dislodge the battery.It barely works *as a phone*. I have yet to find a spot where the signal is strong enough that it won't cut off, even when it has all bars maxed out. The microphone has lousy gain, unless you happen to be in an area with a slight breeze and then it picks the wind noises to the exclusion of all else. I've had so many calls where the person kept telling me the wind was too loud, and there was just barely a breeze!Taking a picture is easy, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to \"store\" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is completely ridiculous...how about I take the picture and it just stores it immediately without me doing anything?The phone just acts very weird. Whenever I check my voice mail, and even sometimes just at random, the phone recieves an undecipherable text message with no return address. Read three voicemails, you get three messages. No reason for it, it just happens. Even worse - I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for *over a week*! It's very common for it to not inform you about a voicemail for a couple of days. I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.If you don't keep this phone fully charged, it will beep nonstop about every three minutes until the battery is really and truly dead. More than once I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off.

Will keep until I find another militaristic-looking rubber-coated beauty that works well as a phone.  (Only better...)Looks are incomparable.  If they'da lost ALL the shine, they would have been perfect.  (And it fits in your pocket too!!!)  Good to excellent call quality.  Lousy menus, maddening phone book and battery life is a joke.1.  Slick looks with a cool rubberized matte skin and a sweet spring-open feature.2.  Hard to tell from the picture, but the hinge is chrome.  REALLY SHINY CHROME.3.  The screens and keypad surface are also extremely shiny and TOTAL fingerprint magnets.  Keypad is flat with ridges, sorta slippery and not the easiest to use.4.  Menu functions are virtually incomprehensible, with stuff buried in nonsensical places.5. Phone book difficult to use, especially multiple numbers under one entry.  (My sim from a four-year-old tits-up Samsung couldn't figure out how to do it, so it gave every number a separate entry with the same name.)  I gave up after a while and simply annotated each separate name with 'cell', 'home', etc.5.  Excellent call quality.6.  Battery life as delivered was a joke--bought a brand-new battery from my provider (paying $37 to avoid the 2-year-old dud batteries so prevalent on the 'net) but the phone still must be charged nightly, or the low power alarm WILL wake you up in the middle of the night.  (And I don't talk much.)In sum:  If you want a phone that works well as a basic phone and has a slick, militaristic look that can't be beat, buy this.  If you want user-friendly software and a 'feature rich' high-tech goody-box that must be strapped to your belt, look elsewhere.(But it'll only get shinier...)NEW SPARTA", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money.", "Author": "Rolando Martinez \"Rolo\"", "ReviewID": "R1BMU0DKTFHVYO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good cell phone model. It has pleasing style lines, folds compactly in an attractive package, and is sharp looking in its simplicity. It always had good signal capabilities and a good battery life with good stand by and talk times. It's also fairly compact, although not the smallest of phones, and well protected from falls and such. You will see some scarring on the case texture if dropped on a harsh surface but this applies to pretty much every type of phone. It tends to be more visible on this phone's finish but I have to say I do prefer this finish to the \"cold plastic\" feel of other phones. One thing to watch out for is that the buttons are hard to find in the dark and/or when not looking directly at it since the tactile feedback bars are somewhat recessed into the keypad, and the screen will perpetually be somewhat greasy from your cheeks unless you're compulsively good at cleaning it after every call (Get a case or use bluetooth). Overall this is a very comfortable, sharp-looking phone with an awesome 1-handed flip out (uses magnets to stay close, so it could double as a very inefficient money clip, heh).", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "shipping extremely fast", "Author": "J.

The phone is sleek and the matte texture is nice to hold in your hand.

Gach", "ReviewID": "R3K4PMUK2O3S0V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The PEBL does have a nice hand feel, the opening mechanism is well thought out and works well in Europe but the \"good\" ends there. I have used the PEBL for over a year and have had 5 or 6 mobile phones prior to this one. I use it for work which takes me overseas a fair bit.The Motorola contact management interface is cumbersome to deal with. Most phones allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but PEBL does not. If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times. This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with phones.The \"mirror\" dialing pad and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking oily. And the dial pad begins to show up on the screen in a shadow pattern after a while. A brilliant design weakness.Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a multi-step sequence.The voice commands are cumbersome. As another reviewer noted \"I would say \"name dial\" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.\" After some time I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command. As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands better - not perfect, but tolerable if you don't mind repeating yourself.The phone opens when dropped, which is often since a decent belt holder is hard to find for this model without buying a leather sleeve which sort of defeats the nice palm feel the PEBL has. And now when it drops it not only opens but the back falls off and the battery spills out.Photo taking is frustrating. Easy to shoot the photo, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to \"store\" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is obnoxious.  I would like to just take the photo and have the phone store it without me performing several selectionsMaybe it is my cell carrier, but I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for several days and sometime up to a week! Like another reviewer, I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.Also annoying is the fact that it will beep nonstop every 3 to 5 minutes when the battery is getting low about until the battery is really and truly dead. I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off.
