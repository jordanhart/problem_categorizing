Petty", "ReviewID": "R2Q2A2TDMBV10X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a cheap replacement for a phone that I drowned when boating.  It was advertised as having all the features of the phone I ruined and I have had good luck with LG phones in the past.  All of the features are there but they do not all work.  There is a camera but this phone will not receive or send photos in text messages.  It will not access the internet either and has lousy reception.  Some of the problems may be due to Verison not supporting this phone anymore, but I am disappointed with it, as I was led to believe these features worked.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone only lasted about four months", "Author": "r.w.", "ReviewID": "RJFL51QJLR79J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone about four months ago and the problem with the phone isThat when I talk the person can't hear me also the \"ok\" button on phone stop working.If that's not enough LG does not want to accept their 1 year warranty because they stop selling this item already.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "not satisfied customer", "Author": "tpluv12", "ReviewID": "ROM0ED9XGKTXI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this order within good time.

All I needed was a quality phone that did not drop calls and I could hear the recipient and they could hear me. Excellent service from seller! I received the phone much earlier than expected. Clean well preserved phone. Price was right. I see people who leave negitive feed back because one has to manually put in numbers, if they want a phone that does it all they should go pay a couple hundred and get locked into a contract. This phone was exactly as stated. If you just need a phone this VG8350 is perfect for that. The only thing I did not care for is the poor ring tones that come with it.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "im gonna miss this phone", "Author": "Jorge", "ReviewID": "R73XLOV9XVATK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this phone 2 years ago, i love it, its so easy to text i dont even have to look at the screen cuz i have the keys memorized so i can text and walk at the same time without looking at my phone. the camera isnt the best. though i only text and dont need pics. and call quality just as good as any phone ive ever used. but yesterday the screen turned to static but im not shocked, ive dropped this phone in the floor so many times i lost count, not one scracth, so i just ordered a new used phone to replace it by the mean time the vx 10000, time to upgrade a bit now", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast Shipping", "Author": "MJB45805", "ReviewID": "RH7NNHRZUXCF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was happy to find this phone to replace one just like it for my 84 yr. old Mother.
