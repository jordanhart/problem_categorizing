On Apple's and Android's app store I find myself flooded with non-relevant selections and wasting my time shifting through trying to find what I am looking for.  On Blackberry's App store I do not have this problem.  Some may find the number of apps on the Blackberry App Store as discouraging while as I find it a blessing for that fact alone.I am no longer an Android fan as their Operating Systems just seem to crash or freeze up more than anything else.  No problems with this on the Z10.To sum up the Pros:*Long lasting battery*Touch is responsive*Interface super smooth*Operations are fast*Not to mention the superb sharpness and brightness of the Screen*I am also a fan of the auto brightness functionality (the brightness of the screen auto adjusts to the light conditions).*The keyboard is better by far than any other phone I have used to include the IPhone and Nexus 4.*Not bombarded by irrelevant Apps*BBM*Security of the Blackberry OS*The price of the Z10 is comparable to Android and IPhone*Expandable memoryTechnical Features:Size: 130mm X 65.6 mm X 9mmWeight: 135.4 gDisplay: 4.2in multi-touch IPS LCD displayResolution: 1280 x 768OS: Blackberry 10 OSMemory: 2 GB RAM, 16 GB Flash and hot swappable microSD Slot with capacity up to 32 GBProcessor: Dual Core 1.5 GHzGPS: Assisted, Autonomous, and Simultaneous GPSBluetooth: Bluetooth 4.0 (low energy)NFC: NFC enabled for security file exchange and paymentsHDMI: microHDMI out portAdvanced Sensors: Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Proximity, Ambient Light Sensor (Auto Brightness), GyroscopeWi-Fi: Dual Band 802.11 A/B/G/N, Mobile HotspotNetwork Connectivity: 4G LTE, HSPA+, support for global roamingBattery Life: 1800 mAh  (Exceeding the battery life of the IPhone 5)Talk Time: up to 10 hours on 3GStandby Time: up to 305 hours on 3G, up to 316 hours on 2GAudio Playback: up to 60 hoursVideo Playback: up to 11 hoursOverall:I think this is the best phone on the market right now.

Basically I'm getting tired of being breadcrumbed into buying the next model. Yes, each one has been beautiful, but copy and paste took three iterations before that came. And I really dislike itunes, so getting my music onto my really expensive phone has always been a hassle. It's like buying a BMW and the company dictating what roads you can drive on. Eventually I got tired of this. Because of this perspective, I will be making my judgement based on the iphone(up till 4s).Im not a fan of android. I tried it and it felt like I was carrying around the baby of windows and linux. Not that i dislike linux, I'm just not apt enough to make it useful. And windows, we're not really friends so I won't consider windows phone. Too much bad blood between MS and me still.I had a BB (blackberry) years ago, and it was ok, if not indestructible. For what it could do at the time, it was cool, but became more irritating to use as they added new 'abilities'. Picked up a playbook in bestbuy and was absolutely shocked at how good the OS was. Very clean and responsive. I really didn't expect that quality of interface from BB. They really missed the proverbial boat when the iphone launched, but it appears to me they jumped on the concord to catch up.So I took the plunge and bought the Z10. And I toast BB on a great phone. Here's to never going back.My phone was made in Canada, although I think they're mostly made in Mexico.It's very minimal in design, could go with anything and I like that. It's feel is that of quality. It is no way cheap feeling but is also not heavy, something discovered to be the Achilles heel of the iphone. It seems to be less prone to breaking its screen. I broke a lot of iphone screens, lots. Ive had my z10 for nearly 6 months and had a couple of hard drops and have managed to avoid replacing the screen. My brother managed to smash his screen, and this is a crap bit about the Z10, the phone is basically unusable, unlike a iphone that still manages digitizer input. And the z10 screen is expensive, $140! Since neither myself nor my brother put ours in cases, that's our own fault. But how can you have some thing so beautiful and keep it in a big ugly case? The screen is very sharp and I find myself watching a lot of video on it, lots of youtube and netflix (android app, more about that later). The speaker is a bit weak but perfect for speakerphone calls. The camera is fine and hard to knock, but not as good as the iphone 4s. It has an HDMI port and a SD card slot.Because I use the z10 far more than i ever did the iphone, its hard to compare the battery life. The iphone seems to last longer, either way, they both need to be charged every day, but the BB needs be charged just after work some days.At first, it took some time to get used to the behaviour of BB10, the new BB OS. after a couple of days and head scratching, my interaction with the z10 became so natural, that I often find myself trying to get my ipad to work in the same way. unfortunately, it does not. :(The hub was the biggest annoyance for me to get used to, but now I can't understand how you'd use a phone without it. Truly remarkable most of us forgot that our phones are just that, phones. Personal communicators. This is what the hub does. Centralizes all communication. The calls are always really loud and clear. Ive never had a dropped call. email, text, twitter and facebook can all be handles in the hub or you can pop open their app to get a more immersive experience.The browser. Holy moly> this wasn't bb strong suit. It is now. Its no compromise web. I get full webpages as they were intended. You forget that you often have to compromise when viewing pages on an iphone because apple gave flash the boot. I understand that it does slow things up, but a huge chunk of the web still relies on flash and you end up filling out a lot of forms at your computer. Not awesome when traveling. The bb browser is absurdly fast with flash turned off and as fast as an iphone when its turned on, except with the full page in all its boxes to tick and little animations that richen the experience. It does have some peculiarities that so bother me though. Apple has a really nice tap to zoom feature that behaves as it should, bb's does this, but nowhere near as well. Also, as BB10 is gesture based, going back on a screen should be a swipe, but for some reason, there is a back button and swiping back doesn't work like it does in the hub.Oh, and as anyone you talk to about it, the keyboard it pretty awesome.BB link is BB answer to iTunes. But its not quite as prison guardy. It hasn't erased my phone when I plug it in to my work computer to back it up. There is no problem going from mac to PC. THe best part is, that with link on, I can view the files on my computer over wifi and copy them directly from my phone. No cable, just a WiFi link. I don't know if you find this a amazing as I do, but I would have switched just for this feature. I use my z10 to DJ parties at the and uploading new sets it so easy its silly. Also the native DJ app is the best Ive seen yet.BB maps. Total piece of crap after coming from google maps on iphone. Even apple maps are far better than the native BB maps. Luckily, there are apps that fill this void and do a damn good job of it. With a better maps app, GPS is solid and maps are fast.Android. Yup, I said it. Android. I can load android apps on my z10. Not all of them, but a lot of necessary ones. Its not too hard but not super easy. I have just installed a leak of the latest BB10 os and it now supports apps up to android 4.2, ice cream sandwich I think. This is how I got netflix on there. I dont find myself using too many apps on my z10 as much because they seem to be there to make up for the short comings of the browser so i don't really miss any of them. Still have an ipad for apple stuff anyway.The z10 comes loaded with office to go which is essentially Word and Excel. They work for opening and editing those documents, I've managed to never have a problem with either of them, but I don't use them day in and out for work. I use excel a few times each day at work and work maybe once a day, maybe less. An interesting note, that the z10 has an HDMI out so I can connect it to a monitor and pair it with a BT keyboard and mouse for when I'm getting into a spreadsheet. Mini computer!In fact, I think thats what BB was going for. This is turning into a novel so I'm gonna wrap this up, but I'll end on this.My twin brother and I live on deferent sides of the planet. We were planning a trip to meet up to see each other recently, he on his z10 and me on mine. He video called me, and from there we checkout out flights on mine using the screen share function of BBM, booked thos flights, booked hotel rooms, paid for them directly from the z10 browser, made a spreadsheet for the dates, times, points of interest and important details. This was all done simultaneously on my z10 while video chatting/screen sharing. This is the sort of stuff you do on a PC, not a phone! This is the reason I'm using my macbook pro less. Because my phone is capable. My iphone surely wasn't capable of this, at least it had lots of apps, because it needs them because the browser is limited.I get a sense that bb is in the position that apple was when microsoft was eating their lunch in the 90's. BB can't fail and it shows. Now, ironically, apple, who pretty much invented the PC as we know it, is dominant, with BB get it arse whooped (for good reason before BB10), being the company that invented the smartphone. I hope that google, microsoft, apple and blackberry keep duking it out, because this competition has given us awesome wonder in our pocket. Here's to the future being now.

Fruit folks said ours will do that in the next version and wow it is so light weight,  Robot folks said wow great battery life.  Both said that is thin.Problems:.

Not Android missing, but WebOS missing. For those of you that don't understand, Android has most apps that iOS has, but not all essentials. WebOS hardly had any, and neither does Blackberry. A lot of apps still to come.... hopefully. One star penalized for this.Now on to the good news, this is a great device! Before I converted to iPhone with the first iPhone, I was an avid blackberry user & lover. This makes that loving feeling come back a bit. The way the inbox is managed is beautiful. The way the OS swipes and moves around is simple and great. The speed is ok, not great, but not bad either. The screen looks great, the weight & size are good, overall, I'm very pleased about this device! If you're at a company that requires blackberry, this is certainly the best option available and it's quite a large step up from previous options. That being said, the severe current lack of apps is probably enough of a buzzkill for a lot of people to steer clear.All I can hope is that additional apps come along. Everything else about this device and OS please me and make me happy. I could be happier here than on an Android if the apps were equal.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone but....", "Author": "Cuanguaro", "ReviewID": "R3NVC75H3RVFL2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought it as a gift for my brother.
