{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fan-TASTIC Phone, Outstanding All Around and FUN To Own!", "Author": "Ray Ben", "ReviewID": "R31QM79FHHL12G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and \"experts\" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the \"People\" tile ... Facebook posts of friends \"pop up\" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say \"It is Friday Night\" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music \"block\", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION!  Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928?  Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares?  When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the \"expert\" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's \"horrible dearth of apps\". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash,  the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or \"reviewing\" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Laura Perez", "ReviewID": "REMGST9JK5CS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the phone just as indicated, BRAND new and everything included.

I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T; phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R103CER04R347Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "First experience with a Lumia", "Author": "R. Henry", "ReviewID": "R26YQ5XEDNPVR2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Nokia N8 that I wanted to upgrade and since Nokia's build quality speaks for itself I went for a Lumia.I wanted a phone with expandable memory as my music and photos are on the MicroSD card and I also wanted a phone with at least 1GB of RAM.So I got this Lumia 820.So far the phone has been great, save for some basic features I really miss like FM Radio, Flip to Silence, select a custom message alert, the ability to set separate volume for alarms, music, ringtones, etc., notification center, some kind of visual alert that I have missed a call, alert or a sms so I don't have to turn the screen on to check, have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, and some other things I already have on a 3 years old phone but missing on a phone launched 5 months ago.The battery life is not as great as with the N8 but then again it's a 680 MHz 3.5 inches vs a 1.5GHz Dual Core 4.3 inches phone.I'm liking the phone so far as the UI is very fast but untill I get back all the funtionality I now have on my 3 years old Symbian phone, the N8 will stay with me as my primary phone.

I wanted a sturdy phone with expandable storage that ran the Windows OS.  That is what I got with this phone.  It's pretty much the perfect size for my hand, not too thick, but doesn't feel cheap.  That back pops off and the battery is removable, another plus that I wasn't even looking for.  The wireless charging cases are pretty cheap ($15 off at&t; website) so I'll be getting one of those soon, the charging plate is probably a little more expensive though.  A protective case fits right over the removable back and can reportedly be charged wirelessly through it.  (For those that don't know, the back of this phone is removable, that's where the wireless charging case goes.  A protective cover can go on top of that for even more durability).  The sound quality isn't the best I've ever had, but then again I don't really like talking on the phone in the first place, so this gives me an excuse when my wife is chattering on and on and on.  And on and on.  And on again.  Hmm...I hope she never sees this review...Anywho, I digress....this phone is exactly what I was looking for.  Not too fancy, will most likely last me more than the 2-year contract that I'm used to with smart phones.

I have been using my 520 as a media device with my primary phone being an Android.  Although the 920, 1020 and 1520 seem to be excellent devices, what made me go with an 820 is that while it may not be the best at any particular feature, it has all the features that I'm looking for.  I have the AT&T; Deathstar version.1.  4G LTE2.  At least 1 GB RAM3.  Replaceable battery4.  MicroSD slot expandable to 64 GB.5.  AMOLED screen6.  Glance7.  Wireless charging with a shell8.

I love AMOLED's.  Glance is a great feature.  Call quality is good.  Fast web surfing.  It feels solid in the hand.  I think the 820 is currently the best all around WP8 phone.  WP8 is a good, smooth, lag free phone.  It'll be even better with the upgrade to 8.1.  Sound is great through headphones.  Speakerphone volume is decent.  The only downside is the relatively poor app store.  Very few Google apps, which I rely on.The battery life so far is good enough for me.  The camera, again, while not the latest Nokia masterpiece like the 41 MP on the 1020 or 20 MP on the Icon or 1520 takes decent pictures.For the money the phone is a 5/5.  Compared to other phones (high end included), it's more like a 4/5.Update 4/23/14: I updated the OS the WP8.1 Preview for Developers.

I don't want to pay a high price, but I wanted a newer phone (I was on a cracked Samsung GS for 2 1/2 years).  So, getting more tech for less was important and this was the best compromise (1/2 the price of the Samsung GS4 mini and I don't want a billboard in my pocket, ya know).Nokia delivered!  They're trying hard to keep up with Google and Apple.  WP8 leaves some major gaps, but those will be filled by vendors as the app store develops as well as MS when they mature the OS.  Still, I'm pretty blown away with the tech and OS.  If it weren't for the lack of apps, I'd never think about going back to Android, but the lack of apps is a headache for WP8.  Some minor integration issues that I'm used to (dialing a number and getting a name, for instance) are a problem, but the way WP8 imported all my contacts from the cloud made that tolerable.You can read many more detailed reviews, but from someone who could use Android pretty well and was willing to stay on the leading edge of yesterday with an old, cracked phone that wouldn't die, I will say that WP8 is a nice way to update my tech without paying a lot of money.  For the price I paid, I'd do it again, and WP8 is very serviceable.  Once the app store starts rolling, Android and iOS may be in for a run.

Some folks are hopeful that Windows will make an update to fix that but this phone has been out long enough for them to have fixed this by now so i don't think its a priority for them. Surprisingly i got a streaming radio app from the windows store (tunein) and it has my local stations. Suppressing because i'm from St. Lucia (in the Caribbean) where no one heard of. so if my local stations are there yours probably is too. the problem with this is you need wifi for this, which means the quality is poor depending on your connection and if i had to use a data plan for this it would get too expensive for free radio.- SD card slot is under the battery. my thoughts are that an SD memory card should have quick access without having to turn your phone off. With this phone you have to turn the phone, remove the cover and battery to get to the card.- the battery life is exactly as many reviews say. it sucks. i have to charge this phone EVERYDAY. if you get this phone my advise is to get extra chargers; have one at work, at home, in the car, at moms house... cause you'll need it. the good thing is the phone does not take long to charge. but truth be told most smart phones today have this issue. You have to keep them plugged in (and that does not hurt the battery by-the-way).i know i went on a bit about the radio and nokia suit thing but those were selling points for me. i first gave this 2 stars because of this but i reconsidered because the phone is a good phone. if you're going to advertise something and not deliver that will not make me buy from you in the future. Nokia suit was a big selling point for me because i have hundreds of contacts and having to re-enter them 1 by 1 every time i get a new phone is a pain. for this alone i no longer have any reason to have any brand loyalty to Nokia.if i could push myself past these 2 sticking points, i actually like this phone. its not as big as the GS3. it fits in my packet and hand easily. the touch screen is responsive. the camera is great. You can customize the tiles and there are plenty of apps to do whatever you want.I will love this phone for as long as it last (hoping for 2 years, any longer is a bonus). But if i had to do it over i would consider the Lumia 625... because it has radio.ps/ Turns out WP8 has podcasts. which is the only reason i have an ipod. so now i only carry one device.Update: 16/Jan/14- Now with radio.

I received a no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro usb connector. Everybody knows that AT&T; devices never come factory unlocked, they are exclusively manufactured for its network, so these Cells are not new they were refurbished to be unlocked. Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T;) or parte number it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins:  the 1650mAh Battery is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and the lacking of gorilla glass.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone.", "Author": "Diego Ledesma", "ReviewID": "R1APX0J6X3WXOW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone.

Nokia never lets me down.-  Wireless tethering(Internet sharing) thats good!!-  I can choose to navigate pages as a desktop browser and not as a mobile browser which has some restrictions by some sites.-  It has mini versions of Word and Excel included.-  The main icons screen is very easy to use and to manage.-  Video playback is smooth and looks good.-  The file structure of the SD card is very simple, not like Androids which is filled with dozens of folders.CONS:-  The battery life is bad, but since mine is a used one I can not say if the new ones are better.-  Not so good MP3 player.  Too confusing.  I just needed a simple player.-  Bad MP3s codecs, could not play some of my 320Kbps songs, like my Sony Xperia X8 did easily.  However an app called Pocket File Manager did play these songs well, I did not expect that from a file management app.-  The flashlight is not full white, it has like some kind of warmth in it, so some photos might look warm(yellowish).-  One of the three main buttons is dedicated entirely to Bing search.  I don't like Bing, so for me it is a big waste of a button that could have been useful for any other function.-  Very grainy photos in low light when flash is not used.-  On the internet browser, part of the screen (like 15% I guess) is wasted displaying the URL the whole time.-  No \"forward\" button or feature on the internet browser.FINAL THOUGHTS:Even though the phone has almost everything I need, it always leaves me the feeling that I'm isolated( or imcomtible) from the Android population.

Windows XP to Vista was a little buggy but it worked. Windows Vista to 7 was just a case of slothering Vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheen.Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 has been the experience nightmares are made of. It was basically going from Windows 7 to Windows 95.Windows Phone 7 was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there. The most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd. Others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the device.They weren't deal breakers and there were some workarounds. That said, everything else in the OS was fully functional. The phones available has very limited storage, most maxing out at 16gbs. However as many figured out, the 1st generation WP7 devices uses MicroSD cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right SD Card, could take a 8gb phone and transform it into a 32gb phone. I did it with no problems on my 8gb Dell Venue Pro. Even better, integration with the Zune Desktop Software (ZDS) made syncing music, pictures, podcasts and videos to a lesser extent, a breeze.When i got home, I put my phone to charge, it would ping my desktop wirelessly, fire up the ZDS and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone. When I left for work the next morning, everything just worked.Window Phone 8 is nothing like that. With this new OS, expandable storage is natively supported except on my Lumia 820 it doesn't work at all. When i put in my Sandisk 64gb MicroSDXC card, and fired up Windows Media Player to Sync my playlists as I did with my Zune and Windows Phones on the ZDS. (I did this with my old sandisk E250 player back in the PlayForSure days as well)My first thought, \"Wow this is slow!!\"Second thought, \"why is song taking to long to transfer?\"10 minutes later \"why is the same song still transferring\"30 minutes later \"oh *uck it froze\"Then something that never happened on my WP7 Dell Venue Pro happened, my Music and Video app crashed, so did my settings app. On shutting it down, it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screen.I forced restarted it by removing the battery.When i powered it up, the SD Card was missing... I turned off the phone, removed the card and put it back in, powered the phone on and it was still missing. I took the card out and put it in a card reader on the PC. The disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the Card and ran but found no errors. Once it was back in the phone, the phone saw it once more. I tried syncing a playlist again, it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of another.This happened over and over. Then I quick formatted the card back in exfat on my PC and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them. Every song synced perfectly.Once back in my phone, all the songs turned up but... for some odd reason, some songs would turn up with no artist or album information. If i resynced them, or copied them manually, they would then show with the correct info, but then other songs would start doing the same thing, to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my Zunes and DVP.Using explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files, music and pics mainly, always results in some sort of freezing during copying.In the end I gave up although I was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to USA so I could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when I was driving or waiting in line. This is still a problem because when I want to view podcasts on my TV or desktop while I work with my nice sounding speakers... I can't.Over the last 2 days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying. For some odd reason, my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselves.If i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory, there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees 2 or 3 of them.Whats worse is if I delete even one of the duplicates, all of the duplicates including the original are deleted.The Nokia Lumia 820 is a horrible phone===========================================This is coming from someone who has owned only Nokia phones his whole life aside for a Dell Venue Pro and an Ericsson and has been a massive fan of Microsoft's Zune Software and Hardware devices as well as the Windows Phone 7 line of devices.NOTHING works like it ought to and despite how much I loved WP7, I cannot recommend this phone to anyone out there.I cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the USA and I live in Trinidad and Tobago.If other Windows Phone 8 handsets give the same problem as this Lumia 820, I recommend avoiding them until Microsoft and the OEM's get their house in order and fix what was not broken in Windows Phone 7.5 to begin with.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "good but incomplete", "Author": "Francisco De Castro \"deka\"", "ReviewID": "R1GQIZJF3WDI6C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is good but incomplete in terms of aplications , when you are use to work with android.
