Works with all the functions as an S3. I would say it is about the same as the Galaxy S3 (that I already have), only smaller. I was apparently made for a foreign market, as the phone and instructions  were in a foreign language.It came with a foreign charger plug, but, it did have the adapter for US outlet. Changed the phone to English and installed some apps. Found a Samsung site, online, with the overview and English downloadable manual. I bought and sent the phone for my son, to replace replace his older phone.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Excellent for my 11 year old son", "Author": "Maron P.
