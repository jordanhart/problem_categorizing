The keys didn't work! I have owned a blackberry for over 7 years and this product didn't work out of the box. The distributor said that I had a 3 day warranty when I called to request a replacement! I didn't ask for my money back, just a different device, which I thought was fair. Any reputable retailer would gladly replace a defective item.The device arrived right before Xmas (24th) and I called on the 28th and they said, \"too bad, we were open on Christmas, you should've called then...\" It never dawned on me that any retailer would be open. Most retailers closed in observance of the holiday. Apparently, this retailer, Worldwide does not observe Christian holidays and certainly doesn't respond in a Christian manner for sure. They were rude, cold on the phone and blamed me for not reading the tiny, and I mean tiny, print on their warranty.I am surprised that Amazon does business with them. The Atty General of California asked me to send them my device and a letter outlining my concerns, and it is on its way.Do NOT do business with this deceptive band of thieves.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worse buy on Amazon.com due to a worse seller experience", "Author": "telecomengg", "ReviewID": "R1J0TOSU0O0GGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "May 10,2011 7:15pm EDT:This VERY UNFORTUNATE incidence that the phone which I bought has given it up completely.

One of the major problem which i have faced since i have purchased is that the phone restarts anytime (even while a call is going on)2. The battery gets drained very fast sometimes even in 4 hrs.3. The phone can not be updated.4.  The color of the body is coming out.THIS IS THE MOST TERRIBLE THINGS TO HAPPEN. BUYING A PHONE FROM AMAZON AS A GIFT TO MY BROTHER, THAT TOO NOT WORKING PERFECTLY. I AM UNHAPPY, DISAPPOINTED HOW CAN AMAZON HAVE TIES WITH SUCH SELLERS WHO SELL PRODUCTS WHICH FUNCTION ONLY FOR 5 MONTHS AND THAT TOO IN PARTIAL CONDITIONS.I REQUEST ALL BUYERS OUT THERE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER AT ALL. ITS A SCAM. ITS FAKE, ALL MONEY WILL BE LOST AND THE PRODUCT WOULD BE A TRASH SOONER OR LATER.I wanted to gift my younger brother BB phone. I selected BB Bold 9000 and bought from Amazon. It clearly mentioned while I placed the order as \"NEW\".I received the package, the box seem NOT new. That raised first doubt in my mind. I opened the box, noticed the cell phone. On the initial glance, it looked NEW.When I checked within the close proximity, found scratches on the front screen and the back guard. The keypads weren't 100% functional. The mouse ball at the center, also was stuck many a times.Over all where displeased with the product. It makes me regret my decision to buy the cell from this seller. Its a huge mistake, I would suggest people not to buy from this seller, since its going to be fraud and not a good decision to buy from this seller.Thankstelecomengg", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Must use data plan.

I am convinced they never repaired the phone. Now when I emailed and called seller they were friendly and made some effort to satisfy me. But the fact that the phone was sent to me with the back cover separated in the box from the phone, the sender had to have known that the clamp was broken. No charger, no instructions in box.

The physical problems are these:*It does not bring the appropriate manual, given that the model is Blackberry Bold 9000, and the handbook says \"Thank you for choosing a Blackberry Storm2 smartphone\", and provides information of that model, not the one that I bought.*It was supposed to include a white sheath (the phone is white), but it brought a black one.*It has a black spot, like if it was beaten or has fallen.*When I press certain keys, it writes the letter twice or even more times and I have to delete the leftover characters over and over again.*The charger does not work.Immediately after making my qualification over this poor cellphone I received, the Wireovia's people, Mrs. Chris and John, asked me to find a \"friendly way\" to reach a new agreement, by deleting my qualification about it and replacing the item. I made this, believing that they were good people and they would keep their word. Instead, I never received a solution. Mr. Chris seemed to try the reaching of an agreement, but Mr. John appeared in three times wasting my time, by making fooly questions, and refusing to give me a phone number or address to go and make this exchange.Unfortunately, on his last email, he told me that the cellphone was out of warranty, letting me without any posibility of getting my money back or replacing the Blackberry. I have to say, that I made my complain four days after I bought this, and two days ago they said it was out of warranty(it's 16th september today, they've kept me sending e-mails for 5 months). How much does the warranty last if, after 4 days, I couldn't make any complain anymore? I used the Blackberry for just 2 DAYS. What kind of people are they?John wasted my time, and also distracted me from my real issue, which was that Wireovia sells bad products. They seemed to be helpful people, but after I deleted my review, they didn't make their propposal over.Please, be careful with making deals with these sellers.John, you're a thief.BlackBerry Bold 9000 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, and MicroSD Slot - International Warranty - White", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad quality", "Author": "A.
