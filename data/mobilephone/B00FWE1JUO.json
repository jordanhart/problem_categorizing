The SIM cutter includes the cutter and a number of sizing trays to use if you cut the SIM down and need to increase the size to put in back in an older phone.  The cutter works just like a stapler, put the SIM in the cutting tray if its already a Micro SIM or just insert it directly into the cutter if its the larger Mini SIM and it will easily cut it down to a Nano sized SIM.  Not much too it, works well and the extra trays to size up are a nice addition.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it and great price", "Author": "dantheman", "ReviewID": "R37LJTX6HH72P5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is what I needed.

Worked well! I didn't even have to sand it or anything. the sim card is a really tight fit but still works w/o any problems/modifications to the sim once cut. A++! Way better than buying a precut nano sim. FYI The adaptors work fine too! I cut my sim into a nano and then put it into a micro sim adaptor and used it in my android until i traded for an Iphone 5.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stay Away", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "ROMD860UFQF8D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed this to put my micro sim into a iPhone 5 which takes the nano. i ordered it used 2 day shipping cause i needed it quick. opened it up the cutter was broken the top was separate from the base the tabs were broken off. I would like to exchange it but they only refund. Considering i paid the extra for shipping costing almost 20$ i wont be able to replace it cause id have to pay shipping to send back and only get 8 $ back. So stay away just go to your carrier and get a new sim more reliable.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "rick hernandez", "ReviewID": "R2HN523B9U3SHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to change to my iphone 4 to an iphone 5 nano card.
