It catches people's attention, browsing is fast and snappy. 8GB memory and GPS built in. wifi, 4G what more one can ask.HP still provide great support and has mechanics to update the firmware from their site palm.com/rom I doctored it and updated with the latest firmware from HP/Palm website. I also unlocked it paying a site $17, but now there are free unlocking site available which I used for my other Palm Pre devices. I also use it without SIM using developer mode, given below. Has plenty of space for music and volume is pretty good in the internal speaker. Touchstone capabilities are awesome.  Unfortunately HP fumbled and stopped these line of products, but they are great and part of a history.Steps to bypass activation and use with just wifi: At the first screen to put SIM Card, using the keyboard type: BZ (those are the buttons for #*). dialer will appear. When the phone dialer appears use the screen to type: 3386633# and press dial. The phone will restart and you don't need a SIM card to use the phone. Use wifi for using like an ipod touch.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweeeeeeeeeettttt.", "Author": "vsarda \"vishnu\"", "ReviewID": "RKJ116WUN3GZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HP veer is a very sweet phone, with size so small. I loved webos and I love it even more on my small phone. The ability to do so much with such a tiny size blows me up. I kinda used impostah to force activate my HP veer and bypassed data plan from at&t; thereof since I never wanted data plan on any of my phone. That was the whole reason of not buying phone from AT&T.;Anyways, regarding phone, it is very sweet phone with ability to do a lot. I just wanted a phone, which functions like a normal phone does, but along can do small small things for me (like email checking etc.). I don't want phone to do everything for me as I have so many other things (laptop, desktop, tablets etc etc) to do it from. I wanted my phone to be sweet looking, easy to hold, stylish, and in budget. I bought it from amazon for around 85 bucks and without activating any data plan, it is a steal now. If I had to get a data plan, I would better buy expensive phones (galaxy, BB etc) from att. But this phone is for those who don't want to get into smartphone hassle, but still kind of want something fancy looking and in line with what is nowadays standard touch screen phone.I am going to enjoy my phone for next couple of years and will only look for new phone thereafter. Thanks HP for making so sweet phone, and special thanks to Preware/precentral guys for helping me bypass the regular activation process. Don't forget to donate few bucks to those guys as you are already paying dirt cheap to own such a beautiful phone (without data plan)...

I just recently got my hands on this phone and I feel I don't need any other ones. It's small, don't get me wrong, but I think that just adds to its compactness. I just recently said farewell to facebook. (It's the biggest waste of time and I honestly don't need to know, nor do I care what my friends are doing with their lives). Facebook came standard, but I automatically removed it. I used to own the Palm Pre 2 from AT&T; but I bought it unlocked. That phone wasn't as good as this one is. The camera is awesome, battery life is what it is (can't expect 1000 days standby...) and the operating system is not only beautiful but fast and easy to use. I love the Blackberry OS (5 actually) because of it's simplicity, and I gotta say webOS is right up there with how awesome it is. If you're looking for a small, compact smartphone (about the size of a credit card, no really, and the width of a deck of cards), then this is the right phone for you. The keys are small but they are something you can quickly get used to. I do have a problem with the X key for some reason, I have to press it harder than the other ones, but that's not a big deal for me, especially since it's a letter that I rarely use.It really is a shame that HP smartphones/webOS went under. I'd much rather see Blackberry or Windows Phone go under, but see webOS afloat. The operating system is amazing, the app store is what it is (I don't care much for apps anyway, plus get your hands on the Preware and you can get apps not found in app catalog), and it's comfortable to hold. Not to mention it does raise a lot of eyebrows follows by ooh's and aah's!Great phone, great OS, perfect for my needs. 5 stars, hands down.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Artur", "ReviewID": "R1ZTRPHJLIRV3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing product from HP.it has everything a modern smartphone has: bluetooth, wi-fi, 5MP camera, email access etc..it integrates seamlessly with several accounts such as Facebook, Linkedin, Corporate email (Exchange), etc...

If your complaining that movies seem small on your phone you should be taken out back and \"re-educated\", of course they are small it's a fracking phone.

I was sure to read reviews on this before I bought it. I was completely in love with the Palm Pixi, but after going through two of them after issues with the side buttons, I reluctantly moved to a Pre and discovered I liked it more. After all, there were plenty more apps compatible with it than the Pixi.After moving from Sprint network and operating a non-smart phone with AT&T;, I decided I wanted a smart phone again. I miss the versatility and interface of Palm and thought the Veer would be a great move forward.Wow--I expected it to be small, but when it was in my hands, it seemed even tinier! I really like the size, though. I managed to get 93% of the patches I used on my Pre onto this one. Everything was basically the same, which I was really relieved by. There's a place to slip on a wrist strap, which is nice. I'd need something like that. I like the front light bar it has that's similar to the Pixi--I was never fond of that Pre ball.I like the way it charges, but I don't like that the battery isn't removable and the headphone jack is magnetized. What if my silent button lost functionality? I would be hardpressed to find another way to hard reset. And another reviewer made a good point that the headphone jack would come off if pulled. I'm a clumsy person, and often I pull on my headphones by accident. I would quickly become weary of having to reattach after it became dislodged. (It's also a very small piece I know I'd lose.) Also, I want to be able to reuse my micro-to-usb cables.

It is fine to read text on, but I will definitely not be watching videos on my Veer.The keyboard is also quite small, which is very annoying as I am a pianist with long fingers and large hands. The keys also have a gummy/squishy feel, unlike most phones with solid buttons, so after a few months nail marks cover up the letters on the keyboard.The phone itself is tiny. The camera has no flash. To insert earphones, you must have a sort of connector, instead of directly attaching them to the phone. I found this incredibly annoying after losing the connector multiple times; it is quite small and hard to find after it is lost.Not a bad phone, but it does not match up with modern technology.
