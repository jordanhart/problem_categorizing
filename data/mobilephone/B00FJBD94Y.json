I don't need a whole lot of bells and whistles, my phone plan is with iwireless megatalk, and the data I have access to is limited.  I just want to be able to look up an address in a pinch or do a quick Google search.  This phone is great for that, it has access to my wireless internet here at the house, too, and if I want a faster, more in depth search, I just hook it up to my home internet.  So even if you don't have a data plan, you can work off of wifi.  There are a few apps like Google Maps and Play, and if you want more you need to get an SD card for more memory; you also need one if you want to take photos or video, so I bought Kingston Digital 16 GB Class 4 microSDHC Flash Card with SD Adapter (SDC4/16GBET). The camera is only rear, so you cannot Skype. The pictures aren't fantastic, it needs a LOT of light.Navigation is pretty easy, I like the swipe down menu, it allows you to quickly turn your data, Bluetooth and/or wireless on and off quickly.  Apps are easy to delete and organize, settings are easy to find and change.It did come fully unlocked, my calls and texts come through flawlessly, and I could still get data on my network(iwireless is connected to TMobile).  It's a nice light weight and the touch screen has good sensitivity, I can use my finger or stylus fine.  Has the standard calendar, calculator, alarm and fm radio. It also came with a charger, headset, and even a screen protector which was an added bonus.  It connected to my D3588-2 DECT 6.0 Expandable Corded/Cordless Phone with Answering System and Bluetooth CELLLiNK, Silver, 2 Handsets and 1 Base through Bluetooth with no problems at all, and all my calls are clear, handset, Bluetooth and speaker phone.May not be the latest and greatest, and the average techie may not think it's wonderful, but for the price, this is a great smartphone.  I would recommend this to anyone who might be contemplating the upgrade, it's cheap, and you don't have to sign a contract.  I haven't found any problems yet, but I will definitely update this review if any are found.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice sleek look but looks can only get you so far.

Constantly dropping calls and not even allowing me to answer when people called me. I emailed person who sold this product and they were nice in helping me get internet working but couldn't figure out why I couldn't send or receive picture messages. They are going to give me a refund for this which is nice. I don't recommend this phone at all. Pictures I took on it look fake and like I didn't even take them.
