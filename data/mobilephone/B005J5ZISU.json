I bought my phone new via Beast Deals, but when I took it to Verizon to activated it, the Sales Associate there informed me the phone was not new and even called Customer Service to prove it.  My \"new\" phone was activated in April 2008 and deactivated from an account Sept. 2008.  On a side note the Verizon Sales Associate was extremely rude and \"made fun\" of my phone in front of me.  I was irritated that she had to prove to me the phone was used instead of just doing her job and activating it.  Anyway, I went to Amazon with my info of my \"new\" phone being used and they didn't question it at all and simply refunded me the difference between new and used price.  I don't order much through Amazon and I was disappointed to discover new items being sold as used, but Amazon did make it right by me, so please beware that just because you purchase an item as new, doesn't mean it really is.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "not so good", "Author": "lg", "ReviewID": "R35PXTWY7017HR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 3 months and am NOT satisfied.

Not too small or too large.The Con is a big one and a deal-breaker in my opinion.This model is becoming known for it's cheap charging port. In my case it will no longer charge.After talking to some friends I have found that others who used this phone had the same issue.This is worse than the charging problem with the old Motorola e815's. At least the wall chargers would wear out rather than the charging port on that phone. And the wall chargers were dirt cheap.

Again, there was nothing wrong with it. Nothing wrong with the seller. But the phone was VERY bulky in my pocket, most of the time it would barley even fit in my pocket. And it always fell out. I lost it at school about 4 times but luckly, I got it back! I guess a peice of crap phone like this wasnt worth taking...(: But the description says that its hard to break, and I dropped it many times. The screws came loose, and it eventualy just fell apart. The keyboard stopped working, the screen did also. About one fourth of the screen went black, and then the rest did over time. The speaker was fuzzy and I just dont like the phone.

He is on the keyboard 90% of the time but the main screen is helpful for the ones who like to call. He likes this phone because 50% of his ringtones are from v-cast and the other 50% comes from a website called mediafiremp3.com. This phone is great for starters but this is his only basic phone out off 6 smartphones. It's body is very light, light as a pin. So don't start off with a smartphone cause trust me parents don't buy you another one unless they are rich like I am . Trust me get this phone. And  for a aau basketball travel team he text me when is nervous about a game. Also acceasing your own music is a piece of cake and sometimes you don't even have to use a data caple. The camera has an exellent view and I love when my son took a picture when he won the tournenment. Texting no problem easyest for people who text fast. Downloading games is a piece of cake also for other things.
