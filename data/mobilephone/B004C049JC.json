It emails better than the iPhone 4 because of the traditional Blackberry qwerty keyboard and it files and sorts emails like Outlook.  I can see all my email accounts on one screen and I can see my sent emails in the same screen.  This was something the iPhone 4 required going to two separate screens to see.  The HTC ARIA was even worse, had to go to each account and then switch from the inbox to sent folder.  This was a pain since I have 4 email accounts.Battery life on the Torch should get you through a full day, unless you are watching movies.  For an average day, I talk for an hour or two, email 20 - 30 times, listen to an hour of music and search the web for about 30 mins.  The HTC ARIA only lasted until 6pm.Screen resolution is good but not as nice as the iPhone 4.  The camera is pretty good and has custom settings.One major flaw is the oversensitive screen lock button - can be a pain when using the phone horizontally - inadvertent screen lock sucks.All in all, the Torch is a great phone.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "LisaE", "ReviewID": "RMHBE9DTJBFXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works flawlessly.  The touch screen is easy to use and not overly sensitive.  The browser is great.  There are many things BlackBerry does so much better than anyone else such as contact management and instant message management, in my opinion.  Push email is awesome.  I've had BlackBerries and HTC and BlackBerry wins hands down.  I have friends with iPhones and while their phone is dead until they get to a place to recharge it all I have to do is pop the battery out and put a fresh one in and I'm still going.  Being able to replace the battery on the fly is very important when I am out hiking or camping. One possible drawback to this particular phone is the OS6.  It is excellent in and of itself but my carrier doesn't support it and I was unable to get service books for the browser to work.  Check with your carrier to see if the phone is compatible and if the OS is compatible.  If not, a quick stop at Crackberry.com gave me the fix for that and now it works perfectly.

As a long time Blackberry user, I have found that I simply cannot get away from their product, nor do I want to. For a short period I had an iPhone but I could not get used to the keyboard. Every time I needed to write a long email I wanted to hit it with a hammer.Blackberry is simply the best for a business person or someone who needs to be typing on it all day. The keyboard on the Torch took a day to get used to vs the Curve but that was it. Here are a couple things I like about the Torch:1. Actual keyboard for those long e-mails.2. On screen keyboard for those quick texts or silent typing3. Calendar  - always simple, just start typing by the time of day and you're done.4. Better camera (Not iPhone 4 good, but good)There are many other additions to the Torch, but the simple fact is its a work horse phone plain and simple. If you want games and such, grab a new iPod. I still have my iPhone and will use it for messing around but I will always go to a Blackberry for work. Blackberry means business and iPhone and Android are there for wasting time (Not all apps of course are time wasters, but who can resist when you have Angry Birds just one click away?)Grab the new Torch, you wont be disappointed.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "I was told it was just part of the device", "Author": "tsabusyb \"tsabusyb\"", "ReviewID": "RVF9AFLBTMBTH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Here goes.

It's simply a perfect idea in its conception.I hate:It's slow and I mean slow on the processor end.  It takes some getting used to in order to delete multiple messages, but the WORST is that when I am on a call, the darn thing intermitently pushes numbers (like if your toddler was trying to get your attention and starting pushing the button on the phone to make them beep).  It also has put people on speaker phone while we are talking which is a big no-no for me.  Lastly, it hangs up while I'm on a call, which is the worst insult of all.  And no, I don't have a fat cheek.I can't imagine that RIM's engineers and beta testers didn't run into the problem.

I realized from past experiences that many people that deal in cell phones apart from the major cell phone companies are difficult at best to deal with. Many are unscrupulous and even dishonest in their dealings and their service and can not be trusted to back up what they sell or even deliver what they promise.For this reason I decided to deal through Amazon who over the years I have found to give excellent service and to be honest in their transactions.I bought my unlocked cell phone from ABE a vender with Amazon. The delivery was made within, actually before, the promised delivery date.At first I had a minor problem with the phone mainly because I did not understand how to use some of the functions I needed overseas.I sent a request to ABE to switch the phone out for another phone. I expected to be met with a disagreeable situation and an argument. Instead I was immediately contacted by ABE through Amazon by email. ABE sent me an email to ask for my phone number and called me. Within 3 days ABE sent me a new phone and told me how use the function I needed. I returned the first phone. The day of the delivery of the new phone ABE sent me an email asking if everything was ok and if the new phone was doing what I wanted it to do, It was, their service was great, and appreciated.I heartedly recommend both Amazon and their cell phone vender ABE.

But when it goes to loading huge amount of texts (300,000 and up), it takes quite some time(maybe 3 or 4 minutes or even more) to just finish downloading the page, and then it will take another 2 minutes to adjust the format as you zoom in. And if you are not careful enough holding the device up tight and so happen to flip it just a bit (or maybe just taking a sip of a drink or a call), it will automatically change its viewing from straight to side and here goes another extra 2 minutes again.I don't know if iphone or android have the same problem; yet I am actually fine with waiting the initial 3 minutes of the loading part.But honestly, I think it should have some sort of applications to lock the viewing as you are surfing the internet.And sometimes, it doesn't happen very often, while you are surfing the internet, the page somehow freezes and the back of the device starts heating up. And within 1 or 2 minutes period, the battery life suddently drops about 30%. I kinda worry if this is goning to damage the device.The actual keyboard is awesome, but the touch screen keyboard is just retarded. You often typed in the letter below the one you actually typed.The camera doesn't have a tiny mirror next to it, so it's really hard for you to take a picture of yourself.The back cover became a bit lose after I accidently dropped it six inches height to the desk, but it is probably my own fault (however I still haven't found the part that makes the cover lose).I think it's an ok device, and if rim fixes the touch screen keyboard and make some adjustments to the internet surfing, I'd rate it as 4 stars.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Blackberry yet!", "Author": "Alex Weber", "ReviewID": "RPSWGQ6WHJTJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been through a couple 8220 Flips and a 9550 Storm 2 that I've owned and I've used a few Curves and Bolds and this is by far the best Blackberry, hands down. Trying to compare it to previous BB models is downright unfair as it blows the all out of the water. The touch screen is a huge improvement over the Storm 2 and its nice to see standard gestures like pinch to zoom are supported. The fact that it has the full querty keyboard and trackpad makes it an easy transition from non-touch phones and also makes it more efficient in general as a lot of operations feel more natural doing it the \"old-fashioned\" way instead of touch-screen.The camera is much improved and BB OS6 is a huge improvement over previous versions. I love Social Feeds and how tightly the apps integrate with your contacts and the phone sofware in general. The new search feature is great too; just start typing and it brings results from contacts, emails, social feeds, applications, etc.So basically, as far as Blackberrys are concerned, you can't go wrong!Compared to other smartphones and mainly the iPhone4 you can tell that the touchscreen still has a ways to go before it reaches the same maturity as the others who've been doing this for longer.  Also, as far as apps go, its definitely lacking. There are very few good free apps and games and the games are just downright terrible compared to the amazing stuff that's coming out for iPhone.  That said, gaming probably isn't a big priority if you want a Blackberry.All in all, I'm very satisfied! I've been wanting this phone for over 6 months and watched tons of reviews and hyped the thing up so much and despite all of that I still managed to get surprised with this phone. It's awesome!Pros----+ Real touchscreen with all gestures+ Trackpad and QWERTY Keyboard = best of both worlds+ BB OS6 is great+ 5MP cameraCons----- Touch is a little awkward at times- Freezes/chokes for a few seconds occasionally- Lacking in app department- Crappy games", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't explain how BlackBerry made such a mess", "Author": "Rocklobster", "ReviewID": "R3QU41E0T7NPA2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love Blackberry.  I have been using RIM's BlackBerry products since they came on the market.  The Torch 9800, bought 1 year and 7 days ago was my second Smartphone made by BlackBerry.  I bought it in Upstate New York while visiting family. When I got home to DC, 6 days later, it had died.  Was given a new one and out I went.  Then, about 3 months later the one I got here died, really died. Now, I was in Warranty Territory.  So, I waited and got my third Torch 9800, with AT&T; refusing to give me the fix - the incredible 9810, which came out fast due to the errors, physical and in software of the Torch 9800 (I have a recording of a BlackBerry tech telling me that the 9800 was \"embarrassing,\" and they (the techs) wished AT&T; would cut a deal or do something to get the 9810 in our hands - yes, all recorded, legally)In came my next phone, it worked for 1 hour and died. I spent 22 hours over the next three days with AT&T; techs (very good) and BlackBerry techs (very good).  Finally, on day 4 of having it, we were happy. When it worked it was incredible.  The integration, everything, amazing.However, a few months down the road this third phone died again.  After 18 hours we determined it was a hardware issue.  I was offered my FOURTH Torch 9800, still under warranty.  Okay, no choice.  It came, it worked for 24 days and died.  We spent over a week, off and on and finally it worked.  I got it into pristine condition.  Number FOUR was the charm.Then, March 12, 2012 came around. It was the last day of my warranty coverage.  Maybe I was safe and would not get anymore refurbished phones.  No, about 11 a.m. on that nice day, the phone started rebooting itself over and over.  It was just sitting on a table and off it went.  Having been through that issue, I did everything they would ask be to do.I ended up calling AT&T; and they had me do everything again, which is very little since it never actually fully powered up, thus, my computer and the desktop program could not see the phone.  Yes, on the last day of my Warranty Coverage Torch 9800 number 4 bit the dust.Hey, I was lucky, I could still get a refurbished Torch 9800.  Then, in August, when my two year commitment was up I could upgrade to the 9810 or whatever I wanted.  It would only be $99, plus the upgrade fee of $39, and a few other things.All I had to do was to wait, get my refurbished Torch 9800, take a week to reload all of the programs, the options, and so on.  And, it only had to last THREE times as long as any single 9800 had lasted to date.I said no.  They (AT&T;) said, \"Sorry.\"  (yes, this is recorded, legally, plus, all of the chats have been saved.)  Finally, they made a deal.  I was lucky. They were going to let up get my upgrade that DAY.  WOW, how lucky.  I could pay $99, plus the $39 and other charges to get a phone that would work, I hoped for more then a few weeks at at time.I asked if there was a way they could credit the $99, after all, I had been without a phone or setting up phones for just over a total of 10 to 12 weeks.  They felt so bad for me, but, NO WAY.  Can't be done.  No way in the system to do such a crazy thing.After another 10 minutes, the nice guy I was speaking with - and, he was a very nice man - honestly.  He was a cog.  His manager said that I could get the Torch 9810 for about a reduction of $40.  Now, not only was I losing the phone, I would have 23 apps that would NOT work on the 9810.  It would be one thing if I had actually gotten to use them a few times, but, some were barely touched for I never had a phone work long enough to use them.  Also, one of the program that came with the 9800 hadn't shown up on the last phone and I had been charged for it again.  I need to work that out, plus, I think I am due a refund for the apps that don't work.  If the 9800 worked I would not have needed to get a phone that did not support many of the apps.I love my BlackBerry Torch 9810, though, I am actually nervous when I pick it up, will it work?The people I spoke with, from both companies were very professional and quite nice. Unfortunately, a 10 year customer to AT&T; isn't a big deal (I know what churn costs).Everything I have said about is the truth.  I have records of it all.  I could be off on the exact month or day that one of the phones died.  I might be off by a few $$s on the new phone costs - unlikely.RUN from this mess.  I beg of you, get a 9810 or another BlackBerry - Stick to BlackBerry, for when they work they are in a totally different class of product then any other Smartphone I have tried.  I am sure some people got some of the good phones, but, not me.Know this, when any BlackBerry product is up and running, you are in a different world as to what you can accomplish.  The phones are so tightly integrated to so many of the apps and more.  There is almost no app that you may be in from which you can do a totally different task.BlackBerry, I don't think, makes Smartphones.  These are something else, a major step up, but, in the ways that make a difference.  If you are buying for just name, you know what to buy, but, if you want to be impressed every day, if you want a product that just doesn't fit the term Smartphone, go with the best.  I am a desktop computer lover, though, I have four laptops and notebooks, plus three other work stations.The odd thing: so far with the Torch 9810, I have found that I barely touch my desktop, including the two 24\" HD screen computer I usually use.  All of this was on the Torch 9810.That's it from me.  All the best to everyone.  NOTE: When speaking to any of the customer service and tech folks, please treat them with respect.  They work hard, are under a lot of stress.  I always ask them to please try to let whatever we just went through, to leave them as they leave work.  No need for anyone to take home that kind of stress.

However for corporate business the Blackberry torch is the perfect solution.I have a new addiction to add to my list, and I am sure my family doesn't like this phone even more than they didn't like the last one.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Phone except for one thing", "Author": "J.

WOW. This is my first Blackberry, and first touch screen smartphone. I'm a former Nokia man coming from the E61i. I did months of research, I looked at the HTC HD2 and 7 Samsung Omnia 7 and  many others comparing features likes and dislikes. I believe you should KNOW WHAT YOU NEED in a smartphone before you buy, there is no one PERFECT phone on the market plus nothing beats going to a local store and see and touch or even demo the item.  If you have access to a pc I highly recommend, FIRST that you download the Blackberry Desktop Software and connect the TORCH to get the need updates for the CORE SOFTWARE and APPS before putting your stuff on it. Yes it is a phone, but it is also half pc and must be treated so as to get the BEST PERFORMANCE from it.  Blackberry is the KING for business and messengering!!! The TORCH handles them beautifully and with ease. I find that I lean more on the hard keys to type long messages, but I am trying to get use to screen typing. The screen is great for watching videos and reading text(ebooks), but I think it could have been a little bigger. There is room. Althought, I updated the software when multitasking heavily you can see the HOUR GLASS popping up. I believe that can be corrected with a faster CPU and more MEMORY, plus I found some helpful tips and tricks on Youtube that I used to BOOST and OPTIMIZE the PERFORMANCE of the TORCH and can work on most Blackberry phones.  The battery life is also outstanding. I can go all day on one charge, but as your know depending on what you mostly use it for can shorten the life of the battery. The TORCH is my personal phone, but I have a company phone as well to travel with and do my job, so I can't give a fair accessment of the battery life.  I have taken some photos and videos with the camera(5MP) and they would PASS:-), well it is a camera phone so you can still get a decent photo to email right away if needed, or capture a special moment as it happens.  The APPLE IPHONE has maybe a million plus apps, but I only need two or three on my TORCH to get to get the information that I may need (sports scores, weather, etc.)  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Blackberry TORCH and you will LOVE it:-) I read in a leak somewhere that the TORCH 2 is coming later this year and I am looking forward to it.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "I have owned every kind of smartphone here is my review on Blackberry Torch", "Author": "L. Breda \"L.\"", "ReviewID": "R30R1GI59BRENW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a phone junky! It's taken me about 20 different phones to realize I have a problem! While most girls want shoes I am always wanted the latest greatest new phone. I would consider myself an expert in the world of smartphones. My last nine phones have been (in order) Motorola Q, Iphone 3g, Iphone 3gs, Palm pre plus,HTC, Motorola Droid, Motorola Droid X, Blackberry Torch, and finnally iphone 4 (my current and favorite phone which I am sticking with).I am writing a review on the new Blackberry Torch because I think it gets to much credit in the smartphone world. When I first got it I was enamored with the slide out keyboard and the slick robust feel of the phone. I noticed right away that it was sluggish and most screens lagged. I still pushed onwards with the Torch I had owned a blackberry pearl a at one time and was impressed by blackberrys battery life and the quailty of product. True to blackberry the Torch has great battery life and even with moderate to heavy usage I could go all day! in comparison with all the other phones I had owned (even the apple phones 3g and 3gs) the blackberry Torch is very good on battery given the screen size and the wide range of features.Three months into owning this device things started going downhill. I would think it was only my phone that was defective but my boyfriends had the same problems and I purchased them at the same time. The screen started freezing, getting caught in landscape mode, half the screen turned white, more and more problems kept coming up! To top it all off with a few programs installed the Torch got extremely slow, it lagged on every screen to the point I avoided using it too look things up because it was too frustrating. Everyday my boyfriend and I were taking off the backs of the phones to reboot them and it really became a pain.On the plus side the Torch was great for security reasons not that I have anything that needs to be secure! And the slide out keyboard is awesome and easy to type on! The on screen keyboard is a joke and unusable, but the touch screen works well for browsing the web and clicking on links.I don't dislike the Blackberry Torch I just don't believe its a phone that allowed me to get the most out of my data package and I don't feel like it was the most reliable phone. As far as blackberrys go the web browsing experience is better than previous Blackberrys but the sluggish phone won't allow you to enjoy the new browser. The phone looks great is very durable, sounds great when its not frozen and you can place a call, and is overall a good option for those who need the security of Blackberry.

I needed a new phone now and was very disappointed with the usability of the Nokia phone. The Blackberry, to make it short, is excellent: great build quality, nice physical keyboard, everything is just as big as it should be. Everything is usable. And unlike Nokia, it took me one day, not two weeks to figure out the basics of the phone. All-in-all, I can totally recommend this phone.Update after 3 weeks: Still love it, and I really love the physical keyboard. This phone is great, and is awesome for e-mail.My only negatives on this phone are the following:- I had the phone at 50% and wanted to just plug it into my laptop to power it up. I picked up the phone and the entire screen was black and totally dead. What ? Nothing worked to revive it ! Very, very disappointing.- The battery is EXTREMELY hard to remove ! I tried as hard as I cold with just my human hands, but even if my life had depended on it (thank God it didn't !), I could not have gotten that battery out. I finally got home and used a very sturdy \"tactical\" knife to pop out the battery. I seriously hope none of you needs to get the battery out of the case when you don't have a big knife handy !", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Irritating little robot.", "Author": "T. Hunt \"wasabi crush\"", "ReviewID": "R1DIYOQLCEWNG0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I opted to upgrade to a stronger device during the AT&T; transition this Spring so this is my first experience with a, \"smart\" phone.  Mistakes were made.Over the last few months, instead of peevishly spitting curse words every time I've had a problem, I've instead swallowed the angst and am storing it in my body until I build a superhuman charge.  Once reached, I'll then maintain a subcritical status until my contract expires.  When that day comes I'll say goodbye to friends and loved ones, pet my dog one last time, grab this phone, and drive down to my local AT&T; store.  I'll wait patiently in line for approximately two to four hours and listen for my name.  I'll then stand up, raise the Blackberry Torch to my mouth, and yell an alien curse word so vile and contaminated that the resulting ten-mile crater will be approachable by neither man nor machine for the remainder of Earth's life.Yes, I am exaggerating, but the Torch doth burn me daily and I'm sick of it.I've developed a disdain for the touchscreen that is palpable.  It freezes frequently throughout the day requiring numerous battery removal/restarts, which got old immediately.  I brought this up to an employee at AT&T; and he confirmed my technique.  \"Yeah,\" he grunted, trying to wedge his fingernails behind the defiant battery cover.  \"You have to yank the batteries out of these things daily or they'll lock up on you.\"  He popped the battery out, one Mississippi, pushed it back in, and then we both stared absently out the window at a drunken homeless woman attempting to navigate the treacherous, smooth-stoned landscaping surrounding the store's perimeter while the Torch's load-screen bar struggled against some demons of its own.And this isn't uncommon.  As the problem persists, I find myself seeking comfort in numbers.  When I see someone with a Torch, I typically ask them for a performance review and the freeze issue has proven a universal one.  I have no idea why this makes me feel better but it does, so I keep asking.  Earlier this week I was invited to a neighbor's house and his mother was there.  She was ranting maniacally about the threat of terrorism and hit a crescendo that included semi trucks, rocket launchers, and our local oil refineries when said neighbor's Blackberry, which I hadn't yet noticed, started vibrating on the coffee table.  Without thinking, I rudely cut her off to ask him what he thought of his phone.  I had front-row seats to a rapidly escalating, frothing paranoia wherein the woman actually pantomimed holding a rocket launcher and I killed it all dead.  The audacity of the social severing was astonishing and made me realize how deeply wounded I really am.I'm also flipping out every time I accidentally hit, \"MUTE\", or, \"HOLD\" with my cheek meat.  This too happens often and it's infuriating.  I'll be talking to someone and then suddenly that someone is gone.  By the time I get the screen back on and sort out which icon I've activated, the person I was speaking with will have already hung up and moved on to a more rewarding conversation elsewhere.I understand that you'll come across these problems with touchscreen phones, but why not have a screen lock that automatically initiates when the phone is answered?  Or one that can be activated by the user if needed?  If the Torch houses something similar that I've not yet discovered, I'll beg a thousand pardons, but for now I'm working under the assumption that this isn't traversed outside of making a conscious/sub-conscious effort to hold the phone at a preventative angle away from what I've come to know as a villainous facial structure.I've also had some problems with the unit displaying a small, \"you'll wait\" clock while it sporadically processes data of unknown origins.  This is crippling to the performance of the phone, rendering it entirely useless until the activity is complete.  Again, this happens randomly and seemingly without provocation.  So, if you need to make a phone call and Wee Clock is busy, \"you'll wait\".Lastly, the on-board camera is just weak.  Last weekend, a friend of mine was showing me shots he'd taken on his Android and I was instantly enamored with the results.  So much so that I wanted to punch his head, steal the phone, and drop my flaccid chunk of failing technology on the pavement next to him before snapping a Pulitzer-winning depth of field photo of the rapidly cooling crime scene.  Torch photos are bland.I know this stuff sounds petty, and it is, but if I'm going to spend this much money on a phone that claims substantial leaps in its field, then I expect it to function at the elevated level advertised.  But it just doesn't do that.  There are some fun apps and a few groovy extras but this isn't enough to quell the scathing grudge I'm developing for this cellular telephone.And, to add insult to injury, my wife rejected the upgrade and went with a stock phone that works beautifully.  There have been times when I've needed to make a phone call and jabbed violently at my Torch's screen before finally giving up the ghost and borrowing hers.I've been duped.  I've been a fool.- tAddendum.  30 October, 2011:Now the phone is blinking in and out of screen lock during normal text operations.  It's exasperating.  I've tried to pin down which letter is doing this, but the prognosis is worse than I could have expected.  It seems the phone has suffered a stroke and now the whole right side of its qwerty board has been rendered useless, albeit randomly so.  Immediately after removing/replacing the battery it works beautifully, but rapidly degenerates into a grossly negligent pile of inoperable plastic that cries quietly in the corner.  I want to punch it with nine cinder blocks while dancing viciously.- tAddendum.  13 December, 2011:Desperate now.  I went through and deleted every app not being used on a daily basis and there weren't many.  This in the hopes that the wee machine would feel less encumbered during its stay with me.  Had there been no contract melding us in some tragic, embryonic embrace, I'd have driven the phone to a quiet field outside of town and thrown it at my own face until it exploded.This, unfortunately, is not the case and now I'm having to remove the battery anywhere from five to ten times a day just to make a phone call or send a text message.  And please, please let me reiterate to you that I'm not alone, here.The Blackberry is made by the clumsier demons of Hades and these demons are made fun of constantly.- t", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "SUCKS...!!!", "Author": "Arundell", "ReviewID": "RFJVHAQBVWNNR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I over looked a few glitches at first but now it's over bearing, only 4 months have gone and my buttons aren't working, the phone freezes all the time and blank out, the touch screen sucks I have to resort to that because of the buttons and and it gives me all kind of problem.

It is a big improvement over traditional blackberry's since it incorporates many of the iphone features such as touch screen, picture sliding and so on, while retaining the best features of the blackberry: the physical keyboard and the trackball. It's the best of both worlds.  The screen is larger than a traditional blackberry and the design is modern and functional.  The pictures taken with it's camera are quite good.  It was easy to set it up since it is basically done in the same way as other traditional blackberry's. The only feature I missed is 4G capabilities, but I had read horrible reviews on the 9810 model (which features 4G), the most common complaints being that it freezes all the time and the battery lasts very little time (sometimes only 5 hours).  So, I did not regret getting this 9800 model, which enjoyed far better reviews.  I bought an international unlocked version and I inserted a foreign SIM card and used it on wifi mode only while travelling abroad to avoid roaming charges.  However, the moment I returned to the U.S. and inserted an AT&T; card and activated a data plan from them, the wifi radio was immediately blocked and never worked again.  Even though it would connect to my home network and other hotspots, it would not let me browse nor download email via wifi.  Consistently a \"cannot connect message\" would come up.  It drove me crazy.  I spent two days trying to fix the problem and blogged for two days on the blackberry forum, but it was impossible to come up with a solution.  From my research, I learned that many Torch 9800 owners were experiencing exactly the same problem: wifi would not work.  I even called AT&T; and went to one of their stores to see if they could help me, and they were absolutely useless.

I am a fairly passive consumer and do not normally feel too passionately about products one way or another.  But this phone has caused me so much pain and heartache that I have been inspired to share my long list of grievances with the world.First, the good.  I begrudgingly had to give this phone two stars, because yes, it's cool that it's a blackberry with a touch screen and still has a full keyboard, and that's worth a star.  That's pretty much where the good stops.  Let the rant begin.First, the touch screen is crap.  Honestly, you poke one part of the screen, and it will act like you poked a part of the screen an inch away.  This makes the touch screen incredibly frustrating to use and cripples the utility of having a touch screen by at least 60%.  You will never use the on-screen keyboard, even if you try, because you can't possibly type a word correctly.Second of all, this phone is incredibly buggy.  Frequent freezes and crashes?  You bet. Dropped calls?  Of course!  Short term memory loss?  You'll get that.  Deletion of call history beyond an extremely short period of time?  100% included.  Notifications whenever any one of your 500 friends does anything on facebook?  Oooh yeah!  And beware, if you try to delete the social feeds app like a normal sane person, it just deletes the icon so you have no way of deactivating the facebook feed without getting a new phone.But that's just the beginning.  The worst, and I mean of all this crap I've had to put up with, the single worst aspect of the phone is the screen lock button.  It's at the very top of the phone, and is extremely sensitive to any physical contact, including the drop of a piece of pocket lint.  So warn your friends beforehand if you get this phone, because you will be pocket dialing them about 5 times a day.  And warn your accountant too, because if you travel abroad you will incur at least an extra $100 a day in pocket dialing charges.  Carlos Slim will be very pleased.I am an ardent freedom-preaching capitalist, and I believe it's rare that a company puts out a product that actually destroys utility for its customers.

For years I waited for a smartphone that combined with the use-ability of the iphone but with a keypad so that I could bust out work emails with the speed of light without making a 100 typos. I wanted to carry only one phone and I thought the BlackBerry Torch was the answer. Instead, I want to light this MF on fire. The Torch is a once, non-intuitive and non-imaginative. It's clunky. It's like the developers never even picked up the iphone when they developed this latest \"iPhone Killer.\" Let me tell you, if the Torch is an iPhone killer, then Roberto Duran was the Sugar Ray Leonard killer. No Mas! I'm taking this steaming piece of doggie doo back to AT&T; and unwinding this 5 hour transaction with extreme prejudice. But if you want a real critique, here is a short list: the web browser is awful; the touch pad typing is horrendous; the map sucks; why can't I add a number to existing contacts?!?; they make you agree to a contract on every application that you open . . .if I were going to spend 48 hours with this phone, I'm sure that I could find 50 things I hate about it. And to the two people who had iPhones and advised me to buy the Torch like they did: get off of the Crack(berry)! And did I mention that I hate this phone?

First I would like to say that I see why the Blackberry Torch could be popular with it great abilities to manage and view stuff form the internet. My issue with the phone is its unnecessarily difficult to use OS which takes to long to navigate between windows. But my primary issue is the fact that my phone freezes every couple of minutes as im am texting a friend or using the internet forcing me to restart every time (I have only installed 5 apps that did not come with the phone and I have not used memory space for anything else). The lack of apps and the bad quality of the apps available from app world also bothers me a lot. As a first time Blackberry user I initially bought one thinking that it possibly match or out perform other platforms like Android os and Apple's ios based on how Blackberries are seen as phones with the highest and best quality.

The more competition, the better for the consumer, otherwise we're stuck with Google, Apple, and maybe Samsung.  I waited so long for RIM to make a 4G phone as I didn't want to get stuck with another 2 year contract with old technology.  More than a year after its competitors, the Torch finally came out, and I jumped on it.  It started as a breath of fresh air, as coming from the Bold, the screen was beautiful, and I could actually make use of the internet on a halfway decent screen!  The Torch also looked the part of a good smart phone.Then I started using it! Here are the frustrations I encountered:-The battery would not keep a charge for a full day, even on standby, so I always had to have a charger with me!-The lock button is too easy to press, and I could not use my favorite Blackberry Holder, because I always need to touch the off button in order to pull it out of the holder to answer the phone.  I would then have to call back the person half the time.-The touchscreen includes a mute button and a speaker button.  It's really easy while on the phone to have one of those buttons be touched by my cheek, and most of the times I have lost the conversation while trying to \"unpush\" them.  Extremely frustrating, and totally unacceptable.-If you are in the \"Contacts\", and you want to make a phone call that is not within your contacts, you can pull up the touchscreen keyboard, but when you switch to numbers, those numbers are so tiny, that there is almost no way to touch them and not make a mistake.Terrible design, terrible phone.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "ten stars", "Author": "roberto", "ReviewID": "R2BQHD78DGJP3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works perfect.

This is my third BB, had the Curve and the previous torch that has the slide out keyboard (the fatter, wider, thicker Torch...don't know the model# offhand).  I upgraded from the slider because the IT guy told me it was the latest 4G model, and should be better and faster.  Besides the Curve, both the slider and this one experience the same issues:  they hesitate, lock up and basically freeze on a weekly basis forcing you to pull the battery and re-boot.  This procedure takes about 4-5 min's.  Some weeks it works fine, but just when you need it to work quick it will just slow down and basically stop.  Most frustrating is using the Weather Channel app that comes pre-installed.  OMG, it takes Forever to load.  My wife's iPhone 3GS is lightening fast loading this app.  Also, the apps from Blackberry suck.  Sorry, but they are cheap knockoff's of the popular apps you hear about.  The apps have stupid names like \"Throw Crazy Things\" or something like that.  And most if not all cost something.  On the positive side, when the camera does feel like working, it does take really nice pictures, and the video camera is also very good.  Both have a tendency to freeze-up though.  The flash works well, but not on skin tones which turn out with a blue tint.  I use the camera frequently for taking images of parts (for work) and it works fine for that application.  I can run out in the plant, take a pic, and email it to myself before I get back to my office.  Another positive is that the email works well about 85% of the time.  It also freezes when you try to scroll down your inbox list, but its probably the best function for this phone.  It has a really nice screen too, larger than the iPhone, but in my opinion not as nice as my iPod Touch (4th Gen) Retna screen.  So, if you are forced into using one of these like I am, then you deal with the hesitation, and having to pull out the battery every week or two.  If you have the option....get an iPhone!", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "it had broken pins and did not connect with the sim card.", "Author": "Eliiko", "ReviewID": "R1RHUXA4VP5SC7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "as i said it had broken small golden colour pins and when I swiped my sim card in they fell down..", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry 9800", "Author": "JuliK", "ReviewID": "R29TYYQB8NWGBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything was good.
