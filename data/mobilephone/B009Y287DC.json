That means spotty coverage and intermittent service. At my home, it worked about half the time, and I live in Fort Worth, Texas. Straight Talk rep promised to add days to my plan to compensate, but that never happened.Then, six weeks after I bought the phone, it would no longer charge the battery with either the AC or car charger. Obviously a problem with the phone and/or battery.I moved to a Samsung Galaxy Centura. It is served by Verizon. So far, dependable service and I'm delighted with the phone itself.The salesperson at WalMart said Motorola made/makes good basic phones but, when it comes to smartphones, just simply \"doesn't get it.\"Sounds right to me!", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Motorola Defy", "Author": "Alleen G.", "ReviewID": "R3SQUW7XQPNXMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the phone very much..although I had difficulty with the touch screen keyboard.
