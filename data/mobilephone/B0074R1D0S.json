I had taken the phone to an AT&T; certified dealer to have it authorized.  That dealer said the phone was blocked, probably stolen, and showed me the red print screen making that statement.  The seller of the phone said that was impossible.  I then went to an AT&T; store and got the same red screen.  This all involved a lot of exchange with the seller but we reached some agreement pending on my showing the seller the screen stating the blocked condition of the phone.  Once again I went to the AT&T; store.  This time, and after the 3rd SIM card, I was told that the phone was working but that I needed to get the 4 digit security card from the seller.  Of course the seller believed that the phone was new and likely would not have a security code.  When I got home I saw that the AT&T; agent had been confusing the phone number screen with a security code screen and no code had been entered.  The phone is working.  AT&T; owes him an apology.

Pretty good considering the holiday. The phone is an iPhone 4, but it came in an iPhone 5s box with some cellophane on half of the box. The phone has absolutely no marks, nicks, dings, scratches or any indications of being used (other than a text from an area code from which it came and an iCloud pass-code). I would assume this phone was a floor model, or display model that may have been refurbished. The phone came with all the plastics on it. The wall charger was new, as were the apple head phones, but the cord was definitely used. And there was no user's manual(not that I use them) So I am not sure how this is considered a new phone, but I am pleased with it at this time. I put my sim card in it from my old windows phone and it works great. For what I paid and how nice the phone is I can't complain to much.
