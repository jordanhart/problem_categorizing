{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Condition and Exceptionally High Volume", "Author": "Paul W", "ReviewID": "R1WCGYOF5YQIX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for a used Samsung Sch U540 that I bought from ReCellulartoo. This is a replacement for the identical phone that I have had for about five years. I have significant hearing loss and I have not been able to find a more featured model with the same high volume level and sound quality than my original Samsung U540 that I could use on the Verizon network. Very Frustrating. I looked at IPhones, Androids, etc. but the volume is not as loud as this ancient phone. So, I bought two used phones hoping that one would work. Surprise: they both work; the sound quality and volume are the same as the original and I am a happy camper!The phones do not come with an owners manual but they are available for download on the Web. Verizon activated one phone for me with no difficulty and now I have a spare!", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product but aged", "Author": "Curly Blue", "ReviewID": "R2K2S951DFSW7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fine phone.  But I had to return it to the vendor.  It was used (which I knew before buying).

She is happy with it, except it is too old a model to be able to have her phone numbers backed up on it with auto backup.  That was dissappointing and a hassel for her, but she likes the phone otherwise.  We only use the phone as a phone, no texting or web is on our service.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Is new and refurbish phone are the same?", "Author": "Chun  J Chen", "ReviewID": "R2SPNQ82BCBHRW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I mean when I got a new phone it came with the original box that contain charger, battery, the instruction booklet and the warranty paper, but this order that I got it had the battery charger and the phone which isn't in its original box.  I know I shouldn't complain about it because you get what you pay.  But when I order it said NEW PHONE so to my understanding that a NEW phone means its in the original box.  When its refurbish phone just say it's a refurbish phone that way people know what they are getting.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, Good Value", "Author": "Roy Prescott \"Roy\"", "ReviewID": "RZPU9B7VWF3JA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice purchase for someone not in need of a smart phone.
