{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Apple0531", "ReviewID": "RNT8B833P69R1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this Blackberry phone more than any phone I have ever used. I owned one once before, and was addicted to it. It gets great apps, good customizing abilities, not to mention it is a cute color. The only issue I ever had with it was it takes forever to turn back on if it dies or if you turn it off for a long time. But as long as you take good care of it, and keep it charged regularly, it should work fine. The only other issue I have is when the battery power gets too low, the service cuts off and you can't make calls or send texts. So you have to keep it charged nightly! The sound is good, it has Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, a very good camera, great app store, and a very cute look. It doesn't have all of the same apps as you can get for a Droid or iPhone, but I always loved this more than any Droid I've ever owned. I've had more trouble and problems out of Droid than any other phone. I always end up coming back to my Blackberry. I recommend it.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really Functional", "Author": "Lobejean56", "ReviewID": "R2Q63WW3JZG1O8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a cute and girly phone.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R99FFK86RM2OZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My former Blackberry died in September of 2011 and when I went into Verizon for a replacement the salesperson assured me that this phone was just as good as the last Blackberry phone I had.  He was wrong....WAY WRONG. I explained that the nature of my work requires that I take photos and I needed a phone that would do that. This phone does not have a flash and the photo quality is HORRID.  If you take photos with this phone just know that you will only be able to enjoy them on the small screen on the phone. The screen on this phone is also smaller than my former phone. I am up for a phone renewal in February and can't wait to get something different!On the plus side, the speaker phone does work really well and the reception remains clear. I am able to receive calls when others around me have difficulty getting a signal.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "annonomys", "ReviewID": "R1AK7ILL0ONST5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have verizon wireless this is the phone to get!

There was also a Verizon logo imprinted on the bottom, which you dont see on the pic.  Then when I tried to put my SIM card into the phone I realised that it does not take SIM cards, only chips.  So again, the phone was totally useless to me.  We dont use chips for any cellphone service in my country.
