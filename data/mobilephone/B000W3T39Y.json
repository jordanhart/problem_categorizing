{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Favorite Symbian Series 60 Smartphone", "Author": "Jay Busari", "ReviewID": "RQQP49VUROV4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E51 is sleek, built for style and productivity...a rare combination that means popularity with true merit. So I'm quite puzzled that this phone isn't being pushed as much as the N95.It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode.It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes.Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email).Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message).I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages.There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser.  The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs.The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys.Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small.Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back.The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone.The CPU is very fast at 350MHz, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Mini USB 2.0, 2.5 mm A/V connector. The BP-6MT 1050mAh battery gives me great talk time and standy time even with liberal use of bluetooth and WLAN.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best feature/price ratio on the market!", "Author": "Ivan Miric", "ReviewID": "R1RFZN9Z9W0HAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After owning the device for a month now, here's my quick rundown of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros (in order of importance):+ Excelent feature vs. price ratio. You'll be hard pressed to find another mobile device offering the same feature set, smartphone capabilities, and strong community following, for the same price. This is arguably the best bang for your buck smartphone on the market right now. After researching for quite a while before purchasing, this was a big deal-maker for me.+ Slim, stylish, classic candybar design and quality construction. The phone feels sturdy and the noticeable weight provides confidence it's not going to break if you happen to drop it accidentally (I can personally attest to this).+ High-quality screen. Sure, it's a bit on the small size compared to other Nokia offerings, but the QVGA resolution and 16M color display more than make up for it. You'll have a hard time watching full-length movies on it because of the size, but the pictures really look great and the UI is a pleasure to look at, especially with your choice of 3rd-party themes.+ Excelent performance. Plenty of CPU power and RAM to run several resource intensive games and application, at the same time.+ Symbian OS 9.2. This is a tried and tested smartphone OS. You just can't beat the huge application library available on the platform. Coupled with the performance bit above, the OS just flies through anything you run. Very responsive and stable.Now, onto to the negatives.Cons (in order of annoyance):- Weak battery. If you plan on using any of the features aside plain voice calls, get used to carrying the charger with you at all times. The battery is seriously underpowered, and a few hours worth of WiFi (for VoIP calls and light web browsing) on a full charge will last you--at most--24 hours. And don't even think about turning on Bluetooth for your wireless headset, since it will drain a full charged battery in about 5 hours--no joke. This is really a shame and it's one of the most frustrating aspects of the phone.- Application certificate: mandatory. The S60 3rd Edition Symbian OS makes a requisite that all installed applications must be signed with a proper certificate. This reduces the amount of software you can install on the phone by a large amount, since most freeware or small apps you might run into are usually unsigned. The only way I have found to remove this \"feature\" is to effectively hack your phone, with the risk of corrupting your system. Thankfully, all went well and I'm able to install all I want now, but this security measure is simply too restrictive for the end user. If you want to take advantage of the best aspect Symbian has going for it, get ready to perform this procedure.- Bugs in the current firmware. Although Nokia regularly updates the firmware of most of its lineup, it has recently set all their efforts on their flagship N series devices. The latest E51 firmware (200.34.36) was released on April 24, 2008, and has some major issues with the SIP client and browser, yet no update is in near sight.=== Added on 2008-12-26 ===- I forgot to mention the very annoying case of the side buttons (volume, mute, power, PTT). They're EXTREMELY hard to press. You literally have to hold the phone firmly with one hand, while you push forcefully on a button with your other hand. It also helps if you have long nails to dig into the buttons. Not sure why Nokia decided to have them so difficult to press.======- The following are not so much of an annoyance, as me nitpicking. The only feature missing from the phone that's not a gimmick (touchscreen, accelerometer, etc.) and would come in handy, especially in business oriented devices like the E series, is A-GPS. But since this would certainly drive the price way up, I think it compensates quite well despite not having this feature. The other feature gripes, like no flash or autofocus on camera, would really be pushing it, since this is not a camera phone, but it's still worth mentioning. One other small thing, is that the phone gets considerably warm during prolonged usage (15min+), be it WiFi, voice calls, video playback, etc. You can still hold it in your hand just fine, but I got worried the first time I noticed it. It's no big deal, really, once you get used to it.In summary, the one thing that soures up the experience of using this phone is the battery. For that fact, I'll have to give it 4/5 stars, but I'm completely satisfied with my purchase, and will surely consider another Nokia smartphone in the future.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Finally, a world-class stylish phone for geeks like me", "Author": "Happy Customer", "ReviewID": "R16782W6ERR24Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the cameras today are aimed either for kids (like the chocolate), fashion conscious adults (the big hit razr), or business people (the bulky blackberry or treo).What if i want a phone that is sleek but also loaded with all the important business tools?  well the E51 was a Godsend.This sleek phone comes with high speed 3G internet and WiFi connection.  Gone are the days paying $15 to connect to the internet at airports and hotels.  Simply use the mini usb cable or download a symbian based modem application and you can use your phone as your modem.The camera is decent (2mb) and since micro sd cards are so cheap nowadays (i bought a 4gb Kingston one at Amazon for $14) you can use this phone also as a portable mp3 player (stereo ear phones included).The best part of all though; it runs on Symbian.  Download Opera mini and Google Maps (with a neat 'show current location function) and you have the capability to browse html pages and use the phone as a water down gps device.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "You are going to either love this phone or hate this phone", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R2U9LL97LTOHWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You are either going to love this phone or hate this phone. I love mine. But I am going to write this review with an eye towards scaring away people who will hate this phone.This phone's feature set is balanced differently than most other phones in its price class. Other phones in this price class emphasize megapixels, music, video, and fashion. This phone emphasizes productivity and connectivity. If you want productivity and connectivity, here is your phone. If not, there are plenty of others to choose from here on Amazon and elsewhere.Let's start with what this phone does well -This phone remotely synchronizes with Microsoft Exchange. If your company uses Exchange, you will have one phone book, one appointment calendar, and one e-mail inbox equally available on your computer and your phone. Updates in either place show up in the other. The Nokia implementation even handles contacts that have a company name but no first-name or last-name fields. My Motorola RARZ2 V8 failed this test.The phone has Wi-Fi. I didn't know how much I would use Wi-Fi on my phone until I had it.The phone can display word, excel, and PDF documents. It runs Google Maps very well, but without a GPS chip, you can only locate your position within about 900 to 5000 meters.The phone has a real message waiting light. Why is this feature disappearing from modern phones?The phone supports high speed 3.5G data on two bands. This is a lot for a European phone, especially one that came to market last year. Sadly, high speed data service is pretty much nonexistent here in the United States, and much of what does exist is on a band this phone can't handle. But will you get EDGE data (and voice) nearly everywhere in the United States and abroad. Indeed, reception in fringe areas is significantly better than my wife's Nokia 6086. I have connected to ATT's HSPDA network in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Madison, and Minneapolis. I can't connect in Chicago because the network runs on an incompatible frequency there (1900Mhz).Battery life is outstanding, especially for a thin phone.Now lets move on to this phone's weak points -The camera is only 2 megapixels. And it is fixed focus at that. And it doesn't work well in the dark. And there is only one of them [most phones capable of sending video have two - one facing outward and one facing you]. The camera is good enough for me, but I would never put shots from it in the family album.The music player doesn't display album art. No flashy light show either. And you are limited to the built-in speaker or a 2.5mm audio jack (I think it helps 'em keep the phone thin - forget about it and use A2DP if you want headphones). I must admit, however, that I really miss gapless playback. Music loads into the phone very slowly on account of the older 1.5 megabyte per second USB limit.The phone will record video. I have not been able to record video at Nokia's claimed quality (15 fps QVGA). I think I have been lied to. I think Nokia means either 15 FPS or QVGA, but not both at the same time.The phone will play video, even from YouTube, but not at high bitrates.Be prepared for plenty of British spelling in the menus and applications.This phone's idea of fashion is understated basic black. I like it, but then again I am this phones target audience.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Happy with E51", "Author": "AD", "ReviewID": "R39DLD7M34KU8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been following the E50 & E51 phones and I am quite happy with this phone. A smart phone has to be a good phone first. This one come pretty close. Small form factor, does not feel heavy in pocket, decent battery life, quad band, speaker phone, 3G, and wifi. I love the small light that blinks to let you know of a missed call.Cons:1) Speaker volume is low, compared to other Nokias I have had.2) If you are a heavy user of the Wifi you might find the screen size small3) Does not charge by USB cable.I thought hard about buying the E51 or the iPhone. I think the iPhone wins overall, but I will never buy it so long as Apple arm-twists me into signing a contract with AT&T; or any one phone company.", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "A solid phone that does not disappoint", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R3GN3IBI666V9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the Nokia E51 since January, and I can easily attest to the convenience, power, and versatility of this all-in-one powerhouse.  I was initially attracted to it due to its relatively high amount of on-board memory and slim form factor, both of which are hard to come by in the world of Symbian S60 operating system phones.  It's a very responsive device and very easy to carry in one's pockets.  The built-in WiFi capability allows for Gizmo5 VOIP calling (calls on the cheap) whenever you are near a WiFi hotspot.  I've also used the A2DP stereo music player with my bluetooth headphones on many occasions as a fill-in for my iPod.  And the amount of freeware S60 applications that are available as well as the powerful PIM capabilities of the phone add to the incredible usefulness of the phone.  The battery life is more than adequate, with ample on-screen and audible warnings before it becomes exhausted. The only serious negative for the E51 is the quality of the internal 2Mp camera, which is relatively poor.  Otherwise, the E51 is everything you want in a phone, minus the gimmicks.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent deal", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1J6W3M6CHE8YN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The nature of my work makes me move and stay to different countries for months at a time so i needed an unlocked phone. I found that's not something easy to get in US. Phone stores would even sell you a locked phone at a full prize if you don't buy a contract, that's ridiculous. I've been to he Nokia store in NYC and I would have paid 100USD more than on Amazon for the same product. I'm very happy with my purchase, the phone came in perfect condition in a sealed box. The Symbian program allows you to synchronize documents with your computer, it's a great tool. I would recommend buying a protection for the screen, gets scratched easily (Invisible Shield is great)", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Happy customer", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"R.T.\"", "ReviewID": "R2D178QORFGJJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No need to comment on the Amazon transaction - everything went smooth and as expected.The phone is great! Compact and yet has all the features which I need. One thing which could be improved is the battery life - compared to my old Nokia phone, the battery on this one lasts only about half, but still gets me through 3-4 days between charges. I travel between USA and Europe and can use the phone everywhere. The 3G connection is usable at this point only in Europe but perhaps some day it may be useful in the USA. The Wi-Fi in that aspect is a great fallback. I even installed Skype on the phone and am making cheap/free calls whenever am in a Wi-Fi hotspot. I stuffed a 4GB MicroSD card and now have a very convenient portable flash drive which is always handy - transferring the files over the USB or Bluetooth is a breeze. From time to time I even use the radio and it works beautifully. The built-in MP3/Video player is also quite good but is useful only if you add a good size MicroSD card for the filestorge.I have used the phone for more than 3 months now and have dropped it a few times - no problems, just works! The Nokia contacts management utility which ships with the phone could be improved a bit (it is a program which you install on your computer to help you with the management tasks of your contacts) - it does help though entering all the contact details on a normal keyboard instead of trying to thumb them on the phone. The necessary USB cable ships with the phone but any standard mini USB cable will do too.Some of the office-type apps pre-installed on the phone are not that great - for example, the Adobe PDF reader does not allow you to flip the screen horizontally, but there are tons of third-party apps available for that OS which you can download and install. Many good games are available too - I installed Backgammon.Overall, I am very happy with the phone and recommend it.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lots of features for your money", "Author": "A.

Well I've used the larger one for some three months again and I'm switching back. My reasons:- The E51 is really compact for a smartphone... I think this is very attractive.- I didn't use the qwerty keyboard as much as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I found it too crowded, and hard to use without looking at it. It was also hard to use it one handed. Since having a good tactile feedback is one of the reasons for not switching to a touchscreen device, I think the numeric keypad is much suited to my needs.- The E71's screen is larger, but still not as large as I would've liked it to be...

No long annoying lags.--Given the big screen and tactile keys, viable as a websurfing device, also because...--Wi-Fi chip gets good connection everytime (unlike other phones or laptops that just disconnect suddenly although youre in a good wifi zone).--four special buttons for calendar, messages, and contacts are really useful. (Dont forget to setup the long-press option, so you have extra 3 functions programmed in shortcut key)--the long \"portrait\" screen serves the to do notes and layout of messages well. you see many text in one shot.--leather case included is very good (unlike the one included in e71).--the calendar is very usable for tasks. In one push of a button, the entire month is displayed nicely with mark on days with impt appointments and to-do's. The week count is also indicated--useful for us in manufacturing, who counts workweeks.--the steel is the body and thin contruction is truly attractive and durable (so far). The thin-ness makes it perfect fit even in tight jeans, so helps you prevent losing this phone. No excuse to your boss for not carrying it everytime as well. If I am an IT director, I would be issuing this phone rather than the N95 that I see with our plant managers.I might be partial to the 'enterprise'/for_business series of Nokia, but Ive owned an N70 and 72, with the same or higher price that this E51, and E51 beats them both hands down.There are negatives of course (two major gripes: short battery life, hangs sometime at menu button), but again, it's 5 stars considering price/functionality.

Well, to keep it simple, the Nokia e51 is a great phone that has excellent signal.

The side buttons that are a bit hard to press, like the volume button and off button. But thinking about it, one of my older Nokia had the problem of side button being to easy to press so I had to always adjust the volume.Another thing I was impressed with was the battery life on this phone. I know this is because the screen is not as big as many other phones. Specially phones with touch screens which sucks the like out of it much faster.This phone has many features as the more advanced Nokia but in a compressed version.

I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch.  After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched.  This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network.  I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen.  The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future.  One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it.  There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with.  This phone cannot be charged via USB.  It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone.  This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions.  I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!!  Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA.

First if you need input for non-latin languages, that is not going to be easy because apparently it requires re-flashing the device creatively with localized (for the country where the language is used) version of Symbian - which obviously voids the US warranty and too much of a hassle.Second, as somebody noticed, the dust accumulates behind the screen quickly and I see no way to remove it.Third, custom voice recognition is not supported - so you can not train the phone to recognize your voice (or language) for voice dialing. You have to pronounce names of your contacts with English accent or they won't be recognized. This is ridiculous - even my old 6230 allows me to assign any voice tags I want.Fourth, the camera produces pictures with annoying green tint which makes it almost unusable. There is no tint in \"night mode\" but then you loose quality. This problem has been discussed in various forums many times with hope that the \"next\" software release would fix it.

The specs for the phone, both documented and on the box, show that this phone should connect at 3G in the USA.  I live in Manhattan and have toured this phone all over the island and it has never connected at 3G, only Edge.  Then I went to AT&T;'s site to find out what the 3G coverage was for Manhattan & it was 100%... so I don't know what's up with that.There is also a problem with the firmware, having had 2 of these phones - the phone will reboot randomly.  If you use a wired headset with the phone, be aware that you must buy a particular headset, the \"HS-40\" by nokia.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great phone - compact yet powerful", "Author": "Sunquark", "ReviewID": "R2NAXSP1WLEYV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the phone but Amazon pricing sucks.

I would say - price/content ratio is very good. But... It's already a second brand new Nokia phone I am returning  (Before it was Nokia N95) for the same reason. The quality of sound during a conversation is very, very poor - a some sort of static noise, the voice itself is not clear at all - I had to ask to repeat last sentence several times during a conversation. Very frustrating. Second thing - volume control buttons and speech activation button located on the right side are very hard to click - especially taking into account that this phone is very slim - actually, I had to hold it with 2 hands to increase the volume or activate a voice calling feature. I was a huge fan of Nokia until two recent purchases of new Nokia phones - I am afraid this company went on a wrong path by chasing the longer list of additional cool features in a phone and lost the phone itself.", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
