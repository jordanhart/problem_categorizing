It is well made, has good audio reception and much better made than the Razor I had prior to this.  I do not use text or online services with my phones but you can do both with this one.  It is easy to accidentally press the web key so I disabled mine.  There is an alarm feature I use but the thing I like best is I can hear well with this phone.  Many others have poor sound quality.  I've read about others having dropped calls.  I ordered one of those peel and stick phone antennas from cellphoneshop.com and it works great on all my cell phones for better reception.  I can get calls even when I am inside a store or building.  I do like the customized ring tones you can set for your friends and the picture to caller feature too.  I'm looking for another phone for my husband who seems to like my phone better than his.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "very cute phone", "Author": "Curly Sue \"Sumi\"", "ReviewID": "RRRXHO86QZEHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is very sleek and has very cool applications although I haven't fully explored all its features.

I just bought another one, this time red, and it's proving to be just as great as the first one. It has all the features I need (camera, texting) but if you are looking for internet this is not the phone for you! I would recommend this phone to someone looking for a basic phone but who also knows how to use the technology - it could be overwhelming as a \"first phone.\"", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "m m soto", "Author": "mane", "ReviewID": "R18X5F9BXVFWG7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Disapointed.. no instruction manual, it is not operating properly,  and if l had none it was coming from china, l would not have bought it.  take too long to receive.  l bought 2 phones from same company, 3 years ago. payed for 2, and received one.  and never resolved...m m soto", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love these phones but voice quality unacceptable", "Author": "E. Parrish", "ReviewID": "RPYW47PWA6W9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a RAZR for years and loved it. Last month I bought a new KRZR K1 from eBay. I love the size and feel and weight of these phones. When I called people they asked what was wrong with the connection. The eBay seller was great and sent me another. I then tested the voice quality of the KRZR K1 with the basic Motorola that Consumer Cellular offers and an LG Shine 2. Everyone told me to throw the KRZR K1 away because of its horrible sound quality. The basic Motorola has OK quality but the LG Shine 2 was absolutely clear. Again, I love the size and feel of this phone and wish Motorola would make an updated version. But I don't think any buyer will be happy with these - technology has passed this 2006 or so model by and Motorola has not made one that isn't a smart phone that competes that I know of. I could hear folks just fine but they said it sounded like I was in a tunnel. Keep shopping and leave this one behind I think.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for travel out of country", "Author": "Allan Brandt \"Big Al\"", "ReviewID": "R10Y15T5JETIRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone for travel out of country.

Saying that, it is cheap, and works OK.  I think the main issue is the cheap battery.  My phone started dropping calls after 4 months, and would turn off every time the Bluetooth connected.  All that was fixed with a genuine Motorola BC50 battery.
