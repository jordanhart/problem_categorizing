{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Like the functionality, but still waiting for a smaller version", "Author": "Bethany Kovars \"-beth\"", "ReviewID": "R3128W422K5LG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the phone at my local store (Santiago) for about US$260, which is actually pretty cheap for any sort of smart phone here (most phones run like 2-4x the price of in US)It ended up like the story of the three little bears.I was looking at the L3, L5, and L7.L7 was wayyyy too big, but it had tempting specs.I liked the L3, but it seemed like specs from 2-3 years ago.I picked up the L5 and it was juuuuuuust right. Or was it?Hrmm... while I don't use the phone in all too serious of a manner (light internet use, simple games, watching videos, etc. etc.) I find the specs just right for me. No complaints.However, I find it too big. It just doesn't fit into most of my (female) pockets. I had the LG Optimus P970 (I think) for a couple years and that fit well in my pocket. The L5 is noticably thinner, but it's also longer and wider.I do wish I had a L3 sized phone with L5 specs. That would've been perfect for me.Anyways, some of my favorite things about the phone include that you can choose what tools you put in the drop down menu. I toggle wifi and 3g connections all day long, so those are obviously there. I don't use blutooth, so I took that off. The dimmer is wonderful, but I wish it had more than 3 settings. GPS can also be put up there (never use it). There's also a screen rotation lock, but it only lets me lock vertical, not landscape. I wish that there was an alarm quicklink here because sometimes I want to access it when surfing the web or whatnot.They seem to have gotten rid of the LGsocial app which I absolutely loved on my old phone. :( The regular apps just aren't as good for Facebook and Twitter.The batter seems to last a long time with Wifi always on (about 2 days) but dies pretty quick (1 day) when 3g is turned on.Anyways, I've had it for about 2 months now, and I like it. I just wish it was smaller. If I had to do it all over again, I would still buy it. I can't imagine a better phone out there for the price.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Item", "Author": "NyamebaEric", "ReviewID": "RSMZHP9NTVWUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really am happy with product. excellent battery life and lightweight.

BTW, operation language was also set to chinese, but it only took four steps (about 15 seconds) to change it to spanish (or any language you may want.

We had several problems, and LG's technical support in the U.S. refused to provide any help.  No manual was included with the phone (had to search for one on-line and download it), and the charger was a European-style plug, not suitable for the U.S.  Without support for the problems, the phone became worthless.  At least Amazon agreed to a refund.  The seller should be penalized by Amazon for trying to sell a European product in the U.S., where support is unavailable.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Got what I expected a very nice low budget phone", "Author": "Belle", "ReviewID": "R1BZJRY5JVKMZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone was delivered on time and in mint condition. It came in the manufacturer packaging with an European charger with US adapter, headphones, and user manual . I popped my T-mobile SIM card in and followed the start up instructions and I was ready to go. The phone is just the right size, not too small so the playing videos and browsing the web is okay but it's not too large for my small hands.The cons:The screen quality is not great at all. Pixels are HUGE in comparison to other smartphones other there. One of the worst in my opinion but then again it is a low-mid range phone. It is NOWHERE near the iPhone, Nokia Lumia 920 or Samsung Note 2 counterparts.The version OS installed was the glitchy version of the ice cream sandwich so the phone acted lagged straight out the box but that was easily fix by updated the android software. Once I did that the phone was a breeze. No gyroscope so the motion and direction sensing is not as crisp as phones with one embedded. Don't be deterred though because that tech is usually found in the more pricey phones. So If you want that, you need to cough up more money.The camera... sigh... the screen is so bad that the pics look like they were taken with a VGA camera. but basically its the same camera that is found on the iPhone 4. If the screen was better the pics would look better.Its a single core processor so its freezes up and moves glitchy if you are running multiple apps.The ProsAfter the software upgrade the phone was snappy with no apparent glitching.The touchscreen is super sensitive. I was not expecting that at all. It have quick memo and even writing with my fingers it was pretty good and recognizing the characters. I need to get a stylus to really check it out but so far so good.The size was prefect for me. 4 inch screen was just what I wanted.The phone performed its phone functions well i.e. calling  (The call screens however sometimes go black so when you are trying to hang up a call you basically have to do a battery pull), texting, the works....Conclusion:The screen quality was the only reason it lost a stars but I got what I expected for the most part. A okay budget phone. with a few tweaks here and there it turns into a fine machine. But don't expect anything major as it is filled with flaws. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone's permanent phone.  It's a decent option for a pre-teen or as temp-phone.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked in Argentina", "Author": "Ariel", "ReviewID": "RYINV64LC0FKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this unlocked cellphone and it was unlocked :) I just inserted a GSM sim from Movistar and it worked right away.The cellphone itself isn't the best.
