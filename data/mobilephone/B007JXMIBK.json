Firstly the seller was very helpful with the questions I had and it was delivered a little longer than I thought but it was wrll worth the wait... I love this phone. Light,super fast, brilliant display.  I owned the htc sensation before this and thought it would be a small upgraded version...boy was I wrong. From the design...to the light weight, to the screen. It seemed like a whole new dimension for htc superphones. The sensatiom uses a S-LCD and this uses a Super Amoled...and I love this display on the One s. Colours are more eye catching and vibrant. I cant emphasise on how much im glad I made this buy.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Ging Hoang", "ReviewID": "R3G7OVFJNURP64", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted the Iphone 5 originally, but could not reason the $700 price so I opted for this phone.

First, the not so great - the black, anodized version (which I have) does look great, but the surface just starts no matter how careful you are.Now onto the good stuff. The phone is perfectly sized for my hand, is FAST despite the plethora of apps that I've loaded on and I really like the HTC screen layout - the interface is pretty intuitive and feels very responsive. I haven't included any technical/feature listings as those are available all over the web. And here's where I should side in the disclaimer: Please note that I'm a first time droid user and also that this is not a comparative review. As an example, I found the Galaxy S3 screen display MUCH nicer; just that I'd need to supersize my hand to get it to work well for single-handed operations.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "If it wasn't for the bugs, this would be THE phone to use!", "Author": "Kerberos", "ReviewID": "R3TP80K0R2BXYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Would be a nice phone if not plagued by a VERY SERIOUS BUGPros:- Light, but strong- Slick and elegant- Battery ok (with some tweaking it lasts me a fair day with about 3-4 hours screen on time, with stock software it still does 15 hours runtime)- Good Audio- PERFECT CAM!!!- Very good screen- Fast!Well, then there is this (same text as some other reviews - says it all):Be aware that numerous users are experiencing a SERIOUS ISSUE whenever carrier signal is weak:The phone will then switch homescreen/multiple screen view on its own in very quick succession, and disable all the capacitive buttons.
