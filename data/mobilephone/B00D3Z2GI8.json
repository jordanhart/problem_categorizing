I haven't truly challenged its ruggedness yet, but so far it's been fine. I went back to a flip phone because I tired of the pocket dials and settings changes of my smart phone, whose \"smart\" features I replaced with a tablet. The PTT button on the Rugby may be placed well for a PTT user, but it is in the way for others and is often pushed accidentally. Should have a \"disable\" setting.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bait and switch beware~", "Author": "jon bostrom", "ReviewID": "R2PWBHUCQXWDWJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The main product description says unlocked for use worldwide, however if you click through and and buy one from one of the sellers BEWARE! as they change the device to locked.

Even though it says it is used, it came in original packaging and the stickers were still on the back of the phone. The battery was fully charged when it arrived. Inside the package was a note from the seller asking me to contact them if I had any problems and they would be happy to make it right. I've bought a lot of stuff from Amazon and that was the first personal note from a seller. It was impressive. The phone is in excellent condition. It looks brand new. I don't use the internet on my phone so I cannot speak to that. I already had At&t; as my carrier so I have no idea about the locked or unlocked state of the phone. I transferred my sim card and turned it on. Good to go. What I can say is that the phone I replaced was an original rugby that I have used for over five years. I never had any trouble with it until recently. The camera and the speaker were going bad. I checked At&t; for a replacement phone. This phone was cheaper by far, plus I didn't have to renew my contract or pay a $36 fee to upgrade it. This phone has all the same features of the original, probably more I just haven't really looked, so it's easy for me to use, and the speaker is fantastic. It rings loud enough on the highest setting that even I with my not so perfect hearing can hear it from across the house. I can hear calls perfectly without having to put them on speaker phone.  It is a rugby so I know that it can take a licking and keep on going. If you want a phone for talk and text that will last through the oopses of life, this is the best one on the market. I look forward to many years of service from my new phone. I will also recommend the seller to my friends.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bomb proof", "Author": "josueMacK", "ReviewID": "RXUS4RU0DAPLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Literaly? No... But this is a great phone! I absolutely enjoyed my iPhone and having all kinds of information at my fingertips. What I did not enjoy is the extra cost for data every month. I switched to a simpler plan with a basic phone and am saving loads. But none of that has anything to do with the phone. The phone itself is great! I HAD an original Rugby when they came out and I loved it! So when I decided to switch from the iPhone there was only one logical choice; the Rugby III. This phone is extremely rugged, has a good enough display for me, good volume (on ringer, speaker phone, and headset), easy to carry, and they list goes on.

Phone was obviously brand new in original packging.  It was purchased to replaced my husband's Samsung Rugby 2, which ended up in the washer and dryer in the pocket of his pants.  (The Rugby can take alot, but the heat of the dryer definately fried the screens and connections).  Purchase arrived within expected time period.  We have ATT, and if purchased from them, the same phone would have cost $260.00.  All we had to do was pop the old sim card in the new phone and we were in business!  Thanks Amazon and Ross Cellular.
