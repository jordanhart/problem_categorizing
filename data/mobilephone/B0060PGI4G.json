I got it as a gift, but its worth it. There some special deals on this phone- so do your research. Its a great phone, but it is 3G, and as far as I know cannot be used or upgraded to be a 4G phone.I've been playing with it for about 10 days. I love it.I don't know if or when I'll really use this to its full potential, but I'm getting better with it all the time. There are a lot of applications included, but there is a whole collection in the market, in the Metro store and from other sources. I use it mostly as a phone, text and internet device. The weather, news, and kinds of info are right at my fingertips with this phone.At first, I'm embarrassed to say-- I couldn't figure out how to dial a phone call! You push the power button on the side to make it light up. Then you swipe the lock button to unlock. It will re-lock automatically to avoid pocket dialing etc.You can get automatic info from Face Book, Twitter etc as well as your email. It has a great camera/video cam and comes with a data cable and memory card. (Well, mine did) Other carriers made it difficult to use a data cable, but this was even supplied. Cool beans :-)Oh, and you also get navigation built in and available with the standard $50 plan. For ten bucks more per month you get Rhapsody too. As it is, I can watch You Tube.There is so much more that I have yet to master on this fun device!My only reason for only 4 stars, is that its not as easy to master as other toys, but I guess I'm just getting old. I'll update another time- but by then-- who knows what else will be available.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone !", "Author": "terrafirma", "ReviewID": "R1AGOEMC3F6C2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having just entered the smart phone craze, I thought that this phone would be a good entry level phone to get used to using a smart phone. I also bought it for a backup email provider in case my desktop computer went down. So far it has been a great phone. The owners manual is horrible though. It gives you the basic functions but that\"s all. I'm learning more by experimentation than actual info in the manual. The 3G speed is okay since I haven't anything to compare it to. It replaced a regular Samsung phone so I was used to good quality. So far so good.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The worst phone I have ever owned", "Author": "Susannah", "ReviewID": "R21NLVWDB76MF5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is a joke--hands down, the worst cell phone I've ever had. It's slow, buggy, and apparently shoddily constructed, since I have had hardware issues with BOTH of my Samsung Admires (the first one I purchased, and the one I ordered to replace it).My first Admire would inexplicably power itself off, and the screen flickered constantly. I contacted MetroPCS to see if I could exchange it for different phone, but unfortunately my only option was to order a new model of the same phone.The second Admire I received was fine at first. It was just as slow/unresponsive as the other, but at least it wasn't shutting off for no reason. However, after a few weeks, I began having trouble with the charger port. When it was plugged in, it would constantly go back and forth between charging/not charging. Eventually, it stopped charging altogether. It is now completely useless.I have since gone back to my 2-year-old Samsung Freeform. I would rather use this outdated non-smartphone for the rest of time than order another admire.It really is SUCH a shame...I wasted a good chunk of money on this completely terrible phone, and now I have no option to exchange it or upgrade it or anything...I'm just stuck with a $130 paperweight. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER SAMSUNG! How dare you put this phone out onto the market! SHAME ON YOU!", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but Internal memory no good", "Author": "TechBlessings", "ReviewID": "R282TV2C3TG7SH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Takes great pictures, nice audio & video quality, tons of features thanks to android system.Cons: low internal memory (even with sd card I can only hold 36Apps because a certain amount of data is stored on phone after downloading and moving the app to sd), everything downloads to phone first then has to be moved to sd, netflix is slow or will shutdown due to phones RAM, and some games and apps won't work on this phone because screen resolution and size.Overall: I loved my phone until I realized it was useless because of internal memory prohibiting me from downloading more apps. I like my phone now after backing it up and rooting it. Next time I invest in a android I will focus more on tech specs than price.To fix cons: Download Best Apps Market(to manage your apps and see how its stored, also find great apps easy), Easy Cache Cleaner (by BAZINGA! its a lifesaver because you may have a lot of excess stuff stored in caches that can easily be deleted with this without disturbing your app progress or memory),Advanced Task Killer (by RECHILD its another lifesaver because it shows you everything thats open and you can close in one click also it has a drag and drop feature for pc.  It's a must have).To increase internal memory if all else fails, like in my case, you can search forums for ways to back up and root your phone.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Fantastic", "Author": "Logan Wilkinson", "ReviewID": "RSC9X2L4HG4KI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had a problem with this phone so far.  It is an absolutely fantastic phone that I have had since the middle of November 2011.  I have have read some pretty awful reviews for this phone, but in my opinion this phone is pretty much flawless.  Some of the things missing are a front facing camera, a flash, a notification light, and a few other minor features.  The camera is average for a mid-range smartphone.  All in all, I think this is a pretty great phone and I would recommend it to anyone that is a coustomer to Metro PCS!", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "rodi463", "ReviewID": "RG5LT8PEFEQR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome, just awesome!

It was my first smart phone and I settled for it since I couldn't afford an iphone or a higher priced android. I must say I'm quite impressed with what I received. The android app store was enough to keep me satisfied. It's simple, sufficient and meets my needs when it comes to music and games, but be careful because the memory can fill up quick. The only reason I'm giving this three stars is because the battery life is quite poor. I went and bought another charger hoping it would fix the problem but to no avail. The battery doesn't last long, less than a day at the most so I try my best not to use the phone at times when I'm out to save the power. Also the charger that originally came with it would take hours to charge the phone up, so like I said before I had to purchase a complete new one that ended up working better. Other than those flaws, the phone is really great for the price.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "solid phone", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R1LOLJA6QSCO10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If your looking for a touch screen phone that does what you want but is not too over the top or expensive this is your phone. ive actually dropped it a few times and nothing happened so as I said in the headline its a solid phone. good phone too overall.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the color but........", "Author": "loleka thomas", "ReviewID": "R1JJIWZ4B2RVZP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone only has 1g connection in order for my son to download games i had to turn on my hot spot..i called metro pcs and said that this phone did not have 4g access but hey i only paid like 45.00 for this phone so its all good..thank god his other phone started workin again so this samsung admire is now a play phone n if he wanted to down load anything he turns on his own hot spot now lol...but he loves the color!!", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for almost a year, then it glitches, badly.", "Author": "Kat Carey", "ReviewID": "R3SD1VQKTRKS12", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my daughter last year for Christmas, and before the year was out, it started glitching.

Through all of this time, it has been riddled with problems. The first BIG problem I ran into was the battery. I've so far had to replace it and it looks like I'm going to have to replace it again. It doesn't hold a charge well if at all. I unplugged the phone at 10 am and at 4:30 am it's dead. If someone sends me a text when the phone is off, that text is lost in space-land, never to return. Someone will call me 18 times and it will show up on my phone only once. Oh, and the internal memory? A complete joke. I'm not a big app user so I have maybe 4 other than the apps it comes with. If I wanted to download more, there wouldn't be any room for it.Now with that being said, it is very durable. I have dropped this sucker so many times I can't count.

It turns itself off. The Battery dies quickly. I doubt the warrenty is worth much. I'm ready to get rid of it and find a new phone and a new carrier.
