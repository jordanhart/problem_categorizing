{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Real review of a great phone compared to 5s!", "Author": "Whitecraine", "ReviewID": "R31P41O4CXETJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my phone through T-mobile's deal of $0 down and pay over 2 years. It's my first iphone switching from andriod. At first I was worried about missing out on the 5s features and that it would be quite small compared to HTC One and other Samsung phones, but I think it is the right size for convenient single hand usage. A bigger screen may be welcome in the future for better movies/gameplay/document viewing but it's certainly better than the 4s screen size.I finally went to an Apple store to see the 5s that I \"missed out\" on. I found out I actually preferred the 5c to the 5s because of how comfortable it felt in hand and the slight additional weight of the 5c made it feel more substantial and durable. The 5s was also less comfortable to hold due to the sharp edges and felt \"cheap\" because of how light it was. I was also kind of turned off by how the 5s looks after being used for so long - the demo models were a bit scratched/grimy not very bright/shinny/attractive. On the other hand the 5c \"ages\" well. I also tested responsiveness and speed of the user interface and was not impressed. It was exactly the same as the 5c. Probably larger apps and other computation would load faster, but general things like scrolling through menus, opening webpages was no different. Next time I'll have to try something more graphics intensive and report back but it does say a lot about the 5c.Functionality, speed and ergonomics are all there with the 5c. Another thing worth mentioning is that the 5c is the less \"flashy\" phone and that was important to me (at least the white version) since I am not looking to standout and since there are a lot of phone theft/muggings/robberies these days. So overall, I feel this phone fit my needs perfectly.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great iDevice", "Author": "Arthur J. Heller", "ReviewID": "R26B92H23OIONJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always had relatively inexpensive smartphones, Blackberry knockoffs (the Alcatel things) and so on. Most of them had data access, but it most were rudimentary at best. I kept an iPod Touch around as an iOS device, and used it to take most of the pictures that I wanted to post on Facebook or wherever because the cameras in my phones were usually awful. Recently updated from an $80 Android device to an iPhone 5c, as the store was out of the 5s.That said... the 5c is a solid, solid phone. It is identical, hardware-wise, to the iPhone 5, except that it's made out of plastic and has a better front-side camera (1.2 megapixels vs VGA). It is quick, and runs a huge variety of apps. The battery life is fantastic. I haven't had any difficulty getting data even when in the middle of nowhere, or wandering around the unexplored wastes of the New Jersey pine barrens. Voice control is a plus... though Siri is, er, interesting, the real benefit is being able to tell the phone \"Call mom\" or \"Call laura\" or something while you're driving, so you don't have to be fiddling around with buttons. Texting works the same way, you can tell it to \"Text Mom\" and then say the message and send it. Very cool, convenient features to have.The plastic feels very good. I've heard reviews that said it felt cheap compared to the \"real\" iPhone, but in reality the plastic -- or, I'm sorry, polycarbonate -- is really strong and is far less prone to scratching and chipping than the glass or metal versions are. The physical buttons on the side are functional and feel responsive, even moreso than on the 4s or iPhone 5. The main camera takes amazing photos, has HDR functionality, and takes beautiful, 1080p, video.The downside to the phone is the standard iPhone complaints. Namely, there's a lack of \"openness\", in that I have no access to the basic filesystem, and that anything I want on the phone has to be shunted through iTunes, including ringtones: I had to take an MP3 file of the sound I wanted, add it to iTunes, then convert it to a ringtone just to make it available in the \"Tones\" list, and THEN I could sync it to the phone. Likewise, it wants you to get all your pictures and stuff off either through iCloud or with iPhoto, but I use a third party piece of software that lets me access the device directly.Another complaint I have is that, for contacts, it synced to the address book on my MacBook Pro... which is all fine and well, but then it also scraped through my Facebook account for information, which then left me with a bunch of people that I either never want to get in touch with, or double entries for those I do. Scrounging through my phone to try to find one person amongst a list of like 400, both contact and Facebook friend, is annoying at best.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone. Great price.", "Author": "Thomas A. Fabrizio Jr. \"Tech Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3K9GQ4OQF3GMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanna address some of other peoples reviews on this product, especially the guy that said unlocked phones don't exist on apple anymore.Apple sells unlocked phones directly from their factory for GSM carriers. You're an idiot. Plain and simple. I don't even know how your review got posted, all of the negative reviews here don't add to the listing at all. Keep your ignorance to yourself.Anyways onto the review.I've had the phone for about a month now, I wanted to get the 5S and was saving for it but my 4S was stolen and so obviously I needed a phone fast.So I guess I'll list the pros and cons over my 4S.Pros:1.Cheaper at 99 dollars with a two year contract locked to a carrier.2. Nice color.3. Bigger screen is much welcomed.4. Faster chipset with the A6 chip is great.5. Camera is absolutely awesome.6. Battery life is great. After all day with my phone. I still had a half of battery left. Which is pretty good for a smartphone.Cons:1. Plastic construction may be a vulnerability and doesn't look as elegant.2. Accessory support really is limited for this phone. Which is heavily disappointing. Every accessory fits only the 5 and 5s. So be advised not many cases are out for this phone.In my opinion this is a great phone replacement for someone who wants an iphone but at a cheaper price. But if you have the money, I'd go with the 5S. Just because of the lack or accessory support for the 5C.EDIT 10/30/13: a commenter (Chow) mentioned that my review contains material from the carrier locked phone. And that it's widely unhelpful. At this point I would like to mention that the carrier locked phone and the unlocked phone are the EXACT same device. With the EXACT same functionality. The only difference being that one is unlocked to all GSM chipset carriers rather than being restricted to one. So even though I wrote the review on the fact that I own the carrier locked version, all the points stated in my review still are valid other than the change in price between the two.  Apple iPhones have the same basic components and same software regardless if they are carrier locked or not.-Tom-", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pros and cons of 5c", "Author": "daniel", "ReviewID": "R1P8CHLUJIJD15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall the product is great.But here are some pros and cons.PRO'S1.

I got mine from Verizon for $150.00 with a two year contract. This phone doesn\u2019t compare to any other phone I have ever had, I\u2019m going to talk about how this phone compares to no other phone I have ever had and why it is so different. I\u2019m going to explain that you can have the next new item with apple and not have to spend one whole check on the phone.My friend has the new iPhone 5s which is said to be better that the 5c, but there really isn\u2019t a difference besides the touch to open. That is pretty cool but the 5c doesn\u2019t everything exactly the same at one fourth the price. This is a great product for if you want to have the new hot item for not a lot of money, which who has $600 to throw around for the next big thing with apple. I really like how it is light weight and has a really clear screen, I feel like I am getting everything my phone can offer with having a screen that is big. As soon as I found out they had an iPhone is green I had to have one, it is my favorite color and it is so adorable. Green is my favorite color and it is not an ugly green like you are thinking.The down part about this phone is it is cheap, yes it is made out of plastic but you are going to put a case on it anyways why pay so much for a phone that you will just cover up any ways. If it is so cheap why do people keep buy it and it isn\u2019t cheap just the back of the phone is cheap with its plastic back that is in all those pastel colors. I hate how they made one case that shows they back but it isn\u2019t a really sturdy case so if you wanted a heavy duty case you would have to cover they color of your phone which is the main reason you wanted the colored iPhone. It is still soon they could still make more cases; that will show the back of the phone with its pretty colors.I have always had an android but my last one was the last straw, because everyone I know who has an android always has a problem eventually. Everyone I know that has a iPhone even if it\u2019s an old iPhone they still work and have little to no problems. It all depends on how you take care of your phone. I hate when people say android is better oh but my phone can do this and this and this, but all phones do something different so you android lovers get over yourselves and realize that everyone phone is its own phone they can all do something cool and different. The battery life on the iPhone 5c is amazing I can be on my apps all day and still have battery life, my last phone I would open an app and my phone would go down to 50%. Apple isn\u2019t perfect but they do have some really cool items and this happens to be one of them.This is the perfect phone for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money and wants to have the next new item with apple that is my advice to you. It is a great phone with the speed of the processor, the size of the screen, and most of all the battery life on the phone. It really is a great phone I would recommend it to anyone who has always wanted an apple phone and couldn\u2019t afford it.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S4, HTC One or Iphone 5c?

A step up from my i4''s a4; I have Bluetooth in my car and it works great. My i4 would cut out after I did the ISO7 update. I own other apple products as well iPad 2 and and older iPod nano 3 gen. I see no issue with these phones, more to the point most people do not like plastic. Hmm both plastic or metal one will dent and the other will crack if you drop it without a case on it, as will glass on the back side of the s5 will crack as will the front. Some reviews of the made me laugh since they state that this phone it a ripoff but if you buy any unlocked phone it will cost you more. When you buy a plan some of the reviewers I guess are clueless what pays for the phone over the two years which cost less up front. I never do that. I been with Verizon since I had a cell phone back before apple even invented the iPhone. and guess what it was plastic not metal.  Never have a dropped call unless I am on the road and hardly ever happens. I did not buy a unlocked phone.  I got mine for 7.50 I traded my iphone 4 in and got a $50 off, which was the price of the phone. I feel that I do not need to spend the extra $150.00 for the metal one since it is basically the same phone in plastic which cost less to manufacture than the metal that is why apple did this in the first place.  If you do not like plastic go though you house and throw it all away than. Here is a hint the fuzzy throw Blankets or pull overs called polyester They are made of recycled plastic soda bottles but they are so warm.UpdateStill acts like an iPhone though faster data when searching the web with the LTE with a small cost of battery life but I had so much trouble with searching on the iphone4 on 3G that I will not miss that. just really look at your notifications on you phone that take more battery power I shut what I did not need off.  If you leave the iphone 5 in the car and it is really cold outside. if you phone is off do not turn it on till you have it warm up in your house. this is a a safety feature of this phone. condensation can built up inside of the phone if you leave it in a cold place like a car in winter.

I've always used Apple products - from the desktop computer our family had when I was a kid to my current laptop and iPod. Though I played around with Droids and the other brands in the store, I was pretty sure going in that I would want an iPhone.I initially thought about the iPhone 4s (which is about a dollar right now), but I didn't like the idea of being roped into a 2-year plan with older technology and poor battery life.My perspective on this product would best suit someone similar to me: you want to be able to do all the usual stuff (call/text, check e-mail/Facebook, Google maps, decent battery life, use a few apps, take pictures), but don't care if it's the most current or top-of-the-line product. My perspective doesn't match what tech critics think about this iPhone - namely that this was a huge mistake on Apple's part; however, this phone is basically what I was looking for.Pros:- $99 with a 2-year commitment. This is really up to you whether this is a good deal or not. I don't plan to update my phone every time new technology comes around - I also get a great deal with my family plan - so I didn't have a problem signing the 2-year contract with them.- Attractive colors- Lightweight- Intuitive interface. This was very important to me because I'm new to touchscreen interfaces and, in general, smartphone technology. This phone has been easy to use so far.- The battery life is great.- Fast wireless- For those of us who don't need the maximum storage capacity that the 5s offers, this seems like a good compromise between the slower iPhone 4s and the more expensive, top-of-the-line (for now) 5s.- Great camera! It takes nicer pictures than my actual camera.- Handy \"find my phone\" feature in the iCloud, that locates your iPhoneCons:- I don't know if this is true of all smartphones, or if it's just this one, but I think it's annoying that I can't rearrange the icons on the wallpaper. I'd like to put the icons I use most on the front and stick the ones I don't use on the back. Maybe I just need to fiddle with it more.- Like others have said, there is only one colored wallpaper pattern available (of course, you could put any picture you like). I don't really care, since it's an attractive blue-green ombre. If I get sick of it, I'll just replace it with a picture of my cat.- It does have less storage than the iPhone 5s, but it still has quite a bit more than previous generations.- I anticipate that the bright, saturated color will fade over time.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lies!!!!!", "Author": "Dennisse", "ReviewID": "RMJ6WSDK5HCIJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before I start, one star is much greater than what this guy deserves.I brought this phone for my teenage sister.

Instead, there's the clunky FAVORITES or use Siri (and wait for it to think and hope that it heard you correctly especially while I'm driving with the windows open creating sound interference)- The front of the phone doesn't have a place for me to leave a message like \"If found, call 123-4567\" so that someone can return it to me.- Retina screen is not as good as Samsung.  Samsung saves the #1 omoled screen technology for itself and sells #2 retina screens to Apple.- Can't easily copy files from pc to phone but have to go through iTunes and even that is limited to only a few types of files.  In other words, I can't use the iPhone as a $5 USB flash drive.- Glass screen is fragile compared to plastic android screen.- Because the screen is fragile, I have to buy a case for it which now makes it thicker and won't fit in phone holsters.- Lighting cord is stupid because I can't attach it to my car so that I can control via the car's head unit, docking stations, etc.- Can't install wifi hotspot software without paying monthly charges via phone carrier.- Can't have an extra battery or bigger battery (android phones can have bigger batteries up to 40 hours)- New battery replacements must be done by Apple at $130 whereas android batteries are $3 on Amazon and I can change a battery myself.- With an iPhone, I am without a phone while I send my phone out for a new battery.- Virtual keyboard does not have haptic feedback- No NFC chip to allow me to tap another phone to share/send a contact card or photos.- Virtual keyboard still not as good as physical keyboard, especially when it guesses what you're typing and misses the mark.- Can't expand the memory by buying a $10 micro SD card.- Apple tried to copy Android's alerts and notifications of new email, etc. but Android's multiple alerts and the ability to dismiss them is still better.- Android has google maps turn-by-turn GPS navigation but iPhone doesn't.- Customization: iPhone doesn't let me delete some apps I don't want to see whereas Android gives me complete control of keeping or deleting any app.  In other words, Android lets me customize so much that I don't need to root it like Apple iPhone.- iPhone doesn't have widgets.

My only complaint about larger screens is its harder to apply screen savers.  I used to use ANdroid burt my phone frequently rebooted and Android phones limit the number of software upgrades to entice you to buy a new phone.  Apple provided full software upgrades to my 3GS until 7 came out.  As far as regular conversation goes I don't see a lot of difference between Apple and the better androids.  Many more apps for android, but a lot of them duplicate functions.  The 2 apps I miss most are the SWYPE keyboard and a YouTube downloader.

I switched over from Android, and boy oh boy, I am never going back. I bought the 5c mainly because it was cheaper than the 5s, and the 5c had a much better feel to it. I'm a student with a limited budget, and the extra 100$ is a lot to me. But honestly, even if I had the cash I'm not sure I would buy the 5s. The 5c is slender, light, and beautiful; the colors make the phone feel unique and full of life. Having handled a 5s, I much prefer the 5c. Something about it seems more human, more playful, more unique. The phone feels as if it wants to be in your hand, and aesthetically speaking its quite beautiful. Coming from android, I found Apple to be a breath of fresh air. I don't believe there is a better designed phone on the market now--EVERYTHING about this phone has been considered, and it shows! Having a macbook, the interface of the 5c was familiar and great. The battery life on this phone is also incredible, lasting a day and then some on a single charge (I use apps that drained my last android phone in a matter of 3 hours!!). My only complaint, and this is important--- the plastic is fragile and bruises very very very easily. This may be why the phone feels much lighter and thinner, but honestly I do believe Apple could have handled this MUCH better. A single drop will result in a dent to the back of the phone if it is not handled with care. But you can solve this with a cover-- I highly recommend the cases made specifically for this phone by apple, DON'T BE FOOLED BY IMITATIONS--the Apple covers are worth it-- they create wonderful color combinations, have a fantastic gummy feel and are surprisingly protective. PLEASE, cover this Iphone, the screen included.

I was very happy with my iphone 4. I even bought a girl I was dating an iphone 4. After awhile I had enough of the iphone 4 and it's slow performance. I know that sounds spoiled,  but I needed something better and faster to really enjoy the iphone experience.  So in January of this year, I bought an iphone 5c in white. I sold my iphone 4 to the local Verizon store for a hundred dollars of store credit. With that I was able to make my purchase of my new phone.I have been very pleased with my iphone 5c. I can seemingly install numerous apps for my cell phone pleasure, as we ell as have hardly any dropped calls.

Now before i had the 5c i was going from phone to phone and trying to get off the apple bandwagon so I went n got a htc one then ended back up with a iphone 5, then the newer iphone 5s/5c was announced with ios 7 so I was wowed and I was just use to the easy menu the iphones have, especially how your emails are all synced together as if it was one email address. So I got rid of my iphone 5 traded that for a galaxy s4 active!! i had the phone for a month and used it in the shower lol. after being wowed by that I kinda grew away from the phone espcially with all the air features that's easy to activate when driving. So I got rid of the active and traded that for the Pink 5C. Now this color is great the black is a good color I think guys and girls can rock this color(well guys with the black casing for the phone lol) so yeah it's been over a month with the 5c and I don't have any urges to try out the note 3 or even the 5S.

On top of that, we have all heartily recommended Apple products to friends and family. I love Apple and vowed to not touch an Android phone with a ten foot pole, ever. In fact, I used to shake my head at those poor Android phone users because I figured they can't possibly know what they are missing.  When my sister switched to Android, I actually felt personally slighted.As soon as I could, I got the 5c and I was so excited to explore all the new features it had to offer. Despite endless ribbing from me about how sorry she will be, my wife shocked me by deciding to switch and upgraded to an Android phone at the same time because she said she was tired of the same old, same old. Since she had 14 days to return it if she didn't like it, she felt like it was worth a shot. To my absolute surprise(and horror!), I found myself playing with her phone endlessly on day one while mine sat virtually untouched. I was streaming on her phone in beautiful HD on a crisp, bright, larger screen and loving it. What I had always assumed would be a clunky interface, was smooth and slick.Ok, I told myself, enough horsing around, time to enjoy mine because after all, I love iPhones and Android phones are stupid. First impression, I like the feel of the 4c. It has a solid, feel despite how some people feel about the plastic housing. The screen is bright and crisp. It's fast and doesn't hog the battery. It's like owning a completely new phone, no wait, it's not. With a slightly, and I mean slightly bigger screen and some upgrades, it is just like the iPhone I upgraded from. Not that fun.Now here is where Apple lovers will swoop in to \"defend\" Apple as though they have some vested interest in the company. Even as an Apple lover myself, I don't understand this. I notice that any review that does not extol the iPhone in all it's glory causes people to freak out. Really? Why spend your precious time defending any company or their products for them? I admit I know what it is like when someone says they don't care for an Apple product. It almost feels personal, almost. But to blast someone for their opinion is just plain dumb. Apple will not call you and personally thank you. They don't care. Surely you have something better to do with your time. If you like your phone, great! But everyone is entitled to their opinion. And the fact that I almost feel shame giving the iPhone a less than five star rating tells you that Apple products are a huge part of my life. But, I will not just blindly love a product just because I love the company. I don't owe any company my complete devotion or my dollars and I would be embarrassed and saddened if I did. Regardless, I am sure my review will be picked apart by fanboys as soon as it is posted. I'll say it again, this is just my opinion folks. If you like the 5c, then by all means get it and love it. I just wanted to post an opinion from someone who loves Apple and yet, isn't crazy about this phone.That being said however, if you love the iPhone usability and are used to it, you will find much of the same here. That is what nearly made me keep mine. And Siri is a pretty neat feature too. It is a solid little phone and you probably won't hate it, especially if you already like the iPhone. But there isn't much new here.The thing is, at one time, the iPhone broke new ground. The first time I laid eyes on one, I practically fainted because it was so freaking cool. There is no question that the iPhone paved the way for every phone that has followed since and in my opinion, Apple keeps setting the benchmarks that cause other tech companies to have to scramble just to catch up. Unfortunately, this phone offers little innovation and while it is a solid little number, it is getting tired. I am looking forward to the next iPhone because it sounds like there will be a lot of changes. I am almost positive I will be frothing at the mouth to switch back to iPhone in the future if what I have read is true. And I hope it is. For now though, I returned my 5c and got an Android phone(I never, ever thought I would be typing that sentence!!!). I love my new phone and for the next two years I will stick with it. But we will see where Apple goes from here. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy my Apple computers, iPads, and iPods because wow, they are all flawless.
