It's mostly what you prefer but i give it a 4 out of 5 because the cons are something easy to get around but do not go unnoticed.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone at a great price, delivered quickly.", "Author": "Tom \"Tommy J\"", "ReviewID": "R3MZ0EPVF5SI6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to keep my unlimited data plan with Verizon, so I didn't want to get stuck into a new 2 year contact and pay an extra $40 a month.  I got this phone, which was maybe$50/60 more than a flip phone.  It works great and it will pay for itself in 6 months.  I was able to swap out my old phone with this one on the Verizon site.  My contacts and apps all loaded up fine.Make sure you don't fall into the trap of upgrading your service while on the Verizon site.  They deliberately obscure the 'activate alternate phone' link during the process.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it.", "Author": "M. Decker \"deckm00\"", "ReviewID": "R164DNK1MMIOA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my corporate-issued Motorola Razr M for most of this year and for the most part I really like it.  Verizon 4G coverage in my neighborhood is pretty minimal (2 bars at best) and yet I can make and take calls easily.  Even video is continuous and clear (if I get closer to the windows).  I like the form factor, weight, screen size and resolution and especially image clarity.  Photos and video are very good.  I don't have a case and instead just throw it in my pocket. I'm not going to get into a Droid vs. IOS discussion here, they both have their pros and cons.  Not sure what the big deal is with the Kevlar rear surface though.  I mean it feels ok and I guess if I'm ever going to have to deflect a speeding bullet I'm ready for it but other than that I don't understand the point.  The battery can't be replaced but for me it's a non-issue (corporate will just issue me a new phone).  Bluetooth connectivity to both Hyundai and Bose headset works great.  The battery life was better at first and I guess is ok considering the technology.  It helps to turn off Wifi when not really needed.  I charge every night regardless and sometimes in the car if I've been talking alot.My Razr M pros and cons would be:Pros - size, weight, call clarity, screen resists scratching, durability (have dropped it a couple times onto hard flooring from ~3-4'), loud ringer, voice activated apps work well (especially the Google Maps Navigaton).Cons - the side on-off button is easy to hit by mistake, the speakerphone could be louder, I wish there was a physical on/off ringer button.  Would be nice if the charger port was on or near the top instead of the lower left side so that I could stand the phone up in my car's center console cubby space while charging.  Can't see the screen at all in bright daylight, you'll need to seek shade.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazing customer service", "Author": "Jacob Reames", "ReviewID": "R2O8XY8NI3L81V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone worked great, but then died.

My first one I broke while working on my car and this particular one was well worth it. I waited for the price to drop because it was still pricey at the time or purchase. It performs the way I need it to and the Smart Actions App that it built in helps keep the battery going until the end of the day. I average about 20 hours of battery life.

It takes Radiocomm hack to stop blocking US GSM radio signal. It was real easy and I don't confess to have a lot of talent at tech. I purchased a AT&T; 4G LTE sims changed APN to the Straight Talk settings. It works prefect. You won't get LTE speeds with this set-up, just H+. To show the difference, my Straight Talk Verizon 3G fastest speed test was .7 mbps. This Razr M fastest is 7.5 mbps. I read some people say you can get 4G LTE. I have not. The wifi speed is FAST!

It's compact yet I'm able to text easily with it. I love that I can verbally ask Google a question and sometimes get a spoken response, otherwise I get a link.. I have dropped the phone once but it didn't shatter as another reviewer wrote. I did however have it in a case, one that is a belt clip holster that covers both sides of the phone.. Phone rings, I just slip it out of the holster easily. Link to holster is here on Amazon: B009RQ1M5KI recommend both the phone and the holster combo. Great sound too, sometimes I just plug in some headphones and listen to my albums in the Amazon cloud, although you can download them to the device. Some people complained about not getting an micro SD card to get recognized. You just have to power off the phone entirely, then insert the card, turn on the phone and you are good to go. Live wallpapers are fun too, one called Smoke is amazing. Okay I said I'd not talk about features but I've had this phone for several months now and love it. Fun apps too like Amazon price check.

I love it and in may ways its in my top 3 phones of all time. As of now it will play any game out at close to 60 fps if not always 60 fps, in day to day tasks it performs as good as a quad core.

So I feel like it's time for this review.This was my first smartphone, and I liked it. The screen size was a huge pro, and it is pretty nice looking HD. Cameras weren't too bad either.However, the cons vastly outweigh the pros. From the get go, this phone is slow and laggy. It cannot handle even the basic task of bringing up the unlock screen without thinking about it for ages. I would try to play back music from the SD card I put in, and it would skip and stop and make awful sounds. It can't be hooked up natively/mounted as a USB device to a Mac computer, which is pretty much a necessity these days. It has okay battery life, depending on how much you use it and if the wifi is on.Since it's not a widely used phone, there isn't a lot of support for it. It held up against the occasional drop until it didn't--all its pixels went out in one fell swoop tonight. It also would overheat regularly, while charging and while not. Almost burned me a couple times.In short, thank goodness I bought this for 1 cent on Cyber Monday last year because any more would have been a crime.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "Belinda", "ReviewID": "R3VZQQKF2H1CSA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No rating at all .....I paid almost $200 for the phone and only last a month and half the phone went off I took it to my company for insurance cover and I have to paid another $100 ....I'm not will risk my money again..... first and last.....", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product and company!", "Author": "Megan Engler", "ReviewID": "R5ZC6OFRYZ0AI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works like it is brand new!

We were looking for a smart phone that was tough enough to handle the rigors of an active young man.  The Razr M looked to fit the bill.  It has gorilla glass on one side and carbon fiber on the other.  What's not to like about this?On the third day of his use, he was taking it out of his pocket and it slipped out of his hand.  After a 2.5 foot drop onto a hardwood floor, the gorilla glass shattered like it was thrown in a parking lot.  We couldn't believe it.  The rest of the phone is absolutely pristine, but the glass is shattered.When we went back to the Verizon store, we were told that the gorilla glass is really good for resisting scratches and such, but will shatter quite easily.  Something I wish they would have told us when we were purchasing the thing.So, if you're thinking of purchasing this phone, make certain that you also purchase the toughest case so the delicate \"gorilla\" glass doesn't shatter in the event you place it on the table too hard.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Verizon Wireless Motorola Droid M Black qHD Screen 4.3\" Super AMOLED Display\nPremium Design, Edge to Edge almost bezel-less display\n1.5GHZ Dual-Core Processor, 1GB Ram\n8MP Autofocus Camera with LED Flash\nSplash Proof (Not Waterproof)", "Name": "Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon + GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Android Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bCNNqXFmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CTAMMTG"}}
