{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really great screen, at a price", "Author": "Andzsin", "ReviewID": "R2AWO0HUTL1HUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best screen I've seen so far in a handheld device, it even outperforms the Iphone 4S' Retina Display. Beautiful pictures, videos, animations. Fantastic colours.But as always, there is a price. Battery life. I wouldn't say it sucks but every time I take a look at the battery usage graph (great btw.), screen is ALWAYS above 50-60%! I suppose this tells a lot. A phone of this caliber was not meant to lay low in pockets. It's not its purpose.What else could I say? Everything else works great for me. I often read bitching comments about the USB port cover. Come on guys.... What's your problem, really? It's not great, but it's just fine. Unremovable battery?

It has a very nice shape and screen and everybody like it. However, the battery is the main problem of this phone. It will not last more than 3 hours if you use it continuously or maximum four hours of calling. Also, it does not support the 3G or 4G network from T-Mobile service if you are planning to use it with T-Mobile network.
