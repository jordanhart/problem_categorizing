So I can't even use it. I am very upset because the phone was expensive to not be able to use it.

It DOES NOT support blackberry 6.0 so if you got used to apps and layouts on that, sorry; you'll have to go back to square one.  Ok, that was annoying, but I figured I could stick with it.  Two and a half months later, half of the keys stopped working, leaving me unable to do all of the things I should be able to do with a blackberry.  Not only could I not text, I couldn't even check my voice mail!It mysteriously resolved itself two days later, and I thought great! All set.Until it happened again last week, a few *days* after my \"warranty\" expired. When I wrote to the company, I received this reply:\"Our apologies. This certainly is not normal. This item came with a 90 day warranty, unfortunately that is up at this time.\"No help? No repair? No replacement? No more business from me; and not you, either, if you're smart.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "On time & works A.W.E.S.O.M.E", "Author": "Dead Pool", "ReviewID": "R1H0LTDLXTGHWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The package came sooner than I thought, and when we opened the box it was like brand new.
