If your a business i would recommend it as an alternative to a blackberry which everyone uses or your tired of touch screens and just want to use a qwerty keyboard type phone.

Some nice touchs (like muting the incoming call by turning the phone over), two interchangeable profiles (complete with themes, sounds, menus, etc.) for use at home and at office, the QWERTY keyboard and very strong construction, and the possibility of creating \"groups\" of wireless connection you authorize for Internet connection, made me very happy of my selection.Ideal for business and SOHO workers like me.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overpriced flashlight", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R30YX3FSHZDUOM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros:-3mm jack versus the E71-Secondary camera for self portraits-Thin, lightweight and white/silver version gets many compliments-Music player and texting functions are intuitive (although \"I\" is not automatically capitalized as with other phones)-Built in internet radio-Great battery life-Holding the space bar down is the command for the handy flashlightCons:-After a month, the Wi-Fi scanner would produce a \"Script Error\" and the E72 would freeze until the battery was removed and restarted again which defeats buying an unlocked phone-GPS never worked quite right and then stopped altogether along with the e-mail alert function and the ability to upload music-5MP camera takes grainy images-Poor call quality-Nokia is impossible to get a hold of and is not concerned with the E72's unstable platform", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "an updated version (E6) will be available soon", "Author": "Zafer Aktan", "ReviewID": "R3U219MREVF7L2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "An updated version (E6) will be available later this year. Unless the price will be your major point of interest, I recommend waiting until E6 arrives.  For E71 owners, don't buy this phone as an update - but wait for E6 as well.  With latest firmware updates and purchasing a new battery - there is really no good reason to upgrade from E71 to E72.  If you need to buy now for some reason, consider purchasing E71 instead.

This is not the first fiasco with Nokias made in China.Too bad that in order to make things cheaper Nokia good name now is going down the hill.Before you buy anything form Nokia, ask where it is made..You can see, feel and hear the difference. Do not buy anything was not assembled or made in Finland, you will regret if you do, in the same way I am sad, disappointed and mad.
