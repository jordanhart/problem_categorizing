Make sure you look at the enclosed promotional booklet before adding airtime as there are lots of bonus minutes offers.  I didn't and called Tracfone later and they graciously added them for me but it was not a quick phone call.  The lady on the other end was very kind and professional but it just took awhile.Much better price than through the Tracfone website!", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap Phone Great Price", "Author": "Shawn Billings \"theSWAMPFOX\"", "ReviewID": "R1B0GR988OAOY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great simple phone for people who don't use their phone very often.I actually only bought this phone so that I could use the minutes on another tracfone. You're actually buying 400 minutes for a double minute phone hence the 800. But if you have a triple minute phone and then use the tracfone discount book you're actually getting 1200 minutes plus 200 more with the discount = 1400 minutes. At $75 that means I'm getting 5.5 cents per minute which is better than buying the minutes straight out.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the phone package or just the minutes", "Author": "cmp1313", "ReviewID": "R2A9P5DZ6WXFBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this just for the minutes.  400 minutes and my current phone has triple minutes, so it was cheaper than just buying the card.

We set the phone up quickly and without problems and so far the phone seems to work well.  With double minutes received 820 minutes for one year and the phone for only $66 and when we set it up she got 15 months of service.

I had this phone before but couldn't find another one and it was my favorite phone. When I got the new one (I'm guessing it was new), one of the buttons on it doesn't work well which is a hassle because I have to push it numerous times to get it to work. Needless to say I won't purchase another phone online again, and I doubt I'll get another Tracfone because this is the third one I bought in recent months that doesn't work well at all.
