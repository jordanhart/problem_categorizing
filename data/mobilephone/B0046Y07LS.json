I only use it when waiting for my daughter at swimming class, dance class, etc. So I don't even have a data plan. I use only Wi-Fi to connect to internet. This phone is great for me, having Wi-Fi, not expensive, easy to carry and use.Although the screen is only 3\", but it is OK to me. Anyway I am not spending a lot time on it.I also like the look of this phone. Somehow I feel the white color is too femine to me (I am a guy). So I bought a black silicon case, and works great for me!", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0046Y07LS"}}
