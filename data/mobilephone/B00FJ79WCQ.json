This was an amazing idea from AT&T.; They offer 4G LTE for prepaid customers on this phone. Plus it has two cameras. A front and rear facing cameras. What that means is now you are able to do video calling on this phone. All you have to do is install the Skype App on your  Z998 and then you can do video calling with other people that have a front and rear camera on there phone. With a 4.5'' screen, plus all the features it has you can't beat the price from a well reputable company that makes this phone.

I have had Android phones in the past and they never lived up to my iPhones, until this one. I can honestly say this phone is excellent and I am very happy with my purchase. There a few small things that ZTE could do better but really nothing that would stop me from loving it. I know there are faster, better and crisper Android phones out there, but for the price and the fact this is without a contract, you can't beat this!Things I like:- Speed. This phone is fast even when I am working with multiple apps.- 4G LTE. This was one of the only phones I could find that had 4G LTE capability. I get between 40-60MB download speed over the network! (Depends on location)- Screen. The screen on the phone produces a bright, crisp image. I also find the touch sensitivity very quick responding and realistic.- Call quality. I tested without the speakerphone and with the speakerphone and the person on the other end said I sounded crystal clear.- Size and weight. Often phones are too big, too small, too light or too heavy. This phone fits well in the hand and has a great weight to it without being bulky.- Battery Life. I can use this phone the entire day without having to charge it which is more than I can say about my old iPhone.- Bluetooth works great and connects to my car well. It even plays stereo music from Pandora etc. over bluetooth.- Comes with a wall charger and the USB to Micro USB cable detaches from it to plug into your computer. This phone uses micro USB for power.Things that could be improved (not much):- Camera. It is a 5.0 megapixel camera with flash, but the pictures and video aren't very good. They're ok, but especially in low light, they aren't great.- Ring, text and email tones. While it does come with some stock tones, most are not basic. I'd like to see a few basic \"dings\" added for us simple tone lovers.- Only 2GB of internal storage. It does allow for a micro SD card if you require more storage space.*Keep in mind this phone ONLY uses a micro sim card not a standard size sim. I had a phone that had a full size sim card and had to go to AT&T; to get a micro sim and have them activate it with this phone. The phone does come with a micro sim but only works for the GoPhone service. (I called and verified with AT&T;)*Also you can use this phone with the AT&T; Go Phone plans OR what I did was add it to my existing AT&T; account. Buying this phone and adding it to your plan means not extending your contract but still getting to use a great phone.Overall I am VERY impressed with the quality of this phone for the price. If you don't want to spend a bunch of money on a phone but still want to be able to use a smartphone, this is the device for you. I will update this review If I find any issues with this phone over the next few months of use.Here is the phone case I bought - So far I love it: Reiko Polymer Case for ZTE Z998 - Retail Packaging - Black", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone Review", "Author": "Kiera", "ReviewID": "R18QSQ1R1RK5JX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I chose this rating because this is a good quality prepaid smartphone.

It worked immediately when i installed the Consumer Cellular sim card from my Samsung flip phone in. I did call Consumer Cellular for them to update the IMEI number in their system. I have avoided smart phones because of my perception of  the high cost of data plans. since switching to Consumer Cellular, we are now using their cafeteria style of plan offering: 3 phones (iphone 4, a flip phone, and this ATT Z998) with shared 500mb monthly data, 5,000 texts and 1,000 minutes) will cost us around $80/month. If you want more or less data or minutes, you pay accordingly. I'm still learning the features of the phone, but it is mostly intuitive and not hard to do. I also have the cell data OFF, and use only wifi for data under normal circumstances, therefore using no cell system provided data for internet activity.

The phone is was one of the cheapest new 4G LTE phones I could find for AT&T.;  The phone doesn't seem super cheap feeling.  It has an ok sized screen and an ok weight.  The phone doesn't have the newest Kit Kat operating system, but Jelley Bean is sufficient. This phone is okay if you are easy on your phones.  I am used to running multiple tasks all day long.  This phone glitches under heavy use.  The phone will temporarily freeze on occasions.I also noticed that it will not keep your place sometimes on apps such as Facebook.  If you are in the middle of writing a message and you stop to do something else.  If you reopen the app holding the home button it will erase your messages.The soft keys are not as responsive as I would like, but it is a cheaper phone.  The screen itself responded just fine to my touch.I also disliked the slide bar on the right side of the screen for scrolling web pages.  My finger hit that many times as I was reading a page on accident. The internet must be running pages even if your not viewing them.  I had a video start playing while I was viewing another page in a different window.  The video even started playing while my screen was off and I wasn't using the phone.The battery life kind of sucks, but the phone charges fast.  I use my phone all day long.  I'm assuming it is just a small battery capacity.  Again this is a cheap phone and not my S4.The photo taking a video taking are adequate. My videos were grainy and the pictures were ok.  The camera on this phone is fine for keeping memories, but I wouldn't use it to put pictures on my wall.  This phones camera does exactly what it needs to do and nothing more.I felt like this phone was lacking on some settings that could have really helped this phone.  I disliked having to go into settings instead of the top bar to switch wifi networks and to turn on Bluetooth.  I do like not having to swipe my screen to open it. I just hold my finger on the screen.  I do not like that the home screen doesn't display todays date.The speaker on this phone is nothing special.  I used it to play music and it wasn't very loud.  I wasn't expecting it to be either.  It was fine enough for the price category of this phone.  I also tried the headphone jack to a stereo.  The output there was also low.  I then played music through Bluetooth.  The music played just as my S4 would have.Phone calls came in clear and I could understand everyone who called.  I had no complaints from anyone else about hearing me on the other end.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RA1H0MUL3C04U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone!

This phone has a smaller sim card than the Avail 2 so I couldn't put the old sim card into the Z998.

Good WiFi speeds comparable to almost any other Android on the market.  Can't beat the price for the up-front purchase.  With AT&T; you can select which Rate Plan you want to be in; as little as $25/month up to $60/month.  I am on the $25 plan which is perfect for what I need.  Phone downloads pretty much all the latest apps on Google's PlayStore, but not all.  Phone is pretty fast when it comes to multi-tasking, and this is why I give it a 4 star.  There are faster phones out there that can mult-task better, but this one is pretty good.  Camera doesn't take good pictures and takes even worse video.  A lot of delay or lag while video while keeping up with what is moving in front of you.  The phone's \"in-call\" volume isn't too loud.  Although in-phone call quality is ok, the volume tends to run on the low side.  Overall, I love the phone and will hold on to it for some time.  It is way better than the ZTE Z990 I was previously using...it's like light-years better.

So, I got a Go Plan with AT&T.; This handheld appeared to be the best solution. Well, its less than \"meh\" at best. It might because, in part,  I am still getting use to an Android platform. But, that does not explain why this phone seems to stall out and you have restart it. Think GM Cobalt car stopping for no reason without the fatality. This phone is that car.

I'm sure compared to like a Samsung Galaxy S4 or some other more prestigious phone the Z998 is lacking but you cannot beat this phone for its price.  I'm an AT&T; post-paid customer, not a prepaid customer.  However, when one of the phones on my account died on us last year before our contract was up for renewal I discovered I could buy a prepaid phone outright and have it activated under my post-paid account.  I like this option because it keeps me from having to fork over hundreds at an AT&T; corporate store to buy a phone during my contract period and it keeps me from having to get sucked into another two-year contract in order to 'upgrade' my phone when my contract expires.  With the price and quality of prepaid phones improving so rapidly I personally don't see any reason to 'upgrade' my phone any longer and continue to be contractually tied to a cellular company, although I continue to get the plan benefits of a post-paid account (i.e. 10GB of data per month).Anyway, my own phone had been dying a slow and painful death for a while and I still have a little over two-months before my AT&T; contract expires and I'm eligible for a sensibly priced phone with a contract renewal, so I'd been looking for an AT&T; prepaid phone that fit my minimal specs over the past couple of months.  Those specs were a 4G LTE Android phone running at least 4.1 (Jellybean), with a minimum 5MP camera, flash, a front-facing camera and at least a 4.5\" screen.  This phone fits all those specifications.  It also feels solidly built and not flimsy or cheap.  The screen resolution and touch response are great.  I read a lot of reviews complaining about the battery life and camera quality.  Compared to my old phone the battery is fantastic.  Right now it seems to stay in the 'green' all day with normal use.  (Of course, my phone is brand new and they always get better battery life when they're new.)  The camera is the worst thing about the phone.  My old phone was an 8MP Samsung Infuse and took phenomenal pics and video, so the Z998 is definitely a step down.  However, in decent natural light the quality seems fine to me.  It primarily seems to be lacking whenever you're dependent upon using the camera's flash.  Then the pics are dull, colorless and grainy.  For $129 you cannot beat this phone though.  At this time the only other phone with comparable specs available for AT&T;'s prepaid service is the Samsung Galaxy Express and it's almost double the price at $249.  Therefore, the Z998 is an excellent choice if you want a lot of phone for a little money!!", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone at a breakthrough price, qualifies for AT&T;'s low use plans.", "Author": "J.

So I activated with the $25 a month plan, and my first call was to AT&T; to switch plans. This was done in just a few minutes. With these plans, people who don't talk much and who can live with WiFi-only data and paying 20 cents each for texting can have 90 days service and up to 250 minutes of talk for just $25.00. Note that there is no activation fee for a Gophone.The screen is very sharp and it has brilliant colors, even if it is only 18 bit. You could spend 4 times as much for an Android phone, but you'd have to look closely to see the difference in the screens. And it has the power to render HD video without a hiccup. Conflicting specs have been published about memory, but it has 2.1gb available.

Save your money and put it towards a decent phone from a name brand manufacturer.Long Review:I bought this phone as a temporary phone after I sold my top-tier Android phone. I simply do not understand how anyone can give this phone a good rating. I'm guessing all of the positive reviews are from people who have never actually owned a decent top-tier android phone; or this was their first smart phone. I bought this phone because the specs made it look half-way decent. It boasts 1gb Ram (for processing), a 1200 mhz dual-core processor, a 5 megaixel cameral, and a 4.5\" display.This phone is a perfect example of how specs on a sheet of paper are NOT the same as actual functioning. Long story short, the phone is VERY slow and gets hung up all the time, despite claiming to have a dual-core processor and 1 gb of Ram. It's quite comical when I read the reviews saying this is a fast phone. It's anything but fast. It simply can't handle much. It even freeze up as I scrolled through my home screens! Pathetic. I actually still have my 5 year old iPhone (that has much less specs than this phone) and it never got hung up like this. It was just so frustrating to use. Loading emails was also super slow and annoying to have to wait 30 seconds to a minute for the phone to load a simple email. And yes, as it did so, it would also get hung up or stuck sometimes in the process.The camera is also horrible. Takes very bad pics; very grainy. The screen is just okay...until you look at someone else's phone and see how gray and grainy it looks. People who say it has a nice screen have never owned a decent phone before. Walk into a store that sells real phones (e.g., iphone or galaxy) and you will be amazed how good they look compared to this screen.My biggest gripe was the slow processing and the bad camera. It got hung up and processed things so slow, I felt like running it over with my car. The camera is actually a waste of time. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're actually going to be able to use the camera and get good pics. I like taking pictures of my toddler and the pics were horrible.Oh, and one more major problem...the battery is horrible. Another lie. It claims to have a 2070 milli-amp battery, but it would fly through power in no time. There was once when I used the phone to check the internet and email, and within 40 minutes it went from fully charged to completely dead!", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "camera sux", "Author": "Joy F.", "ReviewID": "R2FWMQU2L8QY87", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had the phone for 2 months when the camera stopped working, with no damage to the phone, so warranty replaced. 2months later the camera stops working again on the new phone!

We have service with a different carrier than ATT. These phones are pre-paid so you own them and from what I read online, they should be unlocked and you can use with any carrier in accordance with a FCC regulation that went into effect this year which all carriers had to jump on board with by May 2014. Their phones worked fine, unpacked them, put in sim card and it worked great, this is with the pre-paid wireless service through WalMart (It is either Straight Talk or Family Mobile which I think are both under T-Mobile). I get my phone, put in my sim card and get a msg saying that the phone is networked locked and a pin number is needed to unlock it for use on other networks. I call AT&T;, go through 5 agents who tell me that there is no way the phone is usable on other networks. But they have no explanation why the other two phones I bought through Amazon which are the same model, works. I mentioned the FCC regulation that went into effect this year regarding that phones should be unlock and they know nothing about it. Even though you own the phone outright you cannot use it anywhere else unless you use it for 6 months with them then you have to submit an online request for PERMISSION FROM ATT to use the phone elsewhere. They have the right to deny it or approve it. Total waste of money, which is a shame because my wife and daughter love their phone. Still don't understand how their's was unlocked and mine isn't. Guess the lesson learned is only buy a phone that is not originally network specific - something that is specifically unlocked form the manufacturer. Do not buy a phone that is made just for that carrier, especially AT&T.; So now I have to see if it can be returned to Amazon or I am out the money.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "the most worthless phone ever", "Author": "Susan Dixson", "ReviewID": "R9FHYUW7OORT8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter purchased this phone and the camera stopped working within 2 hours of purchase.  We failed to ask the right questions at the ATT store, thinking that they would honor the warranty if there was a problem.  HAHAHA!!! Nope.  We had to utilize the warranyt support line.  AND EACH phone we have received under the warranty program had cameras that would not work.  The local ATT store said\"We are sorry but...( fill in with whatever lame BS reason) The ATT phone line did exchange out the phones quickly but gave us no other options but to continue exchanging the Z998 over and over and over and over....  They want to charge me full price to get another make of touch screen phone (and not a very reasonable price either).  So go ahead and pass on this one and get something far far away from ATT.

The phone only supports one notification tone. This tone covers everything from emails , texts, out of wifi range etc. This is annoying as half the time I end up ignoring it because I get the notification so much and I end up missing texts . I sent an email to the manufacturer in hopes that they would possibly put out a software update for the phone which would allow for different notifications . Thats why I only gave it 1 star.

The replacement had same problems.Sometimes when you charged it it would not indicate it was charging but it would charge. Kind of annoying but no big deal. However other times it would indicate it was charging and would continue to do so even after it was unplugged from the charger. This effectively renders your battery meter useless. I would even check with the battery usage widget and it would give me a percentage which would have been fine until i realized it had held a 96% charge for over 12 hrs of heavy use. Restart phone and surprise 20% battery.Bluetooth connection to car was not reliable. Sometimes I could use buttons on dash to answer and end calls sometime I could not.
