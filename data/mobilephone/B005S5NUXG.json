{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Item just as described...and with great customer service!", "Author": "Eric John", "ReviewID": "R3411TD8UDXLMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband needed a flip phone to replace his old broken one...make a call, speakerphone, take a picture, he's happy.  They're not so easy to find these days, but this phone was exactly what he was looking for.  It has way more features than he needs, lots of ringers, pretty big number pad, email etc...he won't use half of it.  The phone is great, and he has no complaints other than the face plate is a little shiny for his taste, but big deal.  He loves that you can set the phone to answer or not answer when flipped open (his old phone would answer when you flipped it open to check the caller ID), and likes the clock on the face plate.  It's really thin and does what it should; it's a great basic phone.The seller was fantastic, he got the phone in the mail immediately so we could get it in time for Father's Day, and didn't mind communicating with me to let me know how long it would take or when he put it in the mail.  Recommend the phone and recommend the seller.  :)", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "dcfan", "ReviewID": "R1W7R9JIT0RNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved the phone!
