Fabio", "ReviewID": "R16FRZIKJI4S3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey,I bought this cellphone to replace my old Omnia 2 (WinMo 6.5).There are a few pros that really make me happy on this cellphone:- HTC Sense:HTC interface rocks. I'm really impressed with the people app and all integration it does with your app. It amazed even some friends that has others brands such as Galaxy S2- dual core:It is not fast as a S2 but it won't let you down.- buildLooks good. Well constructed, HTC spent some money in good materials here.- ScreenIt is bright, colors seems to have the right colors (Galaxy colors looks green to me) and it is readable at sunlight (you can make a call, but it is not comfortable to read a message)What is not so good:- WeightIt is heavy: 170 grams is heavy compared to the 111 from galaxy s2 and also heavy compared to my old phone- BatteryThis really limits your cellphone. In fact this is not something related only to HTC EVO, but is something that impacts ALL smartphones. If you want it full power, it'll not last 6 hours.I definitely was going to rate this phone as 3 stars, but after talk with some friends I notice this is a common issue among smartphone users, so I spent some time testing configurations on my device to save some battery. right now. It can make 2-3 days \"saving\" battery or 1 day of hard usage.So, here is the thing.Sync: I did several tests... data transfers over 3G drains your battery.Take some time and configure it right. Do you really need to have your mail box being checked each 15 minutes? I really advice you to reduce or disable most of syncs.wifi:Check if there is wifi available, turn your Wifi on. It consumes less battery.GPS:\"GPS satellites\" drains your battery a lot.disable \"GPS satellites\" unless you are going to use your HTC as a GPS navigator. Use wireless networks instead. It is enough for most of your applications and will not eat your battery.If possible think about change you network settings from WCDMA and GSM to only GSM specially if you know you'll not be using data transfers.Rgds", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "It works fine.

Let's get this over with shall we,I properly hate the 3d feature. It feels like a gimmick and destroys the battery life. However, to account for 3d's battery sucking nature,the phone comes with a greater capacity battery than the similarly specced htc sensation. Because of my abhorrence towards the 3d camera, the phone, unlike my friend's sensation, easily gets through a day of moderate usage(awesome side effect). The only gripe I have is regarding the hardware aspects of the phone, mainly the ergonomics and the display. Talking of the former, the ergonomics of the phone could have been much better. The biggest culprit here is the camera key, which juts out from the side. The design of the camera key leads to it pressing into the skin and often getting pressed accidentally.Putting a case on the phone, however, negates this problem. The display, while of qHd resolution, has very bad viewing angles. Despite saying this, I would take this display over pentile matrix displays like those of the atrix's and the droid razr's every-time.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "it is not an unlocked phone!", "Author": "Danny Jimenez Vega", "ReviewID": "RMC5T4YJGCW0A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was a joke!
