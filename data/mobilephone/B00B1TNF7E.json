{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More than adequate.  The best you are going to get until the S3 or Nexus get to Virgin Mobile.", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R15XIC0WD92UJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Virgin Mobile has always been a great value, delivering acceptable phones and service at a far lower total cost of ownership than the big contract carriers.  Low cost coupled with much more flexible terms, from being contract-free, makes these carriers worthy of consideration for all cell phone consumers.The downside to Virgin Mobile, is that the phones that they offer are always about a year behind the current, cutting edge offerings.  This remains true, however being a year behind is mattering less and less now that smart phone technology is reaching a plateau.  I'm not saying that the iPhone 5 is not better than the iPhone 4S, that the Samsung Galaxy S3 is not better than the Samsung Galaxy S2, or that 2012 HTC Evo 4G is not better than the 2010 version of the same phone.  What I'm saying is that the improvements are far more nuanced now, in 2012, than they were in 2010 or earlier.  Getting a phone with last year's technology is not as big of a deal now as it once was, especially when you look at the cost difference.This phone, the Samsung Galaxy S2 4G is obviously not the newest version of this phone available.  If you want the very newest and best, you won't get that on Virgin Mobile or any other budget priced contract free carrier.  It is however very adequate, and by far the best phone ever offered for this low of a total cost of ownership.I have had six different Android phones on Virgin Mobile, including the HTC EVO 4G, Motorola Triumph, Optimus, etcetera.  I bought this phone in November 2012 at Radio Shack, the day that it became available.  I still have an HTC Evo 4G in our family, but personally have been using this phone for over a month now, quite heavily.This Samsung Galaxy S2 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), which is currently (at the time of this review) one version behind the newest versions of Android (Jelly Bean 4.1 & 4.2).  It has a fast dual core processor, good 8MP camera, is 4G capable, has great battery life, and has overall great performance. Although it has been out for over a year on Sprint, it is not nearly as far behind the mainstream as previous Virgin Mobile offerings have been.Size. This phone is more similar in size to the Motorola Triumph than it is to the bulkier HTC EVO V 4G.  With a 4.52\" AMOLED touch screen and a thin body, it is the most compact phone for the screen size that Virgin has ever had available.  I really like the form factor.  After using it for about a week without a case, I put an Otterbox Defender on it.  That case bulks the phone up quite a bit, but it is still comfortable.  I like it with or without the case, but got the case because of my clumsiness and lifestyle.Cases. Since this phone is identical to the one that has been on Sprint for over a year, there are plenty of great cases available for it, including ones from top of the line companies like Otter Box. There are many times more accessories available for it than for previous Virgin Mobile phones, except for the HTC Evo V 4G which also had a lot of cases to choose from.Screen. I love the 4.52\" screen size, and this one is even sharper and more vivid than the one on the HTC Evo 4G, which was better than the Motorola Triumph.  It is great.Touch Screen. The touch screen is very responsive, accurate, and precise. By far the best touch screen I've ever used. Even better (or equal to) the one on the Apple Ipod Touch. I use that comparison because I've always felt that the Touch was better than the Android phones I'd had in the past.  The HTC Evo V 4G is the same in this regard.  Both phones have excellent touch screens.Keyboard. The touch screen keyboard on this phone is awesome.  The touchscreen keyboard on the HTC EVO V 4G was far better than any of the previous Virgin Mobile offerings, and this one on the Samsung Galaxy S2 is even better.Battery. The battery life on this phone is incredible because of its increased size and better power management and network management. It lasts 3 times longer than the battery on the Motorola Triumph, and about twice as long as the one on the HTC EVO V 4G.  I like that this phone gives you an actual percentage reading for the battery instead of just the imprecise icon.Network management.  This phone is great at making seamless transitions between 3G, 4G, and Wifi, always switching to the best available choice.  The HTC Evo V 4G used to give me some problems in this area.  The S2 is flawless at this.Camera. The 8MP camera on this phone is far better than any cell phone I've ever had.  I think that it rivals the iPhone and in most conditions can fully replace your compact point and shoot camera.  The video camera shoots 1080p video and is also very good.4G.  Having 4G is great, especially since the Virgin Mobile 3G network is a little slow sometimes.Internet Sharing. The ability to share this phone's internet connection is awesome and works really well. It works great on both 3G and especially 4G. It is simple to use, and at $15 a month is a much better value than a Mifi card.Call Quality. The call quality is great on this phone, and is much better than the Motorola Triumph which sometimes sounded muffled, and slightly better than the HTC EVO V 4G which wasn't bad.  It is clear for both you and the person you are talking to.Bluetooth. The Bluetooth on this phone works great both with a headset and with my car. I love how it seamlessly transitions from my Podcast Application (Doggcatcher), Navigation, and phone calls.Processor. This phone is snappy and doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all. No matter what I run or play, it works the way it is supposed to, even when I'm multi-tasking. The processor seems to be more than adequate.Durability.  This phone is no more or less durable than any of the other plastic smart phones out there.  I personally wish that more phones were available with unibody metal housings.  I used to wish the same things about laptops and they are finally moving that way.  Hopefully more phones will be more durable in the future.  Anyway, this phone is adequate in this area.Reliability. So far, I have had no issues with applications or functions crashing on this phone. It works consistently and flawlessly. I will update this review if I find anything getting hung-up or crashing. I have had the phone since they first released it, and still haven't had any problems.  My experience in this area was the same on the HTC EVO V 4G.If there are any topics that you wanted me to address that I failed to, please let me know in the comments and I will update this review for you.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Crippled By The Wi-Max Network, Replaced By Galaxy S3 With 4g LTE", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2ARB71V26N1L6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Boost Mobile has replaced the Galaxy S II, using the obsolete Wi-Max network, with the more advanced Samsung Galaxy S3, running on Sprint's new high speed 4g LTE network. There is NO reason to buy the Galaxy S II unless you can buy the it for a sensationally low price...say, about $199. The more expensive Galaxy S3, with MUCH faster data speeds, provides better value for your money.The Samsung Galaxy S II is a great phone. If rated by the superb quality of its large screen, the solid quality of phone calls, and its superior ability to handle basic functions such as texting, email, photos, videos, and music, the S2 is equal or superior to the Apple Iphone 5 and most other premium quality phones. For details on why the S2 is such a great phone, read some of the many \"Five Star\" Reviews.So, why do I rate the Samsung S2 as only a \"Two Star\" phone? Because it is priced as being a 4g phone, but the Sprint/Virgin Wi-Max network can deliver TRUE 4g speeds indoors to only about 10% of American homes. Second, instead of expanding the Wi-Max network, Sprint/Virgin has decided to replace the Wi-Max network with a 4g LTE network and shut down the Wi-Max network.The closing of the Wi-Max network has begun. Within three years, the Wi-Max network is likely to be totally shut down. A Wi-Max phone, such as the S2, can NOT connect to Sprint/Virgins's new 4g LTE network. In cities with a 4g LTE network, the S2 will be limited to the Sprint/Virgin BASIC network, which is the slowest network in America...with very slow download speeds similar to the snail slow dial-up internet speeds of 1995.How bad is the Wi-Max network? Go to the Virgin Mobile website and study the Wi-Max coverage maps. ZERO coverage in the majority of states. Zero coverage if you are not near a city with a population of over a million people. Tests by CNET and other organizations find that even in cities with great Wi-Max coverage such as Houston, Texas, TRUE 4g speeds are reached only when you are outdoors. Inside a home, the speeds slow down to less than the speed of an At&t; 3g HSPA phone. Inside a large office building, the Wi-Max speeds revert to 2g speeds that are too slow for video, and sometimes to slow to stream music.Battery life? Many of the \"Five Star\" and \"Four Star\" reviews mention very poor battery life. That is a direct result of the low quality Wi-Max network. If a phone is getting a strong signal and can download data rapidly, there is a very light load on the battery. However,if a phone is constantly searching for a usable signal and struggles to slowly download data, the load on the battery doubles or triples. A phone that gets eight hours per charge on a weak network would get up to 16 hours or 24 hours per charge on a strong network.If the Galaxy S2 was selling for the price of a good 3g phone ($125 to $199) it would be worth buying. However, Virgin Mobile prices the SII at the level of TRUE 4g phones that have 4g coverage in every major city and in every major state. Because Sprint/Virgin has already decided to close its Wi-Max network, selling Wi-Max phones at premium prices borders on consumer fraud.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Julio Rivero", "ReviewID": "R24XUA37KJEVB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome ... all the bells and whistles.

I like everything about this phone so far.  I was looking for a Virgin Mobile phone with more storage, at least 8 MP camera, and faster processor, as well as good/great reviews and good price point.  Battery life could be a bit better, but with some tweaking of settings, including notifications, widgets, screen brightness/timeout, etc, it has improved.  I get about 12 hours with light use and about 10 hours with medium use.  Someone mentioned that the phone has shut down out of the blue and needing to remove and replace the battery.  This happened once with mine so far.  I believe I was closing out of an app when it happened.  Battery was still charged.

I was so happy with this phone, now it's been 11 months since I originally bought this phone it is a piece of junk now! The phone constantly turns off and on and sometimes wont turn on at all! The screen cracked right in half from the one time I dropped it (normally had a case in this phone but took it off that day for some odd reason.) The screen is supposed to be of high quality but the phone fell off my lap and on the payment not even a one foot drop and it cracked right in half. Another major problem is the lock button just decided it didn't want to work anymore this happened about 7 months into this phone! I downloaded an app that allows the proximity sensor to work as a lock button this is just a big pain and so annoying. Other problems the speaker now sucks, the screen goes crazy and has random lines and movements almost wave like. I hate this phone and have replaced it and left Virgin Mobile forever! HORRIBLE customer service the worst I've ever dealt with! I would strongly suggest anyone interested in this phone to go to Straight Talk they have S3's that run on Sprint Towers as well As Verizon's which is incredible! Blows sprint out of the water my Verizon 3G is so much faster than Sprints 4G! I am now a proud owner of the LG Optimus Showtime which blows this phone out of the water as far as the guts go! I warn you do not buy this phone or you will be in need of a new phone in under one year! I always take good care of my phones with professional applied screen protectors and cases! I would strongly suggest staying away from this phone sure it's a gorgeous phone but looks aren't everything. Also forgot to mention the touch buttons just suck! They hardly work half of the time. I hate this phone now and am so disappointed in a phone I paid over $300 for and it just went to crap after 8 months! I am now a hater of Virgin Mobile! Sure they have amazing phones at great prices but the customer service is horrible and sprint for the most part has the worst towers around.

The thing cost me $300, and as I've hit the year mark it is breaking down already. The power on off button is hyper sensitive, and turn off in an instant, even worse, it keeps shutting itself off over and over now. Literally shuts down, comes back on, shuts down again, comes back on and keeps going unless you pop the battery. It is awful. And now I need a new phone already after a year. Even worse my wifes s2 also went bad in a year also. Hers shut off and never came on again. It had powerbutton problems also before hand.

For \"wind addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3TR4PQI48V4Q4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the phone for about 2 to 3 months  and I am very happy with it.PROS:* I love the design of the phone, it is very thin and comfortable in my hands, and the white color gives it a sophisticated look.  My brother has the Samsung Galaxy S3, and shape-wise, it feels and looks pretty much the same, except that the S3 has a home button.* Other reviewers have complained about the battery life, but I am quite satisfied with the battery life.  I guess it all verges on expectations.  Before buying the phone I had talked to other people about their phone's battery life, (Iphone users), and all pretty much said that theirs lasted about a day or down to 12 hours with heavy use.  So based on what Iphone users told me, and my wife's use of the Samsung nexus, my expectations with this phone were that I wanted to get at least a day of battery life.* My battery life of course varies based on my usage and on where I am.  For example, if I am at home for several days in a row (where I have very good signal), my battery life can last from 2 \u00bd to 3 days based on medium usage.  However, when I am at work all day, where my signal is very bad, and the phone is constantly roaming, then my battery will only last from 1 day to 1 \u00bd days.  I have also been able to extend my battery life a bit by downloading the \"Easy Battery\" app.* Granted I am not a heavy user....I only use my phone to check work and personal emails, facebook, LinkedIn, read some news sights, watch some YouTube videos, watch Vine videos, text and do some light talk-time with family and friends, etc.  I do not use my phone for listening to the radio, downloading music, gaming or talking on the phone constantly.* The Virgin price of $35/month for unlimited text, data and 300 minutes is a very good deal.* I've been very satisfied with the pictures the phone takes.* I bought the S2 on Virgin because it gives me the option to turn the phone into a Hot Spot by paying an extra $15.  I wanted this option, because sometimes I need to connect to my work computer remotely while on the road.  The S2 is 1 of 4 other phones that has this option under Virgin.  The S3 doesn't have this option yet on Virgin.CONS:* I guess the only CON I have is the Sprint network, and that is why I gave this review a 4.  Virgin is on the sprint network, and it is pretty good in the city I live in, Raleigh, NC.  I can get 4G WiMax sometimes, but for the most part I get 3G at home and at work, and that is good enough for what I use my phone for.  Whenever my signal is lacking, I'll simply just connect to a wireless network.* I have absolutely no signal when I travel to the remote parts of North Carolina, i.e. when I go to the Outer Banks (Avon, Buxton, Frisco), or when I travel to Cape Lookout.  However, this also happens with other carriers.  When I was on Net10, the same thing happened.  I think Verizon or AT&T; are the only one that has good coverage in these remote areas of NC.  So in the future, when I get my next phone I might consider getting a prepaid Verizon phone, just so I could have signal everywhere, but the CON against that is that I would be looking at $60 to $70 per month for unlimited, versus the $35/ month for Virgin. The cost / benefit of Virgin probably comes out on top, since it's not like I travel to remote areas all that often.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "ZM", "ReviewID": "R2KBS0KODNKBG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is wonderful.

The picture quality I found to be good too as so the video playback. I also enjoy having the option to put widgets (the YT widget lets you scroll through recent upload from my subscriptions w/o opening the app) and play music or streaming from soundcloud while Im on other applications. It is also nice to have a wifi hotspot feature on the phone (additional $15 on your bill) so when I need to use my note 10.1 or ipod it will have internet access. The phone still hasn't replaced my ipod because androids can place certain music files such as WAV, aiff, M4a, and others that I download from soundcloud but I doesn't make much difference if your streaming but I would still like to put those files on my phone or tablet.

I played GTA 3 on here and it runs smooth no lagging or any problems.My dislikes that I have with this phone is no HD streaming on YT, sometimes it becomes a hot brick in my pocket, no HD display that thought it had and its on 4.0.4 (it might be Virgin mobiles issue and not phone but still would like to see 4.1.2 like on my note 10.1 or a more updated OS).The things I like are the mobile hotspot, good screen size, editing where apps can go on the home screen, widgets, voice talk, mobile id even though Im the only user on my phone", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Ana Carey", "ReviewID": "R6DJB87GTZYDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

The battery life is poor; with frequent use, the phone doesn't get me through the whole day and I am even using a low brightness setting. Also, sometimes the phone will randomly shut off, but this doesn't happen too often. And lastly, when the phone charges, it almost seems like it gets too hot and I don't want it to overheat so I take off the phone case while it charges.Besides these few drawbacks, the phone is beautiful, has a large screen, and is definitely the best phone I've ever had from Virgin Mobile.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone just as good as an I phone", "Author": "V.

I followed their procedures to return one phone, still unopened.  I have called every week for two months and they first claimed not to have received it (so I sent the delivery confirmation).  Now they say they found a record in their computer about a phone that came back missing some accessories.  I told them that is between them and the postal carrier they hired to bring me the phone I did not order (or the postal carrier they hired to bring it back to them, this was all done with THEIR shipping labels and their chosen carrier).  So far, they still have not acknowledged that they owe me any money at all!Because it is over $300, I will next go to my credit card company to find out if they will reverse the charges for me.  I have spent hours and hours on this and received 4 separate \"case ID numbers.\"  Each time, they promise to call me back.  They have not called me back.  Not once.  We did activate the other phone which works sometimes, though not as well as our AT&T; phone worked.  When I topped up the first time (paid the monthly fee) they double charged my credit card AGAIN.  When I demanded a refund for that, they refunded me only a portion of what they had charged me!  I see that I will have to check my credit card every month for double charges.  Now that I have spent $300 on a locked phone, I feel I am stuck with these terrible crooks.  I hope I can find a way out of this.

I bought this phone for my mother because I have owned both the Galaxy SII and Galaxy SIII. I love the Galaxy and I'd preach it's goodness to anyone who would listen - BUT - I am not happy with the service provided through Virgin Mobile. It's one of those too good to be true kind of things. We researched her area for signal strength before we purchased it, but when we got it it still doesn't have a signal. Indoors OR outdoors. My mom goes for days without having any signal at all, and when we took it into the VM store we were told that because we purchased it from the VM website they could not help us. We would have to call the VM hotline. Well how do you expect us to do that if the only phone she has is the phone that doesn't work? On wifi, it's amazing; however, when you need to rely on Virgin Mobile's data/talk plan you will NOT have a phone to work with.
