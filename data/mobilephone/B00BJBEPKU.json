So, here I sit with a $500 phone that I can't seem to get rid of.  I know it was my fault for purchasing this phone and not reading the specs, but what a waste of money. I am currently trying to sell my unused by me but used phone on amazon if anyone is interested.  Please make sure that your cell phone service will allow you to use this type of phone.  it has us cellular stamped on the reverse side. etched in. not all of these phones are made for us cellular. just this one.  otherwise i would totally love this phone.  just wish i could use it.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BJBEPKU"}}
