I complained about the wifi hookup along with a lot of folks. It  WILL work, and really flies once you figure it out. Get the set ID saved first. Then pull it up and look under options (details) and find out what kind of encryption you are hooking up to. Then save the password. If you garble the SSID you will have trouble erasing it. To erase, delete ALL the letters and then re-type the correct name in.I tour on my motorcycle and will probably be using a few of the web features for trips and looking up motels, etc. If you're a heavy user you may need to look at the regular smart phones and pay through the nose. Setting up email is a no brainer. The keyboard is nice and a little small but it works. The space key drives some folks nuts until they figure it out, as it will post a space and a PERIOD at the same time. The trick is to hit the LEFT side of the spacebar if you don't want the period in there as well. Lovely screen and nice battery life, this is a huge step up from the other Tracs. I had the LG800G and I hated the scrolling and the touch screen, this phone is far superior and as a real bonus the voice dialing works absolutely great. This phone is a real bargain for the casual user.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Blue Hen 2011", "ReviewID": "R14MNIBWUNNQ70", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My wife and I text back and forth on our lunch breaks and I was getting tired of texting on my old clamshell Tracfone. This was the cheapest phone with triple minutes on Tracfone and the wifi feature sold me on it. The phone features a 3G connection, wifi connectability, a browser, and e-mail synching.The full blackberry-style keyboard has made texting MUCH faster than a normal clamshell phone. However, the keys are somewhat small and the spacebar frequently glitches and puts in periods if I press it towards the right rather than the left. You can set the keyboard to automatically lock and I've had no problems with it pocket dialing. However, you can still dial 911 while the phone is locked (you press the numbers and it asks you if you want to call SOS).I liked the idea of the e-mail synching on the go but not the execution. Everytime the phone automatically checked my e-mail, I was charged minutes for using the 3G connection. I ended up turning the automatic synching off and I haven't checked my e-mail on it in probably three weeks.For my purposes, the 3G connection is a useless feature. 3G makes sense on my wife's Droid 3 but this phone doesn't have the goods to need a fast connection. I know this is a Tracfone phone but I expected the browser to be better than it is. I hoped against hope that I would be able to watch netflix on the small screen. However, the browser is the same \"fake internet\" browser you'd get on a clamshell phone except with a faster connection. Many sites are incompatible and surfing is difficult. After checking it out the first couple days I had the phone, I haven't used the browser at all.The wifi makes using the fake internet on the phone fairly fast but I just can't get over how clumsy the browser is.Altogether, I'm happy that the phone has made texting about three times faster for me but disappointed in the internet features that initially interested me in the phone.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great little phone at a great price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1QEOE2YFR70JJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up my review in one paragraph, if you are a current Tracfone customer, this is a great cell phone and you should seriously consider upgrading to it. The triple minutes for life that come with the phone, make it pay for itself--perhaps even from the very first day! Even if you are not a current customer, there is so much to like about this phone that you might wish to take a close, hard look at all it offers. (Be sure to consider the other version of the phone that comes with one year of service and 1200 minutes.) Here are my main points in support of these assertions.1. It is a very nice, well-made phone from a top-notch company. It is somewhat similar to the Blackberry Curve 8310, except that it has almost twice the internal memory, a CPU that is 40% faster, better battery life, and the ability to connect to Wifi networks. I should add that it is also less than half the price. What more need one say about it as a phone? You can place and receive calls. The sound quality is good and is easily adjusted via a volume rocker on the left side of the phone. Tracfone provides service to almost every location in the USA and allows low-cost international calls to many different countries. The \"must have\" feature of this phone is the Nuance software that allows voice-activated placement of phone calls (or initiation of text messages). It is easy to program the phone so that two key pushes activate the Nuance software. Then you just say \"call home\" and the phone will dial your home phone number (if it is listed as \"home\" in your phonebook), or \"message Sandy\" and you will start a text message to Sandy. You can even have Nuance check your battery (\"check battery\") or the status of several other aspects of the phone.2. The most common complaint about the phone is actually (in a strange way) a strength. If your phone is \"on\" and inactive for a short period of time, it will go into a \"keyboard locked\" mode. In that state most key presses are ignored, but if you do push 911 (as could be necessary in an emergency or if those keys are pressed by accident), the phone will ask if you wish to dial SOS. Some other key presses also seem to register in that mode and will occasionally cause the phone to crash. (If you get an alarming warning screen with a bunch of yellow text on a black background, it's time to reboot the phone after first removing the battery for about twenty seconds.) . . . . OK then, what do you do if you want to lock down the keyboard so that you can put the phone in your pocket or your purse, and be a little more confident that you won't be dialing 911 or causing a software crash? Simple. Hold down the right Alt button for a few seconds. The phone will again say \"keyboard locked,\" but this time the phone seems to be a bit more securely locked. Unfortunately, it could still \"pocket dial\" unintentionally. Pressing \"0\" four times in a row, for example, brings up a message asking if you wish to call SOS. I recommend keeping the phone in a hard case to make such dialing even less likely.[EDIT--2/29/2012. The problem of the phone \"pocket dialing\" 911 is real and might be bad enough to make some people think twice about owning the phone. My solution has been to purchase a WIRELESS CENTRAL Brand Soft Silicone BLACK Skin Cover Case for SAMSUNG R390 FREEFORM 4 [WCB578]. This skin fits the phone fairly well, though the cut-outs (which are mostly unnecessary) are not made for the S390G. Then I traced the outline of the phone on a piece of very stiff poster board and cut it out. When the skin is on the phone and the poster board cover is attached with a stout rubber band, the keys cannot be depressed at all if the phone is slid into a pocket or purse. It is not an elegant solution, but it is cheap and it works.]3. By far the best feature of this phone is its ability to connect to wifi. I can't tell you that it will connect flawlessly to every Wifi network, but it has worked reasonably well for most of the public sites I have tried in my brief experience with the phone. Just make certain that the tiny wireless icon changes from blue to green (indicating that you have switched from the available 3G connection to a Wifi connection). When the wireless indicator is blue, you WILL be charged minutes for time spent browsing (though sometimes that is worth paying for). When the light is green, your browsing is free.4. The native browser (NetFront 4.2) is very fast and reasonably good. The phone's OS seems to invoke that browser for certain kinds of activities (downloading and opening new software, playing Youtube videos, etc.) A few of these activities can only take place when the phone is connected to a 3G network (not Wifi); that is annoying, but it is not a deal-breaker for me. Personally, I prefer to use Opera Mini 7.1 or Opera Mini 4.4 for most of my browsing because these programs make better use of the phone's small screen. To download either of these browsers, go to the Opera Mini homepage on the Netfront browser while connected via Wifi. Click on \"Other download options.\" Scroll down to the bottom of the page that comes up and choose the \"Select Code-Signing Certificate\" for your preferred browser (or do the whole sequence twice to have both Opera Mini 7.1 and Opera Mini 4.4). Now bookmark the page you are on; it's the one which has the link to \"All Certificates.\" Exit the browser, disconnect from Wifi, and reopen the browser. (You will start being charged minutes.) Go to the page you have bookmarked and click on \"All Certificates.\" Click on \"Download Opera Mini 7.1\" (or Opera Mini 4.4 as the case may be) and wait for the completion of the download. Exit the browser, connect to Wifi, go to the Games&Apps; folder and boot up Opera. You will now be able to finish the installation progess for a signed version of the Opera Mini browser.5. If you would like to add one more piece of useful software, consider Google Maps. Simply navigate to Google Maps on your phone and click on \"Install Now\" for version 2.3.2. I have only been able to install the unsigned version of Google Maps, which means that an annoying pop-up screen requires me to click \"OK\" every time the program accesses the Internet. (As long as you are connected via Wifi there will be no charge for doing so, but navigating the maps is slowed to a crawl.) If you just need driving directions without a map, I recommend using your browser to go to Mapquest mobile. [EDIT--12/29/2012. Google has changed its website recently and the Java version of Google Maps is currently unavailable there. You can, however, still download it from Getjar and several other sites. Use the Samsung GT Ch@t 5720 as your phone.]6. This phone has a wonderful mp3 player. The mp3 player alone is worth the price of the phone, but to make best use of it you will need to buy additional memory on which to store your music, pictures, and videos. A 4 GB mini SDHC card (with SD adapter) costs about $4; an 8 GB card sells for around $6. I bought Class 4 cards of both sizes (Kingston and Sandisk), and both work very well though the Sandisk card needed to be reformatted in a PC before the Samsung s390g would recognize it. If you are listening to music and your phone rings for an incoming call, the music player automatically pauses to allow you to reply. At the end of the call you can start it up again just where you left off. This device is perfect for listening to mp3 audio books since you can fast-forward or rewind through long tracks quickly if you have lost your place or need to listen to a chapter over again.7. There is a fairly good 2 megapixel camera. The pictures don't compete in quality with those of dedicated digital cameras or the best phones, but they are more than adequate for spur-of-the-moment snapshots or home videos. (By the way, you can invoke the camera via a long press of the 0 (zero) button. Once the camera software is running, you can view your photos in full screen by tapping \"View.\" Stroking the mini-trackpad to left or right cycles through your photos. Pushing the volume rocker allows you to zoom in or out. . . . In addition to taking photos and home movies, the phone will play video files in a variety of formats (making it a very tiny portable video player).8. There is a built-in digital voice recorder--another feature that is worth about the price of the phone.9. I could wax rhapsodic about some of the other features of the phone that one might once have paid for as separate items, but almost all of these are now also freebies in many competing mobile phones--the calculator, the calendar, the alarms, and so on.In the end I suppose I'd say that with this phone (and with many others that are more expensive and require costly data plans) one gets a very capable all-purpose hand-held computer. Thirty years ago it would have required a roomful of equipment to do the various things this small Samsung s390g can do so much better. I think you will like it as much as I do.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's amazing.", "Author": "Kelly S.", "ReviewID": "R3ECJMB32AP338", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT 10/9/12: I think there are a small percentage of defected phones out there, so if you're having MAJOR problems with your phone, this may be why. But again, this is just a small percentage, so make sure that you have absolutely tried everything to get your phone working to do whatever you're having trouble with. If not, you may be one of the unlucky people who got a defected phone. But for the third time, this is a VERRRRYYY small percentage of phones, so make sure you know for sure before you send it back!!!10/9/12 HOW TO SET UP WIFI -PRESS \"MENU.\" OKAY, GOT THAT?THEN, SCROLL TO \"WIFI.\"PRESS THE \"SELECT BUTTON.\" (AKA, THE LEFT SOFT KEY BUTTON OR THE BIG BLACK SCROLLER THING IN THE MIDDLE.)OKAY ARE YOU GUYS WITH ME HERE?IT WILL SAY \"SEARCHING.\"THEN, CLICK ON YOUR WIFI ROUTER'S NAME. YOU WILL ITS SETTINGS.OKAY, BEFORE PRESSING \"SAVE\", MAKE SURE YOU SCROLL DOWN TO \"PASSWORD.\"TYPE IN YOUR PASSWORD. (MAKE SURE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE IT IS CORRECT!!)AFTER YOU TYPE IN THE CORRECT PASSWORD, PRESS THE \"SAVE BUTTON.\" (THE LEFT SOFT KEY BUTTON.)AND WALAHHH!I think some people are having trouble with the wifi because they aren't scrolling down far enough to enter their password, and then saving it. MAKE SURE YOU AREN'T ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE OKAY? I think one or two of you guys left comments a long time ago saying how no one is helping you with the wifi. WELL THERE YA GO! (:First of all, I have to say this: You are INSANE if you have this phone and do not like it. Seriously. This is the best phone I've ever had. I had a touch screen from ATT, but my parents thought they were paying too much for it, so they decided to change it. (My mom was already an existing Tracfone customer, so that's why she thought this would be a better deal for me since I don't even text/call much.) Since I was never a heavy texter or anything, it wasn't really a big deal for me that I had to change. The main reason why I loved my previous phone was because of the touch screen, and how easy it was to type on it. But to be honest, I was actually kind of excited for a change in the phone I had. My previous touch screen was still a great phone though. ANYWAYS - I'm not here to support my old phone, I'm here to support my new one.I've read a bunch of reviews online and most of them were complaining about the setup taking too long, not being able to activate the phone, not being able to set up the wifi, charging minutes for using wifi, etc. I don't know what the heck these people are doing wrong, but the wifi DOES work, and no they do NOT charge you a penny to use it.Do not change your mind in getting the phone just because of THIS. Obviously those are just personal problems that they are having because they do not know how to \"properly\" set it up. If you are PATIENT in what you are doing, you will get it. It really annoys me how people keep complaining about something when really, all they need to do is be patient. Patience is a virtue, remember? I don't understand why so many people are having trouble with this. It took me just half an hour to transfer my mom's old Tracfone number and minutes to the phone, and it took about another half an hour as well to set up my new phone too. Come on, if a 16 year old can do this all by herself, I'm sure you folks can too. The 1500 minutes came in at about an hour after I activated them.Also, the wifi on this phone is amazing! It's pretty fast, and I'm happy with it. If you are having problems with the wifi, it is most likely because you don't know how to set it up, you're doing it all wrong, or there is something wrong with your wireless connection in your house. Don't blame it on the phone because it works perfectly fine for me. I suggest that you download the full user manual online as the one they provide with the phone does not have full information on this topic. Trust me, I promise you that you will be able to set up the wifi. It is very easy, easier than you think. Oh yeah, but here's a warning: Whenever you go online, make sure that you are connected to wifi. If the phone is not connected, you will end up losing lots of minutes very, very fast. To know if you're connected by wifi, the bars by the volume symbol must be green. Green means that you are connected to the internet by wifi. If it's blue, it means that there's no wifi and you'll get charged if you go online like that. Some of you may think the screen may be too small to be used on the internet, but I don't see any problem!Okay, now I'll begin talking more about the phone.One minor thing about the phone is that whenever I press the \"space\" button on the keyboard, a period pops up. I know why this is happening though. It's because this is similar to the iPhone wear you double click on the space bar really fast so a period will pop up. As of now, the only solution I can find to this is not pressing the space bar directly in the middle. Press on the side of it and the period won't pop up. Hopefully this problem will go away after I start using the phone more. I'll update if it improves for me.Another tiny problem for me is that the soft keys (the send, end, and the two middle keys) are not backlit. The whole bottom keyboard is backlit though, which is a good thing. I don't know what I'd do if they weren't. But if the top keys were back lit, that would be PERFECT for me. But again, it isn't a big problem.And also, for some reason, sometimes a random message pops up saying \"email login failed\" or something like that, and then it deducts half a minute! Anyone else with me or is it just me? I don't understand that part. It's probably because my phone got disconnected from wifi but I don't want my phone deducting half a minute every time the wifi is not connected! I'll find out more about this later and update. If you're having this problem too, I suggest deleting your email account from the phone for now until we figure out why they keep deducting minutes like this every time the wifi disconnects. EDIT: I found a way to stop this message from popping up and deducting my minutes. Whenever you take your phone somewhere that doesn't have any wifi, make sure to go to \"Receiving options\" and then \"Auto sync.\" You should see the choices On, Home Network Only, or Off. Press off. This may take some time to do each time you get out of wifi service, but it help from getting deducted minutes. Then when you get back to your house or whatever with good wifi connection,turn it back to \"Home network only.\"Typing on this phone is okay. I'll probably get used to it though. Overall with the typing, it's so so. It's not as easy as typing on an iPhone or something like that, but like I said, you will get used to it after using it for a while. The buttons are the right size, so don't worry about them being too \"small.\" It's just like a Blackberry. Obviously if you just switched from a fancy dancy smart phone, it's probably going to take some time to adjust to this new keyboard. I've also seen some reviews where people are like, \"UGH THE KEYS ARE SO SMALL!! I'M RETURNING IT BACK! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH YOU TRACFONE.\" Wow, seriously? Give this phone a break and stop trying to find the negative out of everything. I'm sorry but these kind of people really annoy me. They act like it's the end of the world.OH - and also, some people think that this phone has voice text messaging. If you're expecting to talk to your phone and then it'll type in everything you say, it's not going to work. This phone doesn't have that feature. What it does have is you can record your voice in a little audio thing and then send it via text message.For those of you who like putting little charms/landyards on your phone, with this phone, you have to remove the battery cover and then insert the charm in from there. Then put the cover back on.The touchpad is great. It's very easy to use, and I got used to it after using it for a minute.The camera quality is eh, okay. Better than nothing. But remember that this isn't meant for taking pictures. This is meant for texting/calling. That's what \"phones\" are for. If you want a camera with great quality, get an actual camera.This phone is a speaker phone too. When you're in the middle of a call, just click the center button and the speaker will turn on.You can also listen to music on here too. Just make sure you add additional memory. This phone can store external memory up to 32gb. And the head jack is 3.5mm. (Just like regular earphones. I'm shocked because previous Samsung phones I've had had weird head jack sizes. But this one is normal.)Oh and I forgot to mention that you can get apps on this phone. Go to getjar.com to download apps for free. There are lots of apps websites like this. Getjar.com is just one of them. But here's the main problem for me with this. For some apps that I try to download, I end up getting a \"connection failed\" message, and I never get the app saved onto the phone. It's like this with apps like Facebook chat, Yahoo mail, etc. And for some other apps, when I AM able to save them onto my phone, whenever I go to them, this message keeps popping up saying \"you are accessing the network. Data charges may apply.\" Of course I click yes because i'm using wifi, but the message still keeps popping up every 3 seconds to the point where I want to just throw my phone at a wall. This is the only thing I really, really, REALLY hate about this phone. Hopefully I'll be able to figure out what's going on soon. If anyone knows a solution to this, please tell.Youtube works great too. Better than I expected. :)Battery life lasts really long too. I'm able to surf the web for about 5+ hours until one bar goes down. And there are 5 bars total. Within this past week, I only had to charge it once! It's amazing.The service is great. But that's the service in MY area. Hopefully it's great for you too.Overall, I think you should get this phone because I can guarantee that you will not regret it. (Depending on if you're one of those people who find the negative in everything.)This isn't exactly a \"full\" smartphone, but it looks like one and it's pretty cool. I have no complaints besides for the few minor ones I listed above. Don't believe all the negative stuff people are saying about this phone. This is a wonderful phone that anybody, any age will love. I as a teenager, am love this phone. If you are a teenager as well, you will love this. If you are planning on getting this for your teenage kids or something, they will love you forever.

Mr. Wonderrfull \"New England Pa...", "ReviewID": "R26A5XH1I00SZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little under a month ago I bought this phone and Promptly decided I hated it. Then after being away from it awhile, or, learning how to overcome what I consider some shortcomings of the phone, have decided to give it another try. This time with much better results. The first reviewer on here said You'd have to be nuts to not like this phone. She's pretty much on target. First off, the Triple minutes for life option, Buy one minute, get two free. Can't beat that. I am looking to NOT have a monthly bill and being able to roll my minutes over month to month is a good thing. If I were a very heavy texter or talker, then that would probably be different, but I am not so this plan works for me. This phone has a Wifi feature that allows you to go online anywhere WiFi is available and not burn through your minutes. I have used it, it works, It works well!  The battery life is much better than I expected it to be too. The battery has longevity. I like having a phone with the keyboard on the front. I would have settled for the LG500G however, that was double minutes for Life and Not triple minutes. Apparently there was a LG500 or 501C offered at one time on a home shopping show somewhere. I wish I would have known back then, but it's present day so foward I go. The keys on the Keyboard take a little getting used to, thus the 4 star rating. If you do not hit the space bar just right, you will get a period at the end of every word. It just takes some getting used to.The phone is also very light and does not take up a lot of space. I now reccomend this phone If it has those features which I mentioned that matter to you. I just wish now that they would come out with a hard rubber case for it. Someone told me that the Samsung Freeform III case will fit this. I ordered one elsewhere and it did not fit the phone, close, but no where close enough, just a tad bigger and the phone would have fit into it.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Randall J. Spychalla", "ReviewID": "R1KP78C5O42Y9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the phone for about 3 weeks and like it better than my previous phone the LG500G. This Samsung phone gets a signal just about anywhere. I can still get 2 bars where the LG500G would have none. I have a TopRam 32GB SDHC card in it that works fine and have it loaded with music and videos. A note on the Videos, they should be no larger than 320x240 and be at 25fps with MPEG-4 for the package and a bit rate not over 400kbs (I used DVDSoft FreeStudio). The WiFi works well, but I wish I could disable the browser button, because if I'm out of range of my WiFi ,it's too easy to hit the browser button and lose minutes. I was surprised that I could view Youtube videos. The browser is just OK, but at least it's more usable than most cheap phone browsers. The battery life is excellent, even with WiFi on. The audio does not allow bookmarking and has a slow fast forward, so podcasts are a pain to listen to on the phone if you have to stop it midway. The camera is OK, but nothing special. This is the best phone right now from Tracfone if you are into multi-media and live in a rural area that has poor reception.Things that could be improved:  1. Improved contact handling (I added Contacts to the quick menu to alleviate some of the problem.  2. Spacebar issue (pressing the just the left side of the spacebar keeps a period from being entered.  3. Bookmarks for music player.  4.

I've had it for almost 3 months now and I really like it. No it's not a full-featured smartphone, but for the price it was a great solution for me. With triple minutes, it costs me about $10 per month to operate and the phone is cheap enough that even if I lose it or break it, I can replace it for less than it would cost to repair the screen on many smartphones. This is my first experience with Tracfone and I'm very impressed. Setup was quick and easy. Their web interface is great. You login to Tracfone and you have one page with all the info on your phone. I like always being able to see my minutes on the phone display. I live and work in a low mobile coverage area, but this Tracfone gets a better signal than my old phone from a major carrier. I ended up getting 2 more Tracfones for my kids! They love them too. None of us are heavy phone users or heavy 'texters'. Here's some things I like about the phone:Wireless:Wireless works great. I can easily connect my phone to wireless at home, at work and even at many stores, restaurants, etc. At home my ssid (wireless network name) is hidden but the phone can still connect to it easily. The phone will always use wireless (and not the cel network) if you're connected to it. There's a little icon that goes from blue to green if you're connected to wireless so you always know. Just make sure that, if you're syncing to email, that you choose to never update automatically, or it will update when you're not connected to wireless and use your minutes. This is an easy setting to change.Wireless: what I use:The phone will run some Java-based apps (kind of) but does sometimes give you repeated messages when trying to use them. It's really not a phone for apps. It runs many mobile sites great. I use it to check the weather. It runs Facebook mobile perfectly. It also plays YouTube videos well. I watched some in high-quality and they even played well--almost never skipping.Email:I use Outlook through my company's Exchange server. One or our IT guys was able to plug in the necessary parameters into the phone in just a few minutes and I can get my Outlook/Exchange email messages, no problem. There is some support notes on how to do this on the Samsung support page for this phone. It's not what you would want to use all day long to read and reply to emails, but will work great in a pinch. I didn't have the best luck syncing Outlook calendar events automatically, but my phone is connected via bluetooth to my desktop computer and I can easily send important Outlook calendar dates to the phone using bluetooth (without any special software... as soon as you are connected to bluetooth, a \"send to bluetooth\" option appears in your Outlook, \"File\" menu) BTW, you can get a tiny USB-bluetooth adapter for you desktop computer very cheaply. I'm using a Targus brand and it works great.Camera:I was impressed with the quality of pictures on the camera--even indoors. It will let you easily email any picture you take using wireless. So you can even send a picture to your FaceBook account using a unique email address and it will appear as an update. I currently have a 2 GB card in my phone which seems like a lot of space. The camera of course can store pictures on your memory card. I haven't tried video yet.Music player:I love the music player! I download songs from Amazon, and the songs and album art come across no problem to the phone. Again, I transfer my songs to the phone, from my computer, via bluetooth.Recorder:I'm a musician, so I've even used the audio recorder to record a quick mp3 rendition of a song to email to band members. It's not high-quality, but it's a nice smaller file--great for recording lectures, etc.The only reason I gave this phone a 4-star and not a 5-star rating was that it has occasionally locked up on me. It gives a black screen with yellow \"DOS-like\" text. Only once every few weeks at most. ...and I really push this phone too. The last line of the message tells you what to do to re-boot. (which I think is ### - pressing # 3 times) Then it starts up again no problem, with all options and memory intact.Size:Yes the screen is smaller, but it works fine for me. Most text is white on a black background and clear and easy to read. Resolution is great. Display is bright and colors are vivid. Actually I like the small size of the phone. It's very thin and light. Some of these smartphones with cases can get huge! I like the way this phone neatly slides into my pocket. I have fairly large fingers and I can still use the buttons. I like the way the characters on the buttons light up. BTW: the problem people talk about with the space key producing a space and a period: It's really not a problem if you just get used to pressing the space key on the *left* side if you just want a space.Summary:So, if you're a mobile addict who needs a full-featured smart phone that runs all sorts of apps, this is probably not your phone. But if you mostly use it as a phone and for text messages, but would like to see facebook, check email or watch an occasional YouTube video, when wireless is available, and you're on a limited budget, I would recommend this phone.Update, 1-7-12:I've never experienced the phone \"pocket dialing.\" I keep it in my pocket all the time and I don't have a cover for it. I always lock the keypad when I'm not using it by pressing the lock (alt) key, but it's not really a problem to unlock it when I need to use it or when a call comes in.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great semi-smart phone", "Author": "scottydl", "ReviewID": "R1SGTBQUGIZHH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing substantially bad to say about this phone, after owning and using for a couple weeks.  True that's not much time yet, but I wanted to get this review up to balance out some of the other unfortunate (and seemingly isolated) wifi failures experienced by some other buyers.  I truly believe those buyers ended up with phones from a \"bad batch\" of some kind, possibly purchased from QVC or Home Shopping Network.I bought my S390G from this same seller (shopcelldeals), but from their ebay store rather than Amazon since the seller offered free shipping on ebay.  Hey, $5 is $5!  I love the combo pack that includes a 1-year of service with 400 minutes (=1200 with Triple Minutes).  This package is available here on Amazon too, although this review is attached to an ad that sells the phone only.  After activating and redeeming the card through Tracfone's website and adding in a bonus code (freely advertised on the Tracfone website at the time), I ended up with 1560 minutes good for 14 months - total cost for me was $99.99 ($7.14/month with an average of 111 minutes/month).  The phone was essentially free with that purchase, since Tracfone's website cost for just the 1-year, 400 minute refill alone is $99.99.PROS:- Nice design and features.  Sure they require a little \"getting used to\" but that's the case with any new phone.  Wifi was easy to set up and has worked flawlessly.  The browser is adequate but don't expect iPhone quality web surfing.  I highly recommend downloading the Opera Mini browser for free.- AMAZING battery life... it lasts days upon end (over a week) on standby.  With light usage, mine was recently off the charger 3-4 days, and still showed FULL battery life!  The battery still lasted a full day when wifi was on and constantly searching, which uses considerably more battery resources.- Effective screen lock capabilities... when activated, screen locks after 5 seconds.  Unlock takes 2 keystrokes of the two soft keys (within ~5 seconds or it locks again), so pocket dialing is unlikely.- \"Sneak peak\" text messages... if you don't click \"View\" right away when a text comes in, you can take a slightly longer route to the Inbox and see just a portion of the text message.  With short texts like \"Ok\" or \"Thanks\" (bad with a prepaid phone but people still send), you can see and delete them without opening the message and being charged.  Tracfone texts are really cheap anyway, but it's nice to avoid the charge when you can.- \"New PC Studio\" software is available from Samsung, and a nice program for transferring data to/from the phone and your computer.  I had no issues moving ringtones and photos back and forth.  PC Studio is similar in design to Blackberry Desktop.CONS (very minor):- Soft buttons cannot be reassigned, and menu icons cannot be moved around... BUT there is a customizable quick-reference shortcut list for quicker access to your favorites apps/options- Regular space bar press (middle of key) results in \"double tap\" period + space, must be hit on left or right side to space normally when typing a text message- Boxy QWERTY key setup is a little more difficult to type on than more curved Blackberry-inspired design(I expect all of those Cons to diminish as I continue to use the phone and get used to its design.)OTHER:- The 2mp camera is decent, but no flash and doesn't do too well with \"active\" shots... if the subject is moving, the photo will appear blurry.  I despise the overuse of cell phone cameras these days anyway, and maintain that you should USE AN ACTUAL CAMERA if you want quality photos.- I haven't used the music player yet, but I plan to.  I have a 16gb micro-SDHC card on order, and will put the phone into use as an mp3 player in the near future.This phone is not advertised as the latest and greatest, and buyers should not expect that.  I give it 5 Stars for what it is.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this product, if you want a semi-smart phone with nice features, fabulous battery life, and plan to primarily talk and text (with occasional data needs on wifi).I will update this review if my experiences change substantially with continued ownership.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has given me nothing but headaches so far!

When the phone is locked, pressing \"0\" three times and then confirming that you want to make an emergency call dials 911. What I do not understand is how in the world does the same thing keep happening time after time???? How is it that my pocket not only presses the zero three times, but also confirms that it wants to make the call? This, I think, is a MAJOR flaw of the phone itself because I have owned similar phones (from Nokia) and when they've locked, they've stayed locked.I have tried to put the phone in different positions, different pockets, but nothing has worked. Also, on at least two occasions, the phone opened its browser which used up some of my minutes while it was in my pocket. The only way to stop this robot dialing/button pressing bs is to turn the phone completely off, which I don't want to do as I want to be notified of incoming calls and messages.And the Wifi has not worked no matter what I have tried to do. I tried every suggested thing on the internet: from simple things like scrolling down and entering/saving the password to changing settings and so on, nothing has worked. I have even tried to connect to the open Wifi connection at my work, which my iPod Touch has no problem connecting to, but this phone just will not connect. It keeps giving me the same message: \"Disconnected\" and \"No Response from AP.\" I have searched those terms and have not found a solution to the problem. I think the problem is that Tracfone has disabled the Wifi feature so that they can have you using your minutes and paying them for it.On a few positive notes, I like the look of the phone and the screen has good resolution and looks sharp. I also like the simple menu layout and the menu controls. However, as others have noted, the buttons are really tiny and close to each other and do get some getting used to.So, even if I do try to get used to the tiny buttons and lack of Wifi, the pocket dialing is just insane and will probably land me in big trouble because it's illegal to keep calling 911 for non-emergency purposes. I think this phone is a huge failure as a phone, no matter how cheap it is.Also, the instruction manual supplied with the phone is very brief and does not explain all the features. I have used Tracfone service for many years and I do like that it saves me money, but this is cost cutting at its very worst and this failure of a phone is on its way back to where it came from.

So I took a chance and bought the phone but have had  a very frustrating experience with it.  The biggest concern is that if the phone is in your pocket or purse and getting bumped as your moving around the 0 gets bumped and if it gets bumped 3 times EVEN WHILE ITS \"LOCKED\" it calls 911 Emergency.  That happened to me less than 24 hours after activating the phone.  I looked it up online and sure enough there are lots and lots of people experiencing the same thing, some are even getting fines for calling 911 falsely too many times.  So I don't like that at all, not only is it a problem for me but I could be jamming the phone lines for those who actually need to call 911.  I've exhausted both going through the phone to try and turn off this feature or somehow disable it, I've called Samsung and Tracfone and nobody has been able to help.  The battery is also incredibly weak..about 6 hours...probably because its getting bumped around in my purse and thinking that its on when it shouldn't be.  You can only see one text at a time and it does put periods in your text all the time no matter how careful you try to be to push the spacebar just right.  So its just not worth it, I bought another Tracfone and I'm trying to get everything transferred but now Tracfone is giving me trouble on transferring all of my minutes even though they promised if I just bought a new phone they would credit me all of my remaining minutes.  Currently I have to somehow come up with another phone line to even call them from to resolve the current issue with my minutes.  Everytime I call Im talking to someone who really struggles with English and its just been incredibly frustrating trying to be understood.  I also emailed them describing my problem 3 days ago and they have yet to respond.  I'm wishing I would have gone with another prepaid company.

There are two ways - one by pressing the left softkey and the okay button, which are right next to each other and could easily be mashed together if the phone gets bumped in your pocket. The other way is by pressing 0 three times and then either the left softkey or the okay button, which dials 911.This is a major inconvenience for me, because I like to keep my phone in my pocket and I don't want it coming unlocked or dialing random numbers without me knowing.

Most on Amazon are for the Samsung S390 (note the missing G) and do NOT fit this S390G phone.  The leather ones seem to work fine, but the hard cases don't.The camera takes decent picks.

Imagine having the sheriff's office calling you back asking if you need emergency assistance.  Once, my two year old son was having a total meltdown in the car with me as my phone, which was in my bag on the passenger seat of the car, took it upon itself to make a 911 call.  The 911 operator heard that.  They called me back a few times and when I answered the call, they questioned me - while my son was still having a melt-down.  Try explaining that everything is fine to a 911 operator when they heard your child screaming in the background?!  And it's never the same number dialed, when I look on the call log.

She always kept her old phone in her bookbag to make calls on the bus to me here at the house...she got this.. and I'm here to tell you, she had the WiFi set up in like 3 minutes.  I just don't see how so many people are complaining about WiFi when my 10 year old had it done in no time.  Anyhow, she likes to text me while on the bus, even more so now with this phone with the keyboard...so, it was time for me to get a better phone..so I got me one of these phones as well.  Took less than 5 minutes to switch my number and remaining time from my old phone to this one using Tracfones website.  I set my WiFi up less than 5 minutes.  Like other have stated, the screen is a bit small for doing a lot of Web Browsing..but you can do it.  This phone loads and switches pages faster than any Tracfone I've had yet.  We usually update our phones yearly.Like at the beginning of my post said, my daughter keeps her phone in her book bag..that's with books being thrown in there with it, water bottles and so on.  She has NEVER had this phone dial 911 like other people are saying.

We are out in the country...but this phone has GREAT service!  Not a dropped call yet.  The phone has great volume.Haven't downloaded any music/ringtones to it yet..because I'm not for sure where to get free ringtones at??  Tracfone is wanting way too many minutes for a small ringtone file..has anyone found a place to download free ring tones? If so, comment and let me know.I did find a Jelly Silicone case for this phone.  If you'll do an Amazon search for Samsung R390...that's  the one.  I looked at pics here online and they looked just about the same..so took my chances and ordered it..was less than 3.60 and that included S&H.;  Got it in yesterday...it fits PERFECT!  Only downside is that the Camera is just a bit over on this phone...so the whole in the back of the case for the Camera didn't match up with the camera on this phone.  I don't use the camera much, so not a biggie for me..and when I need to, you can pull down the case and take a pic in one second.So...all in all, this is a great phone for the money.  When my phone came in the mail..I ordered it through the TF website...it came with a FREE 15.00 gift card for gas  AND and 10.00 gift card for \"lunch on us\"  got to choose between like 30 different restaurants..PLUS, When I activated it, they gave me 25 free minutes...so I ended up getting this phone for about 20 bucks.

Text messages appear as just a standard \"you have a message\".  My old LG displayed a caller ID if the person was in my phone book.

Just one push of the phone while it was supposedly locked was all it took to dial.  It made no sense for me to have the phone on me but off.

The screen is fairly low-res (for the cost and size, it's worth it), but it's still easy to read. The menus are straight-forward; you'd be able to figure out most of its functions without a manual (which is good, because they don't send you one).That being said, there are a number of small issue that can be a real problem. Added together, they're bad enough that I knocked two stars off what would have been a five-star review:1) When the phone locks, it's unlocked by pushing one soft key, then the other. It turns out that it's very easy for those buttons to get pressed in the correct order in a pocket. Twice in the first day I'd owned it, I pulled it out of my pocket to find the browser open. (And yes, I locked it before putting it in my pocket.) There's a phone password option, but it only prompts for the password when the phone turns on, not when it unlocks. Buying a belt holster is *mandatory* with this phone.2) The USB port (which is used for charging) is clunky. When you insert a cord, it feels like it's in before it's fully inserted- it hangs up on the inside of the port, feeling like it's bottomed out. This is especially true with the included charger- if the cord moves around and the screen doesn't light when you plug it in, it's not in all the way, and it's not charging.3) The space bar types two spaces when you press it. It appears to have two buttons under the keyboard piece, and each one registers separately. The problem is, the space bar is about the width of a thumb, so pushing just one side is a real pain. It becomes especially annoying because the autocorrect turns double spaces into new sentences (changing it to a period and a space, and capitalizing the next letter), so you end up using the backspace key a lot in text messages.4) This is the worst one. There's a glitch in the phone's internal operating system: If you set the dialing display font to anything larger than \"small\", it starts wrapping numbers to a second line if you manually dial a long enough number. However, once it skips down a line, it moves the text insertion point back a space, so that the numbers you're typing are inserted in the middle. I found this out when I went to test the phone on my home phone, and dialed a wrong number; by watching the screen, I saw what it was doing. It doesn't do this on the small font (though a typical phone number won't wrap down a line in this font, anyway), and it doesn't do this if you start with a one (must be the auto-hyphenation). If you live in an area with an area code overlay, thus meaning you always dial ten digits, you're stuck with small font for dialing; it can be difficult to read unless you hold the phone fairly close to your face.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "nouseforaname", "ReviewID": "RB44QQA9Q1759", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is quite nice and easy to use.

TracPhone!...hands down.  I researched Target, K-Mart, Rite Aide and Radio Shack.  All were the same price but none had a model with the features I wanted.  The difference was that only at Radio Shack could I find anyone who knew what the heck they were talking about.  My criteria for a phone included a camera (still and video), web access, full QUERTY keyboard, easy to use/program, voice commands, well built, all the other bells & whistles (WI-FI & Bluetooth, MP3, voice activated and easy APPS) and reasonably priced.  All, and more, were included with the Samsung S390G....plus it came with Lifetime Triple Minutes.  None of the mentioned stores had the model that would do all that.  The Samsung was listed at $50 everywhere online except on Amazon.  I got it for $32.  Then one must buy both 'minutes' and 'air time'....two different things.  The TracPhone web site had a special on both.  Combine the special and my 'triple minutes', I now have a years worth of air time and over 1400 minutes...all for less than $80.  The same type deal in a store was over $100.  Don't forget to purchase a large memory card.  I started with only 4G until I see if I need a larger one.

My wife and I now both have one.* The screen is nice and basic functions are fast.* Size, weight, and battery life are very good.* Wi-Fi enables browser use without using up minutes/units, but I don't know how one could stand using the web browser on this phone except in emergencies. One nice thing I do like about it is that I can now check the weather radar when I'm out, but I'd never use it for \"normal\" browsing.* No complaints about sound quality like with other Tracfones I've had.* I was able to transfer my phone number, minutes, and service days from my old Tracfone to the S390G using the Tracfone website.* Cheap: The cost for me with Tracfone comes out to less than $8/month on average, including all taxes, fees, and phone costs (all prepaid).Cons:* MAJOR: Minus 1.5 stars for not being able to change the right soft key from being the 'Browser'. It's too easy to accidentally press it and waste minutes. I worry about it accidentally getting pressed and the phone staying in the browser for a long period of time. My wife complains about this too. It's really unfortunate because otherwise I'd probably rate this phone 5 stars for what it is (a good voice & texting phone).* Too easy to press space bar and get the \". \" instead of just a space. I think it's too sensitive. If you have this problem, try quickly pressing the space bar on the side instead of the center. If you hold it down longer, it inserts a period then a space. This is suppose to be a time saver but I find it more annoying that anything else.* My phone seems to have turned off by itself at least two times. My wife, who has had this phone longer than I, said the same thing happened to her when she first got it, but it doesn't happen anymore. For now, I'll assume that this is some automated update process and that this behavior will stop (I'm fairly certain that it wasn't due a low battery condition). If this behavior doesn't stop, then I'll update this review.

If you're the type that likes to watch videos & movies on your fone, mp4 files play flawlessly (to my amazement. didn't think you would get such a phone from Tracfone).

Solid feel, nice keyboard, lots of features.But the very first evening I took it out of my pocket and it was asking \"Call SOS?\". Luckily(?) I had no service there, so it didn't complete the call. I looked online and it turned out that lots of people have this problem with the phone. Pressing \"911\" does it, even if the phone is locked. So does \"000\" and \"112\", thus covering their bases. The FCC apparently has a requirement that any idiot be able to pick the phone up off the road at the scene of an accident and make an emergency call even if the phone is locked, but the result for this phone is a disaster. It is not an exaggeration to say that EVERY time I put it in my pocket even briefly, it gets to the \"Call SOS Y/N\" stage or worse, I hear the 911 operator from my pocket. (Perhaps my pocket is very scary, so the phone calls 911?)  In desperation I started carrying it around in a plastic Chinese takeout container, which was safe but not very convenient. Then I accidentally ran over it with a car, and although the container was utterly destroyed, the phone had no apparent damage at all! Very solid!The 911 pocket dialing is the worst, but with the possible exception of the e-mail, everything else about the software is terrible also. Did the developers not try this thing out for even a day before they put it on the market? Here are a few of the other problems:1) Doesn't tell you who the text messages are from until you read them. So I have to click on them to see that they are spam. Worse, there doesn't seem to be any way to block text messages from spam numbers. They have slowed a bit now, but for a while I was getting 5 or 10 a day.2) The browser button is on the front screen, right where you can click it every time you unlock the screen. That way you can click it as you put it away, and it can suck down hundreds of minutes while in your pocket or purse. Some of the stuff on this phone is just stupid, but this \"bug\" is clearly malicious. My LG 800g did something similar. I can't say I ever tried out the browser, but if it's like the 800g's version it's completely useless - it's only purpose was to drain your minutes while you weren't watching.3) It occasionally forgets my contacts, and just shows the numbers.4) It plays music nicely over bluetooth, but then the phone crashes. After some messing around it would restart, but the battery would be totally dead. (When working properly, the battery life is actually very good, up to two weeks.)5) The calculator wants you to use the mini touch pad to select operations, thus rendering it useless.6) The mini-touchpad built into the center button is barely usable, and the scrolling software for it is abysmal. Trying to find a particular message in my inbox was impossible if there were more than a couple, so I had to empty it out all the time.7) Taking a picture requires several menus, button clicks, etc., so by the time you have it ready your subject is gone.8) Another stupid feature: pressing the center of the space bar gives you a space, period, and capital letter. Pressing one or the other sides gives you the normal space. Even once I figured this out, I still had to backspace dozens of times to clean it up when I hit the button wrong.9) A smaller annoyance, but the T9 touchpad doesn't show the associated letters (ABC = 1, etc.) They could easily have set it up so pushing the letters while dialing gave the proper numbers, but they didn't. So it's hard to dial a phone number given as letters.10) Rings when the battery gets low. This should be an adjustable option. I don't want to hear about it when I'm trying to sleep.11) How to dismiss the voicemail/missed calls/text message notification without checking them is not clear. They keep popping up when I'm trying to do something else.12) The on-screen labels for the buttons are lined up over the wrong ones. Until you figure it out, it looks like you're supposed to push the outer pair of buttons, but actually the labels refer to the more central pair.13) Even aside from the emergency dialing problem, the screen locking is inadequate. You can add a security code, but it only requests it on startup and a few other things like some multiple deletes. And of course you don't have to enter the security code for 911, or the screen unlock sequence.So this is the last TracFone for me, what awful phones.

It seemed like the pros (price, triple minutes) outweighed the cons (dud browser button) so I bought it. Now I'm looking for a different phone because of two critical design flaws in the S390G. First, the annoying browser button which if accidentally touched immediately launches the phone's very primitive (i.e. useless) web browser. It uses the cell connection for this service, thus taking up minutes until you manually turn it off. You can switch it to wifi connection mode if you need to use the browser, but the default for the button (which cannot be changed) is by cell mode. I learned to live with this but to my amazement even when the phone's keypad is locked the browser can *still* manage to launch itself - usually when in a pocket or bag, out of view. There seems to be a key combination that defeats the two-step button sequence of unlocking the keypad, and whenever that key (or keys) is pressed, presto! Minutes are eaten up until you notice it and tell it to stop. Worst of all, though, is that this phone will dial 911 (again, with the keypad LOCKED). It has unintentionally dialed 911 on several occasions; shortly thereafter, I get a call from a 911 dispatcher checking to see if it was a legitimate emergency call.

Looking into it, I have learned that it's because this phone was programmed to use the panic code 112 in addition to triple-0 and 911 - which is ridiculously easy to get mashed, even when the phone is in a case. People have reported this to both Samsung and Tracfone, who both fob it off as the other company's responsibility to fix - so it never gets addressed. This is something to be very aware of and the utter lack of concern on both companies' parts would be worth another half-star rating - if we could do halves. Which is a shame, because otherwise, this is a very nice phone. Especially for tracfone.What I like:The 3G and wifi connectivity, email access, the slightly more open java app access, and enough memory and processing power to run them without completely choking are a nice feature. Still more than 8 years out of date. But good to finally have the option with this service provider. It's yet another fixed keyboard form factor, but I think this is probably the optimal design for feature phones of this sort, so I'm a fan. Call quality is on the upper end for a tracfone, and battery life has, thusfar, been quite good. The hardware seems alright - again, outdated, but it feels solid, it's not too heavy, and isn't so narrow my hand cramps from holding it too long. And lifetime minute multipliers are always win (even if they do get you back on in-phone purchases - but why do that when you can just sideload whatever media you want?).Things I don't like so much:I'm not a fan of the punctuation key assigns. They just don't feel natural to me. Though I am willing to concede this is likely due to my having gotten used to the layout of my previous key-phone, and it may become more intuitive with more use. My biggest gripe in this area is the double-wide space key. While a good idea in theory, having it auto-insert a period if you don't tap the key in the middle (which happens often when I get on a roll) causes more hassle than it solves. The raised keys are particularly prone to pocket-dialing  - which has caused a fair number of users to get in trouble for repeated unintended calls to emergency services (as 911 always works, regardless of the keypad's lock status). So a case/holster is highly recommended.Several of the built-in apps are also less useful than their counterparts on the 500G. The note app is largely useless to me (100 character limits? In 2012? Really?). Though I was able to fix this with a third-party app. And while I do like the expanded utility of the Samsung's contacts list (individual rings and images - about time!) - having to re-enter all of them manually from my old phone was not a lot of fun (it cannot reliably interpret contact dumps in the LG format).One of the biggest (and, thusfar, seemingly unaddressed) gripes is the actual fee rate for 3G data access. Despite the default boilerplate in the instruction manual and all available references to the standard Edge network per-minute rates - 3G data on this phone is charged by the kb, and at a fairly high rate (an official fee schedule has yet, to my knowledge, been made available). If you're stuck on an Edge connection, it does seem to revert to the per-minute rate. But it's highly advisable that users install a third-party browser with data compression (Opera Mobile is the easiest to find), adjust MMS settings to auto-resize images, and disable (or severely cut down on the frequency of) social media and email polling to significantly cut down on unnecessary data charges.

In any event, I can say with FULL CONFIDENCE that my S390G easily pocket dials 911 with no user error whatsoever. If I lock my keypad, dial \"000,\" \"112,\" or \"110,\" a message will appear saying \"Dial SOS?\" The left soft key selects \"Yes\" and the right soft key selects \"No\".I repeat: THIS OCCURS EVEN WHEN THE KEYPAD IS LOCKED, and I am competent enough to know.I have resorted to carrying the phone in a bulky case with some extra stiff material protecting the keys.

Here's why.My phone before this was a Nokia Lumia 521 with T-Mobile. Before that I had an iPhone 3GS with AT&T.; Before that I had a Samsung T401G with Net 10, and before that about five LG 300G's with Net 10. All of them paying different prices, trying different services and features. I made a sudden leap into the Smartphone world with my iPhone, and upgraded from that to a Windows Phone. I'd never had a QWERTY Keypad phone before. I was satisfied with Net 10's service, but left after they raised the plan I was on by $5 without notifying me. AT&T; was awful in the coverage and price department, and T-Mobiles Data and Customer Service was unacceptable. I looked around for a while at Feature Phones, which is what this kind is called, and I decided I'd rather have a nice Feature Phone like an old Blackberry, oppose to a smartphone which I felt was a little more than I needed. All I need is occasional access to Facebook and Twitter and the ability to listen to music with good coverage, without the frills and emptying of my wallet. This phone is perfect.Allow me to list a few good points and bad points I've experienced so far.THE GOOD- WiFi, so I can send emails, browse the web and more, for free at Home or places like McDonalds and Starbucks which offer free WiFi.- QWERTY Keyboard, with Send and End buttons. It's a bit slower to use than a Touchscreen, but it just feels so much better.- Great Coverage, using both AT&T; and T-Mobile coverage, so that where one lacks, the other picks up.- 3G Data. A Huge step up from the 2G I was used to on other Tracfones.- Triple Minutes For Life. I cannot stress how great this is! I buy 60 Minutes at $20, I get 180 that last 3 months, Equaling $6/mo.- The Build Quality. It feels like a phone that costs more than $20! It doesn't feel fragile, and I'm not too afraid to break it.- It uses Micro USB for Charging and Syncing, which is great because that's what most of my cables around my house are.- MP3 Player, for listening to music on the go. I have to have this feature, and it works great and can play music in the background.- Micro SD Cards up to 32GB are supported, and they go in the side and not under the battery like some phones, so no taking off backs.- E Mail, which is super great to have. Make sure you set it up to not automatically search for mail though, as it uses your Minutes.- The Battery hold a charge for a very long time, often lasting me up to almost a week without charging. It rates at 1,000mAh.- This is minor, but you get 20 Free Minutes and Two Months of Airtime just for activating. I used it for a few days for free..- Each Minute lets you send Three Texts. If I do the 180 Min. Plan, 180 x 3 = 540 Texts.THE BAD- The Screen has awful viewing angles, and it doesn't support all colors, so some colorful wallpapers I set look distorted.- The Trackpad makes it a little difficult to navigate compared to Navigation Buttons, but you will get used to it.- The Rear speaker is certainly nothing to write home about, and is mediocre compared to some other Tracfones I've seen.THE UGLY- Although the glass screen looks nice, it makes it more likely to break when dropped and catches fingerprints (Which clean easily).- The Camera is Acceptable. It's Fix Focused, so you cant take up close shots without them being blurry. Takes otherwise good pics.- Tracfone doesn't give you much for the price. $10 for 30 Minutes and a month of Airtime? Good thing there's Triple Minutes.- YouTube Video's are extremely low quality, probably because the small amount of colors the screen supports.CONCLUSIONOf all the Phones I have owned so far, this is my favorite in overall price, quality and function. It says it has app support, but the only apps I've come across on the web that work properly with this phone so far are Facebook, Twhii (A Twitter Client) and YouTube, which is just a direct link to the YouTube site in the browser. I've read a lot of complaint's that people are dialing 911 or Opening the Browser with the phone in their pockets. I have pressed a button here or there, but never unlocked the phone or dialed 911. Then again, being a man, my pockets are much larger than women's jeans, so I'm not sure if any men out there are having this problem. I haven't yet. Personally for me, the buttons are all very clicky and provide nice feedback, so even if I did press a button in my pocket, it would be under some serious pressure and I would know. I don't think Tracfone offers many minutes for what you pay, probably because it is made for people that don't use a phone much. If this phone didn't have Triple Minutes I probably would not have bought it, even with all the fancy features.If you use your phone often and do a lot of texting and calling, definitely buy the Net 10 version of this phone. It will cost you $60 and can't be bought on Amazon. They give you more minutes for your money. However with the small amount I use and the Triple Minutes, my plan on Tracfone costs me only $6 a month.If you are considering getting this phone, definitely get it, buy it new for $20 on here and get a $5 2GB Micro SD card to get Free Super Saver Shipping. I think you will be satisfied. I know I am.Here's a link to the SD card you'll need to get super saver shipping:B000HCGAFKI Also had to order this thing for 21 Cents to get it over $24.99 (I have no idea what it is, I just threw it in a drawer:B009K50I3KThat's all folks,~Ritchie", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "As \"smart\" as a Tracfone gets; nice keyboard, but obnoxious in its flaws", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"robotech_master_01\"", "ReviewID": "R2DRWFG3PPQMRJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So, the thumb keyboard is nice to have for writing text messages. That's the biggest benefit of this phone. If you do a lot of texting but don't need the processing power of a smartphone, this might be a good choice for you--except for its tragic flaws.Although it looks kind of like a smartphone, it's really just an ordinary candy bar phone with a better keyboard, and the ability to hook to wifi so you don't burn your minutes browsing the web over its pitiful built-in browser. Note that although Gmail is on the bookmarks menu of the built-in browser, you can't actually load it. Install the mobile version of Opera, it works much better. And the mobile Facebook application you can get for this phone is surprisingly good--the only downloadable app I actually ended up using very much apart from Opera.That being said, the phone has a couple of major drawbacks. One, as many other reviews have noted, is the unfortunate tendency to butt-dial or pocket-dial 911 EVEN WHEN THE KEYS ARE LOCKED. If you punch 000 or 112 or perhaps some other keyboard combinations, even through lock, it will ask you if you want to dial 911. And if you then mash the enter key, it will dial it. I got called back by 911 a couple of times while this phone rode in my pocket. It's really embarrassing to be asked if you're under duress when you tell them it was an accident! And even turning it off isn't necessarily any protection--I've had this phone TURN ITSELF ON in my pocket before.The other big problem I noticed is minor by comparison, but still annoying. When you call a number that asks you to spell something out using the letters that are normally affixed to phone number buttons, there's no way to know how to do it--these buttons aren't labeled with the right letters. If there's some way to call up on the screen what letters correspond to what numbers, I don't know what it is.If you're going to text or email a lot, and plan to keep this phone somewhere OTHER than a pocket, this phone could be useful.

I bought it from amazon for the features and the price.  I read the reviews about it ghost dialing emergency and was worried about that but managed to find a way around it. there are several number combinations which will dial emergency on this phone (911, 112, 000) and possible others. so I found to prevent this you cannot carry this in a pocket with any other hard objects such as keys, pens, coins, wallets. basically I just designate one pocket for this phone and everything seems to be fine. I carry it around all day at work doing hotel maintenance. if you throw it in a purse with other hard objects it will probabally ghost dial when moved around, so you could maybe get around this by putting it in some kind of soft case lined with neoprene or foam padding and then throw it in a purse. if you wear tight jeans and put it in a pocket it may ghost dial.  the space bar does have a bit of a defect. there are two triggers under the space bar so that it will work if pushed on either end, the defect with this is that if you push too close to the center it sets off both triggers causing a double space which on this phone causes a period with a space, supposed to be convenient but is more of a pain actually. to get around this you can train yourself to push on just the end of the space or you can practice pushing it ever so slightly to get just one trigger to click, if you play with it you will notice the second trigger clicking if you press just a bit too hard. I don't have the skill to do this so I just leave a bunch of periods in my texts and look like a retard, oh well.  the buttons on this phone are small and close together, but this is my first blackberry type phone. my finger tips are wide so I easily press the wrong button, but with practice I find if I turn my thumb tips vertical its easier. the menus on this phone are inneficient, there is no single press button that takes you to your contacts like there was on my last lg flipfone. most of the ringtones are pretty lame, and most of the alert tones have a huge discrepancy in volume from the ringtones.  the wifi works okay, and I can use it to acces my mail through the browser, but I can't get the email sync to work on my phone to auto load my emails. which is funny because it was so easy  to do with my ipod touch, maybe the ipod sync is interfering with syncing this phone?  yes using the browser eats up minutes and tracfone sets up buttons that make it easy to accidentally do this, but I am used to it from my last lg tracfone which I had for two years and my Samsung net10 phone which I had before that. you just have to be mindful that there are buttons you can't ever touch unless you want to go browsing and use up minutes. you must train your brain and you will be fine. I haven't accidentally browsed in over a year.now for the good qualitiesthe phone is very attractive, it looks like a nice smartphone from the back and sides, the weight and texture of it feels like quality. the battery seems to have a fairly good time between chargings. I go about 6 days with light use. the call quality seems better than with my last phone (an lg fliphone) especially from cell to cell even when I don't have full bars.so in short this phone has many little problems, but on the upside it is cheap, handsome, has wifi, a full keyboard, triple minutes and many other features.UPdate: so I've been using this phone for about two weeks now or so, and I am noticing some major problems.first of all I tried reactivating my old lg phone with a new phone number for my dad to use. but in order to do this I had to call tracfone tech support. they told me the phone needed a new sim card because it had been deactivated, so they sent me a new one in the mail a few days alter for free. then i had to call back tech support to reactivate it with the new sim and this is when all the problems started. after being on the phone with them for over an hour and repeating my personal information several times and having to pay 20 dollar for minutes to reactivate the phone, they ended up switching my old phone number back to my old phone and deactivating my new phone. suffice it to say, this same s*** has been going on for two weeks now with multiple calls and hours to tracfone tech support. and things are still not as they should be yet. I don't know if they are even capable of getting things the way I want, all I know is I was with tracfone for two years and had no problem till tech support. tracfone works flawlessly as long as you just use the automated internet or direct phone options. its a piece of cake to activate a new phone and even port a number from net 10 and to even upgrade your phone all through the automated system, but once you call tracfone tech support you are basically screwed. because they don't seem to have a clue what they're doing, or it seems like their system is super complexed, it seems almost as if they are writing code while trying to fix my account.another thing, the phone seems to shut off while in my pocket, I guess from a button getting pressed or something. and then it won't let me turn it back on for several minutes.update..... so I've been using this phone for almost a month now, and yeah it seems to pretty much suck, the scroll button is a piece of crap, twitchy and jumpy. the phone seems to shut of completely about once a day when I travel around with it in my pocket...I think it has something to do with service dropouts or something and then it won't let me turn it back on for about three minutes. when i'm at work having to kneel doing hotel maintenance the buttons get easily pressed in my pocket and it unlocks itself and starts browsing about once a day.the call quality is still far superior on this phone as with other Samsung phones. talking to a person on an I-phone is no problem, clear and no digital distortion as with my last lg flip phone where I couldn't even understand a person on an I-phone. but because of the other problems with this phone im gonna have to get rid of it, I bought an lg 840g which seems lovely so far but I haven't activated it yet. fingers crossed.also I have figured out the secret to tracfone tech support. the main tech support people have no clue what they are doing and just give you a run around and act like they know what they are talking about and screw up your service and your account and will try to make you feel like you are the idiot and its all your fault. some of the supervisors know a little something and will screw up your phone and service a little less, maybe. the managers are the only ones who may know what they are doing and can get it done in any reasonable amount of time...say maybe a half an hour to an hour. the general technicians will transfer you to a supervisor if you request it. the supervisors will transfer you to a manager if you request it. the manager got the job done for me finally that previously took six calls and four new sim cards sent in the mail without success. the managers will probabally transfer you to another manager if you request it or maybe there is even someone about the managers, I don't know. if they are very busy you will have to wait a long time to get a transfer.  they were not busy at 10 am Hawaii time on Wednesday. therefor if you are getting a bunch of b.s. from a tech or super or manager and they are making you feel like you are stupid and they are talking a bunch of jargon that doesn't even apply to you immediately request to be transferred to someone higher up. and don't feel bad about being rude to them, but don't be too rude or they could cut you off. you might just get what you want.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Damn 911 calls - all the time", "Author": "Cuchman", "ReviewID": "R1HXIUJZ0SRBX5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cannot keep the phone in a pocket - which is amazingly inconvenient.

I will be doing a lot of comparisons to my previous Tracfone model, the LG 500G.Pros:-Triple minutes-Bigger keys than 500G-Wider screen than 500G-Supports microSD cards up to 32 gigs-MicroSD card not located under battery like the 500G-Cheap-Scratch-resistant back cover with nice textured feel to it-Lighter than the 500G-Faster and more responsive than 500G-Slightly better camera than 500G (2MP vs 1.3MP)Cons:-No improvements to music player. Actually it's worse in some ways. I will elaborate more below.-Not as easy to send text messages on. I will elaborate more on this as well-Still has the browser button on main screen that you can accidentally hit, thus burning through your minutes without realizing it-No improvement on battery life over 500G-Touch-sensitive middle button can take some getting used to-Takes longer to start up than 500G-No navigation buttons (up, down, left, right buttons)-No preloaded gamesI was most disappointed by the music player. It displays less songs than the 500G (3 compared to 6), and you can't use the volume button on the side of the phone to scroll up and down pages. You can use the middle button to scroll up and down, but if you slide your finger to the left or right it will exit the library and force you to start over again. It can be really irritating if you have a larger music collection like me.Also, when you text, each key will only register when you take your finger off of whatever key you are pressing. The 500G registered when you pushed the key down making texting faster. Also, if you happen to press two keys at the same time, it will input two of the second letter you pressed. It's kind of confusing to describe but it is really annoying because you constantly have to delete text if you type fast.I also suggest turning the grid menu style off. It is the default and can be quite difficult to navigate if you are not used to the touch-sensitive style of phones. (Menu -> Settings -> Display -> Menu style).Overall I am disappointed with this phone. The two features I use the most (music player and texting) are harder to use and have less functionality than my previous phone. I was hoping for some major improvements over the 500G and in some ways it is, but in other ways it is a step backwards. I am still waiting for that one perfect Tracfone but it doesn't look like any manufacturer wants to step up to the plate.8/12/13 edit: So I am marking this phone down a star. It seems to like to stop getting a cell phone signal whenever it wants. It requires me to restart the phone in order to get my signal back. In an emergency situation, this could be very dangerous. Also it causes me to miss calls completely, often for hours at a time because I don't realize it's happened until I look at my phone.

I've had the 390g for 2 months now, so I feel like I can share a pretty solid pro-con list for those looking to buy.Pros:- The keyboard is great.  Some review complain about issues with pocket dialing, etc.  I have had none.  I just hold down the \"lock\" key, stick it in my pocket, and go about my day with no worries.- The wifi is pretty easy to use.  I'll admit, I haven't used it a lot, but when I have, it's been pretty easy.

Easy to make calls, navigate the menu, take pics, and find whatever I need to on the phone.Cons:- The battery.  I work in an office with ZERO reception.  Even Verizon users have spotty reception.  My battery was dying after mild use form me and NO use at work... in about 36 hours!  I've started putting in in Airplane mode at work, which does give me a solid 5-ish days of battery... but I shouldn't have to do that, you know?- The sensitivity of the scroll button is a little hard to get used to.

We decided to get the S390G because of the 3 G capabilites.  Our family cell phone plan doesn't include 3G, but we don't have need of it most of the time anyway.  We all have smartphones, but our carrier allows purchase without dataplan so we just use wifi.  Anyway, that's why we decided on this Tracphone.  When we go on trips, this phone should allow us to do any browsing for information we may require.  It's pretty simple to get wifi running.  He loves the ability to watch youtube videos, and look up things using the wifi.  Also, if you download youtube videos to the mini sd card you can actually watch them on the phone (mp4).  To view them, he had to go to camera, and view, play and then it will say too large; but then hit the arrow play button and an 8 min video will play.  Ones that are more like 6 min do work without the error, but I have been able to load a few 1/2 hour sitcoms on that are on Youtube in part 1 2 and 3 segments onto his sd card for him to watch on the phone when there isn't wifi (with the error it just takes one more push of a button).You can download the OperaMini App into the Games & Apps to browse the web instead of using the built in browser (which is kind of clunky).  The Opera browser is much better.  So I'm sure there's a few other apps that would work also, but I believe they are all online java apps so they won't really work without the browser so unless I'm wrong about that we won't really use many apps with this phone.  And he doesn't have a use for FB or Twitter etc.  I'll have to do some more playing with more apps to see what can and can't be done.The phone does have a calendar, notes, calculator, and alarm.  But there's really not a way to sync the calendar with your computer as far as I can figure out.  I would imagine there's a google calendar app that may work on it's own with wifi connection...?My only complaints are:The browser connection is on the front screen, so you do have to be careful not to connect to the browser if you haven't connected to wifi yet.It would be real nice if the keyboard was a slide-out so that the actual screen size would be larger.Have to add contacts manually.For this price (less than $8.00 a month on the year plan on a triple minute deal), the benefits, and functionality are great.10/3/13 Have to add that Tracfone Customer service is wonderful.  Our son lost the phone, and we purchased another since they are under $20 to replace.  They moved the minutes, the plan time 1year, and the phone number to the new phone without hesitation. Not only once, but twice!  We activated in Jan 2013, and now have one year of service til June 2014 because of the lost time of not being able to use the phone because we spent 3 months looking the last time he lost one.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect, except for 911 calls", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Bullone\"", "ReviewID": "R2S8HZ11J1SWG4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like this phone a lot but there are changes that Samsung absolutely must make:  A.

Johnston", "ReviewID": "R3LRSWW0TQMS2F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The S390G is probably Tracfone's most advanced phone to date. It is only one of two Tracfones with 3G capabilities (the other is the Samsung S425G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)) and is the only Tracfone I know of with Wi-fi capabilities.  To be sure, only those people looking for any sort of data usage, such as web surfing, actually need these features, and Tracfone's data rates are not a good value for those who plan on a lot of 3G web-surfing. If your tastes lie with a cheap phone and you could care less about data, you probably don't need this phone, and if you want to stream YouTube videos and surf Facebook on the go you definitely need a different carrier. However, for those who just need occasional but speedy data access, this is one of the very few ways to get 3G data access for under $10 a month.I've been a Tracfone user for several years now and their phones have been, to put it politely, modest. This phone is not a true smartphone, but it is also not the \"dumbphones\" of Tracfone years past. It has decent connectivity options - Bluetooth and in addition to the aforementioned Wi-fi and 3G - and has a few other niceties like a microSD slot (I put a Sandisk 4GB in without trouble), voice activated dialing, a basic but functional camera, a mobile browser that does the job pretty well, and Java app capability that allows for a decent range of add-ons, including the Opera Mini web browser, Facebook, and an assortment of games. Tracfone's site actually sells a few nice games produced by designer Gameloft, including LEGO Batman, for about 50 minutes each. The interface is pretty easy to use, the touchpad and keyboard work well (including a spacebar that is actually two different buttons), and the OS seems to run pretty cleanly. Some have said the screen is too small for web browsing, but that is not my experience; it's Blackberry-sized and works well for the volume of mobile sites now out there.The phone is not perfect. Other reviewers, for example, have debated at length the phone's Wi-fi, with some insisting it doesn't work and others insisting the first lot is wrong. For me, the Wi-fi has proven somewhat temperamental, depending on the router. On my primary router, a Belkin, it at first it did not work at all, and after trying some of the suggestions online (including turning the phone and router off and waiting for a bit), I was able to get it running, although I'm not exactly sure what did it. Even now, though, it goes through bouts where it doesn't feel like connecting to that router. Conversely, I dug up an old Linksys router and that connects without trouble.  Likewise, when I'm out and about some wireless systems connect great and some won't connect at all.The Wi-fi is not a total disappointment - once it connects for me it runs smoothly - but it certainly isn't as flawless as it should be. Assuming you can get it running (be sure to scroll down to the password), the Wi-fi provides a way to play around with the phone without burning up minutes in the process.A couple of side notes about accessories. One, many have lamented the fact that there aren't very many options out there beyond the leather clip/pouch variety, which aren't terribly stylish or compact. After searching a while online, it does seem like this phone is of the same dimensions and design as the Samsung Cha@t 527 (S5270), and it actually has a few silicone and gel skins online, so that may be an option for those who want them. Two, there are car chargers out there but this phone has a micro USB port and will charge on a computer or, on newer stereos and cars, a car USB port.As I said at the outset, this isn't for everyone, but it has its niche. I'm a phone user that mostly has one for emergencies, but there are also those times when I am at a store and need to compare a price on Amazon or I need to find a nearby restaurant. This phone fits that bill perfectly.  Some Amazon and eBay retailers are also selling the phone with a year of service for at or even less than a year card alone, which makes this essentially a free upgrade for existing Tracfone users.

My replacement arrived quickly and I sent back the defective phone.My replacement phone works great.  I love how slim it feels.  I like the keys and find it much easier to text with than the LG800G I had before. THe LG800G was dying and no longer covered by Tracfone so I needed a new phone.WiFi works great.

I have to scroll through to put them back in the order I need.  Odd glitch that only happens with certain number combinations.

My first TracFone was a nearly indestructible Motorola V170 flip phone.  That phone had free incoming text which was really nice and I had bought a lifetime double minute card for it.  I wore out my belt holsters for it, some in as little as a day and eventually started keeping it in my pocket uncased.  I started with it in my hip pocket and broke the antenna off (a little nubby antenna) in a couple of days.  Replaced the antenna and moved the phone to my front pocket where it lived for many many years only getting slight scratches on the outside from my keys.  When it started falling apart, I could only find one like it for over $100 on eBay and I had only spent around $30 new at Wal Mart on it to begin with.  The battery didn't quit on me until after five years.  (I kept it turned off except when I was using it or expecting a call.  Once it started falling apart, it took about a year for the screen quit working, but I could still charge it and make calls with it.  Then it started being hard to turn on.  So began my search for a new TracFone because I liked the TracFone system and the phone was so well made.I finally picked the S390G because of the free triple minutes for life and the WiFi.  I read all the reviews at the time and decided I could probably live with it even if I didn't like it much.  After about 11 months the \"mouse button\" or \"trac pad\" quit letting me scroll or move about on the screen with it.  It still worked as a button when you pressed it, but wasn't much use if you couldn't scroll to what you needed to press on.  Then a couple weeks later it would sometimes charge and sometimes not.  I thought maybe it was just the battery wearing out so I bought a new one at Batteries Plus for $40 (twice the price of a new phone with a new battery) and found out it wasn't the battery.  I returned the battery.......So began my search for a third TracFone.  There was only one other model with WiFi besides the S390G.  I decided I didn't want to try the other TracFone with WiFi and I liked the S390G well enough to go ahead and get another one.Now for the pros and cons of the S390G based on owning one for a year and a 2nd one for a week:Pros:WiFi - the WiFi on the first phone would connect to some sources and not connect to others.  I have converted several Linksys and Cisco/Linksys wireless routers to repeaters running on dd-wrt firmware, so I know what I am doing in this area.  The WiFi would not work with my home router or repeater.  All my computers and my Wii system will work on my home router and my repeater.  Even my broadband home phone would work over the repeater.  The S390G would connect to an out of town library I used to go to a lot every time I tried.  All other sources would either not connect at all, or would connect and disconnect right away.  So aside from getting a few games while connected at that library, the WiFi was pretty much useless on my first S390G.  The new S390G connected to my home system right from the box and I have tried it on one other WiFi source so far and it worked there where my first S390G would not.Voice Recorder - You can voice record on this phone and then save as a voice message, ring tone, or alarm tone.Alarms - You can set multiple alarms on this phone.  You can set each one for different days or activate them for one day only.  You can set a different sound for each alarm.  You can record a message and set it to an alarm to play the message when you want the message as a reminder.Cons:Apps - about 99% of the apps will not run on it.  And if your app requires an internet connection, you will be charged for internet usage unless you are connected to a WiFi source.  I finally went through all the reviews of this phone looking for app sources.  I eventually found out that your apps have to be java apps that are jar/jad compatable AND I only found one web site with free java jar/jad compatable games that were worth keeping on the phone.  So far I have been unable to find that site for the new phone and will have to go back through all the reviews so I can find it and get some games for this phone.  BTW, when you are using WiFi and you lose the connection, you have about 1 second to get the browser closed or the 3G connection will kick in and you will start being charged minutes.Internet browser hot key - My phone never had a problem pocket dialing 911.  However, the power but got pressed in my pocket a lot and the internet browser hot key got pressed a lot too.  Most of my minutes were stolen through this flaw on this phone.  I could not find a hard case anywhere to use with this phone.  I eventually got a nice soft case made by Golla that had a side zipper pouch and a velcro flap that had a padded pouch and a non padded pouch under the flap.  The phone fit in the padded pouch very nicely, but would still turn on and off in my pocket and would still connect to the 3G in my pocket because of the browser hot key.  There is no way to disable this hot key or to make it open a different browser.  I eventually started taking my battery out when not in use and putting the phone in the padded pouch and the battery in the unpadded pouch.  Now with the new phone I keep the extra battery charged and in the zipper pouch as an extra in case the other one goes dead about the time I really need to make or receive a call.Small keys - I used to text a lot with my old flip phone.  I rarely text any more with this phone.  Even after using it a year, it is just plain hard to text on and my fingers are not even all that large.Conclusion:I liked the phone well enough to buy it again, but I doubt many people would be willing to remove the battery when not in use.  I did buy a nice gel case with the new phone.  It was a gel case made for this model and fits nicely and now I just leave the back battery cover off the phone and the gel case holds the battery in place when I am using the phone.  I just take the lower have of the gel case off to remove the battery and then put the gel case back in place to keep dust out.  The gel case makes for a slightly tight fit in the soft case, but it works.  Be sure to read other reviews of this phone and decide if this is the phone for you.....or not.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad keyboard, really loud vibrate", "Author": "Brett Foster", "ReviewID": "R227L7A5UU6S3S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a little biased, because I really don't like the way the menus work on Tracfones.  The LG 840 is the only one I've used that has an improved interface that is actually pretty easy to use.  Anyway...This is a decent-looking phone that doesn't scream Tracfone as much as the average little flip-phone does.  But that's about the only good thing I can say about it.I ordered this phone because the Blackberry-like keyboard really appealed to me.  But trying to use the keyboard is nothing like a Blackberry.  It doesn't have the ridges on the keys that make a Blackberry easy to type on.  And the space bar is really strange.  It always adds a period and a space unless you press the left edge of the space bar, and that's difficult because the space bar is pretty small.The LG 540 is a Tracfone with a much more Blackberry-like keyboard, but it's more expensive.Instead of a 4-way directional button to navigate through the menus, it has a cute little track pad sensor.  It works pretty well, but when you go to press the button down to make a selection your thumb often moves enough to change what you had selected.  So the menus are a bit tricky.I expect a cheap LCD display from any Tracfone, but this one has an exceptionally bad viewing angle.  The whole screen is very washed out and bad-looking from the side.  It's not a big deal, but if you see the phone sitting on a table or something, the cheap screen really screams at you that it's a cheap throw-away phone.  Which is a shame, because otherwise it's about the classiest-looking Tracfone I've seen.If you turn the volume all the way down, it goes to its Silent profile, which vibrates.  And when this phone vibrates, it is LOUD.  If you work in an office, it'll sound like you just fired up a Dremel Tool at your desk.  So if you want it to be silent, you have to go into Sound Settings, and set all three Call/Message/Phone notifications from Vibrate to Mute.

After 3 months I began having problems using the wi-fi.  I kept seeing that the \"maximum number of connections has been reached, delete some.\"  This was easier said than done.  The long and short of it is that it was impossible to delete previous wi-fi connections.  This meant that the wi-fi was totally unusable on this phone.  I called up Tracfone Support and spent over an hour on the phone, first with a technician, and then with a Customer service manager.  Eventually they agreed to send me a new phone.  It will be interesting to see whether or not the new phone is better/worse/the same as the old one.  After doing some research on the internet about this problem, it seems I am definitely not alone.  There is even a video posted on youtube describing the serious problem with the wi-fi.  I would caution anyone about purchasing this phone.  It appears to be a good phone, but unless you love to spend hours on 1-800 support lines, you might be very disappointed. I have told Samsung Support about this, and they washed their hands of it, even though it appears to me, that they marketed a defective phone.  I want to applaud Tracfone support for taking the time, making the effort, and then doing what was right in order to resolve this problem for me. One other thing I just remembered:  The battery life on this phone is very short.  I found myself charging it every other day, and sometimes everyday, which became quite irritating.  On top of that, there were a few times where the phone was fully charged at night, and the battery was dead in the morning.....not what I would expect from a quality phone.  Just thought I would add an update.  After receiving a replacement phone from Tracfone, I have not had any issues with the battery.  The wi-fi seems to be working ok as well.  I've been using the replacement S390g for about 3 months, and can only assume that I received a bad phone when I purchased it from shopcelldeals.

I did every step and then some that Tracfone had me go through [again & again.............]. So if you have ever dealt with what passes for tech support with Tracfone. So my situation is i am my elderly mothers caregiver and i do not have time to jump through Tracfones hoops so i just got another one and it works fine. What i like about this phone is the wi-fi works and it gets decent battery life and it gets better reception than any other phone i have owned and since i live in the middle of nowhere where most phones do not work well if they work at all so if i were rating it on reception alone it would be a 5. So here is the bad first off this phone has an optical puck / button for navigation that can be a little hard to control and the buttons could be better, but i have large hands & fingers. the phone has a weak speaker , but the headphone jack gives clear sound and while the mp3 player works and is far better than some other phones i have had and has a bad quirk in that if you are browsing songs and open a folder or album that has only 1 song if you dont back out quick it automatically plays it which when you are just trying to browse and or build playlists can be quite a pain and if you put it in your pocket before the screen locks the optical puck is going to crank the sound. I have not had any problems with phantom dialing like some people have reported as it has been my experience that when the screen locks it in fact stays locked until you unlock it. Only one otjher thing i dislike about the phone is when it is switched on it has to  scan the 32gb sdhc class4 card and until it takes 1-2 min to do that [because i have it 3/4 full] it will do nothing else and as i have not gotten a class10 to use with it yet i do not know how much faster the process can go.

Another thing that annoys me is the lack of options to change the browser 'soft key' on the main screen.

Luckily I can hit the 'end' key quick enough that I don't get charged.All of those things I can deal with, but the pocket dialing of the SOS or 911 number is just plain wrong. There should at least be an option to turn this 'feature' off. Even with the keypad locked, if you hit 0 several times it will ask if you want to dial SOS.

In that months time, this phone has cost me a $1000 fine, loss of friends and I have been put on several \"blocked lists\" from my contacts stored in the phone. Now for the explanation of all this...This phone will auto dial \"Emergency Services\". No joke. Even with the screen/keypad lock activated. Just recently it was placed on my kitchen table, no one around it and it called 911. I couldn't believe it. When I received that callback from 911, I was informed that they had received ANOTHER call from this #. When I explained what had happened I was informed to contact Samsung and possibly get a replacement phone. Oh and I was issued a $1000 fine for misuse of 911 services. Nice. Now, I stressed the word \"ANOTHER\". This phone calls 911 around 2 times a day, all by itself. It will auto dial people in your contacts list. It has called 99% of everyone in my list and if that person does not answer...the phone will ring back to you, making you think that you are receiving a call from someone when in reality the phone is doing a call back which means that when you answer the phone, you hear a ringing as if you are calling that person. They are not on the line. Oh and most of the time this will happen when the phone is not on your person or in your pocket. OMFG. My contacts have \"Blacklisted\" me because of this. And of course, the keypad and screen are always LOCKED. Many of my contacts have requested that I remove them from my contacts list. Which sucks. Then again I don't blame them. Oh and this is a Tracphone. Which means that every-time the phone chooses to auto dial, I lose minutes. Thankfully when I reach 0 min I will stomp this phone into a million little pieces.Now for the phone itself. If you think this phone will make a good QUERTY phone for texting, think again. You cannot adjust the auto text feature in it. It will input words for you that it thinks you mean with absolutely no way of correcting it. On the main screen there is a \"Browser\" word meaning if you push a certain button the internet will start. OMG another way that you will lose minutes quickly. That button for Browser is next to the \"end call\" button. Therefore every time you hang up a call, 9 times out of 10 you will activate the browser. And not even realize it. Bye Bye minutes.I honestly wish I could say something positive about this cellphone. Wait, I think I may have one. Its slim and easy to hold.

It was good for calls, not much of anything else, although it did have a basic camera.Then I run upon this S390G I first saw at the Dollar General Store(for $40), so I went looking, and wow, Amazon had it on TRACFONE and for $19.99.  What sweetens the deal on this phone is that it gets triple minutes when you add a refill, so basically, I got 360 minutes for $28 (slightly better than AT&T;'s 10 cent/minute), but get this, my expiration date is 12/23/13.the phone had 20 minutes on after I activated it ending in 60 days.  adding the refill extended the airtime expiration ANOTHER 90 days, so my airtime lasts 5 months (150 days)--versus AT&T;'s 90 days, and net10's $30 for 300mins/30 days).  I just use this phone for emergencies and talk while not at home--infrequent.  I love the value in the plan and cost of the phone.Yeah, the phone has a few quirks, but you get used to them.  the space bar/period is annoying, until you push it on the left end.

I have straight talk and after 3+ yrs my phone was just not getting a good signal anymore so I thought I'd give this phone a shot. I have to say I really am not crazy for this phone. I was looking for a simple phone. I'm not really into the high tech phones. I am just wanting a simple phone that makes calls and texts. Using the web on my phone isn't a big deal but being able to from time to time is ok. The more I use this phone there are things I like but some things I hate. One big pet pev is that everytime you get a text is the stupid phone shows you how much its deducting from your minutes. It drives me nuts! I do not want to see every deduction of my minutes everytime I use the phone. There is a feature in it that shows that so I can go there to see it if I choose. I think it should not show that until you get to 100 or less minutes on your phone. There is no way to shut it off from showing it. I have looked and looked. Not crazy about the texting either. When I write a text and go to send I type in the persons name and it will not let me send it that way. I have to go in and find them in contacts to add them and then it will send. It's just kinda dumb that I can't type their name and send. These little things drive me nuts. If I could have tried this first I would have not kept this phone. There are better phones. I guess I will have to learn to like it for now because I am not buying another one. I'll deal with it for another 2 or 3 yrs and I will upgrade again. But other than those things, it's not a bad phone. The sound is good and it does have some nice features.

If you use it traveling and do not DELETE your hotspot configurations WHILE STILL CONNECTED - you will never be able to delete them and you will eventually reach your limit.  Disconnecting is not good enough - they need to be DELETED.When you reach the limit of 11, the phone will not connect to any more wifi hotspots.

This phone has been repeatedly calling international emergency numbers (000, 112, etc) while in my pocket.  Apparently these cell phones are designed to allow all universal emergency numbers to be dialed by the keypad even when they are locked.  Only if they are completely shut off (tedius to do), the battery out, or the keypad covered in some way (a flip phone) will that not happen when in a pocket.  Last night it did this repeatedly and the sheriff's office called to make sure everything was o.k.  It looks like another law enforcement person also called later in the evening to confirm everything was fine.  I won't be using this phone again until I can get a slip-on hard case to prevent that.  I need to knock off more stars for this reason until it can be resolved.  It's too bad there isn't a slide-down cover or something on it.Original Review:  Wifi that does work, though with limited use on such a small screen.  Good connectivity with a computer.  Good sound, though for music playback it only supports MP3.  WAV, AIFF, FLAC, and OGG support would be nice.  Full keypad.  Micro SD card has its own little slot instead of being behind the battery.  Uses the same adapters as the LG 800G.  Menu is a little clunky and the center cursor control is a overly sensitive, but there are some shortcuts on the keypad I think I just need to get used to.  I have a minor issue where it seems the space key adds periods when I'm texting, but I'm not sure if that's a physical defect, intentional in the software, or a glitch.  It only happens when texting.  Otherwise I'm very happy with this phone.  If things change, I'll edit this.

I also enjoy of how the Micro SD inserts at the side so then you don't have to take out the battery for it. Then for the music part you can just hit end to bring you to the main screen where the lg500 made you take the long way in order to have it keep playing. The only items I don't enjoy about it is that withing the first week I had it \"butt dial\" twice. Once to 911. Another item I don't enjoy is that it don't come with any games, but it's worth those for all the other features. Another item that's a downer, but easy to fix is that during your text input if you hit two separate buttons too close to each other it repeats the second one hit, or with the space bar key it can respond in two different sides so if you try to hit the center then it will hit both sides and give it a . as well as the space. again in two matters, one you can put a different entry manner like an auto correct, and two the good outweigh the bad quite a bit.

We my daugher and I both really like the phone. I had been using the most basic phone tracphone users can use, I liked it just fine but my daughters keep texting me and it was a pain to text them back on my old phone. This new phone has made texting much faster.Here is what we like and why:The key board is really easy to use. I have read the reviews about the period being a problem when using the space bar, but if you play around with it you will figure out where to touch the bar so it doesn't do that, on mine if you push to the center/left you never have that problem.The silent mode is really silent, no vibrating unless you put it on vibrate.Better reception then our old phones.I usually have trouble remembering all the \"shortcuts\" you can use to make navigating faster on electronic items, but I've been pleasantly surprised at how easy it has been to figure out and remember the shortcuts on the keyboard. If you go to the tracfone site they have a really easy to follow manual, but the phone is cheaper at Amazon.I've never had a camera on a phone before, also really easy to use. It also has a camcorder feature but I haven't use it yet.I like the calendar, you can actually add events.It has a tasks feature for all those things you need to do.It also has a memo feature, it is okay for quick notes but it doesn't have much space so be brief.You can browse on line but you may only want to do that through your wi-fi connect on the menu where there is free wireless to connect to, otherwise it will cost you and browsing can get pricey. You will know if you are browsing on the wireless if your signal indicator on your screen turns green. If it is blue you will be using your minutes/units. You can also download things from the web. I found some fun free screen savers for the holidays and downloaded them with no problems. I know there are some of you rolling your eyes, but since I haven't had a phone that would do that before I think this is pretty cool.The screen isn't a touch screen but the middle button is a scroll button, which makes it much easier to move around. Although sometimes it can be difficult to get it to stop where you want it, on the first try.Really the only thing I haven't liked about the phone is the browser button. I don't like that you can hit the browser by accident and be connected before you realize you are using your minutes. I try to remember to turn off the wi-fi unless I want to have internet access, but sometimes forget.If you want a really good review find the teenagers, her review is really the one to see.I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants some fun,useful and easy to use features on their phone.I would not recommend this phone if what you are interested in is a smart phone.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "First time TracFone User", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "RI7XN35O2JZBI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from ebay as a backup phone for my car. The phone had minutes and days left already and it was previously registered to someone else so I had to contact customer service to get the phone number changed. You can read about that below.The first thing I did when I received the phone, was setup the wifi. It was super easy to turn on the wifi, and then connect to my network right after putting in my password. IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO A NETWORK AFTER IT IS TURNED ON. You must click on the network you would like to connect to. The wifi symbol should turn from blue to green when connected to a network. I read on a different site that someone was having problems deleting a network? If you changed the password or something, all you need to do is go to options (left button) for that network you would like to delete, and press delete. And then you can reconnect to it after putting in the password again.The browser (right button) key does get pressed accidentally sometimes when I'm looking at my phone, but there is a slight delay where you are able to exit out of it before you start getting charged for minutes. Also, the browser is quite limited. When you enter an URL, it does not automatically open the mobile site, so you have to know the mobile url before you try to go to it. Or it will most likely say that it is too big and fails to open.Someone mentioned that it was dialing 911 even when the phone was locked? I tried testing that out by pressing a bunch of keys when my phone was locked, and after about 9 times the screen says \"Keypad is locked. Press unlock.\" the screen asks you if you want to call SOS, which you can click cancel.The button you navigate with is sort of sensitive, I'm usually overscrolling with it so it may just take some time getting used to. And the regular buttons are quite small but manageable. I find it easier to type with my thumb nails than instead of my fingertips like you would do with a smart phone.For receiving texts, you can see the first 6 characters of a text without having to open it, so if you are sending a yes/no type of question, you can save yourself from opening a text. Just press cancel when it first comes in, and then go to your messages.The camera is not that bad, I just wish there were a faster way to access it besides going to menu>tools>camera.I haven't purchased anything on the phone yet, but I think it is neat that you can use minutes for it instead of having to put in a credit card or something else.I actually really like the size and feel of the phone. It does not feel like it would break if it were dropped accidentally.-----------------------------------------------------------------------I think I got lucky with my experience with their customer service. When I first called after I received my phone, they had said that they were not able to change my phone number without the previous owner's name/email/bday/zip code, so I tried to get that information, but it failed. So I contacted TracFone through their site stating my problem, and the following morning they called my phone. And they asked if I had a different number to be contacted at so that it wouldn't be using minutes. I gave them my cell number and they called me immediately after I hung up with them. I was on the phone with them for about 15 minutes and then they said that they would send me a new sim card.The sim card I received in about 2 or 3 business days, when they had said 3-5 or at most 7 days. I could not get a new phone number online, I had to call their customer support line. The wait was 7-10 minutes, but they did that thing where you can choose them to call you back when it is your turn in line, which is nice.From when they called me back, it took approximately 6 minutes to activate my new sim card and get the phone working with the new phone number.All of the representatives that I spoke with were all extremely friendly, although they did seem to all have slight accents like they were not from here as people complained.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dont Do it!!!", "Author": "imamom", "ReviewID": "RJKO6U4J71RR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't do it.

I have had more texts  that have not gone through, than with any of the LG phones I've had in the past, and STILL get charged minutes for them.  I've had several occasions where I've had calls fail in places that are definitely in coverage areas.  The only quick way to make a call is to dial the number. Using the contact list or speed dial list takes several steps.  Even to use the voice command, you have to get to that menu pick first. As with ALL tracfones, they have placed the browser button in a position that will have you logging into the browser unintentionally and if you don't notice that you've done it (like if you toss it in your purse and the browser goes on), the minutes just tick away until you realize and shut it off.

I hadn't had this option before with my old LG phone, and it's really nice to have these notifications delivered.The Blackberry-like touch-slider is fine, if a little twitchy. [actually, it's worse than that... see below.]Text and voice operation are all intuitive enough.Contrary to what some have reported, I've never had any issues with accidentally dialing 911, I have to assume Samsung's fixed that now.the wi-fi is handy, saves me minutes when I'm home.Now the bad:The mp3 player. I swear, I really wonder if the firmware designers have ever actually listened to audio when they design this stuff--my old LG was pretty terrible, and this one, while a bit better organized, has teeny-tiny control icons (RW, Play, FF) that are very easy to slip past when you used the slider control, and unfortunately that's the only way to get to it. Also, there's STILL no way to bookmark your place on a long podcast, and it tends to forget where you are if you stop the audio and come back. This is tolerable at best.Apps. I'm having trouble getting any PC to recognize the internal memory, so I haven't been able to copy .jar files to the phone. I guess I'll figure that out one day, and I'm not dying to have a whole lot of crummy little mobile apps aboard, but Facebook would be nice.

The truth is, that cannot happen because the phone's operating system will not connect to a PC either by USB or Bluetooth.  I am a computer engineer and tried several different things in both Windows XP and Win-7.  \"PC Studio\" resolutely refused to acknowledge the phone was connected.  But I was able to connect to the 32G micro-SD card via USB as though it was connected to a card reader.  That saves having to removed it from the phone and connect directly to a card reader.  But without \"PC Studio\", I would have to enter 100 contacts and other data, ONE. LETTER. AT. A. TIME.  That isn't going to happen!  I was also hoping to add my own alarm tones as opposed to spending minutes to get some from Tracfone.  Without PC Studio, that function doesn't work either.The second most disappointing:  I was hoping to replace my Apple iPOD functions with the mp3 reader in the phone.  But the functions of the phone's mp3 player are so limited and controls so intractable that, after about a week's experimenting, I decided that really was not a good option.  iPOD is much better.The third thing disappointing:  Right after buying the phone for $30 and spending another $30 for a 32G microSD card which won't get much use (see above), the phone was selling for $21.  Bad timing I guess.On the positive side:  The 390 does have triple minutes,  the alarms are handy and work well,  the calendar is pretty good, and the calculator is minimal but okay.  And it's nice to be able to connect to GSM 2g & 3g.Conclusion:  I bought this particular phone mainly because my view of Samsung quality in products was A++.  Now I have revised that to maybe B+.

No. The way it works doesn't allow for hands free. I promise.If you don't mind having a phone that's constantly trying to call 911, this is a more than decent qwerty Tracfone.

However, I'm going to just mention one characteristic that, I'm sure, was designed to be a feature. But, in my opinion, it is a bug that makes the phone unusable. When the keypad is locked, random button presses can cause the phone to connect to 911. The digits \"9\" \"1\" \"1\" don't even have to be pressed in order. If the phone is in your purse or pocket, and buttons are pressed, the phone assumes you're an idiot/disabled and aren't able to dial the correct digits - so it assumes the worst and connects you to emergency services.Imagine my surprise when the cops showed up at my house after I'd only owned the phone two days. I checked my outgoing call log and discovered that I had unknowingly dialed 911 twice in the last hour. I live in a small town and had a compressor running. The cops got a general location and then looked for a house with construction going on.I've contacted Tracfone about this and they say it is a safety feature that cannot be disabled. I always carry my phone in a thigh pocket with nothing else in the pocket. They recommended getting a case/sleeve for it. So, I bought a pretty heavy duty case to keep it in while it's in my loose, front, thigh pocket. I've still had two random pocket dials of 911 this month. I'm not sure if I'm relieved the cops are ignoring my emergency calls now or not. I should be happy they're not fining me for misuse of the 911 system. But, if I ever have to dial 911 and can't talk to the operator, I know I'm on my own.Bottom line, I can't believe the FCC allows manufacturers to sell phones that misuse the 911 system. How many 911 services are getting bogus calls thanks to Samsung? Why is this \"feature\" even needed? The keypad is easy to unlock with two specific key presses in sequence. And, it doesn't require a password. If a stranger picks up my phone, needing to dial 911 when the keypad is locked, all they would have to do (without this feature) is press the two keys in sequence, that the phone prompts you for, before dialing 911. I've had lots of cell phones from other manufacturers that don't have this \"feature\"; so, it's definitely a Samsung thing.Fix this Samsung!", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone but it keeps calling 911", "Author": "Hip Chick", "ReviewID": "R2E7S9XANROIRP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son for Christmas.

This phone is much more work. The young lady above shooed it off, but I strongly disagree. The keys are tiny and easily are double clicked, especially if you nearly miss. Double clicking the space bar makes a period automatically appear. Couple that with accidental double clicks and you will think the period shows up whenever you hit the space bar.The remedy here is to diligently learn to type on your new phone. Its a pain, but for everything you get, its worth it.Speed. This phone is slow, once you test it. Fill a card with 32g of music and you will wait to load and search.

I took different videos and reformatted them using format factory and came to once conclusion: this phone is not for playing video. Its ok, its a $40 phone!

I was already a fan of South Korea but this phone really goes the extra mile. I'm not going to waste your time comparing this phone to an iphone ... for 2 reasons ... first and foremost, I've never owned an iphone LOL and 2nd this is a TRACFONE cell phone, not an android phone. My favorite thing about this phone has got to be the wonderful keyboard. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT, and I also love the wifi feature so I can check email and facebook without dinging my minutes when I'm at home, using my home wifi network. The best piece of advice I can give about this phone is something I read from another reviewer. First when you click to turn wifi on the icon will light up BLUE. BLUE means you are using tracfone mins for your wifi. After you turn wifi on then all available networks will pop up on your screen. So connect to your home network and your icon then changes to GREEN. GREEN means go baby :) When the wifi icon is green its FREE :)The other most valuable thing I can tell you is to make sure the email \"receiving options\" are set to \"auto sync\" off. If this setting is not set to OFF then every 1/2 hour your phone will check your email and ding your minutes if you are in the BLUE instead of green. Of course you can solve this issue by making sure you turn on/off the wifi whenever you leave the house :) To get to the auto sync ... hit menu, 6,5,2 then click to turn auto sync \"off\".This is a SPECTACULAR phone that has no business being a tracfone ...

And a few are not useful or just bad. So I'll list some things I do not like (or use).1) The screen is too small to go online. Period.  2) From the idle screen, the browser can be activated veryeasily, by accident.  3) Sometimes hard to hear voices on calls.  4) Maybe a few other tiny issues.Everything else is Top Notch. Easy to understand & operate.

'til now i would say i am more than pleased and i am sure that the triple minutes will only add to my savings. I'm another 16 year old and can't comprehend the difficulties others have with this phone. set-up is actually easy.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung s390g tracfone", "Author": "inhalethis", "ReviewID": "R1YWVYA113XL6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone yet from Tracfone!

Too many other cons to list but some are:There is no option to turn off phone confirmation sounds for example saving a contact or changing a setting. Only thing you can do if you want to mess with your phone in bed at night without keeping partner awake is go to Silent Mode. Good luck remembering to turn back on normal mode when you're done. I've NEVER had a phone before that didn't have an option for turning off phone sounds without silencing the entire phone, but then I've NEVER had a phone with an operating system this spread out, confusing, non user-friendly, nonsensical and just plain stupid and burdensome. I have some old free Motorola phones from 12 years ago that were easier to use. And actually still WORK - see further on down about that.The track/scroll/touch pad, which, having come from a phone that had a scroll/push-to-select button I'm familiar with how they work - sucks. It is alternately too sensitive and not sensitive enough. So with a light touch it doesn't move at all and using just a little heavier touch moves it past the entry you're trying for. What a POS. You can avoid some of its use by learning to use the numbers on the phone and the volume-rocker to navigate menus - it's in the user manual. Tho it's not real clear, you can figure it out -unlike a lot of stuff in the manual, which is sadly lacking in both clarity and subject matter.There are two options for message alerts (think they're under Messages/Message Settings? Hah! Think again!! You want Settings/Sound Profile/Normal (or choose one)/side scroll to Messages, down-scroll to Message Alert Repetition, click to Change and choose from Once or Periodic.) If you choose Once that's exactly what you get, and must rely on the icon that's left near the top of the screen to know you have an unread message or unheard Voicemail if you don't want to View or Dial immediately and forget after you've clicked out of the alert. If you choose Periodic, then, after the original alert which comes with whatever sound you chose but no flashing or anything for Silent mode, if you don't View or if you Exit the alert then it makes your sound approx every 2 minutes til you View the message. If you Exit without viewing a text message it leaves a certain icon at the top of the screen so you can see, if you know to look there, that there's an unread message should you look at your screen inbetween the time you Exited the Alert and the 2 mins when it comes again.  These alerts continue for ? length of time until you've Viewed your message OR DIALED VOICEMAIL. Yup, the setting applies to Voicemail, too, so if you're like me and ignore calls from numbers you don't recognize, or would rather just call a person back than check voicemail, you still need to call Voicemail to get rid of the alerts. If you have a landline you can call from it to avoid using minutes, but I don't like being forced to choose between mandatory voicemail calling and the only alternative, ONE message alert.When you create a text message then you need to press softkey Sendto which takes you to a Add Recipients screen where YOU HAVE TO ENTER THE PHONE NUMBER. Not type in the name of a contact, but actually type in the entire phone number. If you want to add from the contacts list you get to press Options/Add Recipients and then touchy-pad crossways to a submenu containing several items, touchy-pad down to the fourth one which is Contacts,click on that which takes you to a Contacts list and you choose one, softkey Done or Add and it's done!  Simple, huh? NOT.  You can avoid this rigmarole by using Contacts which in its options for a selected contact has \"Send Message\".If you want to add a cc: or bcc: you use \"Change Recipients\" :oMessage lists scroll endlessly and you don't know when you've reached the end or beginning of a list because the dates don't show and the list doesn't stop; it just continues in an endless loop. There are sort options but though you may choose to sort by date (it's the default) the date doesn't show. All that shows is the contact name and the first few words of the message. So keeping track of what you sent when to whom using the sentbox folder is impossible. Not to mention that if you click on a sent message to refresh your memory what it was about, it automatically populates a Create Mesage box with the text from the already-sent message, with no easy option to cancel. To avoid sending this unwanted message you have to go to options and scroll down 6 entries to cancel and then push that. Or you can always push End button to get out of the entire application and go back to the Home screen and start over. Lovely :\\Under the menu item for Messages a submenu entry (you would think since it's among other submenus) is Voicemail. But if you \"click\" it, it immediately dials voicemail, costing you minutes unless you're really quick with the End button - despite the fact it's nestled among other menu entries that, when you click them, take you to more options.Creating a contact has no way to set a different default for the available fields you'd like to have. You can choose, through a cumbersome process, to add more fields (like birthday, fax#, URL, etc.) but the default which can't be changed has only first name, last name, cell#, landline#, email, group, picture, ringtone and a note. If you want to put A FREAKIN ADDRESS for cryin'out loud (or anything else not in the default fields) EVERY TIME FOR EVERY CONTACT you have to choose options/add more fields then use the extremely dysfunctional and touchy trackpad to choose a tiny icon from a long line of other tiny icons representing the available fields.  :|  Not sure when I wanted to throw something out the window in a worse way.If you want to delete a contact the confirmation screen doesn't specify the contact that was selected, just confirms you want to delete. So you have to be vewwy vewwy careful with your touchy-pad that it didn't slide up or down from the contact you hope you chose.I can't comment on the call quality or web browser or wi-fi because, firstly, the phone arrived defective and making a call disallows you hearing who you called or them hearing you; the sound breaks up, rendering the phone completely unusable for making or receiving a call. Also the reception bars constantly alternate, sitting with the phone in the same place and position, from 1-3 bars and No Service. Removing and reinserting the battery with phone both on and off has had no effect. Tracfone is happy to send a replacement...in 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS, leaving me without a cellphone for probably at least a week. No amount of cajoling or threatening could change it, either. I told them it was stupid to create an extremely unhappy customer just to save a few bucks on shipping but that's what stupid is - nonsensical. I wasn't mad at Tracfone for the phone being defective or generally a POS; that happens. Sometimes defects just are present in an item and/or you just hate the way it works even though you spent three days reading reviews on the item before you bought it. The stuff that bothers you wasn't IN the reviews. I understand this and don't blame Tracfone for it. But leaving me cell-less for a week over THEIR defective product? THAT I BLAME THEM FOR and boy am I pissed. Secondly, and re the web/wi-fi, I haven't messed with it because I am flat out of patience.This is the only Samsung phone I've had but I'll sure hesitate to try another one. There are more stupid, time-consuming, burdensome, cumbersome and ridiculous  things I hate about this phone but I'm done with a capital D -for now.

Setting up the wifi took patience and more knowledge than the website shares.

For my telephone book, it offers enough contact fields enter a name, category, 3 numbers and a e-mail address, that's all, and does not match out all the fields available within the S390G.  The images stored on the internal memory may or may not exist, depending on which routine you are running.  Looks like you still have to go to the phone to attach face images to each phone number.I bought a cover for it for $3.58 delivered and also keep it in a recycled belt-loop holster.  But it still dialed 000 Emergency when I was reaching sideways to crank up the window on the other side of the car.  Apparently I was half-ways sitting on it with my hip and each oscillation from turning the crank pressed the buttons again and again. So I scrounged around the trash and found an empty, rigid plastic antacid bottle, cut the top off and the device just barely fits into it and put that into my holster.  That might keep the buttons from being pushed inadvertently.  So far that has worked.The camera isn't bad for a point and shoot and the adjustments are functional.  But it cannot take a picture of a business card, driver license, bar code, etc. Which came in handy with my previous smartphone when I was in a multi-car accident.  The camera does engage almost instantly by holding down the zero key and has come in very useful when you have to be quick about it and you're nervous to boot.  The video appears adequate, has good sound.  Used it twice so far.The downloadable Opera browser is very powerful once you spend time setting it up, and shows off the strengths (and weaknesses) of the device.  You can't cut and paste urls because the device isn't multitaskable but Opera helps out a little bit there for you.  Facebook has its own app designed for this type of device and works well.  The device has trouble attaching photos, have to keep trying and it eventually works.  Cannot preview thumbnails before selecting them, have to memorize the file name first.  All this should be done with a WiFi connection to save air-time costs.  WiFi will sometimes become disabled and I have to reset the device for WiFi to work again.I cannot comment on the messaging, e-mail or music features because I am not using them for now.  For my purposes it is really a phone with a camera and a few toys, which is fine because that pretty much covers what I had been using my previous smart phone for anyway.  Decent price for what actually works - which is not much more than their $15 camera- flip phones.  The best part is the triple minutes, keeping my air-time costs down to about $10/month with a 1-year minutes purchase.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for Me", "Author": "HonesTom", "ReviewID": "R1ZMA285PPTZCO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone unlocked repeatedly in my pocket.

One more problem is that I have sometimes butt dialed, or butt internetted (which makes me lose minutes until I notice), but that's not a fault it's just that butt dialing is pretty easy with this phone. But to fix all this (except the butt dialing), I just turn off and turn back on the phone. Really, they're not that common, so don't worry about it. It's a simple fix any way. And small problems like these seem to happen to all of the tracfone phones I've ever had. But with this phone, it has happened the least.

I have been a trakphone subscriber for about ten years. Recently I determined that the best way to communicate with my grandchildren was by text. The old trakphone I had just was not up to that. So, I selected the S390G because it has a keyboard and was inexpensive. I chose it before reading the reviews (mistake). I read the reviews after receiving the phone (bigger mistake). The problem of pocket dialing 911 would have been a showstopper had I found it earlier. A little experimentation,however, indicated that the problem occurs even when the keyboard is locked and zero is dialed more that three times, not 911, but zero. Samsung in their infinite wisdom probably thought of that as a safety feature, although, it is hard to imagine why. And, they didn't bother to mention it in any of the documentation. Well, the fix, which has worked for me thus far, seems to be a hard case that encloses the keyboard (search \"black rubberized phone holster combo for samsung\" at $14.99). I find I really like this phone otherwise. I am using the MP3 player much more often than the phone. I also use the internet connection (caution use only WiFi the 3G connection will eat your minutes) frequently to check the metro schedule and weather forecast and send photos. The camera is not great for high quality photos, but is good for snapshots when your camera is not handy. The camcorder is of low quality, and I have not yet been able to get sound from that to transfer to my PC along with the video. The phone has a number of neat gadgets which I will probably never use after playing around with them during the first month. The progressive loudness alarm will be nice while travelling. All in all a pretty good device for the money. I have also acquired a couple of useful accessories.

After 4 or 5 stores, and not finding what I wanted, I settled on this triple minute phone. I'm a light to medium texter and caller. I was looking for the new non android touch screen with triple minutes.I was with a different prepaid company. It was a great prepaid company. 2c per text, 5c per minute of talk. No data plan, but it allowed you to use your wifi on a smartphone. Although it was an entry level smartphone, it was an android 2.2 which at the time, to me, was great. It served my purpose. Be able to use home wifi with a prepaid phone. Pretty non existent these days. I broke it, so I had to get something.The previous prepaid plan would allow you to buy at the least $10 worth of minutes, but only lasted for 60 access days.Anyways, I settled for this Tracfone prepaid triple minute phone. I transferred my number from the previous company. NO problem. In fact, it was the quickest transfer I'd ever experienced. Was my old prepaid heartbroken that I was leaving them? Hell no, I think not. I think they were happy to be rid of this old head. Seriously, I think their goal is to get customers on their unlimited monthly android plans.So, the transfer was seamless. 2 hours, to 48 hours? Noooo. It was about an hour!  When I went to add the tracfone minutes, I did NOT get triple minutes. I had to do what I dreaded most in this lifetime: Call a wireless prepaid phone company to deal with a customer service associate. As I waited for a live operator, beads of sweat were forming on my forehead and upper lip, and my hands were shaking a little bit. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I get a pretty polite person on the other end. Outsourced, maybe. I cannot be sure. The young man was doing his damned-ess to speak perfect english, and so he did. I told him I didn't get my triple minutes, and that's what the phone package said. GET TRIPLE minutes for the life of this phone. Otherwise, what's the point of NOT getting triple minutes? Just wasteful, unless you have bills to burn.So, after about 15 minutes on the phone with CS, everything is corrected, the minutes are righted, and I should not have this problem again. That part of the deal was taken care of. I'm hoping that I won't have to go through this again the next time I need to add minutes.As for this particular phone... It is definitely touchy. I keep it in a purse pocket as to not dial 911 accidentally. It is somewhat like a newborn blackberry. Whiny, and poops on you every now and then.The screen is small compared to an android, but it does actually play Youtube videos and has flash. It has built in wifi, and 3g speed. It is not an android. It is not an android. P.S. the video quality is sub-standard, but in a pinch, it does play the videos. The wifi is fairly fast. The phone signal is good. The camera isn't bad at all, and neither is the video recorder. It all does in a pinch.It has built in Mp3 player, and says it can take up to 16GB memory card. I have a 32GB memory card in it, and haven't had any problemsOopsie edit: I have a 16GB micro SD card installed. BRAIN FART... Sorry for the misinformation.I have a ton of music on it, and the sound is pretty decent for a cheaper phone. With built in bluetooth, it is seemless in streaming music to a wireless bluetooth speaker. Always a plus.I do not miss the virtual text keyboard from the old android, therefore I like having the qwerty keyboard again.All in all, this is a good basic feature phone with a good signal. I hope to have continued luck with it in the not so distant future. Of course, deep down in our hearts, we ALL would love an IPHONE, but until then, this will work for me.All in all, this Tracfone turns out to actually be about $7 a month, which meets my needs for now.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Wendy Barrett", "ReviewID": "R1YE3K4NAIJNYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this for our teenage son and it has been a great phone for him.

The keys are sensitive -- \"unlock\" does get punched despite the keys facing outward in my pocket.  I have called 911 once (which is the \"1\" speed dial on every cell phone) and pulled out my phone to find other buttons punched at other times, including the \"browser\" which will, of course, drain all of your minutes.  I also hit \"reject\" on a phone call at a dinner party then shoved it quickly back into my pocket, only to find later that my friend who called subsequently listened to ten minutes of my conversation before hanging up because it apparently answered when I put it back in my pocket.  I guess at least it picks up sound really well.  If you get this phone, get one of those contraptions to carry it on your belt so buttons aren't getting hit.  I had a slider phone before which never had that happen in my pocket.  As far as texting, I do like the spacing of the keys, though sometimes when I hit the space key, it gives me a period.  So I guess that sucks too.TracFone: I resisted going TF for a long time before giving it a shot.  I should have stayed away.  The first phone I bought was a basic slider that did not have an rca input for a corded hands-free device!  Guess they just figured everyone goes Bluetooth.  I called customer service about it (outsourced, of course), which took forever to get through, and the guy assured me they make headsets with the 1/4 inch wide input head (same as the charger head).  Maybe in south Asia.  Absolutely crazy.So I got another phone, the one that has the problems mentioned above.  I went to their website to sign up for the $10 monthly plan and automatic renewal.  Every time I filled in the info and hit submit, it just kicked me back to the same screen!  How the hell does this company stay in business when you can't even buy more time on their website!?  So I went to the store and bought a 60 minute card, which put 60 minutes on my phone despite my phone being triple minutes for life.  At least this time it only took a few minutes to get through to customer service.  He manually put them on, but while I was on the phone with him, I got two texts from tracfone that each charged me to open them up!!!!!  Holy ripoff here, batman!  That was the final straw.  I'll use these minutes, then I'm done with Satan, I mean, TracFone.Additionally ... TF advertises three texts per minute of talk time.  They don't tell you certain texts from certain types of phones -- smart phones and some picture/video messages -- get charged the full minute or more!  And the Browser button is, of course, the default top right button on the phone, meaning it is easier than hell to accidentally hit it, especially when that button was \"contacts\" on my old phone.  Maybe there's a way to deactivate it.  Obviously set up to have people accidentally hitting it.The one upside is that both of the phones have come with a hundred or more minutes on them, which was not advertised.  Nice surprise.  Not enough to make up for all the crap.  I try to be understanding but it's been too much stupidity to just write off as an isolated bad experience.  Do yourself a favor and try another company.The ironic thing is I've had great luck with Net10 over the years, and they are owned by TracFone now.  They must have left Net10's management intact, because they're worlds apart.

I freely admit I haven't learned all its tricks, mostly because it has some serious flaws and I use it as little as possible. I call it my fakeBerry, but a number of other things are fake beyond the Blackberry style. (I use this phone on the Net10 system, not Tracfone.)Number one reason I'm ditching the phone is the awkward voice dialing, because first and foremost I need reliable Bluetooth/hands free calling. The phone often has a hard time finding names in the contacts, despite that fact that I re-engineered many in an attempt to make them as unique as possible. It also has the most arcane way of distinguishing different phones for the same contact. It's not \"Jack mobile\", it's \"Jack private mobile 1\", where private is pronouced \"preeVAYT\" (rhymes with hate!). \"Jack business\" becomes \"Jack landline business 1\". Even if I remember this completely bizarre syntax, I will occasionally be informed \"No Jack landline business 4 found\", or something equally preposterous, as if I actually had four entries for Jack's landline business numbers. The system is laughably called \"Nuance\".If this voice dialing nightmare weren't enough of a deal-breaker, there are a number of other \"features\" I could do without:1) As others have noted, the cramped keyboard makes it really easy to insert periods into sentences when texting. As in. every other. word. This is a major pain. Compared to a smartphone (which is perhaps unfair), it's hard to manage the ALT key to get alternative characters. I now understand why so many texts have no punctuation, because it's really hard to see what symbols (', ! ?) are where, especially if you've lost your fine eyesight!2) The WiFi connection was easy to set up, but when I saw the browser, it's a serious \"why bother?\" Tiny screen, not user friendly. Can't even imagine what it would be like to see emails on this sucker.3) AT&T; service is inferior to Verizon in my area (southwest CT) - and this phone was partially to test how that would work out. I now know. I was in Asheville NC for a week and the battery drained itself twice with literally no use as the phone tried helplessly to get a signal. People with contract AT&T; had not much better luck, so I know it wasn't Net10's (or the phone's) fault.4) Phone does not always display when I have a voicemail. Not sure if this is Net10's fault or the phone's. It seems to display properly when I have a text, but not always a voicemail.5) The status icons are small and very hard to decipher. Kind of like dense Chinese characters, there is something oddly boxy about their rendering. I suppose I'd get used to them over time, but other phones I've owned have had much more intuitively obvious and more legible pictograms.6) Even with a good signal, battery life it rather poor, and I'm barely using the phone at all. It's also not very good at signalling when it's low - I've actually put the phone down with what seems to be two bars and come back a few hours later to find it dead. I've conditioned the battery as with all my cell phones, but it doesn't seem to have helped. Oddly, the battery indicator is opposite to most I've seen: instead of showing a solid battery that gets \"hollow\" as is discharges, the full battery has a series of bars {||| and then turns solid as it gets lower.Otherwise... I guess if you were giving this phone to a kid who didn't care about voice dialing and punctuation, it certainly looks sleeker than your typical slider. (Although honestly, a slider is a lot easier for texting.) The center button is rather touchy - it sort of functions like a joystick you use as a cursor in menus. I find myself overshooting things I'm trying to select because it is so sensitive. The phone was fairly easy to set up and most things seem fairly intuitive. For those who are interested, you can add your own ringtones to the phone free (except for airtime) by having someone send you a text with the ringtone attached. You then have the option of saving it as a ringtone. This burns up more than two minutes of airtime and takes some time (it's kind of a two-stage operation, and you get charged twice, once when you get the \"header\" info for the text, and once when the \"data\" comes through), but it's still cheaper than buying them.I'll keep this as a spare or a temp phone if I have to travel where AT&T; is better than Verizon, but for now I'm replacing it with a Verizon compatible phone.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Jose Marrujo", "ReviewID": "RI8ZX4FWRUNTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like it.

The phone is comfortable to hold and to pocket. It is a bit slippery and I recommend getting a gel skin or case! Call quality is good so far for me with 4-5 signal bars at 3G speed. The browser is very generic and no frills and will get you by in a pinch, the average time to load the home screen for me takes about 7 seconds. Doing a search using Google about 20-30, not bad although I would enable the smart-width view setting. The menu is a breeze to navigate around thanks to the track pad, although the track pad is a bit on the sensitive side.The phone has small amount of tones and graphics for user customization, and I found it very easy to transfer my own tones and wallpaper to a Micro SD. If the sound file is to large you won't be able to set it as a ringtone and wallpapers(jpegs) 9-120K seem to fit fine. The built in speaker is nothing to brag about but at least there's a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.The 2.0 camera/camcorder takes grainy photos but that's to be expected and one must be very still using the camcorder.The WiFi set up is fast and user friendly as well as the Bluetooth which I was able to pair with my car audio system in no time.The screen is low rez but easy on the eyes, the qwerty keyboard is responsive, yet some may find the keys to be on the small side?Now I do have a complaint and that is Porting my number was a pain between my two back pockets! I hated calling and talking with a service rep, sounded garbled and I'm not even sure what nationality they was?

I even purchased a belt holster for the phone but it still dials 911 at will; very annoying.  Plus I also have the browser problem.  The phone will dial into the useless fake Internet browser and eat up minutes until you notice what's going on and end the connection which can cost you an hour or more of wasted minutes.Now I just leave the phone on my desk or in my car because I'm afraid to carry it anywhere.  What's the use of that?I edited the review AGAIN because I wanted to alert you to another problem.  The phone will also connect to the Internet Browser through your phone service and use up all your minutes.  When I transferred my minutes from my old Tracfone to this one, I had 2,200 minutes built up.  I probably use about 100 minutes a month, and after 9 months, the phone has eaten up 800 extra minutes just by calling 911 and/or connecting with the Internet Browser.  I am sure this is why the price has dropped from $38 down to $19 now.There is a comment here that I only saw today that says to dial in a couple of numbers and THEN allow the phone to lock & these problems will not happen.

I like the feel of the phone--sturdy but not too heavy, and a good comfortable size in the hand.  So far, the format is easy to figure out and seems user friendly.I had read all the reviews for this phone and one other Tracfone before ordering.  Some reviewers indicated that the minutes on their old phone had not only transferred to their new triple minute phone, but that the old minutes had been multiplied in the process.  My minutes transferred with no problem but they were not multiplied, and I asked the Tracfone rep about it.  I was told that only the new minutes I buy on this phone will be tripled.  That was disappointing. I had added minutes very recently to my old phone.  So if you plan on buying a triple-minute phone, hold off on buying minutes until then.  I wish I had not trusted those reviews.I had a very old Tracfone before this (a tiny thing that probably cost $15 and may have lasted 10 years or more) and minutes were deducted by the second, not by the whole minute.  I had also read some reviews that mentioned this nice feature of Tracfones.  Well, this one deducts whole minutes only, except for when you check your messages.  Another disappointment.  I asked the rep if there are any new phones that use the more thrifty approach, and was told no.I'll use this Samsung mostly as a phone, less for the internet.

Sadly, I don't like pouches on my belt and I don't  carry a purse. The phone has a nasty habit of dialing 911 or 000 while carried in the pocket. It's well documented across the web and numerous people have complained about it to Tracfone. I guess it's a safety feature, but you can't disable the emergency buttons even while the keyboard is locked. I have also had it hit the right combination to unlock the keyboard while in my pocket, then activate the web browser. I lost a quick hour of airtime that time.The phone does have wifi capability and you would be wise to use it when you can. Tracfone doesn't really document it, but this phone will bill about triple when using the cell signal or sending MMS messages. I guess that's the penalty you pay for having a 3G capable phone. The phone is Java based so there are apps that will work with it, but you have to do a lot of trial and error testing to see if the app will work.

I only use it when I need it to make a quick call or just to carry with me when I'm driving. I'm not a cell phone person but when I was I can immediately see everything about this phone to hate. They keyboard is annoying because the most important part THE NUMBERS YOU DIAL! are so tiny and hard to press. Also let me not forget to add try calling when the number is Phrase or business name like 1800flowers or 1800Pickups because you cannot! There are no letters on the number dials like a standard phone. The most annoying feature however is the slide button in the center. It's extremely touch sensitive and navigating with it is painfully annoying. It's almost like playing ring toss at a carnival trying to get the rings centered on your target while it goes everywhere else but there. The phone also seems to enjoy costing you money/minutes by going into the browser at the slightest touch... oh I'm sorry they installed a GIANT button next to the slider that enters you in browser mode anytime you \"oversteer\" accidentally with the annoying slider button. How many times do you think an adult human finger is going to slide off the tiny center button and tap the large button next to it? MANY TIMES! and Net10 knows this and so does Samsung. It will readily enter browse mode at the slightest of touches and it's annoying. 9/10 times I use this phone the browser goes off. Another problem with the phone aside from that issue is its lack of durability. I brought a case for the phone but none of the cases seem to come with a complete face cover to kept the buttons form being pressed. These new phones may have superior tech but they are inferior when it comes to durability and practicality to a flip phone in every way. This phone is too big and too flat to fit in my pocket and it just leaves your phone open to getting lint and debris on the phone and buttons not to mention being scrunched and pressed while you're carrying it around. As a man I carry my Keys and my wallet with me when I leave the house. Tell me... if you've ever seen a mans key set or the bulky wallets we carry around there's no room for this over sized flat phone to fit in our pockets comfortably. It's like carrying around a Cable TV remote in your pocket.I for the most part gave up on the idea of carrying the phone on me I usually leave it in my car when I'm out. Which is fine because I hardly find myself needing to call someone at the spur of the moment but if I do I know a quick walk to my car and there I go. I still have my old flippy phone from Net10 that I also rarely used and will probably seek to have that reactivate with a new Simm card if this phone ticks me off enough. I like my flip phone. It was sleek enough to drop in my pocket and never got in the way of anything. Plus, it did it's job of taking and sending calls quite well. Half the features on this phone I don't need and won't use but for 20 bucks it's whatever. It's more modern looking compared to the usual \"This is a cheap prepaid phone\" look that these phones usually carry. It looks up to date and it has a camera on it that has video capture and takes photos...too bad it's the worst camera quality and video quality you have ever seen in your life. My old LG flip phone I had 8 years ago from Verizon took better pictures and videos than this thing and I WISH! and I do mean I WISH! I was kidding about that but I am not at all!. This thing doesn't even have a flash on it while my old LG flip phone did. If I could someone how resurrect that phone from the dead and all 2 Pieces it ended up in I would keep that phone for like I loved that phone.The Samsung S390G for me is just a temp phone until I feel the need to use the phone more frequently then I will purchase a better phone and leave Net10 while I'm at it. Net10 is okay if you DON'T use your phone for much other than \"Hi, Hello, How are you\" 5 minute conversations or \"I'm just calling your store to see if you have this item in stock\" type of phone calls. This is NOT! and do mean NOT! in all capital letters with the exclamation mark at the end, type of phone for conversations with the NET10 service. Your minutes will be gone faster than McDonalds #1 SuperSized Combo down a fat man's throat. Anything and everything you do to this phone costs minutes and none of them are created equal. Sending a picture 1-2minutes, receiving a picture 2-4 minutes. Browser .50 minutes every time you hit the button. Text .50 minutes everytime you hit send not to mention .50 every time you receive a text from someone else. That includes the many random Text you'll get from strangers that used to be friends of the previous owner for the phone number Net10 provided you on top of the scam text and calls.These phones are kind of like Hour glasses. From the moment you get them or charge them up with minutes the time/grains of sand just begin to tumble downwards and there's nothing you can do about it but watch them leave the reservoir then once they're all gone you flip the hour glass over or in this case recharge your minutes and it's back to the same game again. Prepaid phones in general are just made to keep you coming back and purchasing more time and losing that time and purchasing more time again just to keep the phone active. It used to be smarter to just get a regular phone plan but with prices so high as they are now for phone plans prepaid is almost economical depending on how you use it. Those Smart phones don't seem so smart when you're spending over 1,500 a year just to have one.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung S390G Cell Phone", "Author": "R. Hammer", "ReviewID": "R9AV7T0WQSSMS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There's nothing I love more than getting a new cell phone and then spending the next week or so trying to figure out how the hell to use it. Well, so far it's been a week, and I'm still not very adroit at using this thing. Even though I know now that pressing the space bar on the right side I'm going to insert a period before the space, I still manage to stick periods in the wrong place throughout my message. I'd love to meet the engineer who thought that one up!I've also learned to select my recipient before I create the message. If I do things the other way around, like I did on my previous phone, I can't seem to send it to my desired recipient, even though their exact name is showing in the recipient's window.It's supposed to have a \"QWERTY\" keyboard and I guess technically it does. But on the \"QWERTY\" keyboards I'm familiar with, the number keys are all on the top row. But not here. The number keys are arranged in a square pattern within the left side of the keyboard. If you need to insert a number in your text you must first press the \"Alt\" key twice then find the desired number key. Of course this shouldn't be much of an issue since numbers are rarely used on a cell phone.A really \"cool\" feature of this phone is the scroll bar beneath the screen (as opposed to being an integral part of the screen). This scroll bar is about a \u00bd\" high and maybe an inch-and-a-half long. So to scroll down you simply run your finger down the scroll bar. Of course, because of its small size, I inevitably scroll too far down and have to scroll back up, and then usually down once again to finally (if I'm lucky) highlight my target. Scrolling across works the same way, often scrolling past your target. Doesn't Samsung have devices with touch screens like everyone else? Do they really think this new touch pad is so revolutionary it's going to replace the touch screen. They may think so, but I don't.One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because it had a slot for a memory card and the description said it could be used for storing music, photos and \"data\". By \"data\" I thought they meant your phone directory. But I guess I was wrong. At least I can't figure how to do that. Maybe there's an app for that but since I don't think I'll have this thing for long I'm not going to bother looking for it.The first Samsung product I bought was a 27\" TV (the old non-digital style). I liked it so well I purchased a smaller version for my kitchen. More recently I purchased a DVD recorder and a large screen HD TV, both Samsung brands. Now I feel like I want to stay away from Samsung altogether out of fear of what their idiot engineers will come up with next. Maybe a remote control that decides for the user what channels they want to watch!I'm in a quandary. Should I send this stupid thing back for a refund or should I do what deep down, I really want to do: smash it with a hammer? I now know why this thing was so cheap. They're trying to dump them. I hope this is a lesson learned for Samsung and that they stick with more intuitive designs.

It worked great, and I never had a problem with it. If I made a 5 second call, I was charged 5 seconds. I was very happy. Then in April of 2013, I decided to upgrade to this phone. After making a 3 second test call, I saw that I was charged for a full minute. I called customer service. This is where it all went bad. I was on hold for 18 minutes,  which was charged to the phone. Then they answered. First the lady barey spoke english. I told her the problem, and she told me that being charged for the minute was their policy. I told her that wasn't the case with my old phone. She put me on hold again, and then told me that I was right and I shouldn't be charged for the full minute. Then, in the next 10 minutes she changed her mind 3 times, changing from I should be charged to I shouldn't  be charged. She told me to wait 24 hours and the problem would be solved. After a day there was no change, so I called back and was on hold for 20 charged minutes. Then, a woman answered and said \"Welcome to Tracfone, I can't  hear you so call back!\" I couldn't believe it! She didn't give me one second to say anything. So I called back. After being on hold again for 20 plus minutes (and charged for thosee minutes), I got a lady who had to be blind drunk. I told her I couldn't understand her so she put me on with a supervisor. This Supervisor took all of my info again, even though I gave it to the automated system and the drunk lady. She then told me that the system was down and to call back in 2 hours. I was furious! So I googled \"tracfone customer service problems \", and found that my experience was the norm,  and some people claimed to have revenge taken on them after calling! Some lost all their minutes, their phone numbers, and other horror stories. So I decided to just eat the money I'm gonna lose. I'll use it up and find another carrier. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!
