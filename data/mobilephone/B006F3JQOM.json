Harding \"ReadnDecide\"", "ReviewID": "R10FRUXHSQO1D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone on Black Friday so I have had about three months with this phone. Overall it is an attractive phone with a good amount to offer, but it has one glaring issue that may be a deal breaker for most.PRO: Good screen, bright and clear, detailed and good colors. Small games play nicely (15MB or below). Responsive screen, Android 2.2 OS is great. Youtube play crisp.... Good WiFi, okay 3G...CON: 3G can drop in and out even in city leading to your app sticking if internet based (primarily Dallas city area use)*When 3G signal is solid, it works well* ... Apps download size larger than on Market... Battery, Memory, User Apps authorityBIGGEST CON: Internal Memory - Internal Memory is the memory on the phone where ALL your data is stored. All of your SMS, APPs, call history, etc. is stored there. So it's pretty important to choose a size that will fit your needs. This phone has 150MB total internal Memory... That's all... Most smartphones have at least 2GB as a norm. Plus in order to download or update anything, the phone requires 25MB to be free, limiting usable memory to 125MB... If you only use VERY few apps and don't play any complex games like Angry Birds or fruit ninja, then you may be okay.> Take also from that that preloaded apps cannot be removed or moved to SD and there isn't much space available (a bit over half but it fluctuates)... Many preloaded apps update regularly increasing their size... and some are pointless, (like Mail, weak when compared to Gmail and Yahoo apps)...>>> Memory fluctuates -- It will say low memory, then you'll go into manage apps and it will show 25MB free... so you go and download something, it'll say no memory, and this time will show 2MB free.... It's very unpredictable... I've searched internet and appears to be issue with the phone itself...<<<< And Yes, there is a MicroSD slot, BUT, none of the preloaded apps can be moved to the SD card and the majority of Market apps won't let you move them to the SD card... It's really a toss up and a pain to a) find and app... then b) download it & see if it is moveable to the SD card... Even if the Market says the app is moveable, it doesn't mean you will on this phone as I found out.***********OVERALL**************Now the above issue aside, this phone is great, it's a good size, the sleek light-weight design is fantastic, good call quality, good OS and pretty good processing... So if apps aren't your thing, or you just use a couple, then this phone would probably be a five-star in your book... But if you are wanting to use a smartphone to it's fullest, almost all other smart phones (even the new virgin mobile addition Moto Triumph has 2GB) have at least 2GB which is probably the lowest you should go********************************<following are my installed apps and memory, this is the only combo i could work out, (having to clear Data regularly)... The phone fluctuates from stating 15MB free to 250k free... Notice the largest downloaded app is 8.5, if you want an app like angry birds, or if you use facebook a lot, you will have to get less overall apps:--------------------------------------Pre-loaded: Maps (10.1MB) Books (4.1MB-6MB - updates), Clock (2.6), Mail (6.4 - w/ no accounts, grows exponentially with accounts), Gmail (4.8) FB (2) Twitter (2), Where (1.5) Google (1.2) Weather (1.2) YouTube (.5) VirginLive (.4)-------------------------------------Downloaded Apps* (With all possible on SD): Words/Friends (8.5MB) Dolphin Browser HD (8.4) Yahoo Msgr (4.6) ChaseBank (2.6) Antivirus (2.4) IMDB (1.7) Live Holdem (1.6) Chess (.7) Sudoku (.6) Jewels Deluxe (.4) Advd Task-Killer (.4) WikiPedia (.2) Solitaire (.2)>> Then there's the OS & Various Framework (40MB+) - across contacts, HTC sense, framework etc)", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The herpes of phones", "Author": "twunch", "ReviewID": "R3KDIBH9A5EZKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I drop you.On accident.On purpose. Like some reckless fourteen year old mother in some PSA about the importance of delaying motherhood.A PSA I'm pretty sure that was never really made but I made up just now to drive home this simile.Of how much I hate you.I never wanted you.You were the phone I bought because it was my birthday and the Cardinals won Game 6 of the World Series and I had a play being produced and the cast sang me happy birthday during the curtain call and so I was so happy I got really drunk and left my Blackberry Curve in the cab.How I loved that Blackberry Curve.I bought it five replacement batteries.But to replace it was 185 dollars.And you were 150 dollars.And then on Black Friday I walked into Radio Shack to see that you'd been discounted and they gave me fifty bucks back.It seemed like it might be okay between us.You are hot to the touch. Feverish. You feel like the tipping point of something that might explode.When you get too hot you turn off. In the middle of the night. With my wake-me-up-for-work alarm smothered forever inside of you.I hate you.Your tiny internal memory is quickly smothered by Android applications. At which point you stop accepting new email. Your apps can't move to an external hard drive.You are a developmentally disabled smartphone.I suspect you vaguely understand how much you suck.You come equipped with a dozen non-removable HTC applications, none of which have any value to me, all of which suck up valuable, non-negotiable real estate in your tiny (200mb) mind.Sometimes I wish I could book a flight to that factory in China where you were made and yell at the workers in the sweat shop that they are responsible for my unhappiness.Though I realize that would probably be misappropriated rage.I tried to replace you.I spent a 150 dollars on a new phone. It was beautiful. I was free of you. I used you as a clock in my apartment- a grim trophy of a troubled but passed time.The LG Optimus Elite had a functional video player, a usable music player, 1gb of internal memory, and apps that could be transferred to an external SD card.It felt warm. Like a mother's love.It fit snugly in my pocket. Until it fell out in a cab.The LG Optimus Elite was so great that I could actually upload an app to the phone even when it was not in my possession. And for a whole day, I could see where my phone was in a nasty section of Queens. To ten feet, I could track my phone. And thanks to google maps street view, I could see that the street looked really scary. And that even though I could probably take the train to that street and leave a note on the car that contained my phone, I feared for my life.I am a coward. Perhaps I deserve you, o demi-phone. You stuttering, stammering, touch-screen-that-hates-to-be-touched idiot phone.I transferred my service back to the HTC Wildfire S. I tried to root the phone. To hack it. To make it somehow move past its horrendous limitations.And I grew scared. Frustrated. I felt as stupid as the phone I was trying to fix.So now, I have become resigned to carrying you around and apologizing for the pocket dialing. Apologizing for the missed calls. The missed emails. The lack of cell service in my own apartment.You, HTC Wildfire S are a monkey's paw. An albatross that reminds me that I can't have nice things.So I bear you as bravely as I can.But I do drop you.On accident.On purpose.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "super little phone", "Author": "K. KESSLER \"Wingsonmyback\"", "ReviewID": "R50BN70JIKMEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After getting out of several 2yr contracts ,I wanted to save money and go with a pay as you go phone. After researching for several months I decided to go with Virgin Mobile, best plans and best smart phones for a no contract phone. I first bought the Motorola Triumph. Since it was the highest priced I thought it would be the best, I liked it but couldnt hear during phone calls,also the person on the other end would say I sounded like I was in a hole. so for $279 and couldnt hear phone callers I took it back. I saw the HTC Wildfire s and it had everything I wanted on a phone. I am very happy with it and should have given it 5 stars, but it is a little on the small side, would have liked it an inch or two larger on the scree,. as for the other person saying it didnt hold much memory ,no it doesnt but it comes with a 2g SDcard. Thats right comes with it. so that solves the memory problem. Guess he didnt read the box. I love this little phone and I have owned the iphones so I know good phones.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone but make sure you're up for the task", "Author": "N. Savoiu", "ReviewID": "RTI4XR4BRMT78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of this phone's reviews point out the relatively low memory available on the phone. You can \"root\" it and then that becomes a moot issue but for that a bit of technical know-how is needed. A middle-of-the-way solution is to download Android Assistant (from Google Play) and move the downloaded apps to the SD card as you download and install them. Note that you'll still not be able to move the preinstalled apps but you'll be able to install a lot more apps than without moving them to the SD card (although not as many as when \"rooted\").Now that we've got the memory part out of the way here's what I like about the phone: 1. Size : Not long ago people were mocking the early cell phones for being brick-size. Lo and behold now we have cutting-board-size ones! The Wildfire S is just the right size to me (an average size guy) to make it non-intrusive yet functional. 2. Performance : I use it mostly as a communication device (phone and some mail/internet/navigation). It will not be a speed daemon for games but for a casual game of Angry Birds or the like it's just fine. Somehow it feels a peppier than an LG Optimus Slider which has a faster processor (600Mhz vs 800Mhz). 3. Music : Put in 32GB SD card and you'll have room for just about your whole music library. And the music player is quite well integrated with the lock screen so you can go to the previous/next song from without having to unlock the phone. The volume buttons work while the screen is locked and won't even turn on the screen for more battery life. 4. It has a true FM radio : call me old-fashioned but I like being able to listen to local stations without having to stream them (not to mention the battery life benefits). Look for Spirit FM app on Google Play (there's a simple free version on XDA Developers as well as two paid versions). 5. HTC Sense : the Android interface customization done by HTC is very neat and has a good set of widgets for time/news/weather/calendar/friends giving you easy access to the most important things.To recap, if you're an avid game player or video watcher then this phone is probably not for you. If instead you need a neat little communication device then you'll probably be pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone sucks", "Author": "NYU", "ReviewID": "RFSTJO3MPZL3S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this phone on \"Black Friday\" special and was happy to replace my IPhone and my expensive AT&T; plan.  Was pretty ok at first, battery life about average, I still have to charge it every day, like my Iphone, it's smaller and lighter than my IPhone, and of course the plan is much cheaper. Reception was pretty good compared to AT&T;, I was very leery of the SprintPCS network. At the time the most annoying thing with the phone was the constant \"memory low\" warnings, and the inability to move anything over to the SD card, cannot delete the useless pre-loaded apps that use up all my space.  (Ok so I recently found out I can root my phone and delete these useless apps, but quite frankly, I just dont think I should have to jailbreak a phone just to delete apps that I don't want or use.)  So, with the memory problems, I can deal with that..  It's annoying, but not enough for me to want to throw my phone up against the wall, or conveniently leave it outside while its storming outside.7 months later, it's a different story.  The constant low memory warnings is now super annoying.  I have barely any apps on my phone now because of it, the LCD display is mostly unresponsive, it works when it \"wants\" to, which is hardly ever.  I've used the calibration tool, and I downloaded a touchscreen booster app (which I've now had to delete to \"conserve memory\")....  I've factory reset my phone (losing all my contacts, downloaded apps, and settings) just to get the lcd display to actually respond.  My reception in buildings is dismal.  I can't even walk into a Kroger anymore and get reception.  The \"so called speaker phone\" is pretty useless as well.  I was really excited about a 5 megapixel camera, and it takes great pictures if you can get around the delay in the shutter speed, and pray that your photo subject hasn't moved.  and why cant you shut OFF the flash?  That's ridiculous....I do not recommend this one to anyone who wants to use this phone long term.

I currently have NO apps installed and somehow don't have the memory available to do the system upgrade.  Many times it tells me my storage is too low to take pictures or even view pictures. The battery drains about three times a day.  I leave it plugged in whenever possible.  The predictive text is absurd - it's constantly \"predicting\" words that don't make any sense.  I have to be sure to reread everything before I post or send so as not to send something ridiculous.  This is my first android phone and first touch screen.  I know it will be nearly impossible to find a phone that's not touch screen anymore but I don't care for that feature at all.  I had various versions of the Tmobile Sidekick before this phone and never had a complaint.  We switched to Virgin Mobile to save money when our baby was born.  I am currently paying 1/3 of what I was paying with Tmobile for the same features, so I can't complain about the cost.  But we paid extra for this phone because it was supposed to be top of the line.  I am constantly frustrated with this phone and it's features.  I absolutely would not recommend it.

Lots of delay with apps, calling, typing, etc. The internal storage is extremely low. I have a 32g sd card installed, but I can't even install apps I need because it only lets you use internal storage. If this was the case with LG as well (as it must be), it was NEVER a problem on that phone and I could always install whatever apps I needed.

So I bought the HTC Wildfire S. I previously owned the Droid Incredible, it actually runs the same software (HTC Sense), which is very nice and easy to use. It obviously doesn't run as fast as my Incredible, but it hasn't really bothered me. Overall its a pretty nice phone, and I really enjoy being contract free. I do agree with some of the reviews saying it is a bit small, but its sleek and stylish look makes up for it. From my exp. HTC has some of the best phones on the market. I would highly suggest any HTC phone if you are looking for something new, no matter what carrier. Don't be like everyone else and dump your money into the black hole apple has created.

When I became a SAHM 9 years ago, I surrendered my phone contract for a tracphone.I decided to graduate from my tracphone and enter the modern world of apps and texting.  This phone was the new hot thing for virgin mobile at the time and I paid around $150 for it.  What a waste. I do not use it much, and couldn't if I wanted to. This phone will no longer charge on the first attempt.  I have to check on it every so often to make sure it is charging.  Sometimes trying to charge it will somehow suck all the power out of it and reduce a half charge to a zero one.  At random times throughout the day and night, it will decide whether it wants to stay on, or not. It sometimes will send texts up to a week after they were sent.  No apps can be down loaded because it doesn't have enough memory to allow a download.  Since nothing can be downloaded, the sd memory card is a complete waste because you can't get anything to move to it.  The phone uses most of its memory to store the apps someone else decided I might want, and they can not get deleted.  This phone has shocked me in my ear when talking and scorched me in the leg when it was simply resting in my pocket.  I have to clear data every few hours from these predetermined apps in order for the phone to function.  When I owned the phone for about a month, I began to have trouble accessing the web.  A tech for HTC told me to do the following:  I had to start putting it into airplane mode for one minute, then turning off the phone and waiting 30 seconds before turning it on again, removing the airplane mode and restarting and resigning in to my wifi in order to access the Internet.

At first I had to go in and clear the caches of all programs about once a week, that has steadily increased to once every three of four hours, depending on how often I use my phone (I've had the phone for about 6 months). I also have to periodically go in and uninstall updates on programs I do not use in order to have enough memory to text a friend.  The only apps I have downloaded (Google Sky Map and Pandora) both went straight to the SD card and should not have any bearing on phone space. In addition to the memory issues, I noticed about a month ago that when I used the phone while it was charging I felt like my ear was being shocked. I read somewhere (if I remember where I will come back and cite it) that using your phone while charging was dangerous so I stopped using it while charging. However, in the past week I have noticed that my ear and jaw bone hurt quite a bit if I am on the phone for longer than a minute at a time.

But over those 4 months I have grown to like it less and less.This phone has a serious memory shortage.  Sure you can download Android apps.  But don't get more than 3 or 4 or your memory will be full.  There is so much bloatware that can't be moved to an SD card or removed unless you root the phone (something most non-techies wouldn't consider doing).  Then even if you only download 3 or 4 apps after a few days you'll start to get low memory warnings.  You can run the little procedure to correct the problem but within 12-24 hours it will show up again.  Eventually the apps will need to do an upgrade but won't be able to because of insufficient memory.  The fix is to uninstall previous updates for each app to free up memory  Then you can do the update for a specific app.  Then all the other apps will need to be updated again as well.  All of this will eliminate the low memory warnings for a few days, maybe a week at the outside.  After that the low memory warning will reappear and the process will start again.The other weak point is the battery.  Connecting through wi-fi and sending only  few text messages, NO phone calls, the battery would last for 10 to 12 hours.  Turn on Bluetooth and it drops below 8 hours.  Make a few phone calls and it drops even farther.  Sure there are apps for battery power management.  But remember this phone has ridiculously low memory capacity so you only get a very few apps.  Why should one of them have to be burned to support the poor design of the power system of phone?  An extended life battery helps some.  But still much use at all and the battery is toast in less than 10 hours.  I don't know about you but I don't want a cell phone that keeps me tied to charger cable.  I might as well use a land line.The final straw came when I was notified of a firmware upgrade.  Aha!  I thought - perhaps this will address the memory or battery issues.  But I discovered in order to do the firmware install I was forced to uninstall all the apps I had installed and delete the updates on most of bloatware apps even before the firmware update had the space to install.  It is beyond comprehension that their bloatware should take up so much space that a firmware update can't be performed without all that rigamarole.  And of course after I completed the firmware update and reinstalled the few apps I could the low memory warning again reappeared.This phone would be fine if you use it to play games, and make one or two brief phone calls a day.

You can unlock and root, however, for the layman, just spend the money on something with more internal memory, but you will void your warranty.  This phone is basically junk.  I runs the latest Android OS, however, useless without sufficient internal memory.  Shame on you Virgin Mobile and HTC for put out such crap.  I do not reccomend anyone purchase this phone.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "no memory. no space for your apps", "Author": "Timbern", "ReviewID": "R3QHHNFIF0LXN2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Its half the phone the LG Optimus is at twice the price. I like the feel of it but the hard-coded htc sense apps use up all of the available internal storage leaving almost nothing for your apps. My first htc, bought for my sons birthday, very disappointed in htc, can't believe they sell this junk.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "DEVICE IS CARRIER SPECIFIC AND NOT UNLOCKED!!!\nMICRO SD CARD NOT INCLUDED!!!\nVirgin Mobile", "Name": "HTC Wildfire S Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UTKsTmBPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006F3JQOM"}}
