It came in the condition described. The problem is, it isn't exactly what I ordered. It is a Blackberry, but it isn't the 8830 like I paid for. Instead, I got a Curve 8330 which works with VZW. I am overseas in Kuwait and I ordered the 8830 because it had a slot for a sim card. The Curve 8130 VZW phone does not. VZW does not use sim cards. I am very unhappy about this.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Watch the fine print!", "Author": "BETH KELLEY", "ReviewID": "R2WEGHP0M0HEQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is fine.
