{"Reviews": [{"Title": "**WARNING** Great hardware but lier seller (comes w/all Chinese apps & no Google Play)", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1C7WHNMOPD5M0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hardware wise this is a great phone: beautiful large 5' screen, pretty fast, takes amazing pics and videos, and at fraction of the cost of other brands, this phone would have been a steal. BUT since the phone comes preloaded with Chinese instructions and applications and with no Google Play Store installed, you will not be able to do anything with the phone. You will not be able to install any applications nor are you able to remove the Chinese applications either.What's more disheartening is I chose this phone primary because of the following seller's promise:\"(Unlocked + Rooted + Google Play Store + No Chinese Apps)\"Unfortunately none of these promises are true.- The phone comes loaded with all the Chinese social media apps equivalent to Facebook, Twitter and God knows what else, since I can't read Chinese.- The phone does not have Google Play Store. So you can only use the apps that come preloaded on it (and unless you know Chinese, you are left with the few apps to use: pics app, Messaging and browser - you will also have to set the apps defaults, like to use Google as the default search engine instead o the Chinese equivalent).- Rooted: Probably not because I can't uninstall the preloaded apps.In conclusion, even if you have to spend a little bit more on other brands, STAY AWAY from these phones - especially STAY AWAY from this seller. It is unfortunate because the hardware features Huawei phones come and at the price they are offered, these phones would have been amazing deal. But the trouble they cause is not worth it in my opinion.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GSGE4FW"}}
