But after having it for a couple of weeks, I'm pretty happy with my decision to buy it.Good alternative if you don't want a smartphone. After all, basic phones seem to be going the way of the dinosaur...extinct. So, the Renue is a good phone for handling the basics, talking and texting. It is possible to get on the internet and surf the mobile sites in 3G fairly well. For the random internet user, to maybe look up movie times or the weather, this phone is just fine. It's easy to use and has the versatility of a touchscreen and a slider. Plus, phone cases are dirt cheap and yes, you can buy one that still allows it to slide open.Negatively, it is easy to miss calls by touching the touchscreen while removing phone from your pocket. For me, this was easy to remedy by just turning the phone screen inward while in my pocket. That way, I always grab the backside of the phone while removing it.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "very smart, for not being a 'smartphone'", "Author": "rgibbs23", "ReviewID": "R2W7I16BKBPPNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't typically do reviews, but decided this one is worth taking a few minutes. If you are like myself, and find paying for a data plan that you don't need or use, ridiculous - then this is the phone for you. It looks and acts, pretty much like a smartphone - with only a few missing points.To sum it up - here is a list of the things I like vs. the things I don't.I like:-being able to mass-delete messages (when you hit delete, checkboxes appear & you can select all, or only the ones you wish to delete.- when you text, there are two steps - you get to 'preview' the message before sending it. I like this because it keeps me from accidentally sending something before I'm ready - but this may be annoying for some people.-has a full, slide-out qwerty keyboard-all screens are fully customizable - you can change the 'wallpaper' for the lock screen, homescreens & even the menu background (though the menu background choices are a tad limited)-can customize your font - I know that's not a big deal, but I found it fun :)- if you miss/ignore a call, a box pops up offering you the option of calling back or sending a message to the caller (pretty handy if you want to let the person know you'll call them back when you can)-touchscreen is pretty responsive - just a tad slower than my smartphone was. Incidentally, I haven't had any trouble accidentally hanging up on  people because the send/receive touch-keys are too sensitive. I DO have to be careful when answering a call and removing the phone from my pocket - it WILL reject a call if I accidentally touch the reject touch-key. I've learned to adjust for this by simply making sure to grab my phone by the sides & have virtually eliminated that problem.-love being able to create my own shortcuts & customize my menu screen to act like a bookmark. I don't even use the homescreens, I just put everything I use most on the main menu screen and they're quickly accessed by hitting the menu shortcut on the main homescreen - simple.- easy to connect to your computer via the included usb cable/charger- LOVE the pc suite available for free from Pantech. Very easy to use - I transferred ringtones (which the standard ringtones were nice, I just wanted some of mine) & pics from my old phone with ease. I did have to manually enter my contacts (since I didn't want to bother going into an at&t; store) and that too was a breeze, using the pc suite - I just typed in the info on the computer and it saved it to my phone. Very nice feature, since typing them in with the phone keyboard would have been tedious at best.-the screen is large & bright with nicely designed icons.- calls are clear, sound-quality is great - seems better than my old phone, as does the volume - can easily hear it if I leave it lying about the house- love the fact that you can set 'profiles' for indoor/outdoor and at a touch can select which one you want & it will automatically change the volume/vibrate settings for calls & texts, to the selected profile- can assign individual ringtones to your contacts- it is an overall good size - not too big for my pocket, but large enough to be comfortable talking & texting.- SPECIAL NOTE: I have not had trouble with the battery life - it typically lasts me a couple of days before needing re-charged. I was curious due to other reviews on here & let it run without charging to see how long it would go. It lasted nearly 3 days with normal use (calls & texts). What I noticed, is that the battery icon has only 3 bars - when it gets down to one, you automatically assume that it needs charged - as my old smartphone would get down to a small bar & then turn red and I knew it was time to charge. This phone, stays at one bar for a quite a while, then the bar disappears rather than changing color, to let you know it needs charged. Weird, for those of us who have had smartphones, but that's what it does. Perhaps other reviewers have received faulty batteries?- the price was right, (a penny with contract) since my old phone had taken an unexpected bath, thanks to my six-year-old and hadn't been quite the same since, lol.- this isn't really about the phone, but rather the service via Amazon. I had no trouble renewing my contract and paid only a penny (the phone was listed for $50 upgrade, with contract on att.com) and amazingly - Amazon got it to me NEXT day - and that was with free shipping. Wow. A new sim-card was also included at no charge.What I don't really like:- no wi-fi- not a very large capacity for text messages - though I went a full week without having to delete messages, so it's not really a big issue for me. For a heavy text-er, this could be annoying though. At least deleting messages is simple and non-time consuming.- keys on the slide-out keyboard are on the slick-side, making it a little frustrating if you tend to type with your fingernails as I do (my old phone was tiny - an Hp veer, so I got used to typing that way). I am getting more accustomed though. :)- would have preferred actual send/receive buttons instead of the touch-buttons, but if you are careful as I mentioned above, it's not really an issue.- the screen is very smooth & shiny - shows every smudge (I am getting some screen protectors though, so that should help)- the build seems a bit on the flimsy-side to me - very light-weight, Hence I will be purchasing a case to add some durability.- not much variety in cases to choose from - just your standard clip-ons, so I am not very impressed with that.Overall, I rated this phone a five-star, not because I 'love it' - but because I do like it and I believe that as a basic phone, it's a winner. Very nice design & features. It's just so annoying that if you don't want to pay for data service, you have to go to a 'dumb' phone. Anyway, for a 'dumb'phone - this one's pretty smart :)", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miss 8 out of 10 incoming calls trying to retrieve the phone from the pocket.", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R2AOOJOUTH22H2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We picked up this Pantech Renue as an upgraded phone through an AT&T; corporate store with a 2 year contract. We were aware this is not a smart phone and require no data plan. The phone was returned after one week and we were charge $35.00 for restocking fee. Following is reasons for the return:1. The biggest issue we have with this phone is its TOUCH end/reject key, I want to point out about the difference between TOUCH and PRESS: with a TOUCH key, you activate it by just slightly touch it with your finger or any part of your hand, while with the PRESS key, you have to press it with your finger and feel a slight click to activate it. With the TOUCH end/reject key of the Pantech Renue, my wife would accidentally touch the sensitive end/reject key trying to retrieve if from the pocket or handbag to answer the call. She would missed 8 out of 10 incoming calls doing that. Of course, she had to check the recent call and call back. Other phones equipped with the PRESS end/reject key would not cause this problem.2. Its sound quality for voice conversation is not that clear comparing to the my wife's old Motorola Raz2 V9X.3. We initially charged the phone for 8 hours before the first use. Battery ran low every night with very little use during the day.The shape, screen size and display of this phone is very good.We think Pantech should look into the design of the sensitive TOUCH end/reject key of this phone. We did call Pantech support inquiring about how to bypass the sensitive TOUCH end/reject key, its agent could not give the answer and quietly transferred our call to AT&T; Tech Support without notifying us that he would transfer the call. Nice service!Buyers who consider buying this phone should pay attention to the restocking fee if it is purchased through AT&T.;", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best non-smartphone out there", "Author": "hjgkgy", "ReviewID": "R11LONS8D9T01C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing!

Great quick messaging phone.

I don't write a lot of reviews, but in this case, I wanted to warn any prospective buyers about this phone so they don't make my mistake. I have owned this phone for almost a year - I got it when it was just being introduced - and it is a cute little non-smartphone. But the fact that it is cute does not make up for its deficiencies. First, the touch screen is so sensitive, I frequently hang up on callers, or reject the call unintentionally. Second, the processor is extremely slow. I send a text and cannot do anything else on the phone until I get the message that it sent successfully, which sometimes takes awhile. Third, the screen is bright, which is nice, but you pay for that in battery drainage big time. Fourth, it is way too easy to bump something on the screen and it automatically connects to the internet and even when you disconnect, you get charged by ATT. I think this is a scam by ATT because my son also has a different Pantech which does the same thing. So I don't get charged all the time, I have to turn off data services on the phone, but then if someone sends me a picture via text, I have to turn on the data services in order to see the picture, then remember to go back and turn off data services. Fifth, you can't increase/decrease the ring volume on the side of the phone unless you are on the home screen. It doesn't work from any other screen. Overall, this phone has annoyed me over and over again. I cannot wait until my six months are up and I can upgrade. Do not buy this phone; you will regret it. Even if it's free, don't be tempted - you will pay for it in endless frustration.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than most here say", "Author": "lighthouselover", "ReviewID": "RLV51D864JK06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I traded a smart phone to go back to this type phone.

The Renue is not a smart phone but I'm finding it does nearly everything I did with my iPhone, with the exception of a few apps.For someone who wants a phone for messaging and social media this is an excellent option. My data plan with AT&T; is even cheaper with this phone.I really love the opening screen. Pushing the top button gives you the time, a mute slide, phone, messaging, camera and voice buttons plus an unlock that takes you back to your last application. Once you unlock the phone there are 5 main screens you can slide through, each customizable. I like the option for creating and adding bookmarks here for easy access.The browser is fast and works better in limited internet situations than my iPhone did. I had opportunity to test this recently after an emergency in our county left our cell phone grid overwhelmed. My husband's iPhone flailed when the signal switched to the edge network but my Renue stayed calm and surfed on.With the Qwerty keyboard I am sending more texts than ever. I find the keys responsive and they have been easy to get used to. It is much easier for me than trying to text from an iPhone touchscreen.One drawback, however, is the way this phone handles group messages. That is a nightmare and I've not found a good workaround yet. I've added a memory card and maybe that will help keep my phone from locking up with incoming messages. ****UPDATE November 2013: There isn't a way to clear or update T9 dictionary. The only option is to reset and clear the entire phone.****I do not like the Facebook app from Facebook and much prefer the Facebook that is already installed. The Renue also comes with Twitter installed and that works extremely well. I've created a bookmark to Twitter DM pages and use that to quickly send messages to a few contacts with much less fuss than I got from the iPhone.Loading music and other files is very easy with the PC Suite software. Just plug in the USB and transfer files. Sound quality is good but there are only 7 levels. 1 is still fairly loud. There is an earphone jack and I think the sound quality is very good.The phone size and weight are something I'm very happy with; it simply feels good in my hand. I haven't gotten a case for it yet but the back battery cover is grippy and that is a feature I like. The slider is smooth. The screen resolution is not iPhone quality but the camera quality is just as good as my iPhone3 was.This phone is a great choice for people like me who primarily use their phone for talking, messaging, social media, and an mp3 player.

Good camera, responsive touchscreen, good keyboard.The complaints about reception, and battery are false. They are based on the signal strength bars and battery life bars. 1-3 bars on this phone does not mean the same thing on another phone.I have had good reception in the city or remote highways. Even at 1 bar I still have 3G data.Also for battery; battery lasted four days with frequent calls and texting and camera use. The confusion has to do with the meter. It has a 3 bar battery, after day one it dropped to two bars. The next day it dropped to one. By that point the average person would plug it in, but I waited to give it a chance. The next day it stayed at one bar, and on the fourth day it dropped to zero bars. I waited. I made a days worth of calls and texts and pictures. And by midnight it finally shut itself off. I think most people complaining about battery or signal just assume that those meters mean the same thing on all phones.The speakerphone is rough, almost useless. The micro SD card slot requires extra steps to remove. Remove battery panel, battery, then card. The camera is good, you should increase the quality as default setting is low. You can customize wallpaper, ring tones, text tones, change the default clock, it just takes some effort to find everything in the menus.When activated I did the Check For Updates, and downloaded the 4/2014 update.

I also can't forward texts.  These are things that were standard on my old phones, but do not appear to be options to even add on this phone.The touchscreen isn't as insanely sensitive as some suggest - in a month or so of use, I haven't hung up on anyone by touching the phone to my face during a call (though the touchscreen becomes active every few seconds during a call, so you can use the keypad, say, if you were listening to voicemail and wanted to use the menu options).

Its nice, but I think the best word to describe it would be adequate. It has a pretty responsive screen, and its easy to maneuver. The keypad makes texting very easy and fast, because there is ample space between each key, and each key isn't too small. I note for a non-smartphone, the battery life isn't great. I'm a high-school student who texts his fair share, having a job, and worse, a girlfriend :). The battery usually lasts me through the day, but its almost completely drained by the time I sleep, so sometimes i find myself hoping it holds out. SO battery isn't too big a problem.The actual product is nice sized, smaller than an iPhone and it fits easily in a pair of jeans pockets. It has some bulk, thinker than smartphones, but I like that fine, because it gives the phone a sense of durability.The phone does support a SD card, but I find it pretty unnecessary because I don't keep a lot of videos and pictures. The reason for that is the camera is sub-par, it only looks decent for close-up selfies (which I don't bother with), and there isn't a zoom feature. Videos look even worse, so I don't even touch that.Overall, this phone works. It calls, and texts, and thats all I really need.

When you receive a phone call and touch the screen in any way, you will either hang up on the calling party or reject the call.  I carry my phone in my shirt pocket.  Just the motion of taking the phone out of my pocket will cause the \"slider\" that allows you to accept or reject the call to move.  If the slider moves to accept the call, the call will disconnect before you get the phone all the way out of your pocket.  If the slider moves to reject the call, you  will have to call the person back.  I'm not talking about pressing down on the screen and moving the slider.  I'm talking about the screen touching any part of your clothing or hand and the slider moving on it's own.  It does not require you to even touch the slider bar, just touch the phone and the phone thinks you are touching the slider.  If the phone is on the table and you pick it up, the slider will move on it's own.  I have talked to AT&T; and even taken the phone to the local AT&T; store and they are unable to resolve the problem.  My recommendation, avoid this phone at all costs unless you actually want to either hang up on the caller or reject all calls.  Next is the web access.  You have to use the Pantech version of ATT.net.  Items that were available on my old Samsung are not available on this phone.  You must use Yahoo which in itself is fine.  But you can't use Yahoo to access your homepage.  I had a Yahoo account.  I used the user name and password I already had but it would not work on this devise.  I had to sign on using my Google Gmail account.  When you use the web icon, you get a menu instead of your home page.  Then, when you select home, every third or fourth time you sign on, your home page is gone and you have to add all your favorites again.  You can't sort your bookmarks.  The default AT&T; sites are always listed first.  You have to scroll through them before you can get to your personal bookmarks.  That even includes a search screen like Yahoo or Google.

If you have recently tried to purchase a non-smart phone, then you know one's choice are very limited and the phones seem unreliable. From the beginning she has not adapted to the Renue (she had a Samsung Solstice). The location of the volume button means she is constantly unintentionally turning the ringer down and there are other quirky problems (touchscreen, poor battery life, etc.) with the phone. However, the finally straw is discovering that she cannot receive or send pics and group text messages without paying for data. When I purchased the phone it required a minimum text & pic plan which was already part of my plan, but no one said she also needed a data plan or she would have to pay per use if she used these features. Years ago I placed a data block on her phone because she was accidentally accessing the data & charges were incurred. This data block was not a problem on her Samsung. Researching the problem online, a thread indicated the Renue required a data plan. A sales associate at my local at&t; store found the same online post but pointed out that the Renue is supposedly a data free phone. A call to tech support confirmed that a data plan or pay for use data is necessary if the user wants to send or receive pics and group texts.  By the time I discovered the problem, it was too late to return the phone. Needless to say, I'm frustrated and angry at the misinformation and misrepresentation of the Renue. If I had wanted to purchase a data phone, I would have purchased a reliable smart phone.
