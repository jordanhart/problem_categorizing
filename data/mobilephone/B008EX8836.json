This phone is not as intuitive as others. Granted I'm used to the Android system and iPhones and have never used a Microsoft operating system on a cell phone. First disappointment was that some apps are completely inaccessible, including Amazon mp3 which I'm sure isn't the most popular app out there, but if you've invested any money in purchasing music throught it, it's a pain to no longer have access to that music through that app. There is no place to access downloads. Once something is downloaded, it is filtered into what the phone decides is an appropriate place. Bank apps download into the \"Wallet\" app installed on the phone. Others of my downloads have simply disappeared into the phone somewhere and I've had several people search for access to them to no avail. This includes apps and documents. I've had this phone a week and already it is doing.. odd things. Today it decided to randomly fade the screen's brightness from well lit to almost invisible (regardless of the amount of time since I'd last touched the screen and on a full battery) and then fades back to normal, repeating the fading in and out multiple times. On other phones I've used, when you use the internet and then close out to do something else.. take a call, use another app, check a text, you can open the internet back to the page you were just viewing... not with this phone. It goes back to your starting bing, google, whatever default page and if you hit the back button it just closes the internet. Also, if you receive an incoming call from someone not in your contacts and want to save the phone number to your contacts, there is no way to do so??? I'm not completely incompetent.. I've selected every possible option and there is no way to directly select that phone number and save it into contacts. It requires you to select one of your contacts' names from your newly created hotmail account (unless of course you already have one) to save the number under. If this person isn't in my hotmail account already, then what? Too many mandatory steps linking to hotmail. I'd rather just have the ability to synchronize without having to manually do it every time I want to do something simple like save a phone number. These things may be able to be worked through, but with hassle. The phone looks great. It's operating system is just, like I said, not intuitive and even during this first week of being on a new phone high, I'm already becoming disenchanted with the phone. The reason I chose this phone is for the Microsoft Suite's amazing functioning on this phone. I've tried using Word and Excel with other phones and it was possible, albeit annoying. Using Excel on this phone is amazing.. almost better than my laptop. So for someone regularly needing that ability, this phone may be worth the other issues. I would say I like the phone, but considering all the other options available at this price point, I may return it. Don't be sold on the camera either.. if you get the sales pitch on it you'll know what I'm referring to. I tried to take a still pic of a plant (nothing moving, me or the plant) and it continuously came out blurry.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "In love with it", "Author": "Olivia", "ReviewID": "R1ZY6Q7BH75IIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I comment on the product, I must mention that when I received it in the ATT box with the ATT logo on it I was terrified the phone would be locked. As it turns out, the phone is unlocked. No issues there. Also, I'm not on AT&T.; I'm on Simple Mobile, which runs on TMobile, so my comment on 3g/4g speeds will be non-existent.1. Fantastic reception on the phone so far. Where I couldn't get reception in the past, I get a strong signal on this phone. Many people blame reception solely on networks, but obviously phone reception plays a part.2. Enough apps for me. I'm not a mass appeal games freak, so I'm not going to lose the plot at the fewer games available, and, heaven forbid, needing to pay $0.99 for Angry birds. I can get all the other things that I want, either the same app as Android or by a third party that fulfills the same function (was on android before this)3. The battery life is ok. It lasts through a day and then some, of course depending what you use it for. I use the phone for calls, some surfing, apps for a range of thing from weather to my Sonos to the kindle.4. Fantastic price. I know Lumia 920 is out but I also know a one year old model is young enough to be relevant and old enough to receive the shipment of the model without the initial launch quirks.5. Xbo smartglass works well, which isn't a big deal but it's a nice convenience when I'm watching netflix on the xbox from the bed.6. Stable. Actually stable.7. The ringer volume has a huge range. That was an issue with my last phone. I like the range. 0-30.As time goes by I'm sure I'll have more to add and maybe it'll show itself to be a dud (though I honestly hope not). Maybe some day Tmobile/Simple Mobile will add the required frequency to get 3g on this phone but I have no issues with Edge for what I use the data access for and I'm mightly pleased with this pretty piece of mobile technology. When everyone had Nokia phones, I never had one, so I'm surprised that I've gone there with this, but they did a good job.

My initial high hopes three weeks ago are now replaced most days trying to decide whether I should try to stick it out or cut my losses and get an Android or iPhone.I love the look of Windows Phone's UI and the integration of your photos and contacts into almost every corner of the OS is somewhat charming.That being said the gimped Windows 7 apps (Spotify) and complete lack of some of the most popular apps from the marketplace (Pandora) make me miss the days of my iPhone 4 and even my 1st gen Android.Technically the phone lags, and the apps often crash.

I was tired of Boost and Virgin Mobile and the terrible service they provide and their watered down phones. Don't believe anyone who tells you the phones manufactured for these prepaid services are the same ones that are released to contract carriers. I had the EVO on Virgin Mobile and Samsung Galaxy on Boost and they were nothing like the same phones given to my friends from contract carriers. You get what you paid for.After receiving this phone I can truly say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I am as left leaning liberal as they come and it pains me to give the thumbs up to a major corporation, but the fact of the matter is that Nokia is a superior company to Samsung and HTC and AT&T; invented the phone and has the largest 4G network. So when combined these two companies have created an untouchable product. This is my first windows phone and I can say that the OS is unbelievable. People choose Apple and Android b/c they are inherent Microsoft haters. However Microsoft powers the world whether they like it or not. This phone works smooth and the screen and looks are top notch. It never hangs or needs rebooting and the features actually work the first time you click them. The back button on Android is a joke there is no telling where it is taking you. When you press the back button on this phone, you go back to the previous screen. Isn't that a notion??? The camera is not the best in the world even though it is a name brand camera, but for goodness sakes it is a phone - who cares. I have also read the reviews that say the phone is \"locked\" to AT&T; and this is not true. Yes it says AT&T; on it but it works on any GSM network. Not too mention, I put it on AT&T;'s Go Phone prepaid plan so I am getting 4G LTE unlimited talk and text for $60 per month, and they sell the prepaid cards at a million stores and gas stations and you can setup your account online and AT&T; even takes e-checks. I am done with the empty Android promises, locking phones, freezing screens, and inferior battery life that the Boost and Virgin Mobile phones provide. I don't even have to charge the phone every day and I talk over 5000 minutes per month. I will admit there are some apps like Mapquest and Google Maps that I miss from my android phone and AT&T; charges for their navigation service. I will also admit the screen is no where near as brilliant as an I Phone or Galaxy or even the upper end Nokia. But I will gladly trade that for a phone that works everywhere and that does not freeze every five minutes. And I have invested $200 in the phone and I am paying $720 a year for 4G service on a great network and I don't have a contract and I can still sell this phone on Amazon a year from now for $100 or $150. Compare that with spending $500 or more and having a contract and spending $100 per month for unlimited. There is no comparison.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn't break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Lumia 900 has 4.3\" (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user's hand!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don't mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelent excelente", "Author": "aristides edgardo rivero areyan", "ReviewID": "R38E7STE8FCYMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "el equipo funciona perfectamente en venezuela 4g con movistar muy completo  ademas es bonito las band son 850/1900/2100con sus accesorios", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "no headphones", "Author": "ADLF", "ReviewID": "R1PD9PHSOQS46Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "very nice phone works very good  and looks very nice but is not factory unlocked and I did not get any headphones.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Nokia phone", "Author": "orlando guerra", "ReviewID": "RN7YV9IXJQJ7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find that Nokia phones overall provide excellent features.

Well this is not the case with this toy..THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PHONE!! - FORGET PRACTICAL USE WITH THIS GADGETSimple, practical and easy is not part of the philosophy in this phone..Things you might be used to do on a couple of clicks, here they take 5 to 6 actions away (or more) and time consuming and frustrating results in many cases.. Understanding and finding your way around with Nokia Lumia 900 wp7 is a very high time consuming effort .. So if you are a busy person and like technology to improve your timing working routing, this is not a phone I would recommend.. Because many \"Basic\" cell functions are missing in the software wp7, and the only option you'll find is to search endlessly the \"market place\" to find app that may or may not suit your needs, download them, install them and use them for a while to see if they really work for you.. (mean while consuming the phone memory capacity) And in my case, I don't want to pay for apps that I have no proven knowledge how they work... So you'll end up searching the \"free\" category (which have advertising on them)-No smart dialing (while you type a number does not display contacts that match the number)-No possibility to customize font size-No \"select or select all\" option when typing-No \"one space back/forward\" buttons option when typing and/or correcting, editing any text-No undo-No cut-No possibility to see or view the date when typing a note, message or document-No return or back to previous task-No easy friendly connection, transfer of data through USB and PC-No contacts transfer, share, backup, update, save, import, export through USB or Bluetooth to your PC or other services-No Bluetooth connection to other phones or PC for picture, music or file transfer--Forget about Bluetooth services with this device (only a handful services incorporated) e.i. hands free and speakers, it's about it..-No message (SMS) save or export to PC..-SMS threads font very small size-For a pretty big screen, contact's info (phone numbers, address, e-mail, notes, etc) are ridiculously small font size!!! (can't change it)-What happened to font selection \"Small, Medium, Large\"?-No compatibility to PC Suite  (Nokia's software)-No ringtone selection as desire by user from own music files-No volume set up by user for default ringtones-Volume adjust same for every sound (lets say I just want to set up SMS sound louder but only that, it can't it won't let you)-No sound selection as desire for \"new sms\" or \"new email\" or \"reminder\" you are obliged to use its small library of boring sounds-the sounds options for \"new sms\", \"new email\" or \"reminder\" doesn't let you customize its loudness or volume independently.-No option in selecting any song from your library as ringtone, message, sms, alarms sounds-When playing a song from my Lumia's phone library, it doesn't have a possible way for moving ahead or scroll through the song (forward or rewind)-No phone book option on \"people\" (only internet accounts or all mixed)-Contacts have a Fixed platform that does not let you customize the Titles for Phone numbers-On Contacts the list of options for labeling Phone Numbers is short!! or limited.-If a Contact's name is longer than the space on screen, it wont let you see the complete name, it won't show it even if you place it horizontal view..-The Export/Import option (that you have to locate and download) for getting my Phone contacts from my older Nokia or iPhone to my Lumia, works mediocrely and poor, many details were left out...-No \"draft\" folder for SMS-No \"recent\" option for choosing contacts on sending SMS-No multiple selection of contacts on one step procedure for sending sms (as on \"Android\")-No possibility to create custom SMS folders, i.e. saving moms sms-Calendar \"Month\" view too small, unreasonable unreadable, no visible marks, tags, color or water marker for events-No scrolling day by day on calendar \"month view\", neither on \"calendar day view\".-Confusing calendar day view (looks like an endless list)-Only hourly settings on calendar day view (No minutes settings i.e. 2:30, 4:45, 10:15 or whatever) it is set up by default as a unnecessary long list even if empty..-No summary  view of daily set events when day selected on \"calendar month view\" (without having to go or redirected to day view)-let's say you enter a specific reminder on the calendar, and this repeats let's us say 4 days in a row.. Well there is no way to copy the whole thing and paste it, you got to re-write it all on each day independently on the calendar.-No tile color and/or size customize by user (a Tile is like a icon for shortcuts to a desired function or application)-What happened to saving contacts on the phone?? Only on a E-mail account??-if you are entering a phone number that already exists on your contacts (but you don't know) it won't tell you it already exists.-No adding feature of related apps to a single \"tile\" to group them (as on iPhone)-Sometimes people can get dizzy scrolling all the way down (or through) the endless \"tile\" collection  set up you might end up having, trying to make short cuts to phone functions.-They claim Zune (the connection app for PC and Lumia phones win7) is the ultimate software, but then again a set back in evolution.. Is quite a drag having to connect and disconnect your device in order to see or check if the file has been transferred.. (I get \"envy\" my wife transferring, music, pictures, etc from her computer to her cell phone ;-) and vise versa)-Many times when \"editing\" the info of a song (artist, album, etc) this info would appear on your PC but not updated on the phone..-Many albums from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"album list\"-Many artists from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"artist list\"-If you have a long list of music files as I do, with this software \"Zune\" I have to scroll all the way to find an specific music file (no \"find\" or \"search\")-arranges pictures by date.. which is fine, but what about trying to arrange by folder.. quite tricky-No lock/unlock gravity (when leaning to one side on the coach the view changes to horizontal, and that is not necessary what I want)-When I need to write a contact's number in different formats for dialing purpose (i.e. +country code, city, number  vs city code, number, the software will hide one or the other-Only one option for labeling a cell number, many times a contact will have more than 2 cell numbers, but here we have only one option to label a cell number, \"CELL PHONE\" (but only once) How do you label the second cell number? Home? Work? Ridiculous!!-Same thing for work numbers, there's only two \"work\" labels available (what if there are more than 2 work numbers as usually happens?)-No \"main\" and no \"general\" labeling for a contact's number-Only three (3) email addresses can be saved for a contact, and have a fixed label-No phone search, if want to search any thing from one place like most devices (phone search), this does not have it...-When you choose to forward an email, there isn't possible way to edit the content being forwarded.-And so on...*I have found that many users report that Nokia Lumia 900 w7 phone or device SHUTDOWN UNEXPECTEDLY VERY FREQUENTLY having to check constantly if the phone is on.. And find out that has been OFF for who knows for how long.. Can you imaging this? Expecting an important call or text message and find out that the phone has been OFF for who knows how long...  Well, mine is not the exception !!! it shuts down very frequently and unexpectedly, very annoying !!IN THE OTHER HAND If your life is lacking emotions and adventure.. You'll find this phone very amusing and entertaining... And time consuming..-Nice connectivity to the internet, this is more of a internet, social networking device and software... But not a phone!!-Nice prediction help while typing, but needs an UNDO and back/forth cursor option, and improve finger selection-Many things can be \"Pin to start\" (but size and color can't be customized) but then again, you'll end with a long selection of tiles and therefore scrolling endlessly through them to find the one you need to click-\"forward\" is hidden under reply button for sync email accounts..and you better have a 20 20 sightNOTE: I bought this phone because I used to be a Nokia fan.. I have tried to love this device but has disappointed me in a way I didn't expect.. for a \"smart phone\" no so smart..NOTE: Never the less, I see potential in this device, with an update (or Updates, that I doubt would happen) this would be one of the best and complete smartphones! If they ever care to make the necessary updates..Next time I'LL get a different one, but not a windows phone.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$169.99", "Features": "Windows 7.8 installed\nGently Used\nComes with a free case in OK condition\nCarrier Unlocked", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 900 16GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, AMOLED Touchscreen, 8MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio and microSD Slot - White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31i1P4ghjUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008EX8836"}}
