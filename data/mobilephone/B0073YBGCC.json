{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid follow-up to HTC Thunderbolt, but could use better battery life", "Author": "Rocman", "ReviewID": "R2RECI3CJAHIEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Update 1/6/2014]The Rezound has since become one of my secondary phones since my upgrade to the HTC One last August. It's still working perfectly. Although the processor is slower compared to today's quad-core phones, that 4.3\" 720P display actually still compares very well in terms of visual quality. And the camera still produces quality shots. I am using it as a mini-tablet with only wifi access, and it works beautifully._________________________________[Original review May 2013]I upgraded from my first smartphone, the HTC Thunderbolt, to the HTC Rezound back in 9/2012. After over 7 months of daily grind, I feel like I have enough info to give a comprehensive review:Pro:-Gorgeous 4.3\" 1280x720 (720P) LCD screenThis was THE reason I got this phone (I was debating between this and the Samsung Galaxy S3 at the time). This screen is made by Sharp and boasts a full 720P resolution using the standard RGB subpixel system. It's over 340+ pixels per inch (PPI), which is even higher than the Apple Retina display (~326 PPI). And this phone came out in November 2011!! HTC REALLY sucks at marketing. I knew about this phone because I am a tech enthusiast, but when I was in the Verizon store, the reps were oblivious to this fact and in generally didn't seem to know what they were talking about. But I am going off on a tangent. Basically, this display was so good and so far ahead of its time, even today in May 2013, my Rezound's display is still comparable to the latest phones. This thing had the highest PPI up until late 2012, when the HTC DNA came out with a 5\" 1080P screen (also made by Sharp). I personally prefer LCD over the AMOLED pentile displays used in Samsung, LG and Motorola phones, because they produce truer color (google pentile display and you can easily see the fuzzy text and green tint in phones like the Galaxy S3, Razr Maxx HD, etc) and also LCDs are brighter than AMOLEDs, which make them slightly easier to see outdoors, especially when the sun is out.-dual core S3 1.5Ghz processor and improved 4G LTE radiomore power efficient CPU and 4G LTE radio compared to the previous generation used in the HTC Thunderbolt. The phone has been rock solid in terms of 4G network signal since day one. I can't stress this enough - I have yet to experience any network issues. Coming from the Thunderbolt, which was infamous for network issues, I was pleasantly surprised. My Thunderbolt was better than the typical since I hacked it, but I digress :)-Solid build qualityThis is more of a general HTC trait that I really appreciate. Their phones, including the Rezound, just feels more \"expensive\" and solid with much less creaking and squeaking and flexing than say Samsung and LG phones. This was another reason I decided to go for the Rezound instead of the Galaxy S3 - even though the S3 was newer and had an even faster CPU. The Samsung phones just feel plasticky and cheap.-supports microSD expansionI have a 64GB microSD card in there. Combined with the built-in 16GB, I have 80GB of storage on my phone!! It's insane. I love it!-removable batteryThe OEM standard battery which I have reviewed here on Amazon is around $10 or so. I bought an extra one just in case. It's good easy way to quickly extend your battery life (more detail below).-Beats audioThis is more of a wash for me, as I think it boils down to a fancy preset equalizer setting. I admit I am a little anal when it comes to sound, as I prefer to leave it as is so I can listen to it the way the artist/audio engineer/producer meant. But the Beats Audio when turned on does a nice job of boosting the bass while emphasizing the mid-high frequencies. Basically, it kinda makes the music \"pop\" more, which could be desirable when you're listening on the go. I turn this off when I listen with my more expensive headphones, but I find myself turning it on for things like jogging and other more casual listening-Comes with Beats AUdio headset!I got my Rezound from Verizon full retail, which meant it came with the genuine Beats Audio in-ear headset with mic and play control. It was actually not half bad - the thing by itself retailed for $99. I ended up selling it for some extra cash (starving grad student after all), but hey it's a good bonus whether you keep it for yourself or not!-completely hackable/rootable :)I rooted and s-offed my Rezound the second week I got it. It was a somewhat harrowing experience since I had to short out two contacts in the back of the phone with a wire. At first I thought I had bricked my phone, but it turns out I was just being too gentle, and the wire wasn't making proper contact. Once I figured that out, the entire process took about 15~20 min. I've been running different ROMs, including the latest Android 4.2 Jelly bean that's not officially out for the phone (and probably never will, see below).  Rezound has a good developer community if you're into rooting phones!Cons:-battery lifeThe Rezound comes with a 1620mah battery, which is a decent bump from Thunderbolt's 1400mah battery. The larger battery combined with the more power-efficient CPU and radio gives me an okay battery life. I can go through a normal working day on a single charge. My typical day is about 8 hours, with emails/texts throughout the day and maybe 15-30 min phone call. To be honest, battery life experience is very hard to review, as it varies greatly with usage pattern and even network signal strength. It's one of those your mileage may vary type deal. But for what it's worth, I get about 2 to 3 hours of screen on time with one charge. It's not great. The phone is a gas guzzler once you start playing games or navigation (google map). I bought an extra standard battery ($10 or so here on amazon), but honestly I have yet to do the battery swap. My routine gives me many chances to recharge throughout the day, so I just make sure I have access to a charger.If HTC can put the Motorola Razr Maxx battery in their phones, I will be a happy man. As it stands, you should buy extra batteries and/or recharge often, especially if you are a heavy user.-thicknessThe phone is bulky compared to the latest thin phones. I thought about giving it a pass given its relative old age (came out in 11/2011), but I see some empty spaces in the back with the cover off that would have been great for more battery! I feel like HTC should have done a better job optimizing the space - either thin it out or put in a bigger battery.I have a Seidio thin case on there, and I am okay with the size. I don't think I can stand it in something like an Otter case.-slow/lack of software updatesThis one is probably more Verizon's fault, but basically the Rezound is stuck on Android 4.0 Ice cream sandwich (ICS). At least officially. My theory is that the Rezound was a custom phone made for Verizon, and the market wasn't big enough to warrant newer updates. But also Verizon's stupid policy of \"valdiating\" slows down progress tremendously. This issue is solved if you're willing to root your phone like I did. You can then put the latest ROM on the Rezound, which currently is on par with the rest with the 4.2 Jelly bean. However, it is an involved process, and the average consumer should NOT have to resort to rooting their phone just to get the latest software update!Overall, I am happy with my Rezound. For me personally, battery life is the biggest glaring problem. But it's somewhat manageable, although still annoying. I have the grandfathered unlimited data plan, so this is going to be my phone for a very long time. If Verizon ever gets the HTC ONe though...", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall a good phone", "Author": "A.

I'm around a year and half into my 2 year contract on this phones and have had a few freeze ups and battery life problems. However I don't feel that these problems are usually the phones issue and has more to do with downloading aps and software constantly being updated etc. Many times all you have to do is factory reset your phone and you will be back to factory performance, just back up all your stuff.The camera on this phone has been pretty good. I know there are better out there, but this one has been better than any I've had to date.The slide to text option on this phone is not as good as swipe, fyithe size of the phone is not bad. its actually easier to hold in the hand compared to many of the super thin phones I've held.The sound quality is good with an exception. If you turn the volume up above half way it buzzes too much, but half way is plenty high for 90% of the time.Overall its been the best phone I've owned to date. I'm sure something better will is already out there. every three months something better comes along. But this is a pretty well made phone in my experience.

I originally had a Droid X which wasn't all to bad except for the single core and mine having black spots.I did not like the bloatware the Verizon preinstalls on all of their phones. So annoying right? I decided to root mine and installed Titanium Backup and Chef's freezer to freeze most apps and uninstall a few that were safe to do so. It performs much faster than it did with the bloat running in the background constantly.Games are now able to be run at near maximum settings with the one expectation of block story. That game does require a bit more speed to get even higher. Dual core is amazing at playing Temple Run 2.It looks so gorgeous and the colors on this screen are amazing. 720p is nice but I think that it would have been better on a 4.5\" display. You can notice the difference between that and a 480p phone but compared to this and someones 4.5\" the 4.5\" appears much better. You may notice that games don't get quite as high of FPS when compared to a Razr M but those Droid devices don't have to push as many pixels since they aren't full HD.Extended battery makes this a beast! Playing about and hour of games on this, texting, making a few calls and doing web surfing/ebay/amazon shopping for a few hours more still doesn't bring the battery down to far. I still charge it overnight as I want to have the security of waking up to my alarm in the morning.This is no where near a Note II or SGIII or any of the other quad core 2GB phones but for the price it is certainly good buy.Update 10/13/13I have decided to put a ROM on this phone. It does take some time to go through it. Had to RUU to get the latest HBOOT and radios for global roaming. I put Liquid Smooth 2.10 with JB 4.3.0 on it. I have been getting a few soft reboots for no reason. I have tried setting the minimum CPU speeds up, but they still happen. The big problem with this phone if you do put ROM on it is that you need to wipe like 10+ time for anything just so the ROM will work. Annoying even if you do it that some other bug will pop up. Still able to play games, yet this phone is starting to show its age. My extended battery seems to be dropping much more quickly then it use to. Also, I have somehow gotten water between the screen and the digitizer. I have tried using some rubbing alcohol, but I don't think it is reaching down where it needs to be. Doesn't effect viewing that much though.

I first got mine in May of 2012 and within the first two months, I had to do two master resets ( despite having antivirus software on the phone and taking proper precautions). About six months after I bought it, the lock screen button completely stopped working. That was doable but one year into owning the phone, I had problems with the battery holding a charge. I went and got an extended battery but it would still overheat and wouldn't hold a charge (I didn't overuse the phone or have multiple apps running). I couldn't even plug in the charger without having to wait with bated breath to see if it would stay plugged in. Nobody was able to fix it and my research just told me that this happened to a lot of people. The final nail in the coffin was when the USB port within the phone itself broke where I could no longer plug it in at all ( I never abused the phone, it just happens with normal use). Insurance wouldn't cover it and there was no way or repair it, and since the thing broke before I was due for an upgrade I had to eat the full retail cost for a reliable phone.
