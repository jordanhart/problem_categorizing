It has the extended battery which I purchased as an extra. Make sure you turn it off with the power button. There is a demonstration on utube. It`s a bit larger than other flip phones. Nice size buttons. Good for large hands. Don`t believe anyone if they say it`s for small hands. It`s just right. Fits small and large hands.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Trish", "ReviewID": "RYSYFVEYS5XUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this phone! It's unique, easy to use, and all around awesome. everywhere I go, I get comments on it and people asking what kind of phone it is.Pros---stylish, sleek, cool graphics.-easy to use, virtual qwerty keyboard.-flip open design makes it easy to answer calls--No more accidentally hanging up because of touching the wrong icon!-no dorky or boring ringtones! (this may not seem important, but I think it is. =)Cons---flip part can break fairly easily.  I snapped it off accidentally by trying to scrub off something on the clear part--oops. (I was able to superglue it back on though, and i can still call and text.) But if you understand that it can break and treat it as such, it should be fine.- I tried to upload music from my i-tunes account, and it did not work. turns out that you have to buy the songs off the music player in the phone. phooie.Because of the accident mentioned above, I've been needing a new phone. (I can do the necessary things, but cannot touch through the flip screen and such.) I am due for an update and have been searching for something that's versatile, cool, and does not require a data pack. After much frustration over the lack of phones that meet those categories, (they were either ugly, cheap-looking,or super expensive) I came to the realization that i just wanted my phone back. So I am buying the same one. Hooray!All in all, I would definitely buy this phone if you need something that's not too expensive, but also unique from what everybody else has out there. =)", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R33GPXDZQYEL09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great item.
