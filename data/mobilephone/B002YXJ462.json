{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value, Not Cutting Edge- LG Pop", "Author": "J. Devine", "ReviewID": "R18S7QRL9TU3BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Smallest 3 inch touchscreen out there.  Operating system is simple and not to much customization is allowed- no apps just a small set of widgets.  OK Facebook, Twitter and MySpace funtionality. My biggest problem with the set is no 3.5 mm jack- you have to use micro USB headsets instead.  You can buy an adapter.  3 homescreens- first is widget screen second is \"livesquare\" screen, and the 3rd is contacts.  The \"Livesquare\" screen is strange- its a visual representation of you communication log (voice, email, messnger) that is supposed to make tracking ongoing conversations and communications easier.  Seemed easier for me to ignore, but really haven't spent much time trying to understand its functionality.Music interface is usable, but not great, and videos are played through the file manager.  Not very sophisticated.  That said, had no problem playing MP4s which look very good on the screen.  Controls are easy and intuative.Excellent build quality- solid phone feel.Conclusion- I guess you'd call it an ultra-compact touch screen feature phone.  Good if portability is your primary concern.  I load it with an 8gb SD with music and movies when I don't want to carry a smartphone.  Also cheap enough that loss or damage of the Pop won't be too upsetting.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "good enough for the price", "Author": "Im Cubo", "ReviewID": "R3105KPFCSFU6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Obviously is not an iphone but it really work well I like the way it looks is very small, the camera is not that good but if you want good photos buy a professional camera.

I am sure the phone is an excellent value for the money and a good international phone, but unless you can read its manual in French (right!) this purchase is useless. One of the other commentators mentioned that they were shipped a manual in Portuguese, but their order was from UnlockedCellPhoneKings. Mine was from Amazon directly. So BUYER beware. Added to that Amazon's customer support on this one is simply a waste of your time. One of the reps told me quite nonchalantly, it is an international phone, and the product page doesn't mention anything about a manual! Sure. There are better ways (and purposes) of learning french. You sell it here in the USA, why would someone expect you to provide a manual in French or Portuguese. I am on the phone with them right now, and I think I will ask them for a manual in Zulu.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG GD510 \"POP\"", "Author": "Sterling S.

UPDATED: Not a good phone!", "Author": "Randall FSF", "ReviewID": "R2PDM8CT93NDEG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this thing to replace a perviously broken razor.  The phone works great, camera is great (although NO FLASH) and the accessories all are great.  Would not recommend specifically for the music and video players, but overall a good phone.UPDATE:I had to drop the rating for this phone, as after only owning it for 4 months I've noticed some problems.  The memory stick I put in there (standard mini card) sometimes is lost in the phone.  So when I go to take pictures or videos, it will say that it has an \"error reading memory.\"  So then I am forced to use my phone memory.  The video quality is not very good at all.  The USB cable connection, as well as the programs which the phone uses, are extremely slow so what I did was when I wanted to upload something, I took the back cover off and threw the memory stick into my computer (when the memory stick worked on the phone).  This caused the back cover to become so lose that I must use tape to keep it on.  I only took the back off maybe a max of 10 times, so this should not have caused the back to wear out so quick.The alarms are fishy now, me and my wife set alarms for each other and hers are usually earlier.  For some reason when I have an earlier alarm set for her, it disables mine.  Even though they are still clearly ON, they simply do not go off.The battery life is aweful as well.  Texting and calling are ok, but messing with the applications a couple times through the day will make the battery last one day.Overall the phone is not absolutely horrible, but it definitely is not good either.It is also a HUGE pain that the headphone connector is not a normal 8mm jack!  The LG headphones are crap, and whatever kind of weird jack they use wears out way too quickly.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer service!", "Author": "Jbow", "ReviewID": "R3B3Q9E5S6YPE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This company said they would deliver the product by a specific date yet it didn't come and they never told me why.
