{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't expect to much", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3OK0A8I6OS5DU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Nokia C3 is a decent phone, but doesn't do everything that NOKIA CLAIMS.  It will not play all the audio and video formats that they claim it can do, also there is no direct support of software from nokia or from the vendors they promote on their mobile page that will augment it so you can.  It has Wifi capability but with 64mg of SDRAM don't expect to go surfing very far, in some cases I find that I can access a page like youtube but can't watch anything cause there isn't enough ram. In addition, memory storage is limited even with an expansion Mini SD Card.Overall the phone offers physical keys which I prefer over the virtual.  It works fine for texting and talking, also offers various features similuar to a PDA.  As long as your expectations are not to high then this will work, otherwise I recommend the phone I bought my wife Samsung Captivate Galaxy S I-897.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I would not waste money on this phone", "Author": "A. khan", "ReviewID": "RDYDTO13APCXP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The very first thing I tried was the wifi connection. It connected fine, however the browser on this phone does not work. I realized this is the Mexico edition, and all manuals are in spanish. No 3G support, only GPRS, and the browser does not work with the GPRS connection either. This is certainly going back. I really wanted to like this phone. I had a E63 a few years back, which was an awesome phone. I was hoping to get a quality phone, ended up with a big disappointment. No wonder Nokia is doing so bad in the high end phone market. I called their tech support, I found equally  bad quality support. The lady barely spoke English. I would gladly accept an Indian technical support in their place. At least Indian technical support folks are technical.  I have a serious doubt if that support person even saw that phone in real life. The seller charged me 5$ shipping although the phone was advertised as free shipping. Very bad experience overall. Still waiting for the seller to approve my return. I will update the review based on their response.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty miserable", "Author": "Fernand Raynaud", "ReviewID": "R21U9D9NYZIFWF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got one of these phones in Europe to use mainly over there on a pay as you go plan. All 4 bands, 2 MP camera, nice keyboard and color screen, unlocked. It's pretty and inexpensive. Bingo, I thought, I can use it in the US as well for SMS, and I can use it for simple internet tasks strictly when I have WiFi in range! Dream on, dreamer! You know the expression \"too good to be true\"?The hardware is fine. But the software problems are huge. To get the benefits of what turn out to be pretty basic features you have to overcome some major hurdles.1) The design of the interface is miserable. It's even hard to explain. Tasks are accessed from a menu that is programmable. There is an icon menu too, and it's programmable. But where is the full list of tasks to pull into these menus? That's so buried I can only find it by chance now and then. Everything is counter-intuitive. In the end it's more like a Rubik's Cube than anything. I've spent hours trying to set it up. Good Luck. You will also discover its countless ways to unexpectedly go into data mode. See item 2.2) The selection of data modes does not allow you to turn off cellular data completely in favor of WiFi. You never know when it's going to go into roaming cellular data mode. It's like a diabolical billing trap. Sitting on a strong WiFi connection I've repeatedly managed to inadvertently consume all 25 Euros of credits within an hour of trying to use the device solely over the selected WiFi. More than the phone itself cost. Assuming that there is any way to fully turn off billable internet, you will likely spend so much money on unintentional cellular connections trying to figure it out that you will save money by getting a better phone. For instance, you want to change the color theme? Bam, it connects and finds big files to download. The video mode is terrible. The camera is bad. Why do they give you a 2 MP camera? So the phone can run up a bill \"synchronizing\" or sending big files. Do stick to prepaid. I'm glad I wasn't using it on a European billable plan, or I'd be looking at a bill in the hundreds if not thousands. The idea of putting an open-ended account's SIM card in it seems suicidal. I'm going to load it up again with 5 euros and I'm never going to use it for anything stateside but SMSing, and as a basic phone when in home area. The worst it can do then is deplete the 5 Euros.3) The Energy Saver feature requires hitting keys to keep it from turning off the screen. There seems to be no way to change the 9 second time-out. This alone makes it useless. Try reading the news or doing anything other than basic SMSing when the screen keeps turning off unless you keep hitting keys! It's designed to make you hit random keys in desperation, and mine came pre-programmed so that hitting the right key would connect to Plus! data services (see pt 2 above). Oops, there went another 2 Euros.I'm amazed some people like this thing. The positive reviews on the US version must be from people who have never used a decent smart phone. It makes an iPhone seem like it came from some advanced extraterrestrial civilization, whereas the C3 was designed by greedy phone carriers and programmed by imbeciles. I can only imagine using it as a basic phone and for SMS messaging.I've since located a litany of whines on Nokia's site about the phone devouring your account with unwanted data connections. If there's a boxed E or G on screen, you are being ding'ed. There are instructions for limiting this if you have the patience and know-how to follow them and to develop some C3-centric skills. The basic problem is that there is no global selection for WiFi-only. Each app they give you (or that you download) has its own controls and peculiarities. If you \"play\" with the phone it always ends in getting connected and sometimes being completely unable to disconnect. Some of the solutions: Take out the battery, restore factory settings, delete all apps, set to Flight mode then back to disconnect, individually set up each app, delete features w/ your provider, etc etc. Maybe it's manageable if you have the time and patience. Personally, I think it's a lousy design.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hacker's Guide to the C3-00", "Author": "DarthRad", "ReviewID": "R2FOL238LCWRPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Months later, I ask myself, why did I pick this phone and get so wrapped in figuring out how to tweak it until it finally worked like I want?  I guess I just like solving puzzles and taking things apart.Initially, I was mainly looking for a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard, not a touchscreen keyboard, which I hate, that could do Wifi without requiring a data plan with my cellphone carrier (AT&T;).  So many of the full keyboard cellphones nowadays have Wifi, but will not allow you to do Wifi without also having a data subscription.The C3-00 fulfills these requirements.  The biggest downside to this phone is that Nokia has pretty much abandoned all further support for this phone and its old Symbian operating system.  That means no easy way to get the apps you need to do simple things like blocking certain incoming phone numbers.However, because this is a simple, basic, and slightly smart phone (think of it as a C-minus level smartphone), that has been out for some time, the phone is relatively cheap to buy and use, and numerous tweaks are out there posted on the internet that allow you to tweak it.  If you do want a data plan through AT&T; for example, this costs only $10 a month, as the phone uses the older slower GPRS/EDGE  data network.The phone also takes up to a 16Gb micro-SDHC chip to play your music  and store your photos for the 2MB camera (you need the latest firmware, earlier firmware versions only supported 8GB).  It will play MP4s by the way (my son figured this part out).Having said all that, the next thing that has to be said is:  BUYER BEWARE!  There are several DIFFERENT versions of this phone!  I have purchased around 10 of these phones now (one has failed).  Here are the versions I have encountered and what can or needs to  be done to fix them:1.  Regular American/Western standard English QWERTY keyboard.  May come locked or unlocked.  Found on Ebay, AliExpress, etc.  Firmware level highly variable from the  6.-- series on up to 8.70.  RM614  8.71 is the last Nokia firmware update, but there is no American or European version.  The closest you get is the English language Australian/New Zealand/Singapore English QWERTY firmware which works fine.  If you are lucky, you will get one of these with this 8.71 firmware.  Depending on the firmware  level, this type of phone is the closest you can get to having a ready-to-go phone that needs minimal programming/hacking to work properly.2. English QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type with  non-English characters (Cyrillic?)  for certain of the uppercase keyboard buttons which do NOT correspond to what is on the keyboard.  These phones need to be re-flashed with the English QWERTY 8.71 firmware (see above) to work properly.3. Partial QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type.  The uppercase keyboard buttons for certain buttons are blank.  These uppercase buttons will generate the same set of non-English characters as type #2.  These phones need re-flashing of the firmware and a replacement full-set English QWERTY keyboard.  As of this writing, these keyboards can be found on Ebay and elsewhere, and there is a Youtube video that shows you how to take your phone apart to replace the keyboard (need a T4 or T5 Torx screwdriver)4. Cyrillic version QWERTY keyboard with same 8.71 international firmware.  Same fixes needed as type #3.5.  AT&T; Go-phone.  These have a dark blue body and silver keyboard.  Comes with 3.63 firmware WITHOUT WIFI!!!  These were sold really cheap for a time by Walmart, and are now often found on Ebay and elsewhere.  Re-flashing the firmware to 8.70, 8.71, whatever, will place a Wifi soft key on this phone, and allow it to seek out and identify nearby Wifi hotspots.  This indicates that these phones do indeed still have the Wifi chip in them.  However, the MAC addresses of these Go-phones have been wiped out and set to ZERO, meaning that the cellphone WILL NOT CONNECT EVER TO ANY WIFI SOURCES!!!  So far, I have not discovered any hacked software out there that will allow you to reflash a MAC address onto the Wifi chip on this cellphone.  So these AT&T; Go-phones have very effectively had their Wifi permanently castrated by Nokia, most likely at the behest of AT&T;, to force users to use an AT&T; data plan.In regards to re-flashing the firmware:1.  Get the cracked Phoenix Software.  Need a good quality micro USB cable to connect to your PC computer.  See Commentary section below for websites where you can download this software and instructions for how to use it.  The original genuine version required a dongle, so you need the cracked version(s).  Phoenix WILL NOT WORK on 64-bit Windows 7!!  It will work on 32-bit Windows XP and Windows 7.  For those of you righteous legal purists, know that Phoenix Software is a now defunct software no longer being sold or supported, and so the cracked version is not defrauding anybody of their rightful profits.2.  Some sites still tell you to download the Navifirm software to get the latest firmware from Nokia.  Well, Nokia shut down their website for the Navifirm software in early-mid 2013, so forget about using Navifirm.  See Commentary section below for best websites currently to get the last firmware version 8.71.Other reviews have already discussed how to get the phone set up properly to send MMS Multimedia text messages.  Go to the Commentary section below for a full update on the details.  One KEY FACT not mentioned by other reviewers so far is that you need to ALSO change the IMEI number with your cellphone carrier in order to get the Multimedia text messaging to work.Also in the Commentary section is a website description of how to get the Wifi to work.Onwards, to the Commentary section ...", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Okay, but not great!", "Author": "M.
