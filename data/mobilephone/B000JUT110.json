{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A beautiful phone but with some limitations", "Author": "Helen Hancox \"Auntie Helen\"", "ReviewID": "RTIZIG5LU53X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend \u00a3100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great mixed with a couple issues", "Author": "Paola A.

Menus suck, reception is lousy, it has problems with bluetooth signal quality and is constantly telling me to switch to the handset, the battery life is good for about an hour or two at most of talking, the keypad is hard to use because the directional pad has an awkward shape.  I go this phone for free and hate it!  I will glady pay money to get a phone that I feel is functional.  The only good thing about it is the fact that it has a nice one handed opening mechanism.  Thats it.  There is nothing else worthy of even mentioning of this unfortunate waste of plastic.", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Phone's Ok but unhappy with vendor", "Author": "bajan", "ReviewID": "R3TVF6J9198FXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. We reside outside the US but use a forwarder in Miami.Due to unexplained delays in shipping it arrived too late & we've only just received it (Jan 9). This is not all the vendor's fault but their initial tardiness set it up.They took several days to respond to my query re this delay & upon reply only send the shipping details - no explanation or apology.Worse yet all the manuals supplied were in Italian & the phone language was also set to Italian. Nothing in English as was promised.I can't see myself buying from this supplier again.The phone itself seems fine & pretty much what we expected. Can't speak about battery life etc. but having owned other Motorolas (RAZR, SLVR, V186) before we're confident it will be fine especially since we want it primarily as a phone not a multipurpose device.***** Update *****After posting this review I've been contacted by Electronica Direct who have offered an apology for the delay and lack of notification.In addition they offered to refund the shipping and insisted upon it even though I said that the refund was unnecessary.Nice effort at damage control!Let me stress that I have no problem with the phone and that not all of the delay can be attributed to them.As well there are several good reviews so I may just have been the unfortunate sap who got the lemon as opposed to this being the morn.Anyway they tried to make amends and that's the important thing.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Gotta Love The Pebl!!!", "Author": "Heather Jasko \"Crazydropped\"", "ReviewID": "R2F5M22WQLQQU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's bad to say about the Pebl.
