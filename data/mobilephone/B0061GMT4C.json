Amat \"Mugetsu\"", "ReviewID": "R1UDYGEU0VFZQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got one of these just for $#!*$ & giggles, not too shabby!Sony xperia build quality impresses. The phone is not as largeas it looks on one of the original ads (girl must have had atiny hand lol ) the slide mechanism is a little slippery butsolid.As a game device, it's a bit underpowered, but this doesn'tseem to slow it down! Played all games i tried perfectly!Have yet to try it as a phone, wifi only so far.Gingerbread kinda stale by now but, NO ICS for the play.Sony cites instability issues that would compromise thePlay's core strength, GAMING.Custom roms around thought (rooted only, I did root only)The ergonomics of the phone are pretty good too.The slideout PS controller works great, even the \"Digilogs\"?and the device as a whole doesn't feel to clunky in the hand.Only cons are the slippery slideout hinge and the overallGlossiness, which makes it a fingerprint magnet for usgreasballs...lol also wish the white was available toUSA carriers.Edit: UPDATEHaving had the phone for a bit longer I can say that in the openposition the phone is somewhat uncomfortable to hold for longperiods. I have average hands (large) slender and the slide outcontroller feels...to thin, and a bit smallish, leading to handfatigue fairly quick. The L & R shoulder buttons are difficult tomaintain your fingers at, while the touchpads feel to closetogether.Also the power/standby button is pathetically small, a smallsliver really. Sure you can use the menu buttons to wake thephone but eventually you need to use the power/standby buttonand it's tiny...But the phone really is a fun devise even just for gaming.Plus not being massive makes it a decent handset as well.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "E.
