How to set language to English and get manual.", "Author": "MikeF", "ReviewID": "R1U132KLFID5JT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Item stated before I added to cart, that item was from Wireless Experts fulfilled by Amazon.  NOTE -- if you click on item today you  will see different seller.  Click on it a few hours later and seller will be different again.  I have NO IDEA what Amazon is doing.  I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews  about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item.  See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone.  I installed a global SIM from company called\"Roam Simple\" and tested texting and  making calls FROM USA;  it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet.  Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc.  (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity:  In US - fine.  (my SIM connected to  T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one  in your country with cheap in country rates.  Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel  global SIM.Volume fine.  (in some previous reviews people mentioned issues.  )FM radio - works OK.  (NOTE - adjust volume up and down using the center button.)Texting - no full qwerty keyboard so it is texting as it was about 6 years ago on most phones.World Clock,  Alarms, Stopwatch,  CalculatorBattery:  Mine came with  an LG  950mH .. great!  is still showing fully charged.Torch (Flashlight) .. nice feature.  Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No  WEB  / internet access with this model.  I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM:  If you buy a country specific (Argentina)  or  region  (EU)  SIM  then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA.  I bought global SIM for $29.  Check with your SIM provider  BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH:  Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be.  It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site.  Search the LG site for A190.  The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries. (the A275 manual not English  is on the LG Brazil site).ELECTRIC POWER:  The power supply had a USA plug.  I cannot tell if it is DUAL VOLTAGE phone chargerallowing it to be plugged into  non USA 220V power outlets with just a conversion plug.  I will be using aPOWER CONVERTER (search  Amazon for 220V to 120V converters). You may need a converter thanactually is a transformer - converting  power down to 120v.COVERSome people talked about cover problems.  Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch.  Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone,  lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY.  If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple.  (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on:  DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP.  Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up.  THEN slide it up  the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord  is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way.  BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side.  With the power cover appearing to your left,  gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is  slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it  up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE:  My phone's language was set to Portuguese.  To get to English:1. hold down the end-call button (which is also the on/off button) on the phone to power it up.2. press upper left button - Menu3. reply \"Si\"  (yes) using the upper right button.4.

I use a T-Mobile sim card and an international sim card. It is nice to be able to switch between the two sim cards without having to take the sim cards out of the phone - very convenient. The phone is easy to use. The world clock works well when switching between time zones. The only problem I have had is with an SMS message. I wrote a short message and saved to DRAFT. I later recalled it, added to it, and edited the original saved part. When the message was sent, only a very short portion of the message was sent-don't know why.

It works well here, in my case with a T-Mobile SIM. LG, here in the USA could not or perhaps I should say 'would not' help me when I called them as it's not sold for the US Market. I give the phone Five Stars but LG USA a lot less.My phone arrived overnight from Amazon and that pleased me a bunch. I opened the box to find that (1) The instruction sheet was in Spanish and (2) The phone was programmed to work in Spanish. That would have been fine if I spoke or read any Spanish. I then called LG USA from their [...] website to find that this phone LG-A275 is not supported by LG in the USA because it's a phone for another part of the world.I did a bit of online searching and I was not able to find a manual on line.I then phoned Amazon and was connected with their Mobile Phone Tech Support (Good News) - Tracey was able to find a manual on line that was Arabic and English.

I find the FM Radio and flashlight to be unusual function to add to a small cell phone but they work well also.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone for the Money", "Author": "soco", "ReviewID": "RHRIXLQ1NHWF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was a little confused after reading many of the reviews.  I needed an unlocked, quad-band, GSM phone, not tied to one specific carrier--that is, one that would accept SIMs from different carriers I can use in the U.S. and Canada, but also outside North America where my Verizon CDMA phone doesn't work at all.  Though Verizon offers world phones that accepts Verizon-provided SIMs to use in other countries (I have one), the phones themselves are locked to that service provider.  The calling rates typically are $1.50 per minute and more depending on the country.  Add to that connect charges, a few other miscellaneous fees and taxes, and even a brief call can become very expensive quickly.  In this situation, buying an unlocked GSM phone, then acquiring a locally-bought, in-country SIM makes a lot of sense.  That alone would pay for itself in less than 15 - 20 minutes of Verizon talk time.Unlike some reviewers, my phone came in a LG box, with a U.S. charger, Limited Warranty Statement, and a User Guide written in French, Portuguese, and English.  The Guide provides an overview of the phone's features: describing how to install a SIM, how to charge the battery, what the symbols on the display means, what are call settings, and some basic trouble shooting.  Also covered are how to text, use the Tools, i.e., the built-in world clock, calculator, and organizer.About the phone:  The phone itself is small, thin, and very light.  In a medium-size hand, it can fit diagonally across the palm.  The phone is mostly plastic; there's some creak and give when one dials, texts, or when gripping the phone firmly.  Most annoying to me are the tones generated when pressing any key.  Later found that this feature can be disabled in Profiles, under the General Settings tab.  Being as light as it is, the phone can easily be carried in a shirt pocket, or comfortably in the front pocket of jeans.  I would lock the keyboard when carrying it this way, and there are options that automatically locks the keypad after 10, 30 or 60 seconds.  The problem when the keys are locked however, is that one must press the upper left key to Unlock, and then, the upper right key to confirm Yes, every time before making or answering a call.  Not exactly intuitive, but one gets used to it.About the display:  Many reviewers are correct when they say that the display's wallpaper cannot be changed.  I've tried, and can't find a way.  The numbers displayed when dialing are fairly large though.  They are white against a black background, easily be seen from at least 4 feet away with normal vision.  The screen is otherwise brightly lit, displaying the time, date, signal strength, battery condition, ring, no ring or vibrate status, keyboard locked or unlocked, and the local network name.About Dual SIMs:  SIMs are automatically detected, and both are active by default.  With two SIMs installed, it is necessary to manually select which one to use when receiving or placing a call.  Both are simultaneously displayed on the screen along with the MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) name, and the actual network providing the service if different.  When one SIM is installed, the keys default to the SIM in position 1.  So, it is possible to have two telephone numbers in one phone:  one, for personal use, and the other, as a business number.About ringing:  There are 5 ring tones in addition to vibrate only, or vibrate and ring, or vibrate then ring options.  The settings allow these to be individually tailored for each SIM, or for Outdoor (louder), or on a General basis which means that both SIMs are set the same.About volume:  The speaker volume is slightly low by default, but found that the center navigation key will raise the volume to decent levels.  One must be on an active call however to raise or lower the volume. Once set, it seems to maintain the level selected for subsequent calls.  Ring volumes and message notifications can be preset in the Menu.About FM radio:  Only used this feature a few times.  Received a tornado warning for my area while scanning for FM stations one day.  Thought I would never ever use this feature, but with recent hail and tornado warnings, I may reconsider that.  There are 10 presets (labeled 0 - 9), and the radio itself is adequate from 4 - 5 feet if placed on a hard surface like a table.  Reception is what you would expect from a portable radio; just okay.About the flashlight:  Pressing the large center button once, assuming the keyboard is unlocked, turns on and turns off the LED flashlight.  Used it once when I had to unlock a rental car door at night.  The car didn't have a remote, and couldn't see where to insert the key.  Like the FM radio, this is an unexpected feature, and yet, somewhat convenient to have when you do need it.Dislikes:  1. Time and Date; specifying Daylight Savings Time usage; both must be manually set for this phone.  Unlike most phones, this does not automatically pick up the network-provided information.  Once set however, the time seems to be accurate.  The only reason I can think of why this might be, is possibly because of the dual-SIM nature of the handset, where one SIM is local,and the other,international,thereby confusing the phone as to which one to display?  I don't know for sure and merely speculating.  Since we can't be in two places at the same time, the phone for convenience, should display the local date and time.  2. Being small and light weight is actually a plus, but oftentimes I feel my hand cramping after a 10 - 15-minute call because of how I grip the phone.  3. The 3.5 mm jack allows for headphones, but I'm not sure if a microphone can be used.  The LG manual only addresses headsets.  This feature would have been useful in handsfree-only states, or when using the phone for extended periods, or even when typing/multi-tasking.  4. Setup options are not intuitive, meaning that in many cases, one must press OK in addition to other keys to confirm changes.  A little awkward, but hopefully one must do this only once during setup.Likes:  1. Phone size.  Very easy to carry.  Great for travel.  2. Battery is 1140 mA and goes for weeks without recharging.  Recharging the battery when low, can take 4 hours or longer due to its larger capacity.  Don't expect a 1-hour charge and go.  3. Good call quality.  Good signal strength.  I get slightly better coverage in many areas.  Reception is clear, and people on the other end, have no trouble hearing me.  4. Quad-band GSM can be used just about in just about all countries except for Japan and South Korea (different standards), and Myanmar (Burma) where there are no wireless infrastructures.  5. Phone uses the mini-USB charger common to my tablet, Smartphone, and other electronic devices.  Only need to carry one charger or a mini-USB to USB cable with me.  6. Dual SIMs.  I like having the flexibility of having a main number in addition to having an international one.  No need to carry two phones.  7. Price point for a new phone is right.As many reviewers have pointed out, this phone is made for developing countries and not for the U.S. market, where plastics tend to be thicker, and where features like Bluetooth are expected.  Since I only require a basic handset that I don't mind losing, damaging, or use as a spare, and don't really need additional features such as a built-in camera, video, MP3 player, this phone meets just about all my requirements.  I give it 4 stars because it was not intuitive to initially setup, and it doesn't automatically display the date and time from the network.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great achievement", "Author": "Kouadio KOFFI", "ReviewID": "R38R5X17XAAWIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light and practical.

Unfortunately, Nokia Basha 206 is not available on North American market (they only sell smartphones here), so I decided to buy this one because I considered LG a reputable brand. It turned out I was wrong.Pros:1. Long battery life when there is no talk (probably because the screen is always off when the phone is not used)2. Lightweight3. Has a flashlightCons:1. No hardware volume control (and it looks like you can only set the ring volume via the UI)2. The screen and letters on the screen are too small. A twice as big screen could fit in the space unoccupied by the keyboard (or with the same screen size a bigger and more convenient keyboard would fit in)3. Back cover is difficult to open4. Keys are very small5. There is no support for Cyrillic letters. All my old Nokia phones, although they did not allow to type Cyrillic letters, were able to display them. This phone supports only a few latin-based languages and displays squares for Cyrillic letters6. Navigation and control keys are not lit (only number keys are lit). Together with their extremely low profile the phone is very difficult to control in darkness.7. User menu is inconvenient and confusing. Instead navigating the menu I often turn on the flashlight. And instead of turning off the flashlight I often accidentally activate some menu commands.8. Two SIM cards cannot be used simultaneously. You need to activate either one or another.9. FM Radio is bad and noisy. I was able to tune only to 3 stations here in Los Angeles.10. It is impossible to lock the keyboard by pressing a combination of keys. It locks automatically (you can specify the time-out in settings).11. Since the screen turns off automatically after a certain timeout (10, 20, etc. sec.) it is impossible to see time and date and whether there were missed calls.12. It is impossible to change or remove the only wallpaper displaying an ugly flower.Voice quality is average. I can't say it's a pro or con, it's a fact.Overall this is a primitive, inconvenient and basic phone. I would not want to pay more than $10 for it. It cost me $22 (it was $32 on Amazon and I got a $10 discount for applying for Amazon card).

It has a built-in FM radio, but other than that it doesn't have any entertainment value.  It doesn't play music, take pictures, or surf the web.It is however a well-designed for what it is.  It has the basics one expects in every cell phone: SMS/text messaging, contacts list, call history, alarm clock, calendar, timers.  It even has a flashlight! Each of these has shortcuts which make them easier to use, but are not very customizable.  If you want to use this phone, you have to learn its shortcuts or else spend time a lot of time navigating its menus.The following is a description of the \"shortcuts\" of the phone.  These may seem really basic, but basic shortcuts can make a phone easier to use!Menu:  A typical basic phone menu navigated with four arrow keys (the orange outlined button in the photo) and a \"select\" option.  This has an old style of shortcuts many users may not be familiar with, but can save time.  The menu items are all numbered, so if you have frequently used menu item, for example the messages inbox, you can press the menu button then press in order the menus options that take you to that item (in the case of the messages inbox, your press Menu-2-1).  Once you open one of the nine sub-menus, you can allso jump from one to another using the side arrows.Messaging:New Message: Just press the right arrow to bring up a new blank message.  You can type letter-by-letter or using the T9 dictionary (that is, the autocomplete dictionary using the numbers 1-9 common in most basic cell phones).  You can add words to the T9 dictionary, but it isn't as simple as in many Nokia phones I have used.  Once you realize a word is not in the dictionary, you have to delete the letters you typed when you discovered the word wasn't there, it won't automatically replace them with the new word you've added.If you close the message without sending it, it automatically saves as a draft message.Reading messages:It appears that this phone saves its messages on the SIMs from its messages \"SIM1 memory full\".  You can only save about 100 messages on a SIM, including the sent messages.If you get several new messages at one it is a bit annoying that if you read and delete the first message, you are taken back to the main screen, rather than back to the messaging inbox (press Menu-1-2 to got to the inbox).  While a message is open you can go to the next message simply by pressing the right side of the navigation button.Contacts:Contacts are saved on the phone or on the SIMs.  Contacts saved on one of the SIMs will default to automatically calling from the SIM they are saved on.  You can call with either SIM using the option buttons and a short menu.  The phone has speed dialing, but I haven't tried to use it.Radio:The radio does not require headphones (I have known some phones to require this).Alarms:You can save only three alarms (unless you use the calendar Alarm).  When setting an alarm in addition to setting the exact time, you can use a menu option to set alarms for 15, 30 and 60 minutes from the time you set the alarm.... it does the math for you, so you don't have to worry about mixing up am or pm or putting it on the wrong day.Profiles:It only has three profiles, \"General\", \"Silent\", and \"Outdoor\".  It doesn't appear that the names can be changed.  The silent profile can be activated or deactivated by holding the hash key (#). It also has a flight mode, but apart from the flashlight and the clock, I can hardly imagine why you would want to use the flight mode...\"Tools\":  Includes a flashlight (US)/torch (UK) (from the main screen the \"up\" key turns this on), a calculator, a stop watch, and a world clock.  Instead of a count-down timer the alarm can be used (see above). Also includes the somewhat bizarre \"self-call\" feature.  Maybe this can be used to fake a call to get out of boring meetings???Also has basic calendar and memo features.  I wouldn't use these to plan my life, but could be useful to set one-time reminders and to take down short information when a pen isn't handy.There is one quirk I have discovered: The calendar weekly re-occurring events with alarms don't quite work right.  The alarm goes off every day instead of only on the day it is set for.  However, there is a weekly alarm which works correctly.  Some of the other reviews mention other quirks, but these haven't affected me.One final note: I haven't had a chance to test the quad-band feature of this phone, though it is important to me.  I assume from the other posts that it really is a quad-band phone.  It really is unlocked, so I am glad that I can use my Lycamobile SIM as well as a SIM from Africa at the same time.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "purchased for international travel", "Author": "Bryan F", "ReviewID": "R3IESH0TKAIOGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased from seller zezoo.
