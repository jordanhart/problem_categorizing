Why didn't I talk to other people that had a 5s already? It is an oversize phone that is not quite a phablet yet not convenient to operate. Something has gone wrong during screen manufacturing and/or calibration. Screen is so sensitive to touch - sometimes it thinks someone touched it when nobody did. Took the iphone 5s to Apple Store, got a replacement - same issues. Apple store tech politely explained that my apps are buggy. Not really.
