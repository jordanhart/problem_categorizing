Watched a lot of youtube videos on the cell so I knew what I was getting into. I love the qwerty keyboard (amazing typing experience), the touchscreen, the fact that it's an android, the HTC sense, and yes, even the size of the screen (screen size for me is perfect). Always been a 'love at a distance' blackberry fan, but I always had a love for androids. So when I came across this cell I had to have it. Definitely glad I purchased it. Went into this purchase aware of the limitations of memory and battery life, but I have a couple ways around that. So far so good -- definitely LOVE it!UPDATE: Be VERY aware about the limitations of internal memory. You won't be able to load many APPS on the cell even if you send a lot of your apps to an SD card. If you can live with it, it really is an amazing cell. If you use the calendar feature, the reminders pop up on the lock screen and I love that you can slide the button of either snooze or dismiss into the half circle. If you are looking for a simple, user-friendly cell that is primarily used for facebook, social networking, texting, taking quick photos, and email than you have a rare jem in this. If you are looking for a cell that is decked out in a multitude of apps and a big screen, probably not up your alley.Still love it! Still recommend it, but only to the right people that want a simple cell not a tablet/cell but more like cell/pda/social networking.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone, Dishonest Sale", "Author": "Brandon in AZ", "ReviewID": "R3BTAWBYJSFNYT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phones has a great keyboard and decent performance for relatively low specs.  The HTC Status is a great texting and messaging phone; however, overall I found the screen size to be a rather limiting feature.  The phone would have been much better if HTC got rid of the call and end buttons and enlarged the screen.  I would have kept the phone if not for the problem described below.  My three star rating is based on the phone itself, and not the problem with the sale.The point of this review is to warn people about the purchase and seller description.  I purchase from Cell Lounge Inc. and the device was listed as new but it was in fact refurbished.  List correctly if it's a refurb, just say so.  It shipped in a refurbished box and had marks on the phone from prior use.  Also, the contents where not retail packaging.  Amazon needs to enforce seller descriptions.  This is the second \"new\" phone I purchased that was refurbished and promptly returned to Amazon.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck!", "Author": "knatesan", "ReviewID": "REPV5TSNCU6BO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I've always been a little releuctant towards writing reviews and this is my first one. Kindly apologize me incase you find something wrong in it.I've been using this phone for the past 6 months and so far the experience on a whole has been great but not perfect (nothing is perfect in the world). Firstly, there is one significant difference between the Status (a810a) and the Chacha (a810e) which is very important to people who are wanting to use this phone in Europe and Asia. The difference is in the 3G compatability of the devices, they both run on different 3G frequency bands, Status (HSDPA 850/1900 Mhz) and Chacha (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz). This is the reason why you can't access T Mobile's 3G Network (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz) with the Status (a810a). The same goes with Europe's and Asia's 3G Networks (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz). So, if you are looking for a 3G compatible device to be used in Europe and Asia or to use it with T Mobile then get the Chacha (a810e). The Status (a810a) would work fine with all the other gsm networks within the US. Whereas The 2G aspect of both the devices are the same (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) meaning it would work fine in every country. The phone that is being sold here is the Status (a810a) and not the Chacha (a810e).Secondly, and most importantly the phone itself.. Its a nice little phone with a lot of pros and one major con. So, here they are;Pros:+ Great build quality (looks high end).+ Amazing Qwerty keypad (has to be one of the best, very well spaced and way better than blackberry's).+ Dual camera (even though it doesn't work with skype its a good feature to have as most of the other phones in its class don't).+ Htc Sense 2.1 (very well optimized for this particular phone).+ Touch screen (quite responsive inspite of the processor being clocked at 800 Mhz).+ Excellent call quality (haven't yet had a single call drop).Con:- Low internal memory {a much awaited software update was released a couple of months ago by att, which has solved the issue a little but not completely. Even though you can transfer the apps to the memory card (not all), a little bit of internal memory is used by the app. On an average the phone with the update can hold upto 20 apps (good enough for me but could be a problem for the app freaks out there) provided you keep clearing the cache and temp data once every 2 weeks}.Things which I thought which were neither a pro nor a con:= Facebook integration (added bonus i believe, very functional and isn't just a gimmick).= Battery life {many people have had issues with it, but what i believe is that its differs from person to person. Heavy users (3G,Wifi always switched on, Gaming for atleast an hour, High Brightness, Talktime in excess of 2 hrs, etc.) would have to charge the phone twice a day and if you are a normal user like me (using the phone little conservatively inspite of taking advantage of all the features) then the battery would last a day}.= Display (screen resolution is spot on for a display this size, nothing looks pixelated).= Camera (5MP with single led flash which suprisingly takes quite nice pictures but the same can't be said about the video quality which still isn't bad as it fares better when compared to its competition).All in all, its an amazing phone and is great value for money. Sad that it didn't sell as much as it should have because of its minor flaws. I'm glad I bought it. So, what are you waiting for? Go get yours ASAP!P.S. sorry for the lengthy review.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "Sara B.

I just slapped the sim card and memory card from my old phone in, entered the APN information I had from my old phone for 3g access and off we went. If you already have a Gmail account with android market access on it, it will let you download any apps you've purchased, like one I can't live without called Trillian for instant messaging.Beautiful screen, decent camera with a flash that works, nice keyboard, it's a little bigger than my old phone and lighter weight wise. It's also whole lot faster with android 2.3.3 and a qualcomm snapdragon 1 processor. Like others say in other reviews, it's not a gaming phone, but for the person that likes the social scene and texting a lot, it's really sweet and for the price...it's perfect.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "What Memory?", "Author": "Chase's Mom \"mom chase\"", "ReviewID": "R1DBWOF9VRMVR6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the phone because of the combination touch screen and key pad.  The design fits my needs perfectly, however the memory is a huge fail.  If you would like to download more than 1 or 2 apps, this phone is not for you.  It comes pre-loaded with many applications that take up most of the storage space and they CANNOT be removed nor can they be transferred to an external storage card.  I purchased a 32 GB card, only to find out that the pre-loaded applications cannot be transferred. I have spent many hours on the phone with an HTC representative who has basically said the only way to solve my problem is to remove the 2 apps I downloaded or just do a total and complete system wipeout to bring the phone back to its original state, which means all pictures, messages, phone numbers, favorite places, etc. are gone.  It is a hassel to deal with the phone because I constantly get low memory messages, and I only have 2 small applications that I was able to download on it.  I have tried to download additional apps, just to receive a message stating that there is not enough internal memory.  While the phone does give me the option to maximize more space by moving items to the data card, once again, the phone will not permit items to be moved.  I am constantly clearing out the cache just to access some of the phone's basic features.  Also the phone will go on mute in the middle of a conversation when I have not touched the screen, (many times I will be on speaker) and the only way to unmute the call is to hang up and re-dial.  In regards to the speaker, the quality is poor, it barely amplifies the sound.  If you are still considering purchasing this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the internet blogs about this phone model and memory issues.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only complaint so far is that I ordered new and it came used or refurbished", "Author": "suruh", "ReviewID": "R2LQEB5NZ3HSCA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Delivery was fast. Ordered on a late Tuesday night, the package was delivered Friday evening but wasn't expected to arrive until the following Wednesday. So far, I like the phone. It's fast, sound quality is nice. Texting is enjoyable on the keyboard. I'm an android/physical keyboard lover so this phone is great for me. I've heard that the phone's amount of internal memory is a problem for most people. I downloaded about 10 apps so far and they aren't posing a problem. GPS is pretty fast where I am. It's an AT&T; phone but I'm using it just fine on T-Mobile's network. I like that it allows you to set different sounds for different notifications (text, e-mail, calender news, etc). Setting custom mp3 ringtones was a breeze. I'm not big into using FB and Twitter anymore so I can't say anything on the use of the Facebook button or Twitter app. It did come with a FB chat widget upon first turning on the phone. Battery life doesn't seem that great but I don't mind charging it every day before bed. The camera is nice if you're upgrading from a 3.0MP/no flash phone like me. If you've had an iPhone or any phone in that range then it's def a downgrade. It all depends on what you want in a phone. This isn't an extremely high caliber phone like the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy SIII so if you just want a phone for texting, calling, a few apps, a decent social networking experience, then this is the phone for you...especially if you like physical keyboards :) Also if you use instagram, the phone will rotate the app so you have to turn the phone to use it, making the pictures smaller but still visible. Just a heads up. Also I was expecting a new phone but when I opened the packaging, it seemed used. Everything was in unsealed but neat plastic and there was a gray gash on the bottom left corner of the phone. This doesn't bother me that much considering I've been without a phone for a while and I don't want to wait through sending the phone back and getting another one.

I bought this phone because I love the blackberry style, but am an Android fan.  Though I love this phone in concept it NEEDS more memory.  I have almost no aps installed and even with most of them moved onto the SD card I'm still struggling.  Rebooting regularly helps, but it's still frustrating.  I hope that the folks at Android realise how many of us are out there who like a portait style, blackberry like phone but desperately want an Android operating system.Updated June 2013: I don't think I can stand it anymore. It's a great texting phone, but that's it. The lack of memory is one of the most shortsighted issues.  I've tried a factory reset and now the HTC won't authorize the Fb button. I always get a page cannot be displayed.  I can't even do a status updates anymore without an error screen popping up.

HTC cha cha looked good and it was ideal for me. I bought it from UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC. However I received it in weird AT&T; package without any label, only kind of barcode on one side. Normally you have picture of the phone there... the phone did not looked new on the first view as well as user manual was printed on home style printer and is barely readable. The phone was for sure used phone, came without original packing and without proper user manual, no SD card, no hands free set, just phone and battery.I thought I will give a shot to it. So I turned it on and start to play with it... after power on the phone, there was no set up wizard or anything that would indicate that this is a new phone, so my worries were confirmed.After playing with it for 1hr, this phone restarts itself and doesn't stay on for longer than 10 min. It was defected, it is not new as well as you can see signs of use, multiple small dents on the phone, so I returned it to amazon. Be aware that UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC did not ship me new HTC phone but some crap 2nd hand phone that did not even worked properly.HTC Cha Cha review:The 1hr that I was playing with it, I realize that it is actually nice Android phone, the touch screen is very responsive and helpful, the display is sharp, crisp and picture taken with the camera are good as well. This is slightly wider than my old Nokia E71 witch was ok with me. The key board is very good as well.

This is sort of a \"music\" phone I keep at my desk at work to listen to the radio, and I also stream using the Wifi.Other reviews have noted the lack of internal storage, and I would agree. Don't plan on installing many apps because they won't fit. I have a 2GB SD card and a 4GB one. For some reason, the 2GB card will allow apps to be moved to it, but the 4G card won't. I need to troubleshoot this issue further.Otherwise it is easy to use and sometimes I swap the SIM from my other phone and put it in this when I'm going out because it just fits in your pocket so much more easily than a big touch screen smart phone. I did not have any problems getting the APN settings working. The Facebook key seems ok if you use FB a lot (I don't). Push it and you can immediately post to your wall, or select someone elses. Oddly, the least intuitive part of this phone is actually making a call. That takes a little bit of figuring out initially.

It is almost impossible to update to a current version of the apps so I just delete and install the newest version.The RAM is so small you will experience a lot of lagging. Like Viber will take a while before it can open your conversations. You can root it and have all apps move to the SD card. But mostly the bootloader is locked and rooting it is a challenge.Overall, good phone if you don't expect much.

Songs sound good when I play them as does my ring tone.I have an HTC flyer tablet so learning the OS was easy for me. Took me a little while longer to learn the phone operations but the book and an in depth online manual helped me out there as well as trial and error.The cameras are great! I love that it has a front camera. Makes taking photos with friends so much easier since you can see what you are taking and the 5MP rear camera takes great shots. Haven't tried the flash yet. Having this phone eliminated me going out to buy a small camera to put in my pocket book.

I also expected worse battery life because this is an android phone with many more operations than my lousy Gravity T.

It is very attractive and nice to hold in the hand. I also have an HTC Inspire that has been a great phone.Unfortunately, I was not able to operate the phone due to what I consider to be a design flaw in the SIM card slot.The phone \"ate\" my SIM card. I could see that this was a potential problem as the slot, unlike any other cell phone I have had apart (which is quite a few), is like a tunnel with one end. You cannot see if there is a barrier to keep from inserting the card in too far.Knowing the potential that the card could possible be inserted in too far to retrieve, I advanced it in the slot 1/32nd inch at at time testing to see when the phone read the card. It never did read the card (that has been read by several phones). Eventually it had reached the point of no return and I could not get it out of the channel. Therefore I kept advancing it 1/32 inch at a time hoping the phone would read the card. It never did.I was really looking forward to using this phone but had to return it.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "It was ok, but died after about 6 months after using while jogging.", "Author": "John Smith", "ReviewID": "R2C4A46LEDI13U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone worked great for about 6 months until my wife took it jogging with her the first time.

Two peeves, the on/off button is a pain to work because it is flush with the surface, and I get that so you don't accidently turn it off and on, but there has to be a better way. The camera is rather sucky; resolution is poor and pictures are always darker and not very defined.
