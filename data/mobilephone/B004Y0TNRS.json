He doesn't like cell phones but this one was easy to understand and easy to handle with a man's hand. Last month (after years of use with no problems)the microphone broke and callers couldn't hear him talking.  I was very happy to find the same phone was available. He is using it now with no complaints.  In the future, when this one wears out, I know this one will be too outdated to find.  I only hope it will be replaced with a similar style as we are very happy with this one.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hello?", "Author": "Spags11", "ReviewID": "R3E7NRQWVXHA6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was brand new-came with accessories (chargers & a case!)

And so I see Vu204 as a facelift of W385. The top menus and buttons are identical in functionality. Some secondary menus may have more items in Vu204. Vu204 is shorter, wider, slightly fatter, more rounded. The display is slightly larger and seems to have greater resolution - fonts look smoother on it. It looks modern, even now. W385 looks dated, in comparison.Just like W385, Vu204 is picky about its wall and car mini USB chargers, and requires either a Motorola charger, or \"Motorola compatible\" third party charger. Otherwise, \"unauthorized charger\" message will appear. The outer small time display has changed from black-and-white LCD on W385 to color dot matrix. This does look better and brighter, but drains the battery more. I had to turn it off for that reason, and after that could only see time after opening the flip cover.Battery compartment cover is made out of plastic (was aluminum on W385), has a different rounded shape, and encompasses entire back of the phone. The phone sort of \"slides into\" it. As a consequence of this design, I would sometimes take the cover off the phone by accident. It is also not watertight. Both W385 and Vu204 have been in my pocket under rain, and if W385 did not seem to mind, the \"white dot\" water damage indicator in battery compartment in Vu204 turned red, indicating contact with water. I thought that the amount of water was not enough to damage the phone. Later, however, the phone started experiencing software problems, and I had to turn-it-off, then turn-it-on to fix. I went to a Verizon dealer to fix this, he opened battery compartment, saw the \"red dot\" and shrugged: \"what do you want, if it has water damage?\"This is when I put my Vu204 in a kitchen drawer, and went back to W385. I have W385 for 5 and 1/2 years now, it has been in my pocket under rains, plumbing accidents, I dropped it many, many times. While Vu204 is a little prettier looking and has better camera, it adds nothing significant in terms of functionality, and loses in reliability.Just like W385, Vu204 does not show as a USB drive if you connect it to PC. How do you then transfer pictures from Vu204 to PC? There are to ways. You can attach a picture to a text message and send it to another phone that does have an easy file transfer capability. Second way is to use bluetooth for picture transfer. The caveat here is that the other bluetooth device must be compatible. I tried iPad, and it is not compatible (out of the box, at least). I bought bluetooth adapter for PC, Motorola PC850, downloaded application for it, and was able to transfer the picture files between the W385/Vu204 and the PC. The file timestamp was lost, however. I detail this process in my Amazon review of W385, if you are interested.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ease of Use\nCamera\nIncludes: Phone, Battery (used, not guaranteed), and Charger", "Name": "Motorola Vu204 Cell Phone for Verizon", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sZsn64WOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004Y0TNRS"}}
