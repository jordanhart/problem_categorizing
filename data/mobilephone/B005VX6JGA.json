It didn't look new and the phone was definitely not unlocked. Amazon was noisy but not helpful at all. The seller began by saying it was unlocked but became more co-operative when we told him we were trying to get AT&T; to unlock it. Anyone who has done this knows how difficult it can be esp. since we have a live contract with AT&T.; We chose to do this because we had sent the cell to my son in Europe and getting unlocked seemed like the best route. It has taken weeks of 'dialog' and calls. In the end AT&T; has come through and I will release payment from American Express card to Amazon and the seller when we are sure the cell does work. My recommendation is to use American Express because they will back you up in Hokey circumstances like this. Amazon and the seller were useless.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "truly unlocked! great!", "Author": "xxxxx", "ReviewID": "R1AQ3C64VHFQG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "truly unlocked phone! on time and everything. i live in ecuador and itwas easy to configure. it operates fine, and works great.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product, BUT .......", "Author": "bomken kamchi", "ReviewID": "R23O45RTM2SDSR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everyone knows its an amazing phone. so, no need to write about Pros..so, i am just mentioning about Cons:1. battery life is very very less2. volume of another speaker is very low.*(i don't know whether other devices have same problem or not!)*", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Apple4Me", "ReviewID": "RWJKOANBT48S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone did indeed come unlocked.I was able to activate with my carrier and it is perfect.I bought it used here on Amazon.Very happy with my 4S.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone ever", "Author": "L.
