This phone meets my needs, but has a few quibbles.Pros:-Simple, no-frills functionality-Inexpensive-Intuitive usage and interfaceCons:-Construction & materials perhaps a bit shoddy--feels almost like a toy in your hand-Uses proprietary Samsung cables for charging and line out, rather than standard interfaces like miniUSB or a 3.5mm headphone jack-No external volume buttonsEssentially, it works well for basic calling and texting, but enough points are lost in the cons that other devices are worth considering.**ALSO**To the reviewers saying that this device does not work in e.g. India, that is because in the technical specifications for this phone you can see that it operates only on 850/1900MHz GSM bands, while access to India's GSM network requires 900 and/or 1800MHz bands. You can see a map of global GSM frequencies at the following address: worldtimezone DOT com SLASH gsm.htmlBecause this device can only operate on 850 and 1900MHz frequencies, it will only work in the yellow region of the map. Operation in the purple 900/1800MHz regions, including India, requires a device that can access these bands.

Initially I just got it as a temporary phone after breaking my beloved SE Walkman and none of the smartphones being offered by my carrier were appealing to me. Anyway, so far my relationship with this phone has been great. I use it mostly for texting and the keypad is made from a very nice rubber-plastic material. There's a nice tactile response when you push the buttons which I feel helps make typing a lot easier. The overall design of the phone is slim and attractive, and many of my friends have called it \"cute\" due to its small size. I don't know if I can blame the dropped calls on my phone or the carrier but it's not really an issue for me. The earphone/headset that came with this phone are, as expected, of unremarkable quality, don't fit in my ears and the cord is too short but since I hardly use them it's really a non issue.Overall I'd recommend this if you're looking for a simple phone with a few extra (nice) features like a nice \"Bejewelled-like\" game which is strangely addictive and alarm capabilities. I also use my phone to keep a few reminders. Since the memory of the phone (for storing reminders) isn't very big, I have to delete old reminders and this (in a way) helps me remember what I was supposed to do. I use the timer when I'm cooking and the convertor almost on a daily basis because I can't understand temperature in Farenheit units.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "Ammon", "ReviewID": "RBY335DTXRD3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was exactly what i needed.  a simple phone that made phone calls and texts.  it even had the full version of the games on it.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hard to get a basic phone nowadays", "Author": "D. Scoggins", "ReviewID": "R36OT1T3DK5EBN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a phone with no frills. This Samsung E1086 is that phone. I had 2 real requirements. Predictive text and no WAP(Mobile Web/internet). Having come from a Samsung A107 flip phone I had high hopes for this model, most of which were met. I will break it down.PROS:Size and feel of the phone are good, it is all plastic but feels well built.Keypad has a good feel to it and is easy to use.Backlight for keypad and screen is very good.Display is good for a 30$ unlocked phone.Speaking of display when the phone is screen locked and you press a button, the screen displays Time, Date, and missed calls and messages. Similar to the outside screen on a flip phone.FM radio. Very surprised at the quality of reception I get- excellent.Call quality and volume is good I can hear others well and have had no complaints.Reception is excellent. I can make calls and send/receive texts in places that I could not with other phones.Software is easy to navigate, not the most intuitive, but works.Slide door covering charging port, means no pop off cover to fight with.Free game, very bejeweled like with a twist.CONS:Proprietary headphone jack...Included earbuds are rubbish.No \"C\" key, usually for clearing text or navigating back in menus, or bringing up calenders.Contrary to the feature listing organizer, the calender does not allow you to schedule events or anniversaries. Or I just cannot find a way to do it. This is my biggest gripe with the phone.Date format is either YYYY/MM/DD or DD/MM/YYYY no option for MM/DD/YYYY.Flashlight, or torch as it is called, is a joke. You hold the up key on the D pad and the screen goes white and is set on brightest setting. I thought it had an LED on the end of the phone or something, but this is not the case.When texting you have to select an option to bring up special characters like . ? !Box claims 40 ring tones, there are maybe 15, and only 1 is not annoying.For what it is and what I was expecting, I am still pleased with the phone. I would give it 5 stars if the calender had an organizer function. If I discover a way to operate that function I would change to 5 stars.Other phones considered prior to purchase:Blu Mobile Tank  29.99Nokia X1-00 US GSM version 65ishIt is hard these days to find a phone that just calls and texts.

Purchased it along with a Telestial Passport sim card planning to use in Germany, Austria,Hungary and the Czech Republic.  In every country the phone showed \"no network\" or words to that effect.  The description on the Amazon site indicated that  this dual band phone was not usable in the US  but there was no guidance as to countries where it would function.  It would be helpful if the description made reference to doing a Google search for \"GSM bandwidth Country\" to ensure the correct phone was purchased.  Had I done that(or gone to the excellent Telestial.com tutorial site) I would have found that this dual band phone works only on 850/1900 bandwidth and will function  in North America and Central America.  Europe uses the 900/1800 exclusively.  South America and the Caribbean may use the 900 Mhz, 1800 and/or the 1900 MHz frequencies.  South America, Africa and Asia are a mix of the four bandwidths.  It would have been best for me to get a Quad-band phone(850/900/1800/1900), that way I would now have a phone with the flexibility  for Europe and my next trip to China instead of being stuck with the dual band Samsung with limited to North and Central Americaof .

The Phone works just as described - makes calls and receives calls. The usual suite of customizable features are there.

Instructions are a joke", "Author": "Sherman A. Thompson", "ReviewID": "R1YMDZYQZKJP41", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I live in an old natural stone house in the middle of rural central-west Texas. After getting fed up with 13 years of Verizon's so-called \"assistance\" via endless circular customer routing and recorded messages accessed by button pushing I decided to give up my lifelong landline, dump Verizon, and go to a cellphone (which I swore I'd never do).A used Motorola \"egg\" flip-phone constantly dropped calls so I switched to the cheapest basic new cellphone I could buy locally, which was the little \"candy bar\" Samsung GT-E1086i. So far, after two weeks, it has performed superbly.I only want a reliable and easy-to-use telephone, nothing else. If I want to take a picture I have a camera with a 30X super-zoom Schneider lens that will run circles around the best cellphone camera. For clandestine or opportune photos I can carry a little pocket clip-on ballpoint pen camera that also takes movies and can offload into my computer via USB.  If I need the internet for browsing or texting I have a Mac notebook. I don't need a cellphone GPS because I have a Garmin and a Cobra. For FM I have a big WiFi sound system at home and don't intend to walk around WalMart with my arm raised, listening to some local FM station playing music to dip sheep by. All I want is a bloody simple telephone for making telephone calls. PERIOD! ... Maybe I'm old fashioned, but to me a telephone should be a telephone, nothing else. ... All that other stuff might be neat-o for techno-nerds but I detest the complications and bloatware built into most cellphones that do everything but open heart surgery.  All I want is simplicity and dependability in a device that sends and receives telephone calls. Accessing stored numbers on this Samsung is a bit fiddly, requiring several buttons to be pushed instead of just pushing a single button on my old Motorola flip. To summarize, the Samsung GT-E1086i satisfies my needs at about a level 8 or 9 on a scale of 10. (nothing's perfect)I'm elderly and my high frequency hearing is shot due to nerve damage, so a hearing aid does me no good. This little phone can be set to both vibrate and ring loudly. The ring and audio volume can be set where I can easily understand normal conversations in a street noise environment. That's all I need. The battery seems to provide power for a pretty long time between charges. My only gripe is that the instructions say I should unplug the charger also from the wall socket when not in use. Just one more thing to remember and possibly forget where I put the unplugged loose charger. Not a biggie, though.Now for the significant CONS:(1) The so-called user instructions are a joke, apparently written by a cellphone technician with limited writing communications skills. What I needed was a simple, well-thought-out and well-written textual explanation of how to set the phone up and operate it, augmented by lots of pictures and diagrams with arrow callouts of the various features and the buttons that make things happen. The nerdy instructions are overly long, poorly organized and sequenced, in microscopic type, using techno-jargon terms and acronyms instead of commonly used conversational English. (One star deducted)Not being a telecommunications specialist I had my phone programmed by the friendly local net server customer rep.(2) Samsung apparently has a thing for not joining the group. This phone doesn't have any industry standard sockets swo commonly available accessories with standard plugs can be used. For example, if you want to use a mix-and-match set of aftermarket accessories to set up an amplified speakerphone system for home or car, forget it. Don't buy Samsung; buy some other maker's product. It was a hassle to locate a car charger that would work. Also, I don't like stuff stuck into or on my ears except for ear protection at the gun shooting range. The Samsung earbuds that come with the phone and plug into the Samsung proprietary jack are worthless to me. (A second star deducted for the proprietary jack instead of a standard jack.)On balance, though, I'd recommend this phone for basic cell communications.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung GT-E1086i", "Author": "Minnneapolis", "ReviewID": "RVT513STWE3PA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money on this phone.It is like a toy and the voice quality is not very good.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Came LOCKED", "Author": "Sinus24", "ReviewID": "RBA8R7KIB5WRV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A simple calling device, came LOCKED so I had to spend another $5 for UNLOCKING...The band is GSM 850 and doesn't work with my provider Digicel in Haiti anyway.Just another waste of money...
