{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Meets the mark", "Author": "Mjolk", "ReviewID": "R1RIDKJ5UR7GM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought phone as replacement. I needed something basic, essentially need to make phone calls and occasional texting. Phone is capable of browsing but I have that feature shutoff. I don't care much about phone cameras so I have not used it for pics either. The item I got was originally made for Central Europe, so it could be set for Ukrainian, Hungarian, Slovakian and English! Manual that came in the box was very minimal and poorly translated into English on that. I was about to return it and called Amazon; the rep was able to find the actual manual in English (PDF) and pointed me to the site where it was. This manual helped immensely and I then decided to keep it. I travel extensively around the world and I am more of the outdoor type, so it needed to be at least tri band and rugged (this one is quad band). Waterproof and rugged it is, I have had the opportunity to test that already.Device meets its claims and works well in the several countries I've been so far. Quality of call depends on the network and sometimes it gets not so good, but it's not the phone, have same issues with other phones. The only three things that I do not like, but I can live with are:1. the phone does not setup the time automatically as others phone do, you have to setup it yourself. Normally the only reason you would need to do that is when you have to turn it off (it does have a function to keep it offline during flights); and the only reason to turn it off is that in some countries, you need to do that to pickup the provider network in that country. Moreover, if you are going to use a SIM card from that country, then you need to take the battery off.2. When I moved the contacts from old phone to SIM card and then from SIM card to this phone, the phone book came up a bit jumble. The Nokia I had before have multiple entries for a given contact, the Samsung has only 2, so it creates a \"new\" entry for any contact that has more than 2 entries. Have not figure out any way out of that. But I guess is not that critical to have 2-3 contact entries for a single one in some cases and I can always set them up to organize the type of contact by country and/or type of contact entry.3. It does not 'recognize' international calls. What I mean is the device does take the call and you can talk, but does not recognize the number and does not display it when a call comes from offshore, the Nokia I had would display the number always, this Samsung displays 'Unrecognized'. This one is annoying to me, because I get quite a volume of calls from offshore and I do want to take the call, as oppose to taking a call from someone I don't want to talk to. I've been playing with the setting of a contact, using their country code, the '+' in front of the number in the contact and finding that it depends on what country/network the call comes from.Overall, good value for the price. The flashlight that comes integrated with phone is very handy to me when outdoors. Device has a FM radio function that works well. It also has a MP3 player and you can load your own music thru a connection to a computer (cable must be bought separate, but is 2-3 dollars) and software can be downloaded free from Samsung web site. Device is Bluetooth capable but have not tested that. I do like the feature of having multiple alarms (there is a wake up alarm setting that keeps on every day, so no risk of forgetting to set it the night before)Device is also capable of e-mail messages, and have not tested that.Another detail I like is that the phone is built with a \"hook\" that was designed so you can use a string and hang it from your neck for easy access (well, when you are hiking, skiing and otherwise have your hands busy to look for it in a pocket that is difficult to reach, as I said, it is rugged and it is meant for outdoor type people)", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Cool Phone!", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R2X2HPTMZG2R0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very cool phone! I'm currently a contractor in Afghanistan & was noticing my Nokia E5 getting beat up from the harsh environment. I looked at the Rugby II and Motorola Tundra but read too many bad reviews on both phones. (phones breaking mostly) The reviews about this B2100 were positive so I decided to order one. Hey it was less than $100 so there was not much to loose.So far I love the phone! Simple & easy to use. It appears to be very rugged & should be able to survive here. As long as you're not looking for a Crackberry you should be happy with this basic phone, that has a few cool applications added. i.e. World Time & Currency Converter just to mention a few.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "A+ Cell Phone!!", "Author": "Adam K", "ReviewID": "R296WWPVVM5UVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fully Impressed With the ruggedness of this phone! It is waterproof! Mine has spent lots of time underwater. Anti-shock that's for sure! Flash light is bright and handy. The best surprise feature of this phone is how long the battery lasts! I never turn it off and only charge it once a week!!!!! Unreal! Works great as a 'Phone'.. Remember Its not a droid ext... ( droids/smart phones don't go swimming though! )  Down sides of the phone : Not much choices in default screens or views. No key pad for text. Can't reconfigure the main center button. Battery cover is tricky to remove. There isn't any useful help in instructions or on the net! That's the hardest part to deal with in setting up the phone.  Over all This is a 5 star Cell phone. Best one I have ever owned.  That's what I was looking for is a tough \"General Phone\". Not a droid 0r I phone.  7 day battery, Water Proof, flash light and survives Drops/shocks!

Kastl", "ReviewID": "R23T4S7JY8M92A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has a great flash light built in. The phone memory is very small that's why one needs a sd memory car, sold separate.The ring tone can not be adjusted from quiet to louder, which we would prefer. I ordered three phones and all three came with different manuals, one with spanish, one with english and one in russian. Also on the two phones with english and spanish manuals you can choose the languages in which you can send messages. One phone, the one with the russion manual you can only use english or some arabic languages for sms etc. So be aware from whom you order the phone. I found out it was the best if Amazon is the shipper. This is the only with one phone came the cd and the power plug for Amerika, the others had only european power supply plug. The CD for the computer does not work with windows 7, be aware, the computer crashes on the cd, so it's actually not worth having this DVD.The phone is small, feels good in your hand and we bought it for the tropis so it's weather proof and for that reason it's just fine.

Koning \"Your opinions may differ\"", "ReviewID": "R34SDVNIYRH2D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Samsung B2100 phone is repackaged. It comes with a European battery charger and an outlet adapter for USA use. It has a skeleton manual printed up (not an official manual). The \"manual\" covers basic features but is filled with typographic/printing errors and missing words. The warranty you might expect for any cell phone purchased in the USA is absent. To synchronize contacts via bluetooth, I had to purchase an iSynch plug-in for $12 from novamedia in Germany. Even then, iSync did not upload iCal entries to the phone (though it moved entries from the phone to the computer just fine); I'm not sure why. I'm awaiting a response from novamedia about one-way synching. I'm having problems with the calendar feature not being able to delete just one event in a repeated series event input via direct entry. I'm awaiting a response from Samsung UK about that. I'm really sorry I purchased this phone so far. I'm not sure why the seller was not straight-up about no warranty, no USA support, a flunky-error-filled \"manual\" etc. I've ordered what I hope is the missing direct-connect data cable, a real USA Samsung battery charger, etc. But it is not clear which, if any, of the accessory items on Amazon.com will actually work with this phone purchased from or via Amazon. It seems Samsung makes many versions \"models\" of this phone making getting support doubly-difficult. The Samsung/USA on-line chat support did their best, but had to send me off to European Samsung websites to get a pdf \"real\" manual. This purchase was NOT up to my expectations for anything bought from/via Amazon.com.

Tucker", "ReviewID": "R369CTC5500M44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll update my rating as soon as I actually get to use the phone.  Unlike some other reviewers who received an adapter with their European charger, I guess I didn't rate one and have no way to charge the phone currently.  The manuals I received are for Central Europe/Balkans...Serbia, Bosnia, etc.  No big deal, I found the English manual on the Samsung site.  It would have been nice to get going out of the box but I expected some potholes with an offshore phone.  More later.Updated 2/2/2014I'm changing my review to 5 stars.  After purchasing a U.S. charger (Part #ATADS10JBE) and a Samsung data cable, I was able to get this phone prepped for my dad.  He's essentially a phone only guy and didn't want anything beyond the ability to make phone calls and use a bluetooth headset due to a new state law requiring hands-free operation.  The flip phone he had, via AT&T;, did not have bluetooth and he did not want to get a phone through them that would force him to extend his contract.  When I got this phone fully charged I was able to pair it up with his bluetooth headset (plantronics) with no problems.  We popped in his SIM card from his old phone and he was up and running in 3 minutes.  This is a great little phone and as soon as his contract is up, he can jump on a pay as you go plan and save a ton of money.  After he's had it for a while, I'll try and update this review again.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "stopped working after  a few months", "Author": "Lily Nisbet", "ReviewID": "R13MJW5XOPBFSG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this phone as a replacement for my son who had a similar one which was so old was no longer waterproof.
