Although, Verizon was significantly better than my old AT&T; Nokia phone and plan, the phone seemed lacking(dropped calls, poor reception, etc).I still like Verizon as a provider and when the opportunity came to upgrade phones(every two years for free with Verizon) I jumped on this one because:A. It is a Motorola phoneB. It has a camera(although not the best in the business)and a color displayC. It was free to meImagine my surprise when I found the reception quality far exceeded my expectaions. I don't drop calls anymore, the voice quality is excellent, and I just love the speakerphone function.It is easy to use, program, and works better than I expected. I even recommended it to my girlfriend as her contract is expiring and we are both on the Verizon IN deal. We have a long distance relationship and with two V276 phones, I think our airtime conversations will be greatly improved.As I am not a techno junkie, I stayed away from paying extra for the Motorola E815. Although, the E815 did look and sound pretty cool from the description. But, it would have been money out of my pocket and I just wanted a phone with a camera. So, if you want to spend the extra dough, go with the E815. If you want to go with the lower end, but still high quality phone, buy the V276.", "Date": "September 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "5 Stars for Durability!", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1RGBRVKFUGIBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am aware that this is not the \"coolest\" phone in the world, but its the most durable out of the 8 phones I have owned in recent years BY FAR!Anyone who has Verizon service knows the lengths you have to go through to replace a damaged or defective phone!  It is a very costly and frustrating process.  That being said, it is important for Verizon customers to pick durable, high quality phones rather than whatever is in style.I am VERY hard on cellphones...

They had a great deal going on, in fact the phones were free with a 2 year contract. We are both very impressed with the phones. The battery life lasts a long while. He left his uncharged and used often for 3 or 4 days. All phones die off eventually. The camera is of good quality compared to my old V220. Neither of us needed a perfect camera. The sound is wonderful and clear. We were both impressed with the speakerphone. It is very clear and understandable. This phone is a wonderful buy and very good for anyone who is not looking for an expensive phone with an awesome camera.

While at Nextel, I had the same Motorola phone for 4 years.  Not once did I ever experience a single problem with that phone.Since joining Verizon and getting the V276, I have had my screen freeze twice and my antenna completely snap off, which is weird because I only use it when I start to lose reception.  Every night I recharge my phone, mostly because I have to or else the battery will be dead in the morning because it doesn't last more than 12 hours.  On SEVERAL occasions (maybe 30??) I have taken my phone from the charger in the morning noticing that the screen showed it as being completely charged and within an hour have the phone die on me because the battery went dead.  On top of that, I have taken a total of 4 pictures and can only download 3 songs because my free space is completely taken up.  Why do I not just delete stuff?  Well, Verizon/Motorola were curtious enough to give me 30+ pictures and 10+ ringtones that cannot be deleted out of the phone.  I have taken it to a Verizon Service provider (to fix the antenna that broke) and asked them to delete the pictures and they told me that they couldn't.  So now I have to either delete songs I have downloaded to add more or delete pictures I have taken to add more.  Honestly, I wish I would've paid money for a better phone and not just agreed to this crappy free one.  I absolutely hate it and do not recommend it to anybody.  I know Motorola can make good phones because I used to have one with Nextel.I hope this review will help out another everyday consumer.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Motorola V276", "Author": "Sue Jones \"Sue Jones\"", "ReviewID": "R1CSX58S3GTF8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My mom got this phone several months ago.  I really can't speak to all its bells and whistles because even if they were the easiest in the world, my mom still couldn't figure them out.What I will say - the phone has EXCELLENT reception and voice clarity compared to her old verizon motorola phone.Verizon, despite all their commercials, has pretty limited coverage in some areas, including at my mother's house in SouthEastern Michigan - right smack dab in the middle of a major city with cell phone towers everywhere.  All other verizon phones do not work there either, or drop calls after 30 or 60 seconds.  (Including my old Audiovox verizon phone, and those of many friends and family who have visited.) This one works just fine.My mother's hearing is going, and she can actually understand most of the stuff that is said on it.  So, that is all good.I'm thinking of getting one too, so I can be at her house and still make cell phone calls.  I'm a little wary of the reviews that say other features are hard to use - but most of my phones were hard to figure out at first...All I really want out of a cell phone is one that works really, really well where I can't get the maximum number of bars.  Most phones seem to just really poor in those situations.  So, having \"great menu features\" seems pretty moot.  These bad phones are like speaking into a bad teleconference phone that drops the first and last sylable of every thing said - and both people can't talk at the same time like on a land line phone.  Once this people figure out how to make phones that don't do that, I'll be happy.  So far, this Motorola V276 seems better than others I've used.", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Verizon?

I've talked to Motorola and they won't help (talk about lack of customer service and a general bad attitude).

The new model hasn't changed much, so I believe my long experience with the reliablility of the V265 will be pretty applicable to this model as well.  (The V276 has a better camera, but I never used the camera anyway.)The voice quality of the phone is very good.  The speaker phone function is exceptional.  When used in a car, the phone can be placed in the center console, and both the person in the car, and the person at the other end can hear the conversation fine using the speakerphone function this way.  (My wife and I share this phone, so I have experience with this from both ends.)  The connector to charge the battery is finicky, you have to make sure the indicator and beeper shows the phone is charging, because the connector can get wiggled in such a way that it is plugged in, but not contacting properly, and not charging.The reason I upgraded to the V276 is because the V265 phone developed a sudden failure.  When calling there was a static noise at the cellphone end, and almost no voice reception at the other end.  After an internet search, I found out this is a failure that is not uncommon with the V265.  I have a good guess about how and when this happened.  I touched the phone one day and gave it a fat static shock on its antenna.  It was after this I first noticed a problem with it.Considering the important factors, which means voice quality and reception to me, and with the extended warranty I now have, I think this is a pretty decent phone.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Phone", "Author": "Barbara A.

I got my wife and my boss this phone and they are ok with it though wife is not impressed.Pro's:The phone is compact and easy to hold in hand.  It works whether you have big hands like I do or small hands like my wife.Ringer volume is really good.Clarity of sound from the earpiece is good.Call reception is acceptable.Con's:The speakerphone function is barely adequate.  Even with all the bars (indicating good reception), the speakerphone is very choppy and hard to understand.  We've even tried using it while on a walk through an open field with no obstructions and it didn't improve.The menus setup is really bad.  We are not slouches when it comes to using cell phones (I use an XV6600 pocket pc as my phone) but finding common functions like wallpaper settings were not easy to find initially.  The contacts menu is not easy to use and entering contacts is more uncomfortable than painful.  You may struggle with navigating the menus until you have owned the phone for a few weeks.The camera is mediocre as best.  Depending on how badly you need a good picture and don't get it one could describe it as terrible.You can't change the wallpaper on the intro screen unless it is a picture you take.  This is a simple function to include.  Shame on Motorola.No bluetooth withouth an adapter.  There are several phones in this price range that come with bluetooth capability.  Again, shame on Motorola.  (Uhh, Hello, Moto.  Can you hear me now?)Recommendation:If you can live with a slightly confusing phone for a few weeks, then this is the phone for you (it does actually work well for placing and receiving calls).  Don't hang your hat on its features, when choosing a phone, as they are good but not great and in some cases the features are not very useful.  If you need a phone that is easier to navigate and makes more sense, move on to something else.  However, it is one of the better \"low cost\" phones that Verizon currently offers.  I know this because I bought the other major brand of phone that Verizon sells (just look on their website and count the number of phones this other company offers and you'll figure it out) for my staff (8 phones) and returned all but 2 because of quality, ringer, and sound issues.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "not bad but battery is horrible", "Author": "Dr. Leibnitz", "ReviewID": "R1AOCJICGDDORG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone overall is OK.

So, if you have home/cell/work numbers assigned to a contact, ALL 3 will be displayed no matter what.  That makes scrolling difficult.3. The phone construction is flimsy.

I had a motorola 233 prior to this, so it was a big upgrade. I loved my Motorola V60t when I had it with cingular, so i figured this flip phone can't be to bad, and it is a good brand.  It was free, I have minimal needs, so it is good.Pluses:  Small, fun little camera for quick snapshots(300k), good sound, easy to use menus and set up, voice dialing, speaker phone.Minuses:  drops calls intermittantly, battery life is reduced only after one year (my V60t never had this issue), flimsy feel/quality (flip gets loose), can't do anything without a hassle to use photos once on the camera (unless you upload them to a website, download them again, or pay 50-60 bucks for a cable to connect to computer,  just a hassle), and occasional button stickage/misdial speed dials (even when new).I will likely be able to get a better phone next time with a memory card, but as for a lightweight user like me, this is a decent phone that you don't have to hide from other folks with .  Plus, it was free.  If it lasts  me two years, it owes me nothing.Update 10/16/2006-hey, it was free, bound not to last.  Just had to replace one of my two phones after only 14 months due to it suddenly not charging on any charger.  Only cost me 50 bucks, got my phone number transferred, lost some photos, but not bad.

I've had no problem with the battery or the screen or really any function of the phone.I actually get calls while at work with this phone. Something with the building makes cell phone usage nearly impossible, all my previous cells didn't work at all in the building. So that is a bonus. If I do get dropped calls it's generally due to the building and the fact I can use it at all sort of removes the disappointment of a dropped call.I have had some problems where occasionally the phone won't ring and incoming calls go straight to voicemail. My fiance also has a verizon phone (not the same model) and experiences similar problems with his phone not ringing so I believe it is a problem with the Verizon network. Not that I don't get my call, just it doesn't ring and all of a sudden it beeps that I missed a call or have voicemail.The camera phone has been beneficial as many of my friends and family have camera phones and I'm currently planning my wedding and they send me snap shots of everything from decorations to shoes all the time.One thing I'm not crazy about is the way the contacts lists everyone. My old phones if you had 2 numbers for the same person there was only one listing and you selected the number you wanted to use. In this phone every number shows on the list so if I go to the contact section and try to find my Dad, I have to scroll through his work and email to find his mobile number. Not a huge upset but I liked how the old phone handled it better.I've used the Get It Now for ringtones with no problem and even used some of the little features like alarm clock for when I decide to take a nap during lunch :-)Is this phone the most wonderful phone on the planet?

Verizon is an excellent provider in my area (Omaha, Nebraska) with great customer service in my experience. I signed on and could have gotten the LG VX3300 free (an excellent little phone in its own right), but I did want the camera that came with the v276, so I payed an exra $60. Ironically, the camera is a bit of a weak point for me, as the resolution isn't that great and I rarely use it. But the reception with this phone is excellent, and i have never had a dropped call. I am also happy with the battery life that this phone offers. It takes literally 10 minutes tops to fully recharge, and on standby, the phone takes FOREVER to lose bars. Howver, the adaptor that is used to recharge the phone is a horrible design: the end plug consists of 2 little prongs that rarely connect well with the phone. Often, one has to rock the adaptor in to get a good connection, and it  usually disconnects itself. What really does drain the battery, however, is talking. Sometimes just a short conversation with a friend will drain the battery at least one bar. That is somewhat annoying when the whole purpose of a phone is to TALK to someone!

This has to be the only phone that does not show the date along with the time. I never would have purchased this phone had I known this. The only way to check the date is to go into the setup menu and view it along with the time. I can't believe this phone was actually designed like this. Other issues, the picture quality is horrible. I wouldn't expect great pictures from a camera phone, but the pictures this thing takes are useless. Also, the volume control on the side of the phone stopped working after two months. You would think with Motorola's name on it the quality of this thing would be much better.

You cant set a wallpaper, unless its a picture you took. Next the ring tone is awful. I'm not sure what the types are called, but the rings sound like Poor midi's.Next Where's bluetooth? It's not here that's for sure. You also cant use MMC or SD memory cards, Nothing to save the pictures to other than the phones small 2MB memory.Last the Camera. The camera is awful. I'm not sure what the mega pixles are but I can tell you that indoor pictures look fuzzy and dark, and I was under light.This phone is awful, if your looking to \"trick out\" your phone, this one isnt for you.
