It is not the most sophisticated cell phone on the market but everything it does,  it does well.  Really well.  No phone to date has had a battery life like this one.  Its operating system is intuitive and smooth.  It is easy on the eyes.........and let not talk about the price point.  It surfs the internet like a breeze.  Facebook,  Twitter.......Whats App.  All great.  For navigation there is the \"Here- Maps\"  Work perfect.  If you are like me and do not need your phone to act as a backup remote control for you TV and you are not leveraging funds to complete a hostel corporate take-over........you and this phone are going to get along nicely.  It does- by the way- make nice clear phone calls!", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E530CPQ"}}
