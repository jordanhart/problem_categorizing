{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A competent Galaxy Nexus replacement, [KitKat 4.4 update]...", "Author": "Nathaniel Allen", "ReviewID": "R1JTRG1R7FGUUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[updated Jan 27th 2014; OS update 19.5.3 applied -- see paragraphs marked with +++ for my edits][updated Nov 11th 2013; OS update 12.15.15 applied -- increased my rating to 5 stars (from 4) -- see paragraphs marked with >> for my edits]I didn't intend to buy a Droid Maxx on launch day; at least, not until a few minutes before 10am, when I read on Droid Life it would *really* be in stores that morning. I would only stop in to check it out in person. Then... it just happened. If you're like me and coming from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I'm betting this latest batch from Motorola caught your eye, too. I fully intended to wait for the first reviews, maybe check out the oversized Note III and HTC One Max, and see what LG was bringing to the table, but...The Maxx's oversized battery is only part of the attraction. My Nexus had become fickle -- I weeded out a few apps that were absolute battery hogs on that device. While I didn't expect the full two day battery life promised by Verizon, the Maxx had to be at least 2x better than the Gnex, based alone on double battery capacity. But better! After my first 100% charge, I ended my day at 7% after 16 hours off the charger, heavy \"first day with a new phone\" usage, 1.5 hours video, 1+ hours audio streaming, 45 minutes unplugged Nav, forum browsing & posting, futzing with apps, editing this review, Bluetooth headset use, switching between wifi and 4G about 50/50, lots of screen on time, etc. I've since repeated this with up to 23 hour days, 5-8 hours screen time, video & nav, completely off the charger. I've bumped my screen timeout to 5 minutes, and don't bother switching off WiFi or GPS. And if that's not epic enough (for me, it is), there's a \"Battery Saver\" slider on the settings menu -- I haven't bothered to flick that On to see what it affects.Amazingly, the extra battery doesn't come at the expense of size. Held back to back, side to side, end to end, these two phones are close to identical in size. You can get the numbers from the spec sheet, but the Maxx is about 3-4 millimeters taller and wider than the Gnex, and more or less identical in thickness. According to my straight edge, the Maxx's screen even has a slight curve to it, ala the overly-hyped curved glass of the Galaxy Nexus.But it's definitely shaped differently. I ran my Gnex without a case for the past year, and I'm starting out caseless with the Maxx. I don't see it visually, but the Maxx has a \"wedge\" feel to it, where the top end of the phone is thicker, and it slims down towards the bottom. The top end is also heavier. What this means is that, when I'm holding it in one hand, most of that weight is concentrated on my index finger. I'd prefer it the other way around -- with that weight and thickness at the bottom -- where it's resting more on two fingers. I know, I know... we're only talking about 164g according to my scale, but the phone feels more comfortable and balanced when I hold it flipped around like that. Despite the very similar size to my old phone, the Maxx has a definite chunky feel to it, not UNcomfortable, but -less- comfortable than my previous phone.+++ My wife slipped a Diztronic TPU case onto her Maxx, and despite its slim dimensions, the phone feels bulky and unpocketable. My recommendation is to skip the case if you can.+++ If you need a quality holster for this phone and want to run caseless, and don't mind an easy do-it-yourself mod, check my review for this Sedio spring clip unit: Seidio HLSSG4AASAThe phone's back is interesting. It's not the shiny, hard plasticky finish of the Droid Ultra. Instead, it's a very lightly textured (\"rubberized\") but smooth finish, with the appearance of a fiber weave. This finish wraps around the bottom edges of the phone and even around the chin to the face, down by the mic. The bottom corners are all rounded, so they're somewhat comfortable -- not squared off, though not as rounded as the Galaxy Nexus. The back is smooth enough that it -does- gets smudged with fingerprints, but matte enough that they're not easily noticeable. The Verizon and Droid labels are modestly sized, and rather than bright white, are of a dark gray hue that is easy to ignore.All together it creates a package with a hefty, high-quality feel. I never minded the durable all-plastic construction of my Nexus and Samsung's Galaxy lineup -- something many reviewers and forum posters dismiss as \"cheap.\" But the Maxx feels anything but, possibly belied by its flat slab appearance.Interrupting the smooth Kevlar wrap are the power and volume buttons -- all stacked on the right side -- that project from the device perhaps a little more than necessary, and with very square edges and textured surfaces. The buttons don't really jive with the carefully crafted, smooth-to-the-touch backside finish, but then again, there's no mistaking when my fingers are resting on them -- even lightly -- so hopefully no accidental presses.+++ Boot is about 55 seconds to home screen and signal lock [post KitKat 4.4 update; original boot time was 30 seconds, which increased to 45 seconds with 12.15.15]. That's still pretty quick to phones I've owned previously, but nearly double the stock, Day 1 boot time. The busy (and noisy) Droid boot animation, followed by the default red home screen, put me off at first -- it all just feels very \"angry\" -- but as I'm sure you're aware, that's all easily changeable with a good selection of included live and static wallpapers (a soothing blue relaxed the feel of the phone for me; I wonder if the default aggressive red tone -- VZW's Droid branding -- turns off would be buyers at the in-store display).While looking for my next phone, I've been really intrigued by the front-firing speaker on the HTC One. My previous phone (like practically every other phone) was rear-firing, but with speaker placement at the bottom of the phone, where my hand tended to cup it and muffle the volume. Not to mention it was a pretty weak speaker. The Maxx? Surprisingly good, by comparison. The speaker is at the top of the phone, co-located with the camera. It's loud. Even when facing into my passenger seat, the Google Nav directions come through crisply. I've tried to muffle the sound with my hand, like for instance when holding the phone in landscape mode to watch a video, and it comes through loud and clear. The sound is still projecting to the rear, which means the phone is projecting away from me and toward the rest of the room that I'm facing, but it's so much improved over the Gnex that I'm now only partially envious of the HTC speaker.I recall quite a bit of forum debate over the 3.5mm audio jack placement on the Nexus -- some folks absolutely HATE the bottom placement (I, for one, was a fan). The Maxx puts that jack up on the top of the phone, where many users think is its rightful place. I suppose I'm indifferent since I tend to use bluetooth headphones when I'm out. But at home, laying in bed and catching up on some YouTube while plugged in to my charger, I've now got to contend with cords coming out of both sides of my phone.One other design niggle -- wnen using the phone on a flat surface, screen presses anywhere within a half inch of the edges causes the phone to rock. The back runs flat for a few inches from top to bottom (down the spine), but is curved side to side all the way across.Let's talk about the Super AMOLED (RGB) screen. The quality is great. Really, I'm don't feel deprived without 1080p. But, don't hate me for this, I preferred some aspects of the Galaxy Nexus Pentile (non-RGB) AMOLED better. Here's what I'm noticing with the Maxx: - whites look slightly gray, particularly in a dark room - blacks have sort of a reddish tinge to them, particularly in dark - in general, pictures look underexposed (for instance when browsing a news website) - in video playback, the black and darker areas of the screen have better overall consistency than on my Gnex (less noise) - in bright sunlight, the screen brightness can't meet the challenge (so what's new?) - but in dark rooms, it's almost as though the screen can't dim enough (but just slightly so) - the active notifications appearing on the screen aren't ever-present -- the phone needs to be jostled / disturbed for the blank screen to briefly light up and display the current notifications, BUT the phone does not need to be flipped over to activate this (a light tapping of the face-up phone causes the Active Display to light up) - >> the capacitive buttons now dim during most video playback [as up 12.15.15 update] -- nice; they were originally full bright, which was distracting in a dark setting. - there's just the slightest amount of light leak from between the screen and capacitive buttons, over the Back button -- but only noticeable in a dark room - the Maxx pixels per inch (PPI) display density works out to 296 PPI across the 5\" screen. The Gnex screen was slightly smaller (4.7\" -- less if you consider on-screen buttons took up some of that space), so despite it being the same resolution, would have been 316 PPI -- except for its shared-pixel Pentile display. I've seen the case made that the Pentile display dropped the effective PPI down to the 200 range. I can't say I ever took issue with that screen by Samsung, but I could see jaggies on certain websites, and those just aren't present on the Maxx -- this display, overall, appears sharper.There's going to be an adjustment period for me, no doubt, but despite some of the negatives I've listed, I don't consider any of these to be deal breakers.I mentioned the capacitive buttons. Versus the on-screen buttons found on the Moto X and Gnex, these ones are ever-present. Accessing Google Now takes a slightly paused press of the home button before swiping up, vs. the simple swipe motion (no hold) of an on-screen home button. And some older apps still call up the 3-dot menu button which takes up a whole 'nother row (a black \"menu bar\" across the entire bottom of the display). On phones with the virtual buttons on-screen, the main three (Back, Home, and Task) would simply make room for the skinny 3-dot -- making it all the more obscene that when it appears on the Maxx, it takes up its own row. To get around that, I can go into Settings and enable a \"long press of task switcher\" option. That gets rid of the wasted screen, but now I have to remember which apps use this long press to access the menu (and some apps only do this on certain screens). This should be less and less of a problem as developers update their apps, as I believe the standard for the OS v4.0 and higher is to display the menu ellipses at the top right corner of the application.+++ Speaking of OS, my phone came with Jelly Bean 4.2.2, but units shipping now ought to have KitKat 4.4 installed (or otherwise readily downloadable via an easily access \"Check For Updates\" selection in the Settings > About Phone > System Updates menu). If you're coming from a Gnex, KitKat is basically the same, only snappier. If you're coming from Ice Cream Sandwich or Gingerbread, I guarantee you'll be impressed with the smoothness and overall look/feel of this operating system.I'm still setting up my various apps and checking them for compatibility. I'm not going to attempt to generate a comprehensive list of what does / doesn't work, but here are some quick notes: - +++ As of the KitKat update, FoxFi is no longer compatible for WiFi tethering. You'll have to resort to USB tethering instead. - >>> As of 11/12/13, FoxFi is compatible for tethering. It *requires* a PIN-enabled lock screen (not pattern) due to some VPN nonsense that I admittedly don't completely understand (FoxFi was great on the Galaxy Nexus, and didn't require this) - +++ Google Wallet tap-to-pay IS FINALLY supported with as of the KitKat OS -- an app I've been running on the Gnex since about week one.  Cruel irony, my purchase of the Maxx was my last Google Wallet NFC transaction before the KitKat update (Verizon clerk: \"Oh, I've never seen THAT before!\" as I swiped my Nexus across her payment terminal) - YouTube updated me to version 5.0, which I was not yet able to access on the Play Store from my Gnex or my TF700T tablet - Swype keyboard is working A-Ok, and pops up nearly instantly when called - +++ Nova Launcher is working A-Ok; mic icon in \"persistent search bar\" (shortcut to Google Now) calls up the voice recognition screen nearly instantly; [new KitKat option for transparent notification bar works as demonstrated on Nexus KitKat devices] - Sound Profile app by Corcanoe is A-Ok without any of the problems / workarounds experienced by Galaxy S4 users - The stock Android dialer app has been enhanced to allow dialing by first or last name, or partial phone number -- nothing new for users of skinned versions of Android (Touchwiz, Sense, Motoblur) or other OSs, but a feature requiring an aftermarket app for stock Nexus users - +++ \"OK Google Now\" is quick, responsive, and so far pretty awesome... but less so with a lock screen [New with KitKat: with user permission, the phone allows certain voice commands to process even if the phone is locked; actions requiring an unlock allow the user to speak the PIN code] - \"Set alarm for ten a.m.\" used to take me directly to the stock clock app, even though I had alternate alarm applications installed. No longer; I'm now given the option to default to whichever one I choose (tested with Timely and Alarm Clock Xtreme); no such luck with \"set timer for three minutes\", which still just sets an alarm for whatever time is closest to 3 minutes from now - As expected, logging in with my Google credentials automatically downloaded all my apps and contacts, with the exception, oddly enough, of Facebook - Not exactly an app, but the brightness slider from the main pull-down menu is very picky, doesn't like switching back to \"Auto,\" and times out quickly -- but works fine from Power Control widget - +++ There's a bug in the task switcher where not all open apps appear -- including the app I'm currently using (this originally was the same with the Gnex, but was changed in a recent OS update). [This seems to have been partially resolved with KitKat -- it still happens, but less frequently.] - +++ [Settings > Apps now has a dedicated \"Disabled Apps\" view to allow me to see all the unwanted Verizon pre-installed goodies I've exiled from my app drawer. They used to appear at the bottom of the lists.]+++ The Camera [post 12.15.15 update & post KitKat observations]: I'm now super happy with the camera. Images were always as sharp as can be expected from a cell phone, with good, natural colors. There's no longer a problem with highly contrasted scenes (original firmware couldn't handle bright backlighting, such as under a canopy of trees with a bright sky in the background). I'll continue to rely on my compact camera outfitted with an Eye-Fi Mobi when I'm looking for best clarity and dynamic range, but the Maxx's results are definitely suitable for everyday, in-the-moment type shots. Under KitKat, Tap-To-Focus has been replaced with \"Drag-To-Focus:\" drag the focal bracket anywhere on the screen to set the focal point and exposure; tapping anywhere on the screen releases the shutter. Holding my finger press captures a multiple exposures at a rate of one frame per second (and displays a convenient counter), great for automatic GIF animation by the magic behind Google Plus (which I have set up to auto-upload my pics). The updated camera UI moves the mode dial to a large arc along the left edge, and utilizes that nifty \"twist yer wrist\" technique to pop directly into camera mode from sleep, like the Moto X (and no unlock PIN required). There's also a half-decent slo-mo video mode, which is fun for well-lit scenes of fast moving objects, or just a honey bee landing on a flower. The HDR mode is incrementally improved with OS 4.4 -- still not on par with true 3-frame HDR post-processing, but an acceptable substitute for scenes where compromised lighting would otherwise challenge these rinky-dink sensors. As of the 12.15.15 update, the camera software now appears to be updated as an app in Google Play, which ought to mean no more delays waiting for Verizon to vet the software via their \"slowest in the biz\" OS update process.The flash is dimmer and yellower than what I've become accustom to on my Nexus, but this is only evident when I'm using it as a flashlight. In flash-filled photos, the camera's white balance is adjusted appropriately for the non-exactly-white LED, and as long as my expectations aren't too high (i.e. subjects are within 6-10 feet of the camera and I'm not trying to light a whole room), the photos seem to be adequately focused, and in a matter of only a second or two. But don't expect you're going to freeze any poorly-lighted motion with this shooter, and expect to see a good amount of noise at full rez. This isn't a Nokia, after all!The operating system is pretty dang close to stock Jelly Bean. Motorola threw some extras in there for the camera and photo sharing, plus a widget or two, and of course there's a whole bevy of Verizon bloat including NFL, MyVZW, visual voicemail, VZW nav, etc... even a caller ID service that sneakily activates, then tries to enroll the user for monthly billing. But with 32 gigs of memory on board, a little attention paid, and the ability to quarantine these apps, they're hardly a bother. The phone's interface is pure Google.In that list of apps up above, I pointedly mention the delay-free call-ups of the Swype keyboard and the Google Now microphone icon. Launching these actions had been increasingly bogged down on my Nexus, I believe due to memory management issues. Androids TRIM memory management in Android 4.4 should prevent that on this phone.+++ The \"OK Google Now\" voice wake (well, really, it works when the phone is already awake, too) is shaping up to be more than a gimmick. After an initial \"voice training\" session in a quiet place, I OK Google Now'd my phone where it sat on the passenger seat cushion. \"Navigate to work\" (work already being defined in my Google Now account) and, bingo, I'm hearing Google's familiar, clear directions. Same with text messages to my wife, and setting an alarm. One step closer to hands free. With KitKat, many actions such as Navigation or alarm settings can be voice-initiated without entering a PIN or Pattern unlock. If I dictate a text to my wife, after voice-composing the message and verifying the recipient, the Maxx will prompt \"Say or type PIN code\" before sending, for a true hands free interaction!+++ Although regarding pin/pattern unlock, the Maxx offers up a cool option (excuse me if this is old news -- new to me) to recognize trusted Bluetooth devices, and gives the option to leave the phone unlocked as long as it remains in range. Think car, smartwatch, a generic USB dongle in a home or office PC, etc. -- the phone will only lock down when it \"walks away\" out of signal range of one of these trusted Bluetooth devices. [However, I've deactivated this built-in feature for a paid app called SkipLock, which does the same, but with WiFi, too, and it works extremely well.]Oh... face unlock makes a reappearance, too. I actually used that a bit on the Gnex.I can't post this review without mentioning the all-important connectivity. The radios are great -- both 4G & wifi. - In my basement, where I've struggled to pull a 3G signal on the Gnex, I maintained a 4G connection on the Maxx, which allowed me to download apps (initial phone setup) while watching an HD video on YouTube - On the main floor of the house, where my signal would flip between 3G and 4G on the Gnex, the Maxx operates decidedly in 4G territory - At work, one room in the office far removed from the wifi antenna would consistently go to zero bars (yet, frustratingly, not lose it completely and therefore would not switch over to the strong 4G signal), I now have at least one wifi bar accompanied by a usable flow of data - Overall, switching between wifi and 4G on the margins seems improved vs. what I had before, though even with \"ignore weak wifi connections\" checked, the Maxx at times seems indecisive about switching from one to the other. If I have one wifi bar that's trickling data, and a 3-bar 4G signal available, the choice should be obvious - No problem with Bluetooth connections; I'm stoked that I now have full integration with my Ford's Sync system, with artist/track tagging from Pandora, and read-out-loud messaging with canned replies - Voice call quality overall is excellent. This is one of Motorola's strong suits, I hear. I'm impressed.Do you remember the iPhone 4's \"death grip\" problem? It seems that in marginal 4G areas (like that signal-quashing basement I mentioned), turning the Droid Maxx to landscape mode and holding it with both hands causes it to show a drop of 5 to 10 dBm off the signal strength meter (Settings > More > Mobile Networks > Network Type and Strength). If I'm already in the (low strength) -115 to -120 range, this results in me completely losing 3G and 4G connectivity. Releasing one hand brings the signal back to life. Where my 4G signal is strong, the signal drop is there, but my connection remains intact.I've taken GPS accuracy for granted for a few years, so I was surprised to notice the Maxx's sense of direction may be slightly off. I use Google Nav frequently, and on a couple of occasions, the Maxx seemed to think I strayed off course onto the streets vs. getting on the freeway on-ramp, or exited when I really stayed on the highway, and as such gives me a fast re-route and impossible directions. It (well, Google Nav) then quickly corrects itself. I'd chock this up to accepted errors in compacted urban driving environments, except that the Gnex, previous Garmin devices, and Ford GPS simply don't exhibit this behavior. It would only be a problem if I already screwed up and missed a turn, but this nevertheless results in confusing instructions. Though other than those relatively minor blips, location setting is fast and mostly accurate, even in many indoor settings.Another point to mention: Heat. My Galaxy Nexus often ran hot. When it did, I knew it was busy with something that was burning through the battery. This phone has run even hotter, both times in the car plugged in. The first was just downloading apps, the second was also running Nav with the screen on the whole time. But I've yet to see it run this hot outside of the car, and in fact, in the car running Nav but not plugged in, and not downloading apps, is was perfectly cool (and only lost 4% of the charge over about 20 minutes of Nav + screen-on time). So I'm guessing the heat comes from the 4G radio and processor working overtime switching cell sites, transferring data, and unpacking / installing applications, though again, this isn't the case when it's doing those same tasks sitting still in the house (and on 4G).Check back. I'm sure I'll have some more detail to add to this already too-long review as I get to know this phone, particularly with respect to battery life, application compatibility problems & successes, and more observations on the radio switching & possible \"death grip\" issue.But in summary, I'm sticking with my title -- this phone may have some issues here and there, and it may not be the fastest/biggest/most beautiful/polished specimen out there this late summer and fall, but in my opinion it's the first suitable contender to supersede the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and betters that phone in a number of key areas. I have a great deal of confidence in Motorola at this time -- both in their tie to Google, and their strong affiliation with VZW. Thankfully, if you're tied to Verizon, you've suddenly got a few good choices after a long drought.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great phone", "Author": "Brian M.", "ReviewID": "RH6MACXZFVC6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the first reviewer here on Amazon, I was moving from the Samsung Galaxy Nexus to...something with a battery that lasted more than 8 hours.  Overall, I liked the GNex, but I had gotten to the point where I had to charge the phone mid-day even if I hadn't taken the \"darn\" thing out of my pocket.  And sometimes it got HOT in my pocket, again even though I hadn't pushed a single button.  I had a total of four batteries for the phone because if I was traveling, I could easily go through three in a day.I had not intended to pick up Droid Maxx on release day.  I figured I would wait and see what the reviews were like, but I stopped by the store anyway to check it out.  And I was hooked.  BTW, Motorola Migrate is awesome.  It would be even better if it also put on the same apps you had on the old phone, but moving my pictures and music with my contacts was a big bonus.Battery was issue #1 and I knew that it couldn't get much better.  My wife has the iPhone 4S and both my boys have Droid Razr Maxx phones.  All those phones are pretty good when it comes to battery life.  I hate the iPhone because I don't find it easy to use and Siri is an idiot compared to Google.Anyway, I immediately went on a trip to Washington DC with the new phone and despite HEAVY usage pretty much all day long, I still had 32% battery at the end of that first long day (it is my work station on the road).  The next two days were even better since I wasn't downloading so many apps. BTW, the Moto rep was in the store when I got the phone and talking to both the rep and the technical specialist, they twisted my arm to get the wireless charger.  I don't think I will ever go back.  It is supposed to be the best charging method and you don't have wear and tear on the charging port.  It is really sweet!I love the screen.  Despite the fact that phone is nearly the same size as my GNex, the screen is larger.  It is clear and I don't have any issue with the colors.  I let the phone auto-adjust the screen brightness to save battery and it works well.  I am not a screen purist, so others may disagree.We routinely spend weekends in a area that ranges between one bar of 3G down to no reception.  My GNex would be dead in about three hours while it struggled to get a signal.  The Maxx had 62% battery at the end of the long day.Signal reception is excellent.  Like I said in our trip to the sticks, the other phones in our party had little or no signal.  The Maxx had better reception than all other phones. The GNex always had a very weak signal (often zero G) in my office, while the Maxx has three bars of 4G.Call quality has been excellent.  There is a tiny bit of hiss when the other party is talking, but otherwise there is no background noise at all.  I've not got the best hearing in the world, but I can hear the other party quite well.The final battery test was at work. If I had minimal phone use during the day, my GNex would be at 10% battery by 7pm, sometimes less (even with a higher capacity battery I purchased at Amazon).  After a full day at work, the Maxx was at 82% battery.  That sealed the deal for me!", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compelling, except for a few fixable things", "Author": "G. Frank", "ReviewID": "R3QUG9PK7BYR19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone integrates elements designed by Google/Motorola and Verizon. I can definitely see which company has its act together and which does not. (hint: VZW should stick to building networks)+ Battery life is truly amazing, and is actually as advertised. 2 days without recharging. Moto has done really well.  This is by FAR the biggest selling point of the phone - and it's a very important one. It's as transformative to the phone's usefulness as broadband was to computers.+ The wifi and LTE radios are much better than my wife's iPhone 5.  Cleaner switching between multiple 2.4G and 5G access points throughout the house, and better rural LTE reception. Also amazingly, the LTE radio doesn't drain the battery at the pace other phones seem to experience.+ The 720p AMOLED screen is great, contrary to what others say. I can't see pixels on even the smallest text. It's bright enough in daylight, and can go to a blacker black than others I've owned.+ The ROM is pretty close to stock, with the exception of Verizon stuff (see below).+ The voice control is wonderful. I can say \"OK google now, play a song by Adele\", even in the presence of background car noise while driving, and without touching a thing it'll start Spotify and play Adele. (I don't like the Google Play Music stock app but it lets you select which app is used for auto audio play).+ The UI is buttery smooth irrespective of apparent CPU load. Finally, an Android phone as responsive as an iPhone.+ The case and screen feel good to touch and hold. I won't be (voluntarily) testing how strong the Kevlar is, but it looks solid. The phone overall is bit too wide to hold comfortably, particularly with the nav button on the lower left which causes one's thumb to have to really reach for any backup action on a web page, for example.+ Motorola has free live human tech support for this phone for any questions. People on web chat, backed up with good searchable documentation. Very responsive, minimal waiting.- It's full of Verizon crapware. NFL football, VZW Navigator, VZW Backup Assistant Plus, VZW Tones, etc. These can be disabled in most cases (except Backup Assistant Plus), but cannot be uninstalled, at least with the stock ROM. Backup Assistant Plus crashed the phone repeatedly to the degree that I had to do a complete factory reset - 3 hours after having got the phone. Seriously, when will VZW learn that their apps suck and if people want them they can install them themselves. This is by far the most negative aspect of the phone and I nearly returned it because of this.  There are Amazon apps also installed into the ROM by default but I don't mind these - I'm an enthusiastic Amazon customer so I'd have installed them anyway, and their apps actually function, in contrast to Verizon's.- Even though it has NFC, Verizon has again blocked Google Wallet.  They haven't provided an alternative because their Isis service hasn't been launched yet. So they are shutting off the market till THEY are ready.  Shouldn't there be an antitrust case about this? I find it preposterous. I should be the one deciding what service I use to pay with my money, not Verizon. If their Isis service is compelling when it's launched, I'll use it. But don't block me from using a service that is running now, that I like, and that is supported by a device that I paid for in full.  All this does is to make me distrust Verizon.- The Miracast screen sharing and \"Droid Zap\" file sharing apps that are hyped in the ads are gimmicks. Miracast sucks anyway, Google Chromeplay is better and I can't see why they didn't opt for that. Droid Zap (a simple file sharing technology) requires a receiving phone also of the Motorola persuasion, so that's unlikely to be useful to most people.- The back is not removable (probably to accommodate the battery shape required for its amazing capacity). So you can't keep spare batteries for long business trips, but you won't have to. There is no SDcard slot. But it's got 32GB built in so that's OK for most uses. Frankly I'd rather have the battery capacity.- Brightness for the navigation buttons cannot be changed. They're permanently bright, even if the screen is dimmed, so these act as an involuntary flashlight shining in your eyes when you watch a movie, for example. Brightness control apps like Lux cannot control them either.  You have to root, which I don't want to do with a new phone (and there aren't ROMs out yet that can use the voice control anyway).- The presence of special features such as always-awake voice control via that custom low-power chip means that this phone will probably not have that many custom ROMs written for it in the future. At least not ones that include all of the phone's nice features.  Which means that one would rely on Verizon for ROM updates - and they have a terrible track record for updates. The Verizon Galaxy Nexus \"toro\" phone for example lagged 4 releases behind Google, despite their promises that it would stay up to date with Android releases as a Nexus phone. I don't trust them to update this phone competently so I have to be happy with the ROM being static the way it is on release day, even though Google will continue to release improvements to Android.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why I chose the Droid Maxx and ditched Apple", "Author": "A. L. S.", "ReviewID": "R2MN5HA1XV9ENK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to go over every spec of the Droid Maxx, as better reviewers have done so, but I do want to describe my overall experience with moving from an iPhone to the Maxx.I have been an iPhone gal since smartphones burst on the scene. It was time to upgrade, so I had an iPhone 5s on order. But the shipment got messed up, so the Verizon guy suggested I try out a Droid Maxx while I waited. Despite being an Apple gal, resistant and entrenched in that ecosystem, he bet me I would end up getting the Maxx. You know what? I did!Not only is the price, screen size, standard memory size (32 gb) and battery life much, much better on the Maxx, this phone is way more useful and comfortable than I could have imagined. Even though the initial switch was somewhat terrifying and quite time consuming compared to an iDevice, the Android platform lets you customize absolutely everything. By most accounts, the allure of the iPhone is that it's the most elegant and easiest-to-use smartphone, and that may remain true, but you can change very little on it, and for me, suddenly having access to the world of Android phone customization and free mega-storage through Google+ pulled me further from Apple. Especially as I could easily migrate all of my own music from iTunes over to Google, getting free cloud storage of 20,000 tracks for my personal music burned from my own cd's-- iCloud stores only iTunes-purchased content for free.Once I got familiar with it, the Maxx' especially tight integration into the Google world (Google owns Motorola) made navigation, voice control, notifications, weather, etc. all flow together in much the same way that Apple's services/features overlap. And I actually found that Google Now responded and behaved at least as well as Siri, if not better. It's also very cool to be able to wake up or find my phone with just my voice, even if I'm way across the room. Three times already I've located my lost phone in very strange places that would have eluded me!I still love the simplistic beauty of Apple's hardware and software, but honestly, in the end, I skipped this iPhone 5s cycle because the Droid Maxx did do what I needed it to do (lots of web surfing, music/video playback, email use), on a screen big enough to actually see, for a very, very long period of time between charges, all with product features that matched, or bested the iPhone 5s. In every way, that is, except for the camera, unfortunately. Despite a 10mp capability and a recent software tweak by Motorola, the camera is still inferior to many smartphones'. The update did improve performance in low light conditions, and outdoors shots are fine, but the indoor flash balancing is still quite substandard. I personally have found the camera to be just fine for my needs, but if camera specs are critical, this phone won't stack up. Maybe the announced update to KitKat will include more fixes?In the end, though, I would definitely recommend the Droid Maxx to anyone thinking of leaving Apple right now. The Maxx stands up in just about every way to the iPhone 5s, and then some.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone Yet - Incredible Battery Life", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R2ZGUVBZLZGSKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a lot of different Android phones since 2009, and this is the best experience yet. After getting things set up I am really impressed with it. It really feels like a polished and premium phone experience. It isn't too heavy or thick, but feels a bit big in the hand compared to my previous Galaxy Nexus. The new Motorola features feel very well done and if I had to switch to stock again I would miss them.ScreenThe screen looks great! It is a huge improvement from my old Galaxy Nexus and it looks very hi res to me. It looks very similar to my iPad 3 with the retina display. The colors are rich and it is easy to read everything. I have seen my friends 1080 screen and I don't see any difference. The lower resolution means it runs more smoothly and it uses less battery. Great decision by Moto to go for the 720 screen. As for the size, it is plenty big. I would compare it with the HTC One or GS4.Power/SpeedI was not really expecting much after hearing that it was just a dual core processor. But after using it for a few hours I am VERY impressed. I move instantly in and out of apps, switch apps quickly, and I can still use the phone just fine even when I am updating lots of apps in the background. I have tried out the GS4 in the Verizon store a bunch and it has plenty of lag doing these things. Samsung has never put much care into optimizing Android for their phones.LooksIt has a smallish Verizon logo on the back at the bottom with no logos or other BS on the front at all. This phone is a bit bigger than my Galaxy Nexus before this and takes a bit to get used to. It just feels bigger because there is not much curve in the corners of the device like there is with the Samsung smartphones. It doesn't have that awful design from the previous models where the device isn't an actual rectangle thankfully. I would compare it in size almost exactly to the HTC One.Feel/Build QualityThe phone feels great in the hand and doesn't feel heavy at all for the size of the battery inside. In fact it feels plenty light. It is definitely lighter than my Galaxy Nexus with the extended battery (~2200 mAh) and much thinner too. The matte finish on the back is very nice and gives it a really quality feel. In the previous Droid Razr series the Kevlar back felt a bit much because it is much thicker. This new thin model has the best feel of any smartphone backing I have tried lately. I guess I am not a fan of the aluminum backing the HTC One has.ButtonsThe biggest downer I had about this phone was the built in buttons as opposed to the on screen ones. On the older apps it shows a bar at the bottom of your screen with the menu icon. Then I found out you can hide that bar at the bottom and just hold down the multitask button to see the bar. I got used to it in a snap and now am happy to have the extra screen space.AppsAs for the usual Verizon crapware, there is plenty of it on this phone. Thankfully with the disable app function I was able to kill all the ones I knew I would never use. Once I did that it was almost just like a clean phone, with the exception of a Verizon login and widget I couldn't get rid of.Active NotificationsThis is a really cool feature. I wasn't expecting much here, but I was pleasantly surprised. When it senses movement or when you get a notification it fades the pretty looking messages and fades them away after a short period of time. It is very minimalistic so you won't be bombarded with a bunch of text or icons. Because they fade in and out you won't need to worry about screen burn in. You can select what apps are allowed to use the notification system. It really feels like it is a new stock Android feature, not just a Moto specific one.Motorola ConnectThis was a hidden easter egg for me. I didn't hear anything about it until I saw it on the phone. It is a Chrome extension that allows you to send and receive text messages, view recent calls, and receive notifications all from your browser. I installed the Chrome extension and I was up and running right away. It is very polished and well done for a first version. It has a very Googleish feel to it, like it was integrated into stock Android. Now that I have used it for a month I can't live without it. I can quickly reply to texts without breaking my stride doing work.Battery LifeI am a pretty light user, but I have been really impressed with the battery life. To go over 2 days without charging with normal use and still have 44% battery life left is pretty amazing. Even on heavy usage days I have been very impressed with the battery life. I played a game for 2 hours straight and only saw a 4% hit in battery life. I downloaded over 20 gigs of music with less than a 10% hit.I have gone from always worrying about my phones battery life to not even thinking about it anymore. I feel like we have finally reached where smartphone should have been all along. It is a great feeling to not need to charge your phone much at all anymore. For my business I needed a phone where I didn't need to worry about battery anymore. This phone passed test that with flying colors!PricingI have seen a lot of talk on tech blogs that this phone is overpriced. I am not sure the logic there because the iPhone 5/5s was/is $299 for the 32GB model. The Droid Maxx is less here on Amazon and has a battery nearly twice the size. For me it is a no brainer since the Moto X is $199 with only a 16GB option on Verizon and a smaller battery.Wrap UpThis is a solid phone. I am really impressed. I would give it a solid 9/10 or even higher. This is the best Android experience I have used over the Nexus 4, GS4, HTC One, and Galaxy Nexus. If you have Verizon this is a must buy. If you are not on Verizon then just know that the Motorola X phone will be a great experience. The only downside there is the smaller battery size.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "From a typical, low-hype smartphone user: This is a really great phone.", "Author": "Piotr", "ReviewID": "R1FQMFMQSPUWK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is way better than some of the other reviews make it out to be. I was between this and the LG-G2... and I am so happy I chose the Droid Maxx.1) Battery: I am a moderate smartphone user. I work in a hospital where I get calls/texts/pages on my phone. I text, call, use e-mail, calendar, do quick searches on medical apps, and listen to Pandora in my car. When I unplugged my phone the first morning, I had 85% at the end of the first day, left it unplugged overnight, 50% at the end of the second day, unplugged overnight again, and ended up with 25% around 2:00 at which time I plugged it in. The battery really does stand out in this phone.2) Reception is great. 4G LTE all around the hospital, and even still good 3G reception in the basement. No complaints.3) Stock Android 4.2.2 with VERY minimal Verizon bloatware, and the Motorola specific features are mild, and even useful. The Chrome texting extension is nice to respond to text messages while I sit at the computer.4) Snappy, snappy, snappy. I had an HTC EVO 4G LTE (Sprint version of HTC One X) that had a 1.5 dual core, and the Droid Maxx's 1.7 dual core (X8, whatever) processor really holds up much better. Google Maps/Navigation snaps right up on screen, finds the address. Browsing is quick. Switching tasks is seamless. Pandora starts right up with no wait or lag when selecting options.5) Unlocked. You can use this phone with a SIM card you buy abroad. Or with an AT&T; SIM, whatever. Travel a lot? Get this phone.6) Nice screen. The screen is the typical over-saturated AMOLED screen, but honestly it was strange to me for about 5 minutes. I'm used to the colors, and actually prefer them. The HTC had a more \"natural\" Super LCD screen, but it's NOT a factor in my opinion.7) The AMOLED screen allows for \"Active Notifications\" which is actually a really nice add-on to this phone. Basically, the phone senses when it is taken out of a pocked, picked up off a table, shifted to be used... then it pops up the time and any notifications onto the screen with minimal battery use. You can then delete the notification, or open it up right then and there. Sounds silly, but it's a really nice, elegant feature. The screen is pretty close to \"edge-to-edge\", though not like the LG-G2... but it's really not that big of a difference. Difference between 720p and 1080p is SO hard to see on a screen this small, that I'm surprized people actually care. Less pixels=less strain on the GPU/CPU, lower battery consumption. I don't need super-high def to read an e-mail, high def is overkill anyway. Period.8) Solid build quality. The back of the phone \"probably\" isn't Kevlar, but the soft-touch/rubberized backing is really, really nice. So much so, that I have decided not to get a case for the phone since it looks so nice, and doesn't attract fingerprints. The backing is very similar to the TPU cases you buy here anyway. The phone has got some solid heft to it, but I like that.9) Camera is ok. There are probably better cell phone cameras, but I don't take a ton of pictures on my phone. It's really good enough for those times when I find something funny to show my friends... you know, once a month MAYBE. I wouldn't say it's bad, I'd just say it fine. Similar to the HTC One X.Well, that's it. I'd highly recommend it. Actually, I already did... to my co-workers. They're impressed, as was I. I'll keep you posted on anything that changes, but I'm sticking to it that this is a great phone.UPDATE:Had this phone for about two months now, and it has only gotten better.1) Touchless Control: I tried out the \"touchless control\" and it works really quite well (note: the phone has to get to know your voice, so if you have voice texted on an Android in the past, chances are the phone knows your voice well because it connects to Google, which learns your voice. If this is your first Android, it'll take about 10-20 commands for it to get good.) I am able to do a lot without touching the phone. HUGE NOTE: it will suck battery much quicker. I still can get two days, but it won't go into the second night and into the third day like it does with touchless control off. Hence, I keep it off.2) Very stock Android. I mean really, none of that Touchwiz/Sense stuff going on here (although, Sense is pretty nice) but I will say, I really like the stock, snappy feel of this operating system. The nice thing is that with Touchwiz/Sense, some RAM is used up since it's basically a \"skin\" on stock android, here, you don't have that. Nice.3) Battery. Still a big wow factor. Unplug my phone Friday morning, drive out to my friend's cabin up north Wisconsin... forgot my charger. Phone lasted till I got back Sunday night without going into the Red (granted I didn't use it much since I was having fun up north). Really useful when your group splits up at the bars late on a Saturday night, and you are confident your phone still has battery to call them. Way up in the sticks. Nice.4) I got the Skinomi screen cover and it's really nice. The material doesn't attract fingerprints, and lets my finger glide on it (not stick to it like the glass screen). It isn't glass smooth, more orange-peely, but it's still SUPER clear. And, REALLY easy to make it perfect. No bubbles, perfect fit. (it's a wet application protector, so once it's on the phone, it can be re-positioned for a couple minutes as it dries so you get the perfect placement)5) Like I said, I haven't gotten a case for it, and there are still no scratches to the back of the phone. Like mentioned, it's a rubberized backing material that honestly feels like a TPU case itself. I still don't think this phone needs the case, and I'm going to stick to that. (if you drop your phone a lot, that might be a different story, but I don't)CONS: Not many at all, really. It's a really, really nice phone. This is what smartphones have been aiming for all along. Nice screen, battery, feel, reception, storage, etc... The only things:- Home screen does't wrap around (so what, right? It doesn't bother me, but there you go)- Running Applications button sometimes needs two attempts to get it to work. Maybe my fingers are too fat, who knows.- Contacts' pictures don't sync with Facebook like they did on my HTC... really missed that, so I found an app that works REALLY well: HaxSync ($4, I think). Now all my contacts have HD quality pictures uploaded straight from Facebook.- When connected to Bluetooth, it plays at full volume through my car stereo. That's good, but when I go to change the phone volume up/down, it gets quieter. It's hard to explain. Basically, I just have to use the car stereo to regulate the volume (duh, that's fine) not the phone. There is a setting that popped up the FIRST time I connected the bluetooth, and I just quick hit 'Accept' without reading it... that was probably the problem. Just FYI.That's it! I really recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best device I've ever used.  Period", "Author": "Chris R. Hotz \"Real reviews.  No fake 5-star\"", "ReviewID": "RQ2NOTPKYR9G7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the Droid Maxx, the phone introduced AFTER Google purchased Motorola, it does not have Motorola or Razr in the name.  I upgraded from the Razr M, a device I really, really liked.  The M is small with a good sized screen, and extremely tough.  I had no case or screen cover on it and dropped in countless times and it still worked flawlessly.  I upgraded to the Maxx because I was due, and I have kind of wanted a phone with a bigger screen ever since trying a Galaxy S3 a year ago (which I returned after a few days because I absolutely hated it).  So enter the Droid Maxx.  I know my way around phones, but am not an IT guy, so I'll bullet why I love the Maxx from the perspective of a 'regular guy' user:-Screen feels huge, but the phone doesn't.  Why?  I have no idea.  I lined it up with a Galaxy S4 and it's the same size, but it feels smaller to me for some reason.-The operating system is pretty close to native Droid.  It doesn't have a bunch of added stuff like Samsung and HTC put on their phones.  What it means is the thing works flawlessly.  One of the things I hated about the G3 was random applications would open for no apparent reason, and all the stupid tips and tricks loaded by Samsung felt like those old HP desktop computers when you first booted them up.-Simple to get up and running.  Two exchange mailboxes and one gmail was an absolute piece of cake to get going.-Battery life is nuts, but by now everyone knows this-Device feels really tough, like my old M.  I can put it in my back pocket and sit on it with no worries.  The S3 always felt about to break.-Feels good in the hand, heavy but not too heavy.  Yes it costs more, but I have no idea why someone would buy an Ultra for a tiny weight savings considering the battery life on this one.-Google now.  You program your own voice, then say \"OK Google\" and the phone will wake up and you can get directions, set appointment, call or text without picking it up.  Very useful when driving-Call quality is excellent (Verizon)-Quirks:  Has none.  Not yet anyway.  Doesn't randomly get hot like the Galaxy did, doesn't freeze up (like the Galaxy did on the 2nd day), etc. etc.-I'm a gmail/Google guy, so if you have a gmail account, this thing synchronizes everything very well.  Probably not unlike an iPhone with iTunes.  It offers a lost phone/wipe service for free, which I really like.  I had a third party one on my M, but it's nice having all this stuff linked to gmail.  If I lose my phone, I don't have to remember what I did with the third party website, how to log in, etc.The two things about this smart phone that I suppose you could consider as negative are that it's not very exciting looking like the HTC One or S4.  Looks like a garden variety, generic Droid.  But I don't care.  If you do, get a prettier phone.  The second is the lack of an SD slot.  This is a  non factor to me though, as the device has 32G of memory.  By the time I come close to needing that much space it will be several years, and I will have upgraded by then. In fact, to me native memory is easier than using an  SD anyway.  So in conclusion:  The Droid Maxx is, in my opinion, BY FAR the best Droid device, and probably the best smart phone currently available.  CNET calls it the best Droid, so they agree.  My wife has an iPhone 5s and you can't compare Apple to Droid anymore.  iPhones are great; they always work and are super easy, but from a technological and configuration standpoint there really isn't any comparison.  And now that Google owns Motorola, I'll bet these devices keep getting better and better.If you are an iPhone user tired of Apple's schtick, you could do a lot worse than a Droid Maxx.UPDATE:  It's been about three weeks, which is plenty of time to have discovered quirks or things I don't like.  And I have found none.  Not one.  This smartphone is amazing.  I bought the Speck brand case and a screen cover, and am absolutely thrilled.  All the apps run great, and the battery is just plain crazy.  I got three days out of it last week.  Even when it is down to 8% or so, there is still plenty of time left for a few more calls.  To get the three days I turned it off at night by the way.

As much as I loved that phone, it was time for a replacement. Over time the GNex was not able to go more than half a day without being charged and it began having signal problems. So in comes the Droid Maxx and so far it has been nothing but spectacular. Battery life and signal have been stellar. I was able to go a full day and half without having to charge it(with heavy use) and I have had no problem keeping signal. In fact, in the office I would never get a 4G signal, but with the Maxx it seems like it is always locked into 4G.Other than the great battery life and signal, this phone really packs a punch. Thanks to the X8 processor, this phone really flies and can compete with any phone on the market. No performance issues so far. Also, all the extra goodies(touchless controls, 8 cores, active display, Zap, wireless charging) that Motorola has included in the Dorid and X phones are a welcomed addition to the Android world, before long I am sure that they will be standard features on the Android OS.The build of the phone is also solid. I know many say that the current Droid's look ugly but I am a fan of the carbon fiber look, so to me the Kevlar looks great. Then again, looks are always subjectiveTo wrap it up, let's just say it's an awesome phone for anyone looking to upgrade or is just interested in having a great and reliable phone.P.S. The GNex is a developer phone so it is easy to unlock the bootloader and go crazy with it. This phone is not mod friendly. Motorola has track record for not letting you unlock the bootloader. Meaning that rooting, Custom Roms, and any additional developer hacks will not be possible.

At first, I loved it. The battery life was unparalleled. We're talking a 20 hour travel day that included constant connection to wifi, picture taking, listening to Pandora, using Facebook, internet, and all other apps and by the end of the day, I still had 32% battery life.But recently, stuff has started going wrong. The other day, the sound randomly came back on (it had been on vibrate), and I couldn't get it to switch back to vibrate. No matter how low I turned down the phone, it still showed that there was sound. Then it kept crashing. It has crashed 3 times in the last week for seemingly no reason.

Having played with the Maxx for a while before purchasing, I can say that I feel that this is the most compelling upgrade you can move to today that gives you pretty much the best of everything you could want in a cell phone.  I will note that I will make some comparisons to the Galaxy S3 in my review, as that is a modern cell phone that many people use as well as the phone I am just coming from.Starting with the packaging, the phone comes in a standard size smartphone box with all sorts of 'DROID' labeling and such.  Within, we find the phone, a dual usb slot wall charger, manuals/warranty information, and a card telling you to join Google's Ingress AR game.  Everything is fairly standard, and I'm glad there aren't crappy headphones included, as I would have just thrown them out anyway as they are usually terrible.  The SIM card comes pre-installed into the phone (the sim tray is actually the volume rocker now, which is an interesting decsion, but is nice not to have an additional port on the side).Overall the feel of the phone is nice - there is a certian degree of 'heft' to it, especially coming from a Galaxy S3 that is very lightweight, almost 'airy.'  Some may be put off by the additional weight of the phone, but I feel its nice to have a phone that actually has a presense in your hand and doesn't feel like you can just fling it away with the flick of your wrist.  The phone is also decently thin, but not too thin in my opinion - it sits well in my hand (I usually wear a Large men's glove) and I can generally do anything on the phone using just one hand, same as I would have on the Galaxy S3.  The texture of the phone is incredibly premium feeling - the kevlar backing make the phone feel great and has a nice degree of 'stickyness' (its not sticky, just can't think of a better way to say it) to it that makes sure it doesn't slide out of your hand like gloss plastic can sometimes.  The power button and the volume rocker on the side both feel sturdy and have no rattle to them like my S3 did, and both have a solid actuation to them when depressed, not squishy or non-existant.  The device also makes use of capacitve back, home, and window buttons, which is unlike a 'stock' android experience where the buttons are on screen, but I actually prefer it this way, as the buttons do not take up my screen real-estate.  A micro-usb port sits at the bottom which is nice and tight with the charging cable.  The headphone jack is at the top, the camera is in it's normal spot, and overall, the device just feels great in hand.Powering up, you get the standard 'DROID' boot screen, which I don't really care for, but it's not big deal - you really only see it once at first boot and then if you have to reboot, you see it again.  After going through the normal registration process of setting up your Google account and getting the network setup, you boot into what is basically stock Android.  I must say, using stock Android is so much nicer than the Touchwiz skin on the Galaxy S3.  Less bloated menus, easier access to the information you want, etc...some may like the additional 'help' afforded by other launchers, but I'm really fond of the stock experience and what it does for you.  Customization of the phone is simple as it is on any other android phone, but there is a fair amount of bloat installed by verizon, pretty much all of which can be disabled in the app manager.  Most people will be changing the \"DROID\" noise monikers, and rightfully so - they're annoying.  I will say though, that the Droid Command center, the stock clock/weather/battery widget you see, is extremely helpful - it contains the clock with access to your alarms, weather which is set to geo-location and other locations you define, and a battery meter that also flips into a quick settings button to access your settings.Actual physical interaction with the phone is fantastic - the transitions, loading times, and overall 'snappiness' of the phone is so much better than the Galaxy S3 - there is no percieveable lag like I had on the S3 between home screens, and loading programs and menus is much faster than the S3 and even faster compared to my friend's Galaxy S4, which sports a newer, Snapdragon 600 processor.  This leads me to my next point - while some may be saying that Motorola's X8 computing system, which comprises of a Snapdragon S4 Pro and 2 other contextual processors is 'old tech,' there is no evidence that this phone is 'old' or slow at all - it runs things faster than the modern Galaxy S4 can in my opinion.  Phones are more than their benchmark scores, but even this phone scores at the top of the field with it's benchmarks as well.  You are not going to feel 'behind-the-curve' with this phone at all - everything is fast, fluid, and runs without a hitch.  Motorola put a lot of work into this computing system, and they hit a home run in my opinion.Using the phone as an actual phone is good - call quality is excellent, and the phone can get louder than you could ever need.  The dialer itself is a little sluggish in my experience, but I believe that's due to the phone searching your contact list with every number you enter.  The speaker phone is loud and clear, and your ring tones are easily audible.  The vibrate function works well and is strong enough to feel in your pocket, but there is no customization for vibration intensity and you can only choose from a few different vibrate patterns.  On a side note, another thing I wish the phone wouldn't do is vibrate on every notification when the phone is set to vibrate only - meaning that if you have your gmail notification set to not vibrate, if you have the phone on vibrate only, a Gmail will make the phone vibrate.  The Galaxy S3 did not do this - certianly not a deal breaker, but just something I wish was different.Signal quality has also been better than any phone I've had previous to this - my office is somewhat of a cell phone hell, and I would usually switch between 4G, 3G, and 1X with my Galaxy S3 at any given time at work.  Now, with the Maxx, I have a solid 4G signal at all times at work - this makes me really happy.  Motorola has always been known for its radio and antenna technology and strength, and it is certianly showing here as well.  Bluetooth works well on the same topic of wireless connections, easy to pair, holds a good signal.  The wifi radio is strong as well and works all throughout my house connected to my wireless-n router.  I have not had to use NFC yet, but it exists in the phone.  Wireless hotspot works well also.The screen is sufficently bright and vibrant, which a lot of color saturation, which is expected of a AMOLED screen.  Some people may lament the lack of a 1080p screen on a modern phone, but I honestly don't see the need - at a near 300ppi (which is the most the human eye can percieve), everything is crystal clear and sharp and I don't see my self needing anything sharper.  The color reproduction is great -whites are white for me, blacks are blacks, and I don't feel any other colors look washed out or poor - I like the screen a lot.  As an extention of the screen, the capacitve buttons at the bottom glow at all times the phone is on - something that may irk people, but personally I haven't had issue with.The camera has had its fair share of pro's and con's - though it appears that this will be changing in the near future for us Droid Maxx owners - Motorola's ClearPixel tech is supposed to allow for better light getting into your photos - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  For me, it seems to be neither here nor there at this time - pictures can look really good, or can look kind of bad.  But in my experience, it's been the same as compared to the pictures I would take with the Galaxy S3.  The new updated camera software for the Moto X has been released and is going through Verizon testing right now, which means it will hit the Droid Maxx around the same time (the Maxx and the Moto X are the same phone from a hardware standpoint with Camera and SoC).  From what I've seen of the new software, photo quality has been greatly improved, so we'll see how it goes.  Overall at the moment though, I am satisfied with the camera.Now as for what makes this phone unique compared to the market, you have the active notifications, the touchless control, moto assist, and the BATTERY.  Active notificaitons has to be the most useful feature I've ever had on a phone to date, and is something I wish could be baked into Android itself (but can't be as this feature requires an AMOLED screen to work).  While your phone's screen is off, when you receive a notification, it 'pulses' this information on the screen for you, using only a small portion of the screen to let you know what the notification is, such as a Gmail.  Taking your finger and sliding the notification bubble up, you can get a quick glimpse of what the notification is for, and you can either open it from there, or just release it and let it go back to sleep, all while never fully turning your screen on, which saves power (and in my observation, it certianly has).  No longer do you have to wonder what the blinking blue LED is for - your phone tells you what notifications are going on.  I don't see how I can go back to any other phone with a notification LED anymore - this really is a game changer for me.  Between emails, texts, tweets, or whatever, the phone lets you know what is going on at all times, and you don't take a battery penalty to do it which is fantastic.  The phone also recognizes contextual changes as a part of this - if you leave your phone upside down, the screen won't pulse notifications until you flip it over, or if it's in your pocket, once you lift it up to look at it, the notifications come to life.  As a side benefit to this whole system, I've probably only hit the power button a handful of times in my tenure of ownership because you can wake the device up from the active display.One thing that I do miss is the inclusion of a microSD port - while the phone does have 32gb of storage onboard, having an external memory card for photos or music or movies is something I do miss.Another feature baked into active notifications is Motorola Connect, which allows you to connect your phone's notifications to a Google Chrome browser extention, allowing you to see your notifications from any Chrome browser.  I have to say, this is pretty cool, as it allows me to check my notifications while in a meeting at work without having to look at my phone.Touchless control is also a great feature, though its one that takes some getting used to.  After training your voice to the device, stating the phrase \"Ok Google Now\" allows you to control your phone without having to touch it at all - read a text out loud, send a text, read an email, program your GPS - you name it, you can most likely do it with your voice.  Again, this is all done without a battery hit thanks to the X8 computing system and it's natural language processor.  I was previously afraid to use the voice activation features of the Galaxy S3 due to the power hit I took every time I used it, but I see myself using this more and more and feeling less awkward about talking to my phone (but yes, you will feel weird talking to your phone at first).  You will notice times where the system didn't recognize what you said or confuse it for something else, but overall, the implementation works great in my opinion.Motorola Assist is also a great feature that the phone has for when you're going to be hands off as well - it allow you to place the car in driving mode where it responds to messages for you, or it can turn off sounds and block phone calls when you're in meetings or sleeping at night.  While this could be done with a variety of apps in the market already, its a nice feature set to include on the phone.And the biggest differentiator about this phone vs the market is the BATTERY - a whopping 3500mAh is way more than enough juice to get you through a day (or 2!).  Where my Galaxy S3 would die on a normal day for me, my Maxx is going at over 50% battery with the same usage as before.  You can easily get 7-8 hours of screen on time before the battery looks to throw in the towel.  No longer am I worrying about having a charger near by or second guessing my decision to play Candy Crush for 20 minutes (though I may second guess my decision to play it in the first place anyway...) - the Maxx just stays alive all day with pretty much anything you do to it.  I've gotten the phone to 48 hours of run time with 4 hours of screen on time at this point, which is downright amazing in my mind.  While most people go to sleep at night and don't need to leave your phone on for 48 hours, its nice to know if you forget a charger or are somewhere you can't charge that your phone is still going to have juice to get you through the day.  And mind you, this is doing all my normal routines - Gmail sync, comcast email sync, facebook, twitter, weather, kik messenger, etc - I don't know that I'd fall into the 'heaviest' of users, but just seeing how much people do with this phone before the battery dies is just amazing.So while there are a few things I would change (the vibrate thing, enhancing the camera, adding a microSD slot), I can solidly say that this phone is, in my opinion, the most compelling upgrade you can buy on the market today - a battery that cannot be beat, a feature-set that's unmatched by rivals, and an overall user experience that is just quick and easy to use.  A phone like this (or the Moto X) that can change the way you interact with your phone in a positive manner (and not just a gimmicky way) is something special and I'm glad I made the switch to the Maxx from the S3.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is really a great phone", "Author": "Master Val \"The master of everything\"", "ReviewID": "R3MCEXSRIUD454", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been rocking a MAXX since the release day and it is really the best phone out there, if your taste is similar to mine.

Battery life on the MAXX is hands down unparalleled - no other phone has anything close. Objectively or subjectively - any way you look at it. Period.2. 720p AMOLED is perfect! I came from 1080 IPS (HTC DNA) and MAXXs screen is just more comfortable to look at. Love the colors of AMOLED. I live in FL where it's always sunny and I have absolutely no issues with viewing the phone under direct sun light. 5\" screen is perfect for me - big enough for browsing and reading and comfortable for my hands. I understand that for smaller hands 5\" might be a bit too big to hold and operate.3. I freaking cant stand laggy TouchWiz or convoluted Sense - pure Andorid is just fine, why cover it? The smoothness of the MAXX is just so fluid - never a lag. Motorola, finally, dropped the dreaded MotoBlur and MAXX comes as close to pure Nexus experience as possible. Motorola added a few features but they are really that - features - not gimmicky TouchWiz array of things that most people never use.Few more things. This phone has no LED notification but instead Motorola implemented Active Notifications which display notification on the screen - I find that feature much more useful and convenient than simple LED.

My next phone was the original Razr, you remember the flip phone with the pull out antenna? It was awesome! Then I converted to the newer Razr, the flip phone, all silver metal on the outside another awesome phone! I don't recall EVER having battery issues in those days. But then these were not smart phones. It was a terribly sad day when I stuffed the Razr into the trade-in envelope because my company got me a smart phone. The proverbial digital leash.The HTC Incredible was trouble from the start, after 18 months of struggle and all manner of contortions to make the battery last even 16 hours of judicious use it just stopped receiving text messages. A factory reset and an investigation on the Verizon switching matrix couldn't solve the problem. Onward to an Incredible 2. OK folks now we are getting somewhere. As long as one stayed away from using the GPS for more than an hour, or God forbid talk for more than 2 hours in a 16 hour period, the battery would last all day. Still had to have Juice Defender, and Task Killer running to get it through the day.Now here we are with the DROID MAXX HD...sigh...I miss the Razr moniker.

So if that is your interest stop reading now...ok if you are still with me I want to talk about how the phone FEELS and LOOKS as it is doing its job. I have had the phone for only a week but I feel as though Moto finally got a smart phone right. I really thought the larger size would bother me in my normal uniform of business slacks and tie, but it's so thin that the extra width and height don't seem to bother. With all the apps I can think of to load on the thing and all of the operating system, I still have 25gigs of storage, a seeming never ending supply. Regardless, since I don't plan on carrying entire movies around or music enough to listen to for 2 years I am not at all bothered by the lack of an SD slot.I haven't yet put a case on it or even a screen protector (but they are on order from Amazon) I just love the feel of the phone in my hand. It's solid and weighty, and feels like a masterful job of engineering. This is added to by the distinct mesh pattern of the Kevlar back, it will be a shame to cover it up with a case.It think it's unfortunate that some folks here have had a bad time with their phone, I think perhaps lemons are possible even at this price level. Speaking for myself the purchase of this phone via Amazon was less $$ than going directly to a Verizon store, go figure. Activating the phone on an existing number was bone-headed simple. Call a number, enter some digits, reboot and you are good to go. The 4G data speed is a whopping 35mpbs down and 10mpbs up that's is incredible to me. I have cable internet service it's not even that fast. I recommend that you get unlimited data because the speed of the thing will tempt you to do a lot of things that you might have not sat still for on 3G.This was a great purchase for me and I am very happy with the phone.

I'm not going to get into technical spec comparisons or anything like that. My last phone was a Droid Bionic that I had for many years, so that is my point of reference to the Droid Maxx.I was choosing between the Droid Maxx and the LG G2. Two similar but very different phones. The LG G2 is definitely more flashy if that is what you want, and takes better pictures, but my biggest complaint with my last phone was battery life so I opted for the Maxx (that and Verizon offered the Maxx for free when trading in my Bionic). At the time of writing this review, I've own my Maxx for 1 week.The highlights for me are battery life, the shake the phone to turn on the camera, and Ok Google Now. I am a moderate phone user I'd say, a few calls, lots of texts, and some web surfing with some basic gaming thrown in sporadically. The phone will last me almost 48 hours with this type of usage. I am typically on Wi-Fi unless out of work and the house. My Bionic was a PITA to engage the phone, but the Maxx is simple. A few shakes of the wrist and bam, you can take pictures. What I wasn't sure about was the OK Google Now, which is essentially SIRI for Droid. My limited experience so far is that it works great. The best thing about this phone, and maybe others have this, is that you can set it to read text messages to you and then respond by voice while driving. This is a huge upgrade and great safety feature as compared to my Bionic.The downside to this phone is that with the long battery life I feel a little uncomforable not plugging it in every night, and in the morning, and throughout the day at work. I'm sure I will get passed that. The size is a little bulky, and when you add a case (I have a Trident  case) it gets bulkier. I tried an otterbox and I couldn't get it in my pocket, so I had to send that back.I would highly recommend this phone to people especially if your main gripe about your old phone is that the battery was terrible. I can get by without the best camera on the market or fastest processor, but that's me.

And that's exactly what would happen with every other smartphone in the world. I'd find myself turning off 4G, NFC, GPS, screen brightness, etc. just to make it through 5-6 hours. I was constantly tethered to a charger and constantly worrying about whether my phone would make it through the day.I can't believe phone manufactures haven't realized until now that battery life is THE most important aspect of building a useful smartphone. I bought this phone for the battery when my old GNexus died, and I'm happy to report that the battery on this thing doesn't disappoint.

After having the phone for a few weeks, I realized it's my fault the battery life was poor... not the phones.  I had WiFi on all day, that's what killed my battery.  Where I work there is a few networks, all with poor signals.  The phone spent the whole day searching for WiFi and it was killing the battery.  If I leave WiFi off, easy 2 days of battery.  If I'm at home and connected to my home WiFi, still has awesome life.  It's just when the phone is constantly searching for a signal that it seems to burn battery power.  It's kind of annoying because the phone itself recommends leaving WiFi on for a more accurate GPS signal.  Also every time I return home or leave I have to manually set my WiFi off/on.  Oh, well.  I like the phone, it's grown on me.I was soooo excited to get this phone.  I read all the reviews, did my research... sounded perfect.  At best, it was a mild upgrade from my Droid Bionic.  It is definitely faster and the interface is certainly smoother.  That's about it though.  Setup wasn't nearly as smooth.  Every review I've read says that the battery life is amazing.

I have to say, this has been the most dramatic upgrade since I switch to my first smartphone (Droid Eris) - particularly from a usability standpoint. I loved my GN because it had a ton of great features and offered a clean / stock user experience - it was a very functional phone. I hated my GN because it was sooo power hungry and because it was more and more buggy over time. The Maxx is an upgrade in every sense - except I do miss some of the formatting changes in Android 4.3 that are not in the Maxx. I think the improvements, both in terms of hardware and Moto Droid software, are dramatically enough to over come this one minus.Pros:> Battery! Wow, can't say enough good things about the battery. I am a mid-to-high power user, my GN was lasting about 4-6 hours per charge before. So I had chargers everywhere, a back-up external battery (2 full charge capacity), and extra battery. Some travel days I would go through the entire battery, the back-up and the second back-up charge. It was extremely frustrating. I can make it through two typical days now. Not quite 48 hours (average), maybe 40 hours. That said, I have gone almost three days on low use days. Overnight I loose about 6% battery life this is about 1% battery loss per hour in idle. I am not using any third party power save apps or features. 4G/Wifi always on.> Love the shape/feel. I do not feel like this phone is larger/heavier than the GN. Build quality is much improved.> Snappy performance - very satisfied with the memory/processor and software> Screen is a great upgrade from 4.65\" pentile to 5\" RGB. Also, I find the screen brightness much better - I typically only have to go to 60-80% when outdoors, vs. still not being able to see the screen at 100% with the GN. I don't feel like I am missing anything in not having a 1080p screen - I tested this phone along with several 1080p phones at Verizon for weeks before selecting the Maxx - I never really saw a difference on these smaller screens. Sure, a TV is one thing, 5\" screen, not so much.> I love the ActiveDisplay - although you do have to get used to not pressing the screen.> Voice Activation: \"Ok Google Now\" works to launch the Google Now search feature. This is a handy feature at times, but honestly, I thought I would use this much more than I do. The issue is the lock screen - it gets in the way of using the feature. You say \"Ok Google Now\" but you have to still swipe to unlock before you can get the information. Notably, you do not have to pause your question - the phone does remember you command even it it can not unlock to provide the result.> Camera is a huge improvement to the GN. Camera comparisons to some of the other smartphone has not shown the Moto phones to excel at image quality, but I do have to say in terms of improvement from where I was - this is fantastic. I particularly like the double twist camerra launch. Next to ActiveDisplay this is probably my most used new software feature. Notably, you do not have to unlock to use the camera, but you do have to unlock for any editing or to review past pictures.> Radio signals seem to be at the same, if not better level than the GN. I feel like the WiFi might be a bit better. Call quality is much improved, particular on the loudness aspect. Also, I have not noticed the Maxx to run as hot as the GN. I used to have an issue holding the GN if the screen was on too long or a call ran long - this is not an issue anymore.Cons:> Active Display does not work well manually when in the car. My car does not have a clock that illuminates - so it would have been nice to be able to nudge the phone to get the time, but do to the car vibrations the active display does not seem to work. I still get notifications for text and email while driving though - so I do not think it is deactivated. Also, in order to use MotoAssist for \"Driving\" mode you have to enabel GPS (and I do not).> Captive buttons: These are the ever present (but still touch screen) buttons on the bottom of the phone. Android has been moving away from these for years and the GN did not have them. I have to say I preferred not having the buttons, but it is not an issue launching Google Now by any means, especially since you can just say \"Ok Google Now\".", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery is unbelievable", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31KZDX42W11G3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from the Thunderbolt so obviously this is going to be the supremely superior phone of the two, but in store I played with the HTC One and the Maxx.

I love the Kevlar/Gorilla glass combo and I've never had a problem with phone damage or a broken screen.  As soon as I registered the phone and got it started it upgraded to Kit Kat, which was a big plus.  After the Razr, I am just floored with the battery life. I can't imagine any phone doing better in that category.  In just about every way the phone is an improvement to my last Moto.  My wife has the Samsung S4, and head to head, I think my Maxx is a better phone all around.  Also, I have to say that the experience purchasing on-line from Amazon (and upgrading per my current Verizon account) was such a great, easy and simple experience I don't think I'd every buy from a bricks and motor store again, and particularly, not from a Verizon store. I actually went into Verizon b/c I wanted to compare the Maxx to the HTC One and they told me there would be at least a 30 minute wait to be helped. You know it would have been hours later if I purchased from them. With Amazon, it was just a few minutes and clicks, the phone was delivered quickly and the set up was a breeze with a quick phone call.  Great experience, great phone.  So far, so good!", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "love the Maxx phones", "Author": "Miss Gadget", "ReviewID": "R1JXAQO85GAGFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this phone yesterday after watching the calendar for my upgrade date to arrive.  This was actually the first time I've purchased an upgraded cell through Amazon and it was pretty seamless.Got the phone, and being both a Droid and a Maxx, it wasn't too different from my old phone, a Razr Maxx.  The Droid Maxx is slightly longer and wider, but the bezel around the screen makes the screen look bigger than it actually is (that's great).  Nice sharp graphics on the screen, very vivid with eye popping colors.  It has the same rubbery feeling Kevlar backing but on the Droid Maxx, this backing extends around the edges of the phone as well, and that's good.  I feel like I can get a better grip on it and I might not even be buying a case for this because of this feature (usually I buy a case right away).  It's slightly thinner than the Razr Maxx.This phone does not have a micro SD card slot but that's fine for me because on-board storage is 32GB (wow) and I stream all my music through Google's All Access music service.  If you haven't tried that out yet, then please give it a shot.  You can upload 20,000 songs though the service and songs that you add via the All Access service or purchases  do not count towards your limit.  Make playlists on the go, listen everywhere you have internet access.  It's wonderful!  Ok, back to the phone.  I use cloud storage for pictures - Dropbox for automatic picture backup - and Drive for docs that I need to use or reference away from home.  The camera is great; touch anywhere on the screen to take a picture instead of fumbling for the button somewhere else.  Nice sharp pictures with the 10MP camera, which is better than my Razr Maxx at 8MP.  Some of the widgets I'm not wild about but they're widgets and can be removed.  For example, the Droid Commander widget that was on the face of the phone when I turned it on.  That widget IMHO does not fit the aesthetic of the phone's design at all.  There are quite a few apps that do the same thing and look much nicer than that.  In fact, I just installed my favorite launcher, SmartLauncher Pro, and changed it all around.  As for wallpapers, I'm not sure why the Droid line gets such overdone wallpaper.  Who designs this stuff?  Lots of arcing electricity kind of stuff that just blocks the view of any apps you might want to see on the screen.  I hardly ever use any of the stock wallpaper, so to fix that I installed Zedge and found some nice clean backgrounds for my new phone.  The speakers are way better than my Razr Maxx, so they have improved on that.  My  husband has no trouble hearing me on speaker phone (and he wears hearing aids).  I had to repeat myself a lot on the old phone.  Processor is snappy fast for those intense games.  Oh! and I can't forget the Google Now and the touch free feature.  You don't even have to touch the phone in order for it to act on your commands.  I can't tell you how much battery I've used up today just playing around with that one feature.  Simply asking it to do something without having to touch the phone is the main reason I bought this phone.  The best part is that yesterday when I was setting up my phone, the last update was for Android 4.4 KitKat!!  I'm so happy to have that (i'm a nerd, I know!).  It's two versions better than what's on my other two Android devices and frankly, it shows.  The update is very polished all the way around.  Battery life as of right now is at 52% as of 18hrs 45m with regular use - streaming music in the car, phone calls, downloading lots of things, and using the touch-free feature.  Battery is the large capacity that the Maxx phones are known for (another reason I bought it), so I'm going to see how long I can go before this needs plugged up.  FYI, my old Razr Maxx still gets 36 hrs on a charge with regular use.  Pretty darn good, if you ask me.There are probably some other stand-out features of this that I neglected to mention, but I think the ones above stick out the most as the best overall and they are the most useful to me.  Couldn't beat the price at 99.99 for the upgrade on a family plan, paired with free 2 day shipping and a seamless transfer of service definitely made this a good spend.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic.  Seriously, why is ANYbody buying iPhone or Samsung?", "Author": "Lunajett", "ReviewID": "R1S3TXB79U9OXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this about 6 weeks now, previously had an Incredible 2.  Don't want to go into ton of detail, there are great reviews here that really analyze everything about this phone, and I would mostly echo those very favorable reviews.  I'm never been a huge \"phone guy\" and didn't need to have the biggest and best everything.  But my biggest issue with smartphones has always been poor battery life.  They can pretty much all do amazing things, but no matter what a phone can do, what good is it if you have to worry about making it through a busy day, or \"ration\" out your phone use to stretch battery life?  Sure, usually you can plug in somewhere for awhile to get a bump and make it through, but why should you have to worry about that?  This phone really eliminates any of those concerns.  Admittedly, I am a fairly light user - checking email and texting throughout the day, checking a few news sites, maybe some GPS or searching or music, etc.  I never watch movies or play games on it, so not a lot of big battery drains.  But I've been going 3 full work days between charges - like take it off charger at 7AM Mon, and by Wed bedtime be down to around 5%, so plug it in overnight.  That's like 60+ hours.  Again, that's light use, I'm sure most people won't get that.  But that's still amazing, and even when I am using it a lot I can easily go two full days and probably have 15-20% left.  No matter how busy my day is and how much I'm using it, I never have to worry about running out of juice.  I don't have to carry a charger with me, or think \"let's see, I'll be at my desk for lunch so if I give it a bump then I can probably make it through the afternoon....\"  Aside from all the other amazing things this phone does, the battery alone is a gamechanger, really liberating.  I think if more people experienced this, they would dump whatever phone they are using now and grab a Maxx.The Active Notifications is really cool.  Seemed a little gimmicky at first, but I love it now.  It will alert you with a little fade in, fade out message when you have email or text, and you can preview it to see if you need to check it now or it can wait, without having to power up whole phone.  Nifty little way to save some of that battery.Motorola Assist is great, although takes a little getting used to.  The phone knows when I'm driving.  It will be in my pocket, and say \"Text from Alison, read or ignore?\"  I say \"read\" and it reads me the text.  I believe I can also respond or send texts verbally, but haven't tried that.\"OK Google Now\" seems to work great, although I haven't done anything too complex with it.  Voice recognition is amazingly accurate, probably like 95%.  Very rare I have to correct it or retry.  You have to learn how to phrase questions and what keywords to use, but you can't expect any phone to completely read your mind.A lot of people complain about the camera.  I don't know, it seems fine to me, but I've never expected my phone to be an awesome camera.  I'm probably one of those people that will always have an actual camera for anything important - if I'm going to the Grand Canyon I will take a real camera and not expect my phone to do it justice.  A phone camera for me is always for snapshot, spontaneous stuff.  The camera on this phone is perfectly fine for me for meeting those needs, but if you expect your phone to take gallery-quality photos, you might not be completely happy with it.  Oh, but the \"twist on\" feature is really cool.  If I want to catch a quick shot, I can give the phone this little twist as I am pulling it out of my pocket, and the camera is open and ready to go by the time I get it up to my face.  Any other phone, you have to get the thing out, then look for the camera icon, tap that, wait for it to open... This feature just saves you that couple seconds that might make the difference between getting the shot or not.  I was doing the little movement wrong when I first got it, and couldn't get the camera to open.  I had the girl at Verizon store show me, and since then it's worked fine everytime, I was just holding the phone wrong when I twisted it.Build quality is awesome, phone has just enough heft to feel solid without being too heavy.  Kevlar back feels great, I hate those slippery smooth fingerprint magnet surfaces on so many other phones.  Even though this is supposed to be a very rugged phone, I've kept a nice Incipio case and screen protector on mine since I got it.  It may not \"need\" it but I like the extra protection, why take a chance with damaging it?  The case adds a nice little contour and a little more grip to it, while still being very thin and sleek.The size is perfect for me.  It's a little bigger all around than my previous Incredible 2, it's got 5\" screen vs 4\" although overall dimensions are probably only about 1/2\" bigger all around.  I was worried about it being too big to comfortably use with one hand.  It did take a little getting used to and sometimes I do have to really stretch a thumb or shift it a little in my hand, but overall I feel the larger screen is well worth it.  Big enough to make everything a little easier, without being too big to comfortably slip in/out of a pocket.I know the Maxx's specs on paper may not look as good as some of the competitors, but I seriously doubt any human could tell the difference in the real world.  Screen looks great and everything is super fast.  Don't get hung up on lab benchmarks and specs; think about how you really use a phone and what improves day-to-day functionality.  Seems like a lot of hot new phones out there like Samsung and Apple compete to come up with the latest \"gee whiz\" features for people to ooh and ahh over, but seriously how useful and practical are things like eyeball tracking or thumbprint ID?  To me, they seem like they would just get more in the way of how most people really use a phone, and are just more time and hassle to figure out how to work with.  Motorola has come up with great phones that have practical, usable features that just make a smartphone that much more of an enhancement to your life, without getting in the way.  I honestly don't understand why the Maxx and the other new Moto phones are not taking more share from Apple and Samsung.  I think Apple just has such \"cachet\" (Ooooh, it's APPLE, it must be the best!) and Samsung has big flashy screens, that people are overlooking an option like Motorola that is just quietly doing almost everything better.  Moto needs to step up its marketing or something, because this phone really should be changing the dynamic much more than it has.Oh, and BTW, I got my Maxx for $12.50 on Amazon in early December.  Yes, I had to start up another stupid Verizon contract which I hated to do, but for that price I figured it was worth it.  I had been watching price fluctuate a lot on here leading up to Xmas, varying from like $199 to $39.99, and I finally pulled the trigger one day when it hit $39.99.  Thought that was great, but the next week I noticed it had dropped to $12.50.  Well, did you know Amazon will price match itself, up to I think 30 days from purchase?  So I emailed them and yep, they promptly refunded the difference so it ended up only costing me $12.50.  Go Amazon!  So if you are looking at this, take some time and monitor the price for awhile, you might get a real steal.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "best phone yet", "Author": "JOSH BERG", "ReviewID": "R34H5QRPLA9D3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beet phone ever.

I have had HTC and Samsung phones before (Galaxy S2 and Thunderbolt) so I went looking for a third option. I'm sure the S4 and the One are good phones, but I had trouble and buyers remorse soon after I got those phones. Not with the Droid Maxx. The features on this phone are awesome. I love the ability to view a text message, or who is calling without having to unlock my phone. The big thing for the Maxx is the battery life, and boy is it great. I use my phone a lot, from 5 am until 10 or 11, and I still have 40% left on a typical day. My other phones would need a charge around 12 or 1 pm with the same use. I know the S4 has a lot of features that it does, but I've found apps that can do the same thing for my Maxx. The other thing I love about this phone is the speaker. It may be a rear-facing speaker, but boy is it loud. I have no problem hearing my ringer, and I don't need external speakers when I'm playing any music.

This is extremely nice because I travel a lot and love not having to seek out and fight over charging terminals at the airport.Whatever Motorola did with the 8 core distributed processor completely fixed the lag issues that have plagued Android since it's inception.

So happy to have no physical central button (Samsung),The phone's speaker is REALLY loud. That's both a good thing and a bad thing.Cons,The only real issue i have with it. is it's Camera. which is kind of a big one. you can tell Motorola  invested a ton of time on the 8 core processor and all the other goodies in it. but not a whole lot on the Camera.

Call quality both incoming and outgoing is phenomenal, as is common with Motorola. Better than the S4.- \"Okay google now\" voice commands. More than a gimmicky item, I've used it a decent amount. In my opinion better than Siri for actually accomplishing tasks, gets what you are saying accurately more often than not.- THE BATTERY! This is of course where the phone really shines. 48 hours moderate use is more than a fair estimate. 10 hour work day texting, calling, web surfing, emailing, watching videos, taking pictures etc. Can usually end a day with more than 50% battery. Light usage you can get a lot more.- Double wrist flip brings open camera. Awesome for those moments you need quick access to the camera.- Camera is good since the November update. white balance is a lot better. Works well for everyday needs.- The radio in this sucker is awesome. At my home I used to drop calls frequently. Haven't had one yet. went from getting only a couple bars of 3g to a couple bars of 4g.

I can heavily use the phone all day and have well over half of my battery life left at the end of the work day. My old phone (a Droid Bionic) was often down into the teens or single digits with similar usage. My friend's S4 isn't a lot better with heavy usage. On lighter days, I'm usually looking at 75% or more battery life at the end of the day.A number of people that I know went with the S4 because of the quad-core processor, the screen, or the camera. But, to be honest, the dual core in the Maxx appears to actually be more fluid. Maybe that has to do with the closer-to-stock Android.The near-stock Android appearance is also a huge plus in my book. While this is personal preference, I just don't like Touchwiz nearly as much as the stock appearance.Some will complain about the 720p display, but it is a great-looking display. And unless you're watching the screen at a couple of inches distance, you'll be hard-pressed to notice the difference on a 5\" display. The AMOLED screen is bright with great color saturation and is pretty good for viewing even under outdoor lighting conditions with auto brightness enabled.Personally, I use the phone a reasonable amount for a quick camera. And I love the fast access to the camera. Is it the best cell phone camera? For still photos, I think that I have to give the nod to the iPhone. But it is certainly a solid entry. The fast access and simple and accessible app is great, though. And I find the camera more than acceptable.When it comes to voice quality, it is really hard to beat Motorola, too.I'm a technophile, so going for anything less than top specs was an interesting choice for me. But it came down to the feel of the phone in my hand, the battery life and the stutter free interface of near-stock Android. Sure, I could have gotten an S4 and a spare battery, but I am extremely happy with my choice of the Droid MAXX.Simply not having to worry about battery life in a smart phone is a real treat.

I've only had this phone 10 days, so  I could return it under Verizon's 14 day return policy, but I'm not going to simply because I enjoy this phone so much, other reviews are great and who knows if the S5 will have problems or not?  One thing you might have to do is check system updates (settings>about phone>system updates....or look to see if you have Kit Kat under Android Version on the same page).  In my case, the phone shipped with Jelly Bean and didn't upgrade to Kit Kat until I manually updated it.  Took about 30 minutes.UPDATE:  I had a minor problem with the phone's programming.  Motorola was right there with their online chat and when we couldn't resolve the issue online, I was given a priority support phone number.  It took awhile to resolve the notification issue, but they got it right and I would rate their customer service very highly.

I had an HTC Thunderbolt which was slow and really only useful with the thick and heavy extended battery, and my wife had a Galaxy Nexus which was just terrible.We went with the Motorola Droid Maxx, introduced last summer. On paper it's less advanced than its most popular competitors (Galaxy S4, LG G2, HTC One) but in real world use its phone and data radios are excellent, and so are its phone call quality and Internet speed. The screen is \"only\" 720p HD, but I'm not sure how much difference 1080p will make on a 5-inch screen. Videos are clear and crisp, with rich colors, deep blacks, and a wide viewing angle.The phone came with Android 4.4 (KitKat), which is an upgrade that occurred since the phone's release. It's not quite stock Android, but it has no overlay and much less bloatware than its competitors.Best of all, its battery life is outstanding between its 3,500mAh battery and power-saving routines. Right now I'm a fairly light user (the Thunderbolt's slow speed had a way of discouraging 4G use) but I last charged it the night of 3/15, it's been on around the clock, and as of mid-day 3/24 the battery is still at 20%. My wife is a heavier user as she's into some online video games, and I think she's charged her phone 4 times. The battery is not replaceable, but with that much power it's a non-issue.NOTE: I take steps to preserve battery life, like leaving Data and Wi-Fi radios turned off when I'm not using them, only using one or the other, blanking the screen manually instead of waiting for it to blank itself, etc. These are hard-learned tricks from owning a Thunderbolt with its stock battery.Hands-on, the Droid Maxx feels good. It's heavy compared to its direct competitors, but it's slim, the Kevlar back has a nice grippy feel, the case is rigid, and the touch screen is responsive and smooth as silk.The main camera is very good, turning in crisp and clear pictures and operating well in low light even without the flash. The camera app doesn't allow changing the picture resolution, but that can be altered with the Gallery app. The front-facing camera is decent enough for selfies, if you're into that.Motorola specs Gorilla Glass for this phone, but we got screen protectors anyway. The phone has built-in cordless charging, but we haven't bought the charging pad, and I'm not sure we will. We have not tried the Touchless Control yet; I'll need to report on that later.The Droid Maxx does not have a micro SD card slot, so memory can't be extended, but I never came anywhere near using the 32gb on my Thunderbolt (I don't even have that much on my tablet, which has a lot more videos) so this isn't an issue for me.My only real complaint is that the AMOLED screen can't be made bright enough to be seen easily in daylight. It's visible, but a little more boost would be useful.Overall, however, I'm very happy with this phone and recommend it highly.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Cell Phone I've Owned", "Author": "Art Wilson", "ReviewID": "R38FCBQWZTZ6OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Droid MAXX is the ultimate smartphone.

I am switching from Virgin Mobile (owned by Sprint).  The service there was extremely shoddy.  With  Verizon, I get very fast speed and I almost always have 4G LTE service (I live in Northeastern Ohio).  I couldn't even stream Pandora on my old service (unless I went to a major city).  With Verizon, I literally drive 3 mins down the road and I have full bars with 4G LTE.  A speed test revealed 29 / 14 mbps with full bars.  This is faster than my internet at home!I think this is the best phone out there for the money.  No other phone delivers the battery life and graphics this phone has to offer.  Speed is perfect for my needs and I just all around love this phone.  I had considered getting the HTC one, but I realized that this phone is hands down the better choice (especially given the incredible battery life).A great phone!* Update 2/12/2014 *I just want to reiterate how incredible the battery life is on this device.  I've used it a moderate amount since I disconnected it from the charger around 5 hours ago, and I've still got 96% battery life.  I've probably sent 10 or so text messages, checked my email around 3-4 times, and played a few levels of Candy Crush.Two things I've been wondering:1)  Could I increase battery life even further by disabling the \"auto\" brightness feature?2)  Should you ever let the battery fully drain?If you have any thoughts, let me know in the comments.  I like the \"auto\" brightness feature simply because if you need to use your phone outside you don't have to readjust the brightness settings.  And it's not like I need to conserve battery life at all.  But I guess it's something interesting to think about.Regarding the battery, I make a point to charge it every night.  I did this all nights except one.  I used the phone two days in a row, and only charged the phone once it was around 8% remaining battery.  I've read that you should always keep it charged when possible and never fully drain the battery, as draining the battery decreases battery life.  I've also read that an occasional drain on the battery can be a good thing (somehow).  I plan to keep charging the phone each night and tend to believe that there is no need to fully drain the battery on purpose.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast, great battery life.

Last night it had about 18% battery power left after going about 40ish hours without a charge.Beyond that, everything about the phone seems pretty darn fast. I will admit I upgrade to this from a s***ty droid 3, so I guess anything would seem fast in comparison.In addition, the newest version of the android operating system is vastly superior to the earlier version I had on my phone. It's faster, easier to use, and pretty.Screen on the phone is great, very large, good quality.I'll add a bit more...battery life is still great after a couple weeks.I am really enjoying the \"active notifications\" that show up on screen, instead of a flashing LED. Active notifications are black and white icons that fade on and off the screen indicating what type of notification you have pending (a black & white GMAIL icon shows up for new email, there's a text icon, facebook). The notification shows up in the same part of the screen as the unlock button normally would. When you touch on a notification, it previews the message at the top; you can then go directly to the message by swiping straight up to unlock the phone and go immediately to the notification; or you can swipe down and just unlock the phone like normal.  The previews are really helpful, as they often let me get enough of the message without unlocking the phone. The phone also seems to know when you've picked it up or pulled it out of your pocket and will display the notifications' icons immediately.I also enjoy that I can flip through music playing on my phone without unlocking it.Finally, I would add the phone construction is great. Kevlar back makes the phone feel durable, without being slippery or heavy.

Best smartphone I have had so far.", "Author": "N. Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R96XNZKXYQ6KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally don't write reviews because I just don't have the time for this stuff but performance of this phone prompted me to jot down my thoughts.  First, I had a Samsung Galaxy Nexus which I purchased shortly after they entered the market.  The battery life of that phone was an issue for me right from the start so I purchased a larger battery for it.  But, occasionally it would get hot (antenna area) and drain the battery to zero, usually leaving me with no phone when I needed it most.  It would also lock up or freeze requiring a re-boot, but even turning the phone from vertical to horizontal when looking at a picture on the screen would cause it to freeze for a few seconds, like it was thinking about what it had to do next.  So, after two years I had enough and purchased the Maxx from Best Buy.  The other phones that I seriously considered were the HTC One, mostly because of its aluminum build, and the LG G2.  The G2 I ruled out as soon as I picked one up in a store.  I felt it had a cheap feel to it. The HTC was ruled out due to battery life.Once I started to use the phone I became even more impressed with it.  It is the little things that just make me like the phone even more.  For example, the back of this phone has a carbon fiber look to it which is nice, but even nicer is the feel of it.  It has almost a \"soft\" feel to it.  It is not sticky enough to pick the lint out of your pocket but it has enough grip that it will not slip out of your hands (a problem with the galaxy).  I love the screen.  It has worse \"specs\" than the Galaxy but for some reason it just seems to have better color and clarity.  The call strength is another ummm\u2026strength.  I could never talk on the Nexus in the lower level of our home because it would drop the call due to our marginal cell tower coverage in this immediate area.  The Maxx is just the opposite.  It may not show any more bars on the signal strength but it hangs on to the call like no other.  I just got done with a phone call that was nearly an hour long, all the while sitting downstairs.  Just amazing.Lastly, the battery life is what makes me smile.  I used to charge my Nexus twice during the day and by the time night rolled around, it was dead.  The Maxx is incredible with its battery life. The phone will easily go a day without charging, and most times significantly more than that.  As I write this, the battery is at 14%, but it has been 1 day and 11 hours since I had it charging, and this is with pretty heavy use.  That is amazing in my book and a huge relief not to be required to look for a place to plug my phone in.Over all, I love this phone.  I seriously cannot think of anything I do not like about it.  For some, it may not appeal to them because it is not \u201cblingy\u201d, but I don\u2019t need that, I want a smart phone that works, and works for a long time.  Highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great experience, close to stock Android", "Author": "atlantaeuph", "ReviewID": "R1QNAU4KQLFNY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About Me:I am a  school teacher and an Android enthusiast who follows several different Android blogs regularly.  I like staying up to date on the latest and greatest tech gadgets and am known to drop into Best Buy just to check them out for a few minutes.  My phone is my mp3 player, calendar, computer, gps, task-list, flashdrive. etc.... It is the single most important tool that I own.  Please note, that I refer to my phone as a tool (ie: I use it get things done), it is not a necessity in my life.  On to the phone:Display - I know many people complained about the screen only 720p when the specs first came out; however, when I put this next a 1080 phone display, I cannot see a difference.  Personally, I am glad they went with 720p as a means of making the battery last longer.  I will add that at first I used a screen protector, which was a bad idea.  The screen protector greatly interfered with the touch sensitivity of the display.Case/durability - As with most motorolas, this thing is a tank!!!  I'm pretty hard on my phones as I use them for many different purposes: listening to music, gps, task list, computer/flash drive, camera, reading news, e-mail, youtube, netflix, etc. etc.  I have owned this thing for a little over a month and have dropped it twice (good drops off the table) and it has no scratches on it at all!  The kevlar back feels great in my hand while providing a nice sturdy outershell to the phone.  THe gorilla glass on the screen is always one of the reasons that I keep coming back to android phones.  I've never shattered the screen on an android phone and, to be honest, I'm not sure how others accomplish such a feat.  You probably don't even need an outer case for this phone, but if you plan to re-sell it later, then it's still a good investment just to be safe.General Speed/performance - Okay, I have seen phones that run a bit faster than the new line of DROIDS, but the Doid Maxx is still really fast!  It is by far the fastest phone I have owned.  My previous phone was an HTC Rezound and the Maxx blows it away.  Transitions between apps are smooth and without lag.  Netflix and YouTube have great seemless playback (wi-fi and 4g).  No problems while multi-tasking with multiple apps either.  Phones like the LG G2 may be a bit faster, but the difference is so minimal that I would not count it against the Maxx.  Notice, that I still gave the phone 5 stars.Audio - Outstanding speakers! For a cellphone this is about as good as it gets.  Most of the time, cellphone speakers sound tinny and thin to me, but these actually have some depth to the sound.  You can get pretty good volume out of them, too!Buttons - I've read some reviews where people complain about the power and volume buttons feeling cheap and plasticy, but this does not bother me.  I kind of wish they had integrated the navigation buttons (home, back, menu) into the screen like they did on the MotoX, but this is such a minor detail that I almost don't care either way.Voice Control / Contextual Awareness - Okay, I have to admit, this is the whole reason I got the phone.  I absolutely love it!  99.9% of the time it works as it should.  The best part is that phone will announce incoming calls/texts while you are driving and simply by talking to your phone it will either answer (defaults to speaker phone), or read the text message aloud.  I can literally respond to text messages without ever touching the screen.  Sometimes, there is a slight lag when the phone is asleep and I wake it with the \"Ok Google Now\" command.  I'm assuming this has to do with the core structure of the phone where one core remains active, listening for the voice command, while the rest of the phone sleeps.Camera - If you follow the blogs, as I do, you know that camera on these phones got some bad press initially.  I've never had a problem.  I like how easy the camera is to use and it has always taken decent pictures for me.  It's especially nice when I hand the phone to someone to take a picture and all I have to say is \"tap the screen.\"  No long winded instructions that you need for other camera apps on other phones.  My satisfaction probably comes from understanding that this is still a phone at its core and, if I truly want great photos, I should switch to a point and shoot or DSLR for most photo ops.All in all, this is a superb phone!

NOTE - see updates!Basically, if you want a phone that has massive battery life, make calls, and surf the net - get this phone, unless you have hearing problems (see below).If you need high-quality pics, get something else.Switched from Sprint to Verizon. Transfer of phone # was very easy, and almost instant. Transfer of contacts using Google account was very easy and worked without any problems.Verizon service: I checked the data coverage prior to purchasing. Supposedly I am in a a very good reception area for 4G; however, I only get 2 bars. That being said - I have not experienced dropped calls. I don't use the phone while driving through the canyons, so that has yet to be tested.Phone:The cons - the phone speaker sucks. I have the volume on max and can barely hear people. Switch to speaker phone solves the problem, but only in circumstances where you can actually use a speaker phone. If you are expecting to take amazing pics, get another device. You cannot take sunset pics (which is about 50% of my pics) - the white balance is completely off and you just get a dark shot that as of yet cannot be corrected (possibly using Photoshop, but who wants to go through that hassle just for phone-pics?)The pros - the battery life is insanely long. I have gone three days with constant use and no charging. The notices without activating is great. Camera is just ok as others have mentioned. The screen is fine. It is lower res, but not very noticeable. If you expect to watch a movie in HD, get an HD TV. The lower res screen also extends battery life, which is worth it. The phone is also fast - researching a bit, I found it this phone has one of the cleanest installations of Droid OS - helping the battery life, and also, IMO security - fewer apps auto-loading means less security holes (my former HTC / Sprint phone would load many, many apps with no way to delete.)I get the feeling the really bad reviews for this phone are for the Droid RAZR Maxx - which is completely different. Motorola is going to be kicking itself for naming a great phone similar to a flawed phone.UPDATE 1: Have now been using for a few weeks. No problems. This device is solid! I dropped the phone about four feet onto concrete - no damage! No cracked screen, no marks on the Kevlar body - and this is with no phone protector, only a screen protector. Battery life keeps impressing me - and others. The \"OK Google Now\" feature is very functional. Strongly recommend this phone.UPDATE 2:First, I heard Lenovo just bought the phone Motorola's phone decision. I would never have bought this phone if I knew this was a possibility. From past experience, Lenovo is the worst hardware company ever. They knowingly ship products that are defective - in my case it was a ThinkPad laptop with a bad touchpad - the same component ID# that for one year previously was found to have problems - as pointed out on their support forum - but was still being installed and shipped in new laptops.  90 days of being stalled by tech support that the hardware issue was resolved and it was the driver - then, when the return period had expired, I was notified it was indeed a hardware problem - their \"fix\" was replacing the touchpad - which takes 2 to 3 months!Second: The covering IMHO cannot be Kevlar. I dropped the phone again - this time while sitting - so the drop distance was about 2 feet. The \"kevlar\" backing chipped away where it hit the concrete. No damage to screen; however, I seriously doubt the durability of this phone.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Better From Amazon", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2T57QVYCAR3G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Awesome Battery LifeLight Weight (compared to my Droid 4)Okay Google Now feature is greatFastCons:Camera could be betterKeeps applications open in a sub window that must manually be closedPossibly a little too largeI love this phone.

The wrist twist to activate the camera is actually very convenient.I have had no trouble with responsiveness and have not noticed any lag.The sensors in the phone allow it to tell when I move it.  When I pick it up, it shows me a small notifications icon (if I have any) along with the time.  This has minimal effect on the battery because of the phones ability to only turn on pixels that need to be shown.  Those notifications can be touched to show a preview of the message without having to turn the phone screen on and unlock it.  That is probably the feature I use the most.

We usually get two days per charge, which is way better than we had with our old Galaxy S2s. I took screenshots when I had this thing still going at 3% after 2 days and 20 hours. Of course, that was pretty minimal usage those three days, but I hadn't been trying to make it last that long.- Awesome design and feel to the phone (why cover that with a case?)- People may say the processor isn't the best, but I love the way it functions, separating different functions onto different cores and chunks of memory.- We absolutely LOVE that the camera is only a \"doorknob twist\" away. I was worried about the camera before buying, because that was the one place I constantly saw the Droid Maxx marked down, and my wife wanted a good camera. I'm glad to report, I'm not disappointed with the camera at all. No settings to adjust, and as long as you give it a few seconds to adjust to the lighting, it does a good job with the auto settings. You just tap the screen to snap a shot, and you can even snap shots while taking video. We are very happy with the camera.- The Command Center Widget is Awesome!!I guess a couple negatives I've found:- Limited case selection (see comments at the end of review for my ongoing case search).- Verizon Exclusive (although, to be honest, our experience is switching from T-Mobile has been- Google is selling Motorola (which in the end, I think will be best for both companies), just feels like an uncertain time for right now.Pros & Cons of (nearly) Stock Android:- You don't have a whole lot of extra bloatware on your phone... Minimal Verizon apps, IMDB, and an NFL app is forced on us (Who still cares about football these days?).- Missing some advanced functionality in certain areas, but at least the additional apps you download to get this functionality are all of your own choosing.- Can't remove unused homescreens- No simple button for Screen Auto Rotate. I would imagine this would be in the options under the notifications settings section, but you have to navigate into settings and display to reach this option. Additional widget apps tend to be large, and I don't want to install one just for that button.- Stock Alarm clock can adjust exactly how long the alarm snoozes from 1-30 mins, but the option for how long the alarm goes off has a list from 5-30 mins in 5 minute increments. Who needs a five-minute alarm (or for that matter, anything longer than five-minutes)?- The text messaging app lacks the option to schedule a time to send a message which is something I use quite often.- Another downside to texting with Verizon is media messages can't be sent over wifi, so you're stuck using your precious data.Anyway, none of this really has to do with the Maxx, specifically.Final Thoughts. The title says it all. We love the phones and wish Google had taken better care of Motorola.Case Comments:There aren't many cases (name brand or otherwise), and they're challenging to find due to the repetitive names in the series (Droid RAZR Maxx, RAZR Maxx HD, Droid Maxx...). Good luck with that (we're still looking for decent cases, I'll update this area if I find one I really like).We've tried:- Diztronic Flexible TPU cases (Black and Pink Glitter). The feel is okay, but the sides are too flexible and it peels off our screen protectors.- OtterBox Commuter case (Black). Great protection, but not comfortable to hold due to added bulk and the slick plastic shell.

That all ended once I held it in my hand and ran it through its paces.  I lost count of how many times I've said \"wow!\" as I familiarize myself with all its features.  I'm still trying to figure out how to \"Maxximize\" the battery life though.  So far the best I've achieved is 23 hours without charging it.  This was the biggest selling point for me, so the five-star rating could go down.  I absolutely loathe being tethered to an electrical outlet so I'll update this review as I figure out how to get more out of the battery.  Design and functionality are top notch.  The screen and cover feel solid, however the side buttons could have been built more solidly if I could have a say.  Not like I think the buttons will fall off or anything.  They just feel a bit flimsy for a device that is otherwise solidly built.  The camera is great and the speaker is decent.  The voice quality gets 4/5 with a poor signal and 5/5 everywhere else.

Verizon has already started rolling out Android 4.4 to the Droid lineup, I just haven't received mine yet and I'm getting a little eager. The only reason is the camera. It takes excellent well-lit photos but it's the dark's that it falters. With the 4.4 update in the camera app you can utilize Exposure in the camera. It's a great solution to phones that don't take well low light photos. It works for me anyway, adding more light to any situation.And oooooh the battery life. I'm a  pretty regular user, leave sync and push notifications on all the time, have GPS and Bluetooth on all day most days, and run multiple apps pretty regularly.

I upgraded from a droid razr ( 2 years old)  Not sure why everyone is complaining its slippery, the old razr was MUCh harder to hang on too.  Its a bit heavier, but thats what you get when you go with better battery.  And it IS a better battery, like 3 times the life of the old phone.  It does do some things differently.  There is no longer a settings option at bottom of the phone, its now an app on the screen.  calculator / calender, and other things are now organized in a 'tools' app.  You cannot fit as many apps on the screen, cause the time/temp thingy is in the way.  It IS faster than the old phone, better processor.  And the text is now black on white, instead of white on black, which I find easier to read.  One major issue I had is not a phone issue, I think, so much as a cloud issue.  We moved everything off the old razr onto the verizon cloud.  Worked fine.  BUT!!! You can't move everything back onto the new phone!  It will not mass move music/pictures.  It did do my contacts, and text history, but if you want your pictures on the actual phone, you have to move them one at a time.  Now you can pull everything up  easily on the cloud, BUT REMEMBER that uses data!  Wheras having it on your phone, doeesn't.  Again, this doesn't appear to be a phone issue, its the way the 'cloud' is setup.  And of course, if you dumped your phone to your PC before you switched, you can download it fairly easily off there.  I WOULD RECOMMEND that, so that YOU have a copy of everything you want, safely on your personal computer.  That way it can't get 'lost'.

That has been the best phone I have ever owned but with a bit small battery.  The Droid Maxx is a very similar phone with a 5\" screen and a very big battery.  First of all let me say that this phone has an AMAZINGLY large battery but the phone is barely larger than my previous very thin Razr.  When I say amazing battery I want to emphasize again that it is not just good but very very good.  This phone is prepared for the most active power user and will still have plenty of battery power.The screen is excellent just like the last Motorola but bigger.  And they have retained the Kevlar back which is the perfect material to back a phone.  This phone is ready for rough use.  My last Droid also had the Kevlar back.  I mostly used it without a case as it easily fit into the Motorola car dock and the Motorola office dock.  The Kevlar is built to take hard use and still look good.  My last phone held up to daily heavy use without a single problem.  I would expect the Maxx will be the same.There are a few new gadgets I like.  The main one on the home screen tells you time, temp, and battery charge level.  All of my existing Motorolola chargers work with this phone.  Google now owns Motorola.  Hopefully they will continue with the long tradition of very good cell phones that are durable, capable, and advanced.One negative is that there is not Motorola brand car dock.  I bought a third party one that is about 1/10th as good as the Motorola brand one I had for the last phone.  There is no office dock.  Oh, no mini hdmi connection on this phone like the last one.

I needed to replace my Galaxy Nexus as battery life was terrible (a common complaint with that phone), and it would take forever for the browser to work which was frustrating when I needed to quickly look something up. I was going back and forth between the LG G2 and this phone and ended up going with the Maxx because (a) I heard the battery life was fantastic, and (b) it was very close to a pure Android 4.2 experience as compared to the bloat-filled G2. I've had the Maxx for a couple of days now and it is 100% better than the Nexus. The 5\" screen is noticeably larger than the Nexus which is great for viewing websites, it feels very solid with a non-smudge Kevlar back, and...and...the battery life is awesome! I played 18 holes today using a golf GPS app and after 18 holes the phone was at 72%. With the Nexus I would usually run out of battery life (or come very close to) before my round was over.The phone is 720p instead of 1080p, it doesn't use the Snapdragon 800, and I've heard that the camera isn't the best, but the screen and speed are both fantastic to me.

That being said I can not give it a horrible rating because I should not have had it in a pocket with anything else.There is a lot I like about the style and feel of the phone I also enjoy the wireless charging capabilities but i am disappointed with the quality and durability of this phone, it needs to be able to handle everyday life.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "angela langley", "ReviewID": "R3DQLLLBFD0YSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I've owned so far.

I would have brought it from Amazon but there was a huge special on this from another sight. Anyway even with that I do buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and have the highest respect for them and there customer service so i would highly recommend Amazon.  I just had to do something which involved a eye to eye contact with a seller.From here on in the review was re written.  The first time I wrote the review I was complaining about the sound and the volume was low, and on hearing aid mode it was unclear.  I exchanged the phone and it seems to be much better.  Anyway on with my review.It is true the phone is not \"as loud\" as the other phones. I loved the phone I was willing to live with it. Yesterday however I went down to Miami Beach  and I was around a lot of noise and I actually had no problem hearing anyone. So this is not a concern anymore. The calls were clear and loud enough for me to easily hear the party on the other ear.  I did exchange a phone a few days ago (same model) which was a bit more unclear and had a bit more bass. I must say with the new phone I'm very happy even if this phone is \"not as loud\" as other manufactures.I also had another surprise  the Camera.  The Camera is a basic very limited camera that the user cannot adjust to conditions. I've taken pics during the day and night The picture quality is very good both day and night.  The camera noise at night is there but it's really not that bad, and at times not existent at all. In miami last night I was able to take a pic of of an awning from across  the street with low lighting around it and the camera picked  up the writing on the awning and I was able to read every letter.  As a critic I will say this Camera has some of the best automatic functioning I've ever seen. The pictures are of good quality also.  Would I like to manually adjust the camera into iso's and do my own exposure? sure I would but for an automatic adjustment this camera is excellent.  If I'm satisfied it must be great. I have owned the Lumina 928 and Droid DNA I will say  the Lumina had the best Camera the colors were real deep and really clear. and but you couldn't zoom in and out during video. The Droid DNA had a excellent still pics in clarity the color was a little off. But the biggest problem with it was the DNA focused in and out during video.  The Droid Maxx over all has accurate day time colors at night it might turn a a yellow light into a lighter one but other than that I had no issues.  I was able to zoom in and out in video mode and the camera stayed very focus. The colors are accurate maybe not as deep as a Samsung, or the Lumina 928 So my point over all the Camera is great when you combine functionality and quality. Other phones might excel is one area but then you lose it in others. Compared to what I owned I like the balance of the Droid Maxx the best.The Samsung s4 and this phone are Verizon Flagship phones. It is True the Samsung line is a lot more popular.  So Why did I pic Motorola?  I like it better. The battery life is great even after tethering, Games, Miracasting, and a lot of calling. After 15 hours with that kind of usage I still had 30% left.  The Samsung phones fall out of my hands like butter and I'm not much for cases.  The Droid maxx has a much better feel. In the Past I had an s3 and the reception was horrible, I can't speak for the S4.  The samsung in Call volume is much louder than the motorola but the Motorola is a lot clearer.  the Motorola has a great voice command over the Samsung.One thing I am a bit disappointed in  is miracast. DLNA is gone, and so is using an hdmi cable on from the phone to your TV.You can only use this phone with Miracast.  With Miracast anything that is on your phone screen will wirelessly be on the TV screen. it works but it does Lag which means it's not good for games, but like DLNA you can see pictures and now watch videos without having PC network connectivity knowledge.  Samsung has allshare. I've never seen it work but when I was in Best Buy a salesman who worked for samsung was there and he was telling me the Samsung unit (which acts like a miracast unit has no lag at all.) I cannot say if this is accurate or not.  If it is true that would be my only down fall with the moto. My personal opinion Miracast is not ready for primetime and no phone manufacturer should have discontinued the HDMI cable until miracast was better developed with no lag. so the gamers can play. I guess if I wanted to I can still build play Tick Tac Toe, use it for wheel of Fourtune, word find etc. you just can't use it for action games.  (for me stuff like need for speed, Crazy taxi etc.After having this phone for a week I'm very happy with it.  When My screen cracked on my Droid DNA I went cheap and brought a windows Lumia phone from Craigslist. I was so unhappy with the operating system (but I loved the hardware) I went and brought the Moto. I have not looked back ever since.  Is the phone perfect no but it's dam good.

Starinski \"engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R1D904JP1APTDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't work for Motorola (tobe exact, \"Google MotoMobility\" as they'e known after acquisition by Google Corp.) - I've written negative & positive reviews of a variety of new products from HP, Nissan, Masscool, Intel, Autodesk, and so on, verifiale (mostly outside Amazon, on competitng eTailers forums) and frankly I cannot possibly work for dozens of companies, I am telling the world honestly:This is the third (3d) piece of Art from Motorola.  First was the venerable \"Razr V3xx\" back in the days of flipphones, it acquired a cult-like status with even some famous Bollywood actor insisting to be photographed with a Moto Razr, always.Then there was Moto \"Atrix4G\" sharing the status of a Flagship Android device worldwide - with Samsung Galaxy (Atrix2 was a slight step backwards video & battery-wise, though), now come Droid MAXX - PEOPLE CLAIMING iPhone is the one to have, aren't using their brains, those are little girls, teenagers or very old folks, not powerusers, not deeply technical people, should I call things by their names and say it bluntly - people still fixated on iC*** are either average intelligence or refuse to apply their brains when analyzing technical specs.  EVEN appearance/materials, not being anywhere as important as technical functions, in Moto's are now a match and exceed iPhones, and surely Samsung's cheap plasticky bodies.  This is Kevlar and a formfactor I suspect inspired by my review of an Atrix4G abput 3 years ago (?) read by Moto engineers, where I proposed to revive the cult classic \"Razzr\" formfactor, so it was born anew in Droid Razr and now newest - DROD MAXX.It is perhaps a bunch of words above, with no concrete Tech Specs to illustrate the point this \"Moto DroidMAXX\" is the top of SmartPhones today, beating iPhone into the dust and exceeding Samsung Galaxy likewise - at least for functions I need, but Iam buzy these days - used to write profusely long technical reviews, but not today.  So today I just say one example (below) of why DroidMAXX is really \"MAX\", and end the review:Motorola is not a marketing or showbiz company, like Apple had tendency tobe, remember Steve Jobs was a great marketeer, but not an engineer/not true inventor - he had partnered with Steve Wozniak for technical side of their company several decades ago basically iPhones look good, appeal to girls, managed to penetrate markets, talking heads but they don't design ICchips inside their devices!, they doNOt design circuits, they design a selling machine.Whereas Motorola was born as an Electronics company (first to fill the need for the early car radios, hence name Moto (cars) Rola (riding)), they went on to become one of the dozen major world's suppliers of Semiconductor IC's (chips).  they design/manufacture THOSE ELECTRONIC CHIPS inside their stuff, so when I was on a rmeote island somehwere in the Pacific, I happened to have two excellent phones, one Moto & another equally $pricey.  I reached my parents on Motorola, could not get thru on the other phone!Point is, Motorola makes electronics, RF/frontend circuits inside these phonese, the company know this stuff by it being their primary business.  Whereas Apple, depends in somebody else's electronics, they were manufacturing for a long time in south China, it's fueled by the hype & marketing.Tobe fair, iPhone is indeed in top 5 devices worlwide, fine, but people - use your brains when you want the \"BEST HARDWARE\" + \"OPEN OPERATING SYSTEM\": it's either Moto or Samsung and OS - Android.A simple task of moving a file from computer to SmartPhone (e.g. a drawing/design in my case), editing & presentation to customers half-world away, then moving file back to a computer - is a painful multistep on iPhone, some people with their iPhones end up emailing files to themselves which is like swimming in tuxedo - not efficient.  Because iOS is a closed \"Holy Warden\" garden, whereas Android does not assume users are stupid and allows you be in control, it is easier to infect but hey, if you're afraid of the wolves, don't go to the forest - \"sit at home\" with iOS, get fat.Not to mention, Google now owns \"MotoMobility\" (i.e. has money to further R&D; Research) and a state-of-the-art battery in DroidMAXX is ummatched (in its size/weight) - I vote to claim it \"Best of the world\", best device one can get for under $700 based on contract-less (true) cost.Maybe someone makes $2000 SmartPhones powered by Hydrogen fuelcells and dual-side displays, I don't know :), for the rest of us - DroidMAXX seems to have done what Razzr did many years ago, i.e. quietly become \"best\", yet hordes of people will coontinue to cling to their inferior iPhones - because Apple is good with marketing (akin to VHS videotapes decades ago, having won market over a technically-superior BetaMax tape, because Beta Consortium wasn't as good in marketing despite ironically offering a better product (BetaMax ended up in high-end/professional market, but lost mass/consumer market where most money was made by VHS).  This is what iPhone did initially - it is the modern era \"VHS\" able to convince we need inferior devices because they're made by Holy Apple, but it seems Anroids are increasingly outselling iOS at least in overseas markets & volume-wise, if not in $profitability where Apple still reigns.As of Moto DroidMAXX vs. Samsung Galaxies - battery & build quality of the DroidMAXX alone & usability issues with Samsung, made me choose one Adroid (MAXX) over the other (Galaxy) and then confirmed by in person/store visit that MAXX is indeed \"Max\" (better), Samsung has done much to propel Android to its high position today, but I think DroidMAXX this year takes the spotlight (+ Apple being entangled into patents litigations vs. Samsung, is an ongoing struggle with outcome to be seen [could be banned from certain sales in the U.S.])Think:We need mobile phones first to make calls/TALK, only secondly to make lame pictures or waste time on inane games, if a half-$Thousand dollar device fails to pick up a remote, ultra-weak signal as happens with iPhones (they're not good in RF/signal processing), why do I need it ?!, I always felt that Motorola's RFfrontend electronics is better due to being able to establish a call in noise, exceedingly weak signal scenario, where LG, HTC, and yes - that overhyped iPhone, fail and drop calls.If I had no life, no work/career, & wanted a toy - it's better to get a Tablet, than iPhone anyway, if my life depends on a phone call - it's better to get a device whose primary target is that - good signal processing, voice calls, which Motorolas been good at for decades (more or less, they did release afew awful products in the past, amongst excellent ones like Razr V3xx)Maxx is not even \"fatter\" much and not heavier than Samsung, but battery in MAXX is a piece of art, it runs unusually long time (at least if you have a brain to edit stock settings into optimal mode conserving battery).I should be fair however, and menton \"Apple Corp.\" started it all, so while iPhone is inferior & at least not my preference, and while iOS is officially dethroned by Androids in terms of worlwide sales (if not $profitability) - at least I admit if it wasn't for Apple, we maynot have had great Androids today.But that was past.  Today you should get an Android, & I vote for Moto DroidMAXX, or DroidULTRA (slightly saller/lighter, less battery), or on AT&T; - at least get \"Moto X\", and if you need certain useless features (I don't) yet don't mind shorter batter life & cheaper materials/buld quality - then get Samsung Galaxies, but by all means not an iPhone if your goal is to get WORK DONE (be PRODUCTIVE), not play games or childish animations.===========================No spell check - buzy, night (dark), mobile device (tiny keyboard), typed on DroidMAXX (mom's got months ago, I am waiting for own, in shipment from Amazon).", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R87Q7ZVA4661G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just replaced my Droid Bionic with the new Maxx!

After about 2 weeks of use, clients told me the phone was fading in and out. Then after 3 weeks the phone stopped working altogether for no apparent reason.  Every time I tried restarting it, it returned to \"setup\" and froze.  The next morning, I took it to the Verizon store and was told that all of my photos, my call log and my contacts were permanently LOST.  A family birthday photo, one of the best ever, is gone.  I told Verizon that I paid $300 for this phone just 3 weeks ago, and I expect it to be fixed or replaced immediately.  VERIZON REFUSED to replace it immediately with a phone in stock, claiming that's an option only for 2 weeks after purchase (convenient for Verizon that my phone failed after 3 weeks).  I was told I must wait for Verizon to mail a replacement phone.  Verizon promised to send it by overnight delivery, but that didn't happen - 2 nights later I'm still waiting.  I have no way to find out how many calls and texts I've missed since the Droid Maxx stopped working 3 days ago.  Adding insult to injury, Verizon assured me that I could reactivate an old cell phone while waiting for a replacement phone, and only after much wasted effort did Verizon acknowledge that it was impossible to do it.  So just a quick recap here: 1) three weeks ago I shelled out hundreds of dollars to start Verizon service on a new Droid Maxx; 2) I presently have no cell service, no texts, no call log, no GPS, and absolutely nothing for my money; 3) the promise of an overnight-mail replacement was false; 4) the promise of a temporary solution was false; 5) I will never get back that birthday photo destroyed by a defective phone; and 6) my complaints to Verizon have made no difference.

With the MAXX,in lock mode,I have to wake up the phone. The screen will tell me if I have a text but not if I have a phone call. The procedure is now pick up the phone to wake it, unlock the screen, check for a phone call. Seriously...how is this helpful?2)THE KEYBOARDWhere there was once an enter button, there is now a smiley face....and an incredibly ugly smiley face at that. Over an hour w tech support to try and install a different keyboard was fruitless. The procedure for this now is type, decide to go to a new line or paragraph, hit the up arrow key from the alphabet screen, and then use the enter/arrow key.3)DISABLING THE RINGERThe RAZR allowed the phone to be muted with a quick split second finger swipe. Good for movies, school, weddings, funerals, sleeping babies. Ringer could just as easily be turned on, even in lock mode. The new procedure: pick up your phone to wake it, swipe the lock icon to get to your password screen, enter your pin, press the rocker/volume switch until volume hits vibrate. This is a feature I need to use daily. This is really stupid. there is no other word for it that is printable.4)TEXTINGText background AND textboxes are now a blinding white. The date and time stamp are grey, hard to read. The time stamp disappears after a day. Old RAZR , as all other phones, had a different color for the text boxes of sender and receiver. After sending a text and using the phone for other things, when I return to text mode it opens up in the last text I sent, rather than  the messaging list.If you only ever text one person this might be awesome for you but the new procedure now is hit the text icon and then hit the back button to get out of the last text and onto the list of your texting contacts. The box in which you are texting is now very small and you cannot see your entire message before you send it if it is more than three lines long. Thereis no longer a DONE button option to allow you to see your entire text before hitting send. Autocorrect may have done something lewd to your message but you will not know this unless you scroll through what you just typed by swiping up and down, which can cause other issues.There is also no way to select a list of texts to delete.You may delete an entire conversation or you may delete one text at a time only.5) Extended battery life is awesome, but there are too many extra user unfriendly keystrokes involved in the daily, mundane uses of this phone.I am reluctantly going back to my RAZR.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will only work for Verizon users", "Author": "Cynthia Herrera", "ReviewID": "R27Y2A8NIADSYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phone but it does not function correctly if you try to switch to anyone.

I'm completely fine with that, but some of the feedback I received led me to believe that for average customers, my previous review wasn't helpful in their decision-making process.  I'm even going to give this a star back, because it's not going to explode on you, its just not great.TLDR:  Battery isn't all that.  Compare the specs to other phones and determine if you really want to pay this much for mediocrity.So let's talk about the Droid Maxx.  Its main selling points are two things:  Battery and Google's voice service.  Otherwise, the phone is pretty unremarkable and its specifications speak to a phone that we'd have seen a few years ago, but this is all to get it better battery life, which is understandable.That said, the Battery life wasn't as impressive as you'd think.  When they say 48 hours of use, they mean you can go two days between charges if you actually use your phone once in a while.  However, what they're advertising is 48 hours of battery life and 25 days of standby.  You're not going to see either.  In fact, on a rare cool day in Maryland, my phone dropped from 100% to 75% from 8 hours in a car which was parked in the shade while I was at work.  That time should have fallen under \"Standby\" and should have been a negligible drain on battery.  This was the main reason I returned the phone, because as I said, it is otherwise very unremarkable.I was able to see roughly 10 hours of \"usage\" which for those of you paying attention, boiled down to 2 movies watched while in airplane mode while flying home from a funeral, an hour or so of Netflix at the airport on the 4G network, approximately 2 hours of Pandora streaming, and perhaps 3 hours of music local to the device (ie not streaming).  When I finally got to my car at my local airport, it was at about 5%.  Whether this reflects \"your\" usage is up to you.The Google voice control was interesting, but for most things, it didn't function right or didn't understand what I was asking for, so it defaults to simply Googling everything.  It seemed to be pretty good with directions, but realistically, when it does screw it up, and it will now and then, you're going to have to find it under the napkins and fast food wrappers accumulated from a solo road trip, then clear your route, then input the new one, and repeat if it's still being silly.  This led to more confusion behind the wheel, but no small part of that was probably me fumbling with a new phone.We're also not supposed to anthropomorphize our phones like the iPhone.  Everything is much more designed to simply give you information, and it lacked a lot of the nice-to-have's like being able to open Pandora from voice.  Supposedly, that's there, but it wouldn't recognize it any way I tried, which included such favorites as Over-40-White-Male, Cake-Face, Straight-Hood (Male and Female), Spanglish, Darth Vader, and as close to George W. Bush as I can approximate.  The feature just feels like it's an early thing.  Wait for a more stable version.It's nice to be able to say \"OK Google Now, play Imagine Dragons,\" but the feature was a little underwhelming.  It's unfortunate too, because this isn't something you can play with at the store because you need to be in a sensory deprivation tank or recording studio to have a quiet enough room to get it set up.  I should also mention that this feature is about worthless if you need to use a screen lock because you'll have to grab your phone and point it at your mug or enter your passcode before it will attempt to do your bidding.So I ended up with a Note 2 for the time being, and swapping for a Note 3 on the way, which got the significant other a free nice phone to replace a Droid Charge, which was aptly named to remind you to bring your charger with you, and me the new gadget.  Honestly, I don't notice the difference in battery life.  It's maybe 1-2 hours of screen time difference, but if your main concern is battery life, get a nice phone and buy a battery pack.  It's a much nicer phone, as well and it's the little things, like how in the droid maxx, the on-screen buttons for back, menu, etc, will burn into your soul while you're watching a movie, where the Note 2 simply turns them off.So I'm drinking the soju now and it's quite nice.  The Maxx isn't an awful phone, but its battery life is laughably shorter than advertised, and if this is the main reason you're looking to buy the phone, as I did, then write that feature off completely and then look at buying the phone.  If that's the main thing you're looking for, get a nicer phone and buy a better battery, or like I did the 9600mwh Samsung pack, which will blow the panties off any phone.I hope this version was more useful.  I'm even going to give them a star back, but the phone, in my opinion was priced as a flagship best thing on the market, and it was pretty disappointing for the price.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wait the phone is great but...", "Author": "besher", "ReviewID": "R318QPFA7056U7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is great and works as it must. but if u r outside US don't buy it from here!!! because the 4G will not work just like what happened with me even the phone is unlocked.
