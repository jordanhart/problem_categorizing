She had an LG phone on Net 10, but she hated that the keyboard was very difficult for her to use.  She told me that this will help her send texts to her family and friends and that she was having difficulty sending accurate messages to.  For the money that I spent for this phone, it was well worth it.  The price was very affordable and it was very easy for me to get pictures of this phone to show her daughter and get her input. I would recommend this phone for anybody who has difficulty texting.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "C. J.

The LG website says it is discontinued, but it does everything I need & I love the QWERTY keyboard. It has a virtual keyboard, but I always use the QWERTY keyboard...think it's easier.

Why was it a fantastic phone?  Because it met all of the needs I needed it to do.Let me explain.I got my phone because I wanted to do one thing.  Communicate.  I didn't get it to browse the internet, tumblr, or just in general any of those things.  I got it so I could communicate with friends who did not have cell phones.  This meant using apps like Android Messenger ((which ended up being an MSN messenger for Android)), Skype, and Steam.  These were what I used to communicate with friends.Of course after about a year+ I realized that I had wanted a bit more out of my phone.  I know it sounds kind of silly because why would I need my phone for anything other than communicating?  Well browsing the web was honestly unacceptable.  Tumblr worked kind of okay, but that's about it.  Nothing to write home about.  Around a year and a half is when my phone started to break down and I was kind of sick of it.  Constantly crashing and things not working anymore, just in general wasn't really that good.  I was not pleased around the end of its life.All and all I'd have to say that if you want to use this for just communication purposes, this phone may be the right one for you, in the beginning.  I'd have to say it's a great intro for those who might be new to smartphones but aren't sure they want to do much.  Don't get this phone for playing games or running apps though.  While it may run a few, this device was not optimized to be doing so.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone for your money", "Author": "Maggie Brothers", "ReviewID": "R19G44PZ4GUWH2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First time smart phone user. I wanted a prepaid phone, I hate contracts and needed a QWERTY keyboard and this was perfect. My friend owned hers for over a year and recommended it to me. Only things that I don't like about it, battery life is terrible, it's pretty heavy, especially with a cover case, it restarts on it's own sometimes and when browsing the web it sometimes won't stay on the page, it'll go back to where you previously where. Other than that, The touch screen is on point, customization is great, service is pretty good (in my area), I ordered it on a Friday and it came on Monday just in time because my other phone ran out and also it was cheaper to buy this here (including shipping) than if you bought it at Best Buy or something.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet", "Author": "Irafutabel", "ReviewID": "R2OER5CZYLBOF4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product is Satisfactory, does what it supposed to do like the old school key board.

I have loved the phone most of it's life =)  It has been a good phone and has done what I needed it to do. My biggest complaint is it takes to long to take a picture.  I have missed many great pics of my granddaughter because it takes a couple of seconds from the time you hit the button to it actually taking the picture. That has been constant throughout the life of the phone. I still have my phone and it still works fine. Things are starting to go a little haywire, like it dropped all of my contacts so I can't just store numbers in my phone. I still have most of the numbers in under favorite, but I can't just put in a contact under favorite if I don't already have the number in the phone. If the number is in my caller ID I can add it to my favorites. My husband paid the $180 for it 2 yrs ago. You can get it for $50 now. I think it's worth it if you don't want or need the upgrade. Perfect for teens. I would recommend this phone. I think if you've experienced less than this with the phone, you've just gotten a lemon.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "Lizzie Who", "ReviewID": "R3CSM0TPB046B0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice Phone, great keyboard.

Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R1QWHAGN8A402T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a replacement for my previous phone of the same model (note: Net10 only provides a one-year warranty; beyond that, it's up to you to replace it).  Works the same as my old one.Pros:Real QWERTY keyboard.  Android OS.  microSD-HC slot (I keep it loaded with a 32GB card).  Net10 unlimited service is one of the cheapest out there, at $45/month for truly *unlimited* talk/text/data (in over 3 years, I have *never* had Net10 throttle my service because I was using too much).  Slider mechanism is smooth and solid.Cons:Keyboard is only three rows, would be even better with four.  Android 2.3 is capable, but getting a bit old, and there's no (authorized) way to upgrade.  The internal memory on this phone is somewhat limited, which means you can only install a handful of apps before you start moving things to the SD card...and not everything *can* be moved to the SD card.  Camera is a capable, but fairly humdrum, 3.2MP (and no flash).  Data service is limited to 3G (use WiFi when available).  Battery life is decent, unless processor-intensive apps (Google maps, Angry Birds, etc) are running.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEWARE! Net10 will be the worst experience of your life! Absolute Nightmare!", "Author": "Darob", "ReviewID": "RKPAQP7AIDIDZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Despite reading a number of awful reviews on the web about Net10 and their parent company TracFone, my son-in-law has a NET10 account and hasn't had any major problems, so I decided to give it a try too.I received my LG Optimus Q directly from Net10 and was able to get it working fine for a few hours. The LG Optimus Q (sometimes also called the Optimus Slider) is a good phone, works good. However I discovered that Net10 assigned me a phone number in the wrong area code (they use your postal zip code to determine what area code to assign, a mistake since many postal zip codes contain several area codes). It took a while to get through to their customer support, but when I did, the person who spoke only broken English seemed very helpful and polite and I assumed that the assignment of a new number would go fine. I WAS GREATLY MISTAKEN. After the call, the phone immediately stopped working, and I never could get it working again.All attempts to get a signal again in the area of the new assigned number, failed. I even went and sat beneath one of the cell towers in the revised area code, to be sure it was connecting with the right zone... but no luck. After making repeated calls (you get either busy signals or they place you on hold for extended periods) and sending several emails, I finally got through to a tech (another one who could barely speak English), followed her recommendations exactly... nothing worked. I tried calling and emailing them again... and finally an obviously irritated tech returned my call (this one spoke the worst English of any of them), who basically repeated the steps I had already followed through with... which I repeated, and which failed as well.Since I am an IT manager and also have a communications degree, I assumed that I could patiently slog my way through their struggling technical support efforts... and help them to assist me... but to no avail. After wasting many days with this nonsense, I called and emailed again to request a refund and to return the phone. After repeated efforts, I finally got a refund for the phone... but they would not refund the one month's airtime, which was an outrage considering that I received no usage from it.As far as I can tell, none of their customer support reps (that I spoke with) can communicate clearly in English... but neither are they sufficiently skilled with either the technology or the particular phones to assist customers. Worst of all, the company's final solution for dissatisfaction is to wear the customer down until he or she gives up.In my many years of dealing with all sorts of customer and technical support issues, this is the absolute worst I've ever experienced. If, like my son-in-law, you are able to get the phone working immediately and have no need to contact their technical support... you are one of the lucky ones, and will probably be able to survive their service.However if you have any need that will require you to contact customer service, you would be better off to throw the phone in the trash and bang your head against the wall until you come to your senses... then go out and spent mucho bucks to secure services with a legitimate phone company such as Verizon, with whom I've been a customer for 20+ years. I despise the arrogance of their prices, but no one can argue with their service.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "kristin t", "ReviewID": "R341OO4EUA7FIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was thrilled that the product arrived well within the projected delivery time & in perfect condition!
