I wanted as \"smart\" a phone as I could get without being required to pay $40.00 or more per month for service, and the LG 840G fits the bill beautifully! I must admit that I don't tend to use the web on my phone all that much, but the screen is an acceptable size if I need to do so. The camera is great and I've sent photos to friends. ( I'm not a kid, and switched from a flip phone, to see if I could adjust to the touch screen, and it was so easy with this phone!) Texting is a \"piece of cake\", with the virtual qwerty keyboard. The service is key, though. Tracfone is great, (same family as Net10), as this phone, as a tracfone, has triple minutes for life, but if you require 500 or more minutes per month, this phone, wit Net10 service is the way to go. I like using a stylus with it, and Amazon has some great choices, (including some that connect to the phone so it is always handy), but the touch screen responds just as well to your fingertips. The LG840G may not be a smartphone, per se, but it is certainly smart enough for me, and, probably for many more people out there, who just wanna be a bit more updated and feel more connected to what everyone else is doing.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb", "Author": "Bryan Heath", "ReviewID": "RC3MDAO8PY6OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Chose this phone after thorough research.

What I really like about the phone is the touch screen because it makes the items and messages on the phone bigger and easier to see.  I also like the fact that it is so much easier to text someone (especially my granddaughters) because you get the keyboard for your text messages.

Feels very solid, kind of big but not real heavy. The screen is not real sensitive so I never butt dial. Overall very easy to use. The only problem is it is a bit slippery, so if you're a butterfingers like me you might want a case. And a screen protector never hurts.The camera is decent--not real high quality, but it's great to have a functional camera in my pocket.It comes with a 2 GB micro SD card, which for me is plenty. You can transfer pictures/video from the phone (the memory card) to a computer with a micro-B USB cord (it's the same kind used for a Kindle Fire).The battery life is quite good. I only use it lightly but I only have to charge it about once a week.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple, easy to use phone that isn't quite as old-school as a flip phone.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Daughter Loved It!", "Author": "Lalani Egodawatte", "ReviewID": "R14GUGNSBAEF1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one for my daughter, and she loved it.

Whitehouse", "ReviewID": "R1X77Y0DR3H07K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the term \"smartish phone\" applied to the LG840G somewhere and liked it. If the iPhone 5 is genius, this thing has an IQ of about 85. Nonetheless it gets five stars from me, simply because you can't beat it for the price. For $35.00 on Amazon and no contract, I got a phone that does 90% of what I would use an iPhone for. The other 10% I can do better with my iPad anyway.The phone arrived a day earlier than originally expected (I ordered it on the weekend). I called Net10 to transfer my old Net10 number. Contrary to some other reviews the transfer was as next to painless as such things could be. The service rep was courteous and his English (though heavily accented) was clear. Within 15 minutes I was up and running.This phone looks like a smartphone, but is only smartish. You can't get apps (other than some games and a few java apps), so it's pretty much what you see. But that's not bad. There's a basic 2 MP camera and music player (you need to get a separate USB cable to connect to computer) a notepad, and a few other basic apps. For me, all I need.My old flip-phone only cost me $4.00 less, but was SO much less useful. I'm actually glad my wife dropped it in the water. Thank you, Honey.-------- Update ---------Having used the phone for a while now I've been able to find a few of its idiosyncrasies. The User Interface is practical but not fancy. The touch screen is a bit jerky and it's easy to open an app by mistake when trying to swipe to the next screen. The browser is very very basic. Don't expect to do any iPhone type surfing on it. Messages with downloads don't give you the info of who sent it so you use data time to download who-knows-what (today it was a \"good luck angel\" from a number i've never seen). By default the Notebook App brings up a number pad instead of the QWERTY keyboard, but this is easily fixable. Up in the right hand corner of the new note is a square with lines in it. Tap it and it gives you an \"input\" option. Select \"keyboard\" and type away. Unfortunately there is no way to save that setting. You have to do it each note.The same thing is available in other apps that take text. The most frustrating is the Contacts app. Each field brings up the same issue. You either have to type the first and last name with the phone numeric keyboard or set the input option to keyboard each time.When I tried to upload music to the phone with a USB cable, my MacBook (Running OSX Lion) wouldn't see it.  I removed the Micro SD card and used a card reader. That worked just fine, though it's a little more trouble. Sound is OK but not great with headphones (my iPod shuffle sounds slightly better in the bass range).With all that being said, I'm still very happy with this phone. It does all I need for very little money. I recommend it for the great number of callers who want more than a basic flip phone, but for whom an iPhone would be expensive overkill.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's Working Great!", "Author": "P.

I rarely used the phone; just mainly kept it for emergencies.  I just upgraded to this LG 840G and it is great.  It took me over an hour on the phone with Net 10 to get the phone set up and number transfered.  First I tried to do this online at the Net 10 site, but they don't want to transfer all the minutes over to the new phone ...only 1100.  I had alot more minutes and I wanted them all because I had paid for them as Easy Minutes over the past few years.  They told me I would have to accept about 1,000 less minutes than I had on my old phone.  I talked to a supervisor with no luck.  So I gave up when they transfered me to a manager....only I was just put on hold again to wait and wait.  I hung up and WROTE to their customer service online.  Within the hour,  the 1,000 minutes were added to my new phone.  So, don't give up the fight if they try to take away some of your minutes.The phone is great...touch screen, good camera, easy texting, simply set up, and looks good.

Brokaw", "ReviewID": "R3KEUBRSHEIA2T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would really prefer to make it work and keep it.But for some reason, Net10 was unable to transfer my old phone number from my old phone to this phone.And then when I went back to try to get it, they could not even change the phone's number to my area code.I have called them five times, but the phone number has never changed the way that it is supposed to.They don't seem to have the technical knowledge to handle difficult situations like this, and they have not answered an email when I tried to contact them that way.Too bad, because the phone would be pretty cool if they knew how use it.This is a new update from June 10, 2013:I was thinking about buying a different phone or a new one of the same model (hoping it would work) when I realized that Net10 wasn't even offering this model for my zip code from their website.  I also saw in my account online that my phone was actually waiting for a new phone number but had not received it (It was supposed to take no more than 4 hours but had not happened after several weeks).  This motivated me to try customer service one more time.  I passed through all of the call center options to get a technical support person and explained my problem.  He was unable to help but realized that I needed a different department.  The second department answered with a surprisingly good customer rep.  She realized almost immediately that I had the wrong SIM card all along and sent me a new SIM card.  I got the SIM card in the mail and installed it today with the help of a mediocre customer rep.  The phone now seems to work perfectly.Take home points: 1) This Amazon site may very likely send you a phone with a SIM card that doesn't work (not sure if it was a malfunction or improper card).  2) You may talk to customer service many times without anyone suggesting or recognizing that the problem is the SIM card.But I'm glad I have the phone.

Slover", "ReviewID": "R3D4IOQYFIXBJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is officially nothing special. It doesn't run Android or iOS, or any other operating system you've heard of. This means, if you want apps or games, they have to be java apps, and you'll be quite limited on what you can find.It has bluetooth, and wifi, and a camera that isn't as bad as I expected. The screen is generally responsive, though moving through screens and menus is a bit choppy. It doesn't have multi-touch, and it doesn't have a tilt sensor. All the phone stuff works great. Call clarity is good, the speaker is loud enough, and the antenna is fine. You *can* do youtube on it, but only via wifi, and videos are the size of a postage stamp. The web browser is ok, nothing special, but it forces you to fill in text bars (except entering a url) using a numerical keypad, despite the fact that the phone is perfectly able to display and use a qwerty keyboard. This is dumb.The battery, by the way, is great. It'll last four or five days with moderate use.So, if you want a cheap smart(ish) phone, that works well as a phone, this will do. If you want to do much more, though, look on to android or ios phones.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice improvement", "Author": "Mark McGinnis", "ReviewID": "R1STCRVWNB7V8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice improvement over the LG840.
