{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Definitely a hidden gem of a phone", "Author": "Just Me", "ReviewID": "R3AOBL4DVGK8DH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying I have an iPhone 5. I love it but some things are better on Android. I had purchased a Galaxy S4 and to my surprise, I actually didn't care for it. It was HUGE (though it had a super nice 5\" full HD screen) and the screen was not as responsive during text messaging as my previous Galaxy phones were. That latter problem was driving me crazy and it didn't matter which keyboard I tried or which app I was using. And I've had ALL the Galaxy S phones - the original, the S II, the S III, and then the S4.Enter the Galaxy Express. I decided I didn't want to spend a fortune. The Galaxy Express was the best combination of price and features - the Snapdragon S4 Plus CPU in this phone is no slouch. It also runs the latest Android which is another plus. This phone also has the newest 4G LTE, which I was not going to compromise on. The older (but still fast) 4G \"HSPA+\" network is fine but LTE is the future, so I wouldn't buy a phone without it if I'm spending a few hundred bucks.I LOVE the Galaxy Express! I'm picky as hell but for the price and feature set, I think Samsung/AT&T; got it right. The screen is not super ultra HD but it's crisp and clear. The camera isn't 13 MP (it's 5 MP) but the pictures are clear and are more than enough for Facebook, Instagram, and emailing. The touch screen is very responsive, Android runs smooth, and battery life surprisingly great for a smartphone. I charge it every other day. I need to charge my iPhone at least once a day, if not twice!Pros:- Price- 4G LTE- Snapdragon S4 Plus CPU w/ 1GB RAM- Super AMOLED Plus screen- Battery lifeCons:- It's not bleeding edge (but it's bargain priced, a worthy trade off!)All in all, very pleased. I find it a little insane that phones without a contract these days exceed the price of my Sony Vaio laptop! Seriously? This little gem of a phone has a great price tag and the performance to back it up. I LOVE 4G LTE. Everything loads so quickly but be careful not to burn through your data allowance - use WiFi when you're at home!", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding phone and service for the price-think galaxy S3", "Author": "J.

A nice phone with many nice features, but in the end the 3.5\" screen was difficult to use and the battery began to malfunction.  All great excuses to upgrade to the Galaxy Express.  GoPhone service is the best choice for me; the unlimited text, minutes, and 2GB data is enough for me.  I struggle to understand why people will pay $100+ a month for the exact same service via a contract plan???  Now AT&T; gives me a cool, functional phone.  Also, I won't look like an old nerd standing around the airport on my dinky Avail anymore.  I'm finally cool!Anywho...The 4.5\" screen is beautiful and easy to use.  The resolution isn't as high as other Samsung Galaxy products, but when I compare them side to side, I really can't tell the difference.  Especially after I turn up the brightness a little.The processor is fast enough to make use fast and no delay between apps, etc.Calls are clear and 4GLTE!Browsing and watching videos are smooth and no hanging up.The backward facing camera is low res (same as iPad 2), and the forward is only 5MP.  Not that high, but O.K. for Facebook.Very few bloatware apps.Feels sleek and light.  I don't like a case, because I carry my phone in my pocket and cases seriously add to the bulk of a phone.Does not come with SD card. (the Avail did) but it transferred easily.  I imported my contacts from my old phone to the SD card and then exported them to the Express after switching cards.  Look for the video on YouTube to do this.Uses a microSIM card which means the SIM from every other GoPhone phone will not work in it.

Does everything my iphone does but with a much bigger screen, sharper colors, and way lighter and SO much cheaper. I have perfect reception and call quality.

It is equal to the call quality of my land line. The clarity of the screen, which is described as Super AMOLED Plus, and the fast response when using either the browser or applications is amazing. I find battery life between charges is greater than that listed in the phones specifications. It has abundant internal memory which was also lacking in my previous smartphones. Although I don't use a data plan, knowing that if I do so in the future, I will have access to the 4G LTE network. I could go on and on about all the other positive aspects of this phone. So far I have found no negatives.Finally, I was so satisfied with this phone that a week later I purchased another for my wife, to replace her smartphone.

(AT&T; Gophone no-contract $25 250min talk/unlimited text and wifi data is perfect; you can purchase 4G data separately if you need it.) It is generous with internal phone storage (4GB+ for personal use) and does not come with a microsd card out of the box but can be greatly expanded with removable card. Big plus. I upgraded from a LG P506 (which I loved, but kept running out of internal storage- puny 30MB- with apps that would not install on the sd card). I will continue to use the P506 for a wifi device and unlock it to use overseas on local plans. But the Samsung Galaxy Express is an enormous upgrade- beautiful display, larger screen, front 1.3mp and back 5mp camera, native support for Youtube videos, MP4/WMV/H.264/H.263 player, Voice memos, easy screen customizability. The 2000mAh battery! I know that doesn't sound like the mongo 3000mAh batteries out there, but I have had it off charger for 3 days and *still* have 40% left on the battery. THAT will be awesome when traveling. Just purchased a Ballistic case for it, since the phone itself is slippery, but it is actually a perfect size - 5.22 x 2.73 x 0.36 in - thin and small enough to hold comfortably (even small hands), fit in pockets- perfect size for web surfing, fb or emailing.

Carriers like Virgin Mobile offer cut-rate plans, but their data service can be very frustrating at times.  Straight Talk offers \"bring your own device\" plans but the start-up costs with an unlocked phone can be very steep.  Tracfone and Net10 have reliable networks, but their overall handset selection is very thin for Android devices.AT&T; has it exactly right with the Galaxy Express GoPhone.  This is an Android device that doesn't feel antiquated, even in the slightest.  It works wonderfully on a network with unbelievably fast LTE that is not crippled or hindered for prepaid subscribers.  Best of all, it has been priced just right.  Simply stated, the Galaxy Express on AT&T; is a perfect balance of quality and economy.The phone itself has relatively few noteworthy flaws.  My biggest complaint is that it won't accept 64 GB microSD cards.  Most people can get along just fine with 32 GB, but my MP3 collection alone is well over 40 GB these days.  The other minor gripe I have is the device's audio output level.  It seems a little lower than other phones, but it still is in a borderline acceptable range.When it comes to the positives of the Galaxy Express, the list is long.  The 4.5\" screen is nice, vivid, and eye-pleasing.  Apps run flawlessly on the dual-core Snapdragon processor.  There's plenty of on-board memory for app storage.  It doesn't feel bulky or thick in your pocket.  Even the battery life is better than I expected for an Android phone.  One can easily get a full day's use from it without needing to plug in.  I'm coming from a Samsung Note 2 (on contract with US Cellular) so my standards for judging an Android device are very high.  The Galaxy Express measures up nicely despite being a prepaid handset.The greatest phone in the world is worthless if the network it uses is poor.  AT&T; has come a long way since 2009 when I left them for Virgin Mobile.  Their data network works exceedingly well.  LTE speeds on AT&T; are easily three to four times faster than LTE on US Cellular.  The best part is I'm spending over $20 less per month with GoPhone, getting much faster data, and unlimited talk/text as well.  AT&T; is a truly national carrier, so my phone will work in places US Cellular will never even have roaming agreements.Samsung makes great phones, and while the Express isn't their most sophisticated device, it competes well against any mid-range offering out there.  Meanwhile, AT&T; is making a serious case for having the best overall value in prepaid wireless.  I'm certainly glad I switched to their GoPhone service, and the Samsung Galaxy Express is the biggest reason for my contentment.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best deal you can find for prepaid service", "Author": "starlord", "ReviewID": "R311SRO87H07HT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this item a week ago. So far so good. Recently switched to this phone from Boost Mobile/Sprint. It has a huge processor, pretty decent camera, 8GB internal memory storage, and a 800x480 screen resolution. I've heard complaints that the screen is not high resolution, but it looks pretty crisp and clear to me. The phone is very similar in terms of specs and appearance to the Galaxy S III.The best thing all and all about this phone is how your getting 4G LTE service from At&T;, which for me, switching from Sprint has been a good choice, and you get it all with no contracts! I've been to several places where Boost/Sprint just didn't work, and yet my Galaxy Express phone still has service. And when I don't get LTE service, which doesn't happen very often, it just switches to 4G, which is also pretty fast.This is honestly the best the best deal you can get out there if your not looking for a contract. I'm paying only 60 dollars a month for unlimited talk, text, and 2 GB of data (4G LTE), which is plenty for me because I'm on WiFi half of the time.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value in prepaid Android phone", "Author": "Douglas Eggleston \"Doug\"", "ReviewID": "R37P41QPIU7K5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for two weeks straight looking for the best value in a prepaid Android phone with Jelly Bean on GSM (AT&T; preferred), and this is it.  Yes, the screen is 720p and the camera is 5MP, and it is a dual core and not quad, hence the word value.  IMHO, they made the right compromises to reach the best price point.

Its faster then my $800 Dell laptop! Pages load so quick it puts my old phones processor to shame.The voice to text is amazing! It texts out what you say as you say it and surprisingly it is spot on almost every time!! The fusion 2 voice to text messed up what i said all the time, It was very disappointing.They now have swype & Voice to text on the same keyboard!! No more switching in between android & Swype! Swype is also sooooo much better on this phone then it was on the fusion. It makes each word correctly so no more fixing text messages!The screen is big, But not to big to handle. Still fits perfectly in my hand! It weighs less or about the same as my smaller fusion did which is amazing. The speakers on it sound great! Overall i just can't even believe the quality of this phone.I use to HATE smartphones because it was hard to text on them seeing as the voice to text always use to mess up, The swype would not work correctly or efficiently, Regular text i would hit the wrong letters with my big fingers and they were pretty slow loading pages and videos. Now because of this phone i now LOVE smartphones!!!! This thing is just put together so well and is so efficient compared to any of the other phones that i have used or have owned in the past.I didn't want to spend $200+ on a gophone and almost wanted to return it to get something cheaper again but i am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy i kept it! I will spend the extra every time i need a new phone as long as it runs and works like this one does! AMAZING PHONE!! I would highly recommend!

I had just finally finished my 2 year contract in November and decided to go a cheaper route (mostly because I would be paying the bill from now on). So after checking out a few of the cheaper cell phone plans, I came across Aio (which I found out is AT&T;'s new prepaid alternative). They offer unlimited talk/text and 2 GB of what they refer to as \"high speed data\", which is 4G LTE. Anything after 2 GB is throttled to about the speed of Metro's 3G, but hey, it's unlimited. Anyway, for the longest time everyone told me Verizon's iPhone 5 model was special and could be activated on any SIM network. This was wrong. So, I sold Aio the phone and they paid $190 for it, which isn't a bad deal since I bought it for $200. I paid the difference in cash and left with this phone. Needless to say, it is strikingly similar to the Galaxy S3 save for less than half an inch in height. It's performance and screen size/quality is on par with the S3. The only significant difference is the camera quality and the speaker position (it's placed a little awkwardly). Other than that, you're basically paying about $200 for a nerfed S3.

I read lots of reviews before I bought this phone and kept wondering if people were really telling it like it was. Now that I own this phone I'd say yes they were dead on.The good: A nice clear screen, good size phone that's easy to handle and very easy to use. For a prepaid phone this is really a nice change!The not so good: Sometimes it feels as though the processor is lagging a little as it takes a couple seconds for the phone to catch up to what I'm pushing. Not all the time but sometimes.Also I'm used to being able to set different sounds or tones for different things so I know what I'm receiving before I even pick the phone up. Like one tone for email, another for texts, another yet for calendar reminders. This phone doesn't let you do that. It's all 1 tone for every notification so you never know what you've received until you look at the phone. Also I'm used to having an LED flash when I have a missed call or any type of text, etc. This phone doesn't show if you've missed anything so you have to turn the phone on to check it.

Since I am used to Apple, I feel there is a slight lag with the camera and loading apps but it's all good once you get used to it. Call clarity is great, apps work well, volume is good and I like the size. I was a GoPhone customer before and this will only make it better. Great price from Amazon too...saved $40 that day on it! I would buy another one if the husband wants to go with a smart phone.November 9, 2013:  Well, I've had it for 2 months now and I cannot say how much I love this phone. Had a new baby grand daughter and all the pix I took came out great and posted to Facebook and Instagram flawlessly. It is a great deal.

I almost did not purchase this phone because of this supposed limitation.  I was very pleased to discover that you CAN set different tones for different events.  I have 2 e-mail addresses and I have set each of these to play a different sound when I receive an incoming email. (Tap E-mail Icon ---> Tap Menu Button --> Settings ----> Tap the email account you wish to set the sound for ---> Scroll to Select Ringtone ---> Tap the Greater Than Sign ----> Choose a ringtone)  I have another sound for text message alerts and another sound as my incoming phone call ringtone.I was able to find cases for this phone on amazon and ebay.  In addition to a case, I suggest the iVisor screen protector which applies to the screen easily and without any bubbles.  I suggest using the \"Navigation\" GPS app instead of AT&T;'s app (which comes at a cost if you want the turn-by-turn navigation to be read out loud while you are driving).

It works on the gophone plan on ATT (though it seems it can work on other plans - straight talk). My reason for purchasing it was the price and to use it on ATT's 4g LTE network.  The applications open fine and the speed is more than adequate.The camera (only 5 MP) is okay but is not that great.  The screen is vivid but you can see pixels on some photos.  The screen is not like the one on a Galaxy S3 but is adequate for the price.  It did freeze up some while running a few applications.  Battery life is fine (though if you do run a lot of applications it will run down fast).  Overall this is a good budget phone and if you have 4G LTE in your area it runs quite well.  My one other gripe with the phone was when I streamed music via bluetooth in my car the song info (title/artist) did not show up on my car radio screen.In the end I did not keep the phone because I wanted a better camera phone and a slightly faster processor. I have a Galaxy S3 and use it on the gophone plan.

That's why I gave it five stars.  The one thing I don't like about it didn't cost it enough points to lose any stars.  \"What's the one thing CarolynAnne doesn't like about it?\" you're probably asking.  Well, I'll tell you.  The keypad tone.  The sound the number keys make when you're dialing a number and you have the keypad tone turned on.  It  don't sound like a regular phone's keypad: bleep bleep bleep.  It sounds more like a single drop of water dropping into a glass or a 1 gallon size bucket filled with water.  Now you're probably wondering why it is that you can download ringtones on this phone and you can download hundreds of apps, I've downloaded 125, but you can't change the keypad tone.  It doesn't give you that option.  You either have to put up with it or turn it off.  Some people might like that \"drop of water dropping into more water\" sound.  I find it annoying, so I keep it turned off.Now let me tell you 7 of the things I love about this phone.1. Size matters.  I love the size of this phone.  It makes my LG Thrive feel so little.  Yes, I still have my LG Thrive as a back up phone.2. Hundreds of apps instead of 9 to 12.  On my last phone, the LG Thrive, I could only download 9-12 apps.  I had to be selective about them or I'd get the low storage space warning.  As I said earlier, I've download 125 apps and still haven't gotten the low storage space warning.How do I know how many apps I've downloaded?  I go to my apps then I hit the arrow pointing down then I see just the apps I've downloaded.  On the downloaded apps, there are 20 apps per page, 5 rows with 4 apps per row.  I've counted how many pages have 20 and how many pages have less than 20 and that's how I know I've downloaded 125.3. Shortcuts on lock screen.  You can put shortcuts to 4 apps on the lock screen.  Then if you want to go to one of those apps when you unlock the phone, you just press on that appp's shortcut and slide your finger.  When it unlocks you'll be in that app.  Couldn't do that with my LG Thrive.  To set up the 4 shortcuts just do these steps:1...Go to settings-the gear shaped app at the bottom of the screen.2...Once in settings,scroll down till you see lock screen.3...Click on Lock Screen then click on Lock Screen Options.4...Turn on shortcuts.5...Touch where it says shortcuts to pick the 4 apps you want shortcuts to on the lock screen.After you've created 4 shortcuts, if you decide you don't want a shortcut to app a but you do want a shortcut to app b instead, then before you exit the lock screen shortcuts menu, pull the app you don't want a shortcut to down to the trash can at the bottom of the screen.  When the trash can and app both glow red, you can take your finger off the screen then just touch...not hold..the plus sign to add the app shortcut you do want.  You can also rearrange the order after you've added all 4.  Just press and hold down the shortcut till it moves up slightly then move it to where you want.  Just be sure you see a small blue vertical line like this--> | at the top of the shortcut you're moving otherwise it'll just move back to its original spot.4. Volume buttons and text size.  This is how to set it up so you can adjust the font size in text messages using the volume buttons.  In messaging, tap the menu button on the bottom left corner of the phone and go to settings in the little menu that comes up on the bottom of the screen.  Then to set it so the volume buttons adjust the size of the font in your text messages just put a check mark in the box next to \"Use the volume key\".  Really love this feature.  Don't need my glasses to read my text messages.5. This phone comes with a sim card but not a micro sd card.  Why am I so happy about that?  Because it allows me to pick how many GB of storage space I want my micro sd card to have.  I use a 64 GB micro sd card.  You might not want anything over 16 GB for your micro sd card and you can do that since you have to buy a micro sd card.  It's just for me: BGGER is better, hence the 64 GB.6. Clock app features.  I love the clock app that came on this phone.  You can have as many or as few alarms as you want or need.  I've tried to get it to give me a \"you've reached the limit of alarms\" message but I haven't yet.  I went high as 12 (or was it 14) last time I tried.  Never did get the \"you've reached the limit of alarms\" message. Here's another thing I like about this phone's clock app.  With my LG Thrive I couldn't turn the snooze off on any of my alarms.  The best I could do was set the snooze to the max which was 30 minutes.  The 30 minutes would be 30 minutes from when the alarm stopped alarming without me stopping it, which was usually a minute after it had started alarming.  This phone you can turn the snooze off completely on all or some or none of your alarms.  Really love that.7. Battery life.  On days when you don't use it much, very little at all, you can go over 24 hours between charges.  I have an app (Battery Notifier Pro BT) on mine that shows what percentage of battery life I have left as a number in the status bar.  I start getting the low battery warning at 15.  When I pull the status bar down, next to that number it shows how long the phone has been disconnected from the charger.  I once went 27 hours 15 minutes between charges.  Amazing but true.  This phone has a power saving mode which helps about the battery life.  The power saving mode comes on by itself, so you don't have worry about it.  I don't recommend turning it off but if you REALLY want to, you can do this one of 2 ways.  Either in settings where it says Power Saving (the word mode might be hid by the on/off switch) or by pulling the status bar down and clicking on Power Saving in the top right corner of the screen.Sorry Amazon.  I didn't buy this phone from you.  I bought it at a store in Florence, Alabama in November 2013.  I waited till now to write this review because I didn't want to write this glowing 5 star review then a month later take the phone back because I found 2 or more things on it I couldn't use which might've made me dislike the phone enough to take it back.To sum up my review: I sincerely feel this phone is worth every penny of what it cost.

My old phone was a flip phone (it was so old, I got a text from AT&T; saying they were no longer going  to support it - they did offer me a free, new phone, but it was chintzy and I decided it was time to move up!) I love this (Galaxy Express) phone!  I'll admit I went to the AT&T; store everyday for about a week to learn how to use it, but, hey, it was all new to me.  It works well for texting (touch screen keyboard - but you can also speak your message and it will type it out for you, a great feature if you're driving), and for talking (you can hook it up to hands-free in your car).  But what I really love are all the apps, and widgets which you can set up customized on your homescreens.  My favorite thing is the Music Player - I don't bother with my iPod anymore.  I can listen to music directly from the phone itself (w/ or w/out earbuds) and also can hook it up to my car speakers with aux. cord.  The camera takes good quality pictures - maybe not quite to the degree of my Canon SX160, but very acceptable, and very convenient when I don't want to carry my camera with me.  It has lots of settings, too:  auto white balance (& other light source settings: daylight, fluorescent, etc...), scene modes, timer, metering, ISO, flash, self-portrait, shooting mode, effects (b&w;, sepia), resolution, etc... Aside from the pictures I take on my phone, I load and store pictures in it - instead of the old days of carrying wallet photos, I scanned and store my kids baby pictures in it, pictures of my hubby, etc... . You can also store documents in it.  For example I have a typed, detailed list of meds and foods I'm allergic to that I store in my phone (handy info).  I use my phone almost exclusively now for facebook, pinterest, google searches, youtubes, etc...  You can also watch movies on it.  I have a variety of games (nice for passing the time), a calculator, calendar, compass, light-up magnifying glass for when I forget my reading glasses in dim restaurants :), a timer, weather forecast (accuweather), google sky map, etc...  Another feature that I was unfamiliar with before I purchased my phone that I like a lot is \"Screenshot\" - you press the Home key and Power/Lock key simultaneously and the phone will take a picture of whatever is showing on the screen at the moment. I purchased a 32 GB memory card for the phone, so I can store tons of music and photos without using up internal memory.  The phone screen is Gorilla Glass - good stuff, doesn't scratch!!  Phone comes with a charger cord, and a computer cord.  It has a really good battery, long-lasting. I use my phone a lot, and charge it once a day (I can sometimes go a bit over a day, but hate to run it low and have it run out on me). I have the \"Belkin Surround Dual Layer Bumper Case for Samsung Galaxy Express SGH-I437 - Fitted Case - Retail Packaging - Black/Gray\" - for my case (hate to send you away from Amazon - but I got it for $5.00 from AT&T;) I like it a lot - it works great for me.  It doesn't add bulk to my phone, It is a bumper case (just fits around the edges of your phone.  It is hard plastic along the sides/top/bottom but the front edge that goes across the edges of the screen in front, and in the back are rubbery and stick up a lil higher than surface of the phone which protects your screen and back cover when your phone is laid down (or dropped). The rubber edges also give my fingers something to hand onto, as the phone with no cover can feel a little slippery in your fingers.  Additionally, the rubbery edge gives it a little grip - if I lay the phone on my leg, or on the car seat, or couch arm, etc... it doesn't slide off. I know that Otterbox style covers are popular, but I don't like a lot of bulk on my phone - and, I'm not one who is prone to dropping their phone so it's not a big worry to me.  However, if it makes you feel better, there is a youtube of some drop tests of a phone with a bumper case :).  I've had this phone for 7 months and am very happy with it.  There isn't anything that I dislike about it.  One thing I was a little leery of, when I bought, it was that it would seem to big (2 7/8\" x 5 5/16\" WITH the bumper cover on) because I walk, bike, and hike a lot and like to carry it in a pocket.  But even that has worked out fine - I still fit it in a jacket, jean, or shorts pocket (that little rubber bumper helps it not to slide out).  This phone is worth every penny (it is $199. now, - I paid $224. That's okay - no regrets!)", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "tye", "ReviewID": "R3VD7OMQEGQ9I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "nice phone, great reception, although beware keeping Wi-Fi setting on, eats battery up, apps are so so. would recommend for first phone, though a little pricey.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Expensive", "Author": "Makin it Rain", "ReviewID": "R1VL3WBNFHCZ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, I would have thought it would have looked and felt nicer.

You are going to *LOVE* the Galaxy Express.  It's ridiculously faster, has a ton more memory, and you can cram in a 32gb external SD card for additional memory.  I mean, really...Yes, the Avail and the LG were the first prepaid Smartphones, but it's a case of you don't know what you're missing until you try the Express.  My 3G reception, slow and spotty in non-wifi zones, was downright pathetic to the 3G reception of the Express. (Yes, it is a 4G phone, but remember that if you aren't in a 4G area, 3G suddenly matters.)I'm not a person who has to load a lot of extra stuff on my phone. I have a handful of apps that I can't live without. I have the entire collection of my favorite band, some of their videos for emergencies, my language podcasts to study, and about a hundred necessary pictures (ok stop laughing!).  The camera on this phone doesn't have a fantastic resolution (I wonder why, seriously, given how easy it is to have a great camera these days) but it's fine for what you need, and it will take both front- and back-facing pictures, which is nice.  The phone also has that handy Assistive Light feature for when you can't see your car keys or you drop something under your desk at work.  Most of the screens are user-friendly, and you can customize your tones, reminders, settings to your heart's content.I have some gripes with the way the calendar functions in the Express as far as setting reminders go, but I've solved that by getting an app and I pretty much ignore the calendar now. I also recommend immediately getting an android-friendly browser like Dolphin that will allow you to exit an internet session easily.  The browser that comes with the phone forces you to back out of EVERY screen you went through. This is extremely annoying and probably uses up some of your data package.I still haven't found time to sit down and read the PDF of the user's manual, but I will get to it.

I  do like so many of the features; camera is just so-so but it's able to be lived with.  The call quality is excellent; (on both ends); speaker phone is good; texting is easy.  Battery life I'd rate as 4.5 out of five stars; it beats my old Samsung Galaxy II hands down in that area.But....(and there's always a but....) there are a few very annoying glitches that I feel shouldn't be present in such a new phone!  The phone turns off and on by itself; the Wifi (though appearing to be turned on) drops and the symbol in the status bar no longer appears, so you need to go in through your settings and turn it off and turn it back on again in order for it to resume working.  Sometimes the touch screen is very slow or freezes up; for some reason the Google Calendar app stopped syncing with the on-line calendar (though all other Google apps kept syncing properly) and to fix it I needed to delete and basically \"wipe out\" all my calendar entries and re-enter.  Not fun.Honestly -- when this phone works, it's a pleasure to use.  But with the poorly functioning Wifi and the very annoying, intermittent rebooting on it's own ...cause me to rate it at only 3 stars.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Cassandra Mitchell", "ReviewID": "RBURE7GU0IEYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love the phone.

Overall I like it, but it's not perfect. Sometimes when I press the side button to shut the screen off, it powers off. Not ideal when you're on a call. When writing an email, it lists options for autocorrect and you select the right one, sometimes it puts the word at a random place. I never had that happen in previous phones. The camera is good but it doesn't have the action option like some other phones.One of the reasons I got this phone is to also work as a hotspot. It appears that it could work, but it doesn't. I called AT&T; and they told me GoPhones cannot work as hotspots. I had looked into this before I purchased and thought it wouldn't be a problem, but I was wrong.When I first got the phone, I got random calls and texts from people who were after the guy who had my number before (for unpaid bills/rent, bail money and other good stuff). Since then I ported over my current number and all is good now.

I want to me sim card from old phone and plug into the galaxy and voice, text and wireless just like I did with at&t; fusion 2 go phone. I chaecked with AT&T; before I purchase the phone and they told me the only problem I would have the Galaxy has a new micro SIM card. No worries, just take you phone a they will swap the SIM card for not charge and I should be all set. I would have my same plan with no changes.When I got to the store they told this was a smart phone and I needed to buy a data plan. I verified that I would not have to do this at least 2 before buying phone. After several on chat and in the store walked out of the store with 3 lines, unlimited voice, text and 15gb data for $135. I did not want data but I was willing to try it month to month because I own the phones and have no contract. If I found I could find the plan I was looking for I could switch providers. To do this I need my phone unlocked. AT&T; is now telling me they will not allow me to unlock it for 6 months. WTF. After one day the phone appears to be very nice but AT&T; is terrible and is trying to keep a long time customer hostage just because I am looking for the best price. If this not get resolved I plan on unlocking the phone myself and taking it to Tmobile.
