I am finding it very easy to use and I have not had any issues with anything EXCEPT the placement of the volume and power buttons.  They are directly opposite eachother and however I hold the phone, I am hitting one or both of them accidentally.  I LOVE the purple, its a great shade.  It did scuff easily, unfortunately,  so I have to cover it with a case and I am now hunting for a good crystsl clear case.  Great battery life and was VERY easy to set up.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "S3", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2XQ307XPZ2UEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE IT !!! thanks Amazon for  giving me a better deal then Sprint The S3 is great and it is in my favorite color purple :)", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Updated my earlier review", "Author": "Dewayne R. Clubb", "ReviewID": "R1KXLMZP1Q65CE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything else about the phone is great but....I guess it is my fault for not doing a more in-depth search on the internet or it could be just my particular phone that Amazon sent me. People can not hear me when I try talking to them on the phone so Amazon is supposed to be sending me a replacement when this one gets sent back to them. If the second one does perform like it is supposed to then I will update my rating. If not then I will send the phone back so they will reset my upgrade eligibility and so I won't be charged for the activation fee. ***Updated see below***Okay so here's the deal.  The internal microphone is located on the bottom of the phone and unlike my HTC EVO 4g LTE phone; when I hold the Galaxy S3 usually I was holding my pinky over the mic unknowingly covering it up therefore making it so people could not hear me and in turn making me think there was a problem with the phone.  When I received the second phone I did not want to give up so I continued to troubleshoot and after more searching on the internet decided to test out the theory with the microphone.  So my problem was solved.I now do not have any complaint whatsoever with this phone and my area does have 4g as well so that makes me even happier.  I have had Sprint service for about 7 years.  I would say my preferred brands of phones are either HTC or Samsung but I waited for the longest for this phone.  I chose this one because HTC did not have another one that I wanted at the time and I did want a Galaxy but not the S4 because I did read of the problems with the S4.So if you are thinking about getting the S3 I would say you would not be making a mistake nor making a mistake in choosing Sprint as they are a decent value for the money.  For what they charge for the Simply Everything plan it can't be beat by ATT, Verizon, and/or T-Mobile. A lot of people seem to go with those companies because those companies seem to have flashier commercials and buy into the hype. Sprint does not try to hype anyone else up. I did check into Verizon and the others before choosing Sprint years ago and the costs for what I have for Sprint, the other companies would have bled me dry all the features I have with Sprint.So in closing I am more than satisfied with not only with my Purple Samsung Galaxy S3 but also with the service I receive from Sprint.

I've never liked iTunes and they change up their phones like three times a year. The Galaxy S3 is not the newest thing, but it's still very nice, works very well, and has a great big screen.  The battery life isn't that bad for what I use it for. The only real complaint I have is not being able to remove apps that came installed on the phone. You don't have to have them on your main menus, but when you go to the Apps menu there's tons of pre-loaded apps from Samsung that I have absolutely no need for, some of them are practically duplicates (there's like 6 apps for music & movies from Samsung) and it can't be removed at all. I've called about it actually.  I have an issue with the phone's menus recognizing my headphones after a few weeks, and I've been too lazy to call on it, so that's kinda my bad. Anyway overall it's a great phone and I'm happy with it. I also purchased another in Black for my fiance, and he has no issues (aside from the unnecessary apps already stated)", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!!", "Author": "GET IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT", "ReviewID": "RK193N62JASU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE IT!!!

The camera is amazing, even in low light. The flash does not distort colors but it is bright.Call quality is very, very clear, and the size of the phone makes it, at least for me, easier to talk on. I don't feel like the micophone is in my cheek.The purple is a dark, lovely purple. Even though I have mine in a case, I still wanted purple.I think it had a fairly good battery life. It charges fast. I messed with mine all day as well as texting on it and it only used 50% of the battery.I have not used a lot of the features yet. It's easy to customize anything you like. From apps and widgets on your screens, to ringtones and message tones specific to a friend or family member.
