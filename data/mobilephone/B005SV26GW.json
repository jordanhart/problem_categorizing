I get an upgrade soon, and I'm definetly going to miss this phone. Easy to text, nice calling, easy to use, GREAT battery life (I once got 7 days out of this phone on one charge!) Incredibly durable! It has survived two years of a teenage girl who has issues with dropping it and falling into rivers with it in her pocket. Never got a replacement. I had a friend kick-drop it across a field onto solid concrete, and it was perfectly fine. The blue is very beautiful and looks nice. AMAZING PHONE! The only down side is the camera. Not gunna lie, it sucks. However, if you are looking for a durable, easy to use, pretty, texting phone, this is a great buy! I would definately reccomend it!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Laggy mess", "Author": "Cucco", "ReviewID": "R17XBNQ12BA9O1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this phone back in 2010 because our two year contract expired. While the phone itself looks cute, it's too short. I find myself having trouble having conversations on it because I either have to hold it at my ear, or my mouth. If it were just two inches longer it would fix that problem.Another thing would be the lock screen. It's really hard to unlock (two buttons in a row), but I have it set to the one button setting. Even on one button, it takes a moment to unlock itself. Opening the phone is faster. And for some reason, the 9 and # key can be pressed on lock...The sound recording is shoddy, and the camera changes anything brown to purple. It's okay, but a lot of my pictures are yellow and purple instead of colorful.The phone itself is horrendously laggy. Texting people can be miserable. I have a friend that texts me a second time while I reply to her, so I have to exit my long text to read it. It then asks if you want to save as a draft, and then it lags some more. Sometimes it saves it for me, even though I didn't want it to. Deleting drafts are just as much as a hassle.The battery lasts me maybe a few days if I'm lucky. My brother has had to get two new batteries -- he texts like 5000 times a month and his phone can't seem to take it.I think the part that annoys me the most about the phone is its dying alert noises. It does way too much to let you know the phone is dying:-the battery bar flashes at the top-it makes a really loud BEEPBEEPBEEP during calls at random intervals-it covers up the main screen and will not go away after you unlock it until you press \"ok\" (and it lags, of course)-it makes one sound randomly to alert you to its dying, sometimes regardless of sound settings-makes that one sound three times in a row, then shuts off when it finally goesThe phone's backlight turns off and it becomes even more annoying to use. It doesn't seem to be a lot of things, but it builds up quickly. I only need to be alerted once of a phone on low battery. Once it gets down to half battery, I assume that it will be dead before the day is over. I do not even use this phone that much to warrant it dying so much.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "I hate this phone", "Author": "SEEatdwma", "ReviewID": "R2DHLN945XHDS9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i got this phone about 3 months ago and at first is was a good phone battery lasted 7 days most of the time with regular use but recently the battery has been horrible. It dies every time i hit send on a call or text and when i plug it in it says battery full please unplug then i turn it on and it dies right off the bat. i have never over charged it. i always unplug it when it beeps and says battery full but still it dies. Not just the battery has problems. I noticed that before the battery went bad i would text someone and it would try to get 2 incoming texts at a time then it would turn the screen black and shut down. also it freezes alot if you have more than 20 texts messages in your inbox. ive tried turning off the backlights entirely and used it for a day to see if it would hold a charge and it wont. everyone says buy a new battery but im not going to buy a new battery when i just got it and its not just the battery that has problems. and all my friends that have this phone says theres dies fast they charge theirs every night to compensate but when i ask if theirs is slow too they say yes. deinetly slow especially when texting. but other than that its nice i like how you can text during calls and the infrared camera is useful in the dark. :) till it freezes or dies.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT", "Author": "loakley1968", "ReviewID": "R3K40S3CJX7P1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works great just like old phone I had would buy another one if and when I break my phone again will replace with the same phone", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "D.

All the phones she had prior to this phone were used ones passed down to her from family members who upgraded to other phones. She's 11 years old and involved in lots of school activities, sports and other things that often leave her needing a way for her to be able to get a hold of us to let us know when she's done or needs a ride. She uses the phone daily as her alarm clock to wake up for school, and she texts her friends often, so the full keyboard is handy.Within a month of having the phone, she had dropped it on the floor at her grandmothers house and it cracked the screen. Thankfully, it's a smaller one that just on the side, so we can still read the screen well. When I try and navigate through it, I find most of the menus and button layouts a bit of a pain to use. The buttons are so small (and I have extremely small hands) I find the phone difficult to use. To dial a phone number, both she and I have to use the tip of our fingernail to press the buttons down, or else we press more than one button at a time.Reception and battery life are fine, and are comparable to all the other phones we have in the home. The blue color is bright and well liked by my pre-teen daughter. It's recently taken a few hits by some water balloons, and after drying out for a day, it went back to working normally again. Other than the crack in the screen, it's actually held up to a lot of abuse, often being lost in messy bedrooms, tossed around in a backpack and left outside a few times. If the buttons were better, it would be a nicer phone. But with everything being so small, I would say this one is best suited for pre-teens.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a great price.", "Author": "Kyle W.

I then only adjusted the time (Ie didn't change any volume or tone settings) by 5 minutes or so and it worked.-It often gets unlocked in my pocket and then dials/sends random texts.-Occassionally it gets put into reflash mode in my pocket.

I usually don't like my new cell phones immediately. I need time to bond with them. I usually end up disliking my phone a lot the first week or two, but then get used to the quirks and end up either very happy with it or at least somewhat fondly remember it and its oddities. I usually even form a sort of attachment to my old phones.This phone was the exception.I hated this phone. Not because of the hardware or dropped calls or anything critical like that. The hardware seemed fine. The problem was purely the terrible software and its remarkable amount of inconsistencies and annoyances.* The alarm clock was completely unreliable. On multiple occasions an alarm simply did not go off. I even double-checked the second time it happened just to make sure I didn't have it on silent or that it wasn't on PM when it should have been on AM. It just flat-out did not go off on several occasions. So I couldn't use the phone for an alarm clock or trust it at all, like I had grown accustomed to with other phones.* The text messaging \"helps\" were horrible. For instance, when you got to the end of a sentence and hit the period key (or any other end of sentence indicator) and then a space about half of the time it would capitalize the next word and half it wouldn't. The problem there is that if you assumed that it didn't when it actually did and hit the shift key you thereby engaged caps lock, and were suddenly shouting at whomever you were writing the message to.* The locking feature was goofy. Sometimes you'd end up having to unlock the phone to answer a call. Not all the time, mind you, but some of the time. And other times the auto-lock wouldn't engage for some reason, so I'd check my phone later and find that it was unlocked and in a menu. Again, it was just inconsistent.* When the keypad was locked, if you pushed the wrong button (any button other than the unlock button) the entire screen would be blocked by a popup screen with a message saying that the phone was locked. This completely blocked the clock. So if you got the phone out of your pocket to see what time it was, you had to wait until the message went away before you could see the time. The thing was that the message was a very small percentage of the actual popup; it was simply bad planning to make it cover the entire screen like that.Those are just the issues that I recall of the top of my head. Everyone else that had one that I've talked to personally disliked it as well. I never heard anyone indifferent or pleased with it; most just wanted to get rid of it as soon as they could. I've read positive reviews online, sure, and I'm sure those people exist, but IRL people? Not one positive review.Honestly, this phone has made me very leery about ever trying any other Samsung phones. If they were this lousy at software engineering, do I really want to trust them with something more advanced?", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "Brian Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3FIQUYP7L6AB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly as advertised and works great!

My cell phone bill was getting too expensive and I average less than 5 phone calls and less than 10 texts a month. Didn't see the point in paying for all that when not using it. I have the Kindle Fire HDX to get mobile internet so I needed a regular cell phone for the calls I may need to make. So I researched and decided on this one.Once you get used to a Smart Phone these pull out keyboards are difficulty. Trying to figure out what text messages are from who and who got what is difficult. I actually sent a text to my boss telling her to go apply for a job at a different company (we're nurses and this was a non-nursing job), that was meant for my daughter. Had to explain that one to her boss (LOL).When sending a text you can only use 160 characters (including spaces), and when you receive a text, it only has 160 characters, so if it is a long message you get a lot of texts and when you're trying to text back, receiving a text interrupts your typing. But for the price of the phone and the cell phone service now, and how little I use it to talk or text, it will do.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because any time something touches a button it comes on. Thank goodness you have to unlock the keypad or who knows what would happen.The battery life on this phone is great. I have left it unplugged for 3 days and still had battery life left.

In fact I would say it is perfect for the person who is not in the market for a smart phone but just a simple cell phone for calls and texting. The Intensity has a slide out QWERTY keyboard that helps make text messages easy and it is I think the best basic cell phone for someone who does a lot of text messaging like myself. I have had mine for over two years now and it is still in pretty good shape. It has been dropped a few times but it is a sturdy little phone. The only complaints I have with the phone is because it is not a flip top you can find yourself easily without knowing it having buttons on the keypad being pressed if you keep the phone in your pocket. Also while the phone does have a camera it takes ok pictures at best. Not too big a deal for me since I don't take that many pictures but for those who do like to take a lot of pictures wit their phone it could be an issue for you.

When you try to open a new text it takes around 5-10 seconds.Something else that bothers me is how it randomly turns on or off.

You don't even have to be touching it and this will happen.The camera is decent not that great though.The battery sign is weird. It changes to different bars so you don't really know.

There are so many little things that bug me about this phone. For instance, if you are in an area with little to no reception, a box will constantly appear and disappear on screen saying that you are entering or leaving service area. This is very annoying, because when it does this, I can't do anything while it is on the screen.The camera isn't great either. It does okay in well lit areas, but if there is not enough light, the pictures are very grainy and poor quality. Also, it is not possible to take videos, which doesn't make too much sense to me.The phone in itself is lightweight, and the blue is nice, but the blue color chips off very easily if dropped. There is a headphone jack, but it is very small, and I have no idea what kind of headphones plug into it. Also, charging is easy, and you can plug in the USB to your computer. But installing any drivers is a big pain. I still have yet to figure out how to do so.There is also a built in like MP3 player. So when you plug it into your computer you can easily transfer songs. The thing I do not like is that I can't set any of the songs to a ringtone. I have to create my own and send it to my phone. But when I do it this way, the audio quality drops, and it sounds horrible.I would not recommend this phone to anyone. Maybe a 12-13 year old might enjoy it.

No data. My contract is up in July and I'm sooooo excited about getting a different phone then!  Only seven more months!  Yippee!I havent experienced any problems with the screen, the phone holding a charge, heating up, or any of those other things.  My issues are purely functional.First, there's a big \"lag time\" between pressing certain keys and the phone's reponse.  Mainly the multi-purpose keys you press for choosing Contacts, or Options, or Message, etc.  They are two keys at the top of the keypad, one on the left, one on the right.  Major pain.  It can sometimes take a full two seconds for the phone to execute the command.  For example, when I press that key to unlock the keypad, it takes so long to unlock the keypad that I push the key again, still nothing, so I press again, thinking I'm not hitting the key square on or something.  Then, all of a sudden, the phone finally \"catches up\" all my keystrokes, and it instantaneously unlocks the keypad, looks at the text message waiting, and erases it!  No kidding!  I cannot tell you how many hundreds of text messages I have to ask people to resend because of this.  Same thing pressing that key for the contact list.  I think I'm not hitting the key right, then suddenly I'm entering a new contact instead of just looking at the list.  Pain!And you HAVE to lock the keypad, otherwise the thing will pocket dial like mad!  People start to hate you!Also, and this is asolutely the dumbest thing ever -- if you want to use your phone's alarm tool -- hah, definitely do NOT buy this phone.  Get this, if you like to set your ring tone to vibrate while you sleep because -- I know this is crazy, you don't want to get wakened by texts all night long -- your alarm will NOT ring!  That's right, your ALARM will also only vibrate,  no matter what ring tone you have selected for the alarm!  So, if you want an audible alarm in the morning, you MUST be willing to listen to your phone chirp, burp and buzz all night long.  I know, RETARDED!The T9 feature is absolutely schizoid. Changing things to nonsense.  For example, every time I end a sentence with the word \"up,\" it changes \"up.\" to \"u7.\"  Really?  Because that's such a common word, u7.  And if I want to end a sentence \"wk.\" it changes it to \"95%\" EVERY TIME.  And there are other crazy things like that that make texting a real pain.  I know, I could use the full keyboard, but I cut my teeth on the little keypad, so that's what I prefer.  But MANY times I am FORCED to use the full keyboard or just shoot myself.  Those are the only two options.Those sound like really little things, when basically the phone does make calls, holds a charge, the camera is decent, but I'm telling you, those few things I mentioned are going to make your daily life just a little bit hellish when you're tyring to use this phone.You have been warned.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good and Bad", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1T6V2DFQU8MTN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought two phones.

I was a little skeptical because it didn't have great reviews. However my only other choice was the Cosmos-which had horrible reviews. Alot of the Intensity II reviews were for what it is NOT-and guess what? It's NOT a video phone, it's Not a smart phone and it's NOT a touchscreen phone.  It is what it is: a simple texting phone that is a cool color (LOVE the blue) that takes decent pictures and is pretty consistent with calls. It is quirky-but every phone has it's quirks. I'm on my second phone because my first phone overheated-BIG quirk-I was walking across a room and suddenly had a hot pocket. But Verizon replaced phone and battery immediately-no hassle. Most of the quirks people complain about are because they haven't figured out their settings. You CAN disable the auto-lock, you CAN keep it from pocket dialing, you CAN get it to auto-delete old texts and you CAN get it to arrange your texts in a chronological order (not in the sender order mine was defaulted to.)Some cons: limited ringtones-they're kinda tween-ish.)Somewhat short battery life for a basic phone-but it does re-charge really fast. The alarm stopped working-but I just use the calendar alert. Occasionally it drops off the network and I stop receiving texts and calls-I just pull the battery and it's fine.
