{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My mother, who is afraid of OSX, loves this phone.", "Author": "Michael Finn", "ReviewID": "R26OMJSLUWZ87A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mother recently got this phone from Verizon and had me set it up for her.  I was prepared for the standard/hellish setup of a new phone.I was wrong.It took a total of five minutes to have her 300+ contacts transferred from her old phone to this new one.  I was moderately impressed with this, mainly because it saved me 30 minutes of looking for a transfer program on the internet.She fell in love with this phone at the Verizon store because it was the first phone that \"I could use.\"  She has tried the other smart phones and just couldn't get a handle on the icons of iOS and the widgets of Android.  It made no sense to her because she wasn't used to thinking of programs->People but rather People->Programs.  It makes total sense to her that a little \"tile\" updates her on what her friends are doing rather than what some programs are doing to her phone and I am starting to agree with her.  The construction alone makes my iPhone 5 weep.  They put a rubberized case on the outside so that she didn't have to spend $20.The online LTE speed is very impressive, it's fast enough to render web pages that are standard HTML with heavy graphics in less than a second or \"Farmville is really fast!.\"  I don't know what that means but I am taking it as a positive.The interface of Windows Phone 8, which I have alluded to in previous paragraphs, really deserves a Nobel prize in peace for the pain relief that it is giving to her eyes.  You see, she doesn't have to squint to see the tiny text on a screen a foot away from her eye because Windows Phone 8 makes the text bigger rather than just doing word-wrap on a window. My jaw dropped at that one; a phone interface that just doesn't punish organics for having inferior eyes to their robotic superiors.Storage is scarce at 16GB, you won't be doing any vacation video/heavy gaming with this thing.  Camera is excellent without any glaring faults or positives worth mentioning.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beauty in Simplicity", "Author": "ApexPredation", "ReviewID": "REQID17WKK95J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a new device that is packed with functionality and wrapped in style then the HTC 8X is for you. I have been using the 8X for about a month now and I am in love with it. The designers have really out done themselves with this one. I can easily describe the outer style with one word, Smooth. There is not a sharp spot anywhere on this thing, instead, HTC decided to turn every corner into a curve. A great decision I must say. it is comfortable to hold, practically disappears in your pocket, and it is pleasing to the eyes, Especially with all the brilliant color choices. The screen is crisp and full of rich colors and responds to your touch without any delays. The sound quality is very surprising. Not only does it have Beats audio integrated in it but the headphone port and loud speaker are amplified! This doesn't mean that its just louder but also cleaner sound. The 8X can easily replace you current MP3 player. The camera, although lacking stock extras like Panorama and HDR which come on other HTC devices, is very capable of capturing those precious moments. The front camera goes where others cannot, with a 88 degree wide angle lens you can get the whole group in the shot along with a highlight of where you are.Being a Windows Phone, it is all about productivity. The customizable live tiles on the home screen are great, you can get so much information with just one quick glance. The integrated office apps and SkyDrive access makes keeping on top of things, both work and personal, a breeze. And although there are not as many apps as other OS markets, there are many high quality and very useful ones that will leave you feeling, 'why do I need so many apps anyway I have everything I need here.' Plus like any app market, it is growing fast.My only gripe would be there is no SD slot to extend your storage capacity. Considering all the free cloud storage you can get, its not a huge deal breaker.In all I think the 8X is a beautiful and highly functional device that can meet, if not exceed, the demands of your mobile needs.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone ... but Verizon cripples it", "Author": "Tim Stone", "ReviewID": "R1HZ3OG7PXQDU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this phone directly from Verizon.  I am proficient with Windows Phone, and loved this model.  Sadly it went back because Verizon disabled the Text grouping feature ( MMS ).  For interactive text, this is a killer bad decision.Someone posted a negative about syncing with Outlook.  To be honest, Microsoft has not supported syncing for many years.  Instead the cloud service ( much of it free ) makes it possible to access your data instantly from a variety of devices.  For email exchange, it can be available for $4 / month.  The fact that what I do on my phone appears on my computer, etc. is well worth that minor service charge.The phone is easy to use, and I love all the app integration.  The camera takes great pictures, and of course they are easy to post to friends and media.  Its very light, and easy to handle.  The call quality was excellent.If Verizon fixes the text grouping issue ( ATT has it and the earlier Verizon Win Phone had it, as does almost every other smartphone ), then I will get this phone right back.  Right now its available on Amazon for half the price, but it will give double the performance of most other phones !", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, fast, and capable hardware. Completely unique Windows Phone software", "Author": "Kevan Mann", "ReviewID": "RPX4JT05E8DLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is simply fantastic. Being an Android user of 2 years and an iPhone user of only one year, I was eager to switch to something that was different from the rest of the pack. No more static small icons on a boring sliding background. I was ready for the uniqueness of Windows Phone 8 that was unlike literally anything out there.In short, I love the phone. WP8 is such an immense joy to use. It's hard to put into words, but I encourage everyone to at lease try it out. It has everything I needed and used on my Android smartphone, so there is hardly a learning curve.The hardware is fantastic too. The blue color constantly stands out from the sea of other grey and black smartphones out there. People constantly ask me about it! It is really well made and feels awesome to hold.In short, if you have even a remote interest in Windows Phone, I encourage anyone and everyone to try the phone out for themselves in stores. I guarantee you'll love it!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT! Happy to have switched from Android, But it ain't perfect yet...", "Author": "Alaina T", "ReviewID": "R1Y052ZCONG0JX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a ton of online research before trading in my three year relationship with my old Android phone (HTC Droid Incredible) for the HTC 8X. I went into the switch with an open mind and the acceptance that there would be some limitations to get use to. But I was just ready for something new!So I have had the phone for two months and so far I absolutely love it! All Windows Phones basically have the same user experience because Microsoft doesn't allow manufacturers or carriers to skin the OS.  So here, firstly, are my pros and cons specific to the 8X.PROSVery lightweight as compared to other top end Windows phones. Very thin profile.Fun colour options for casing. It's an eye catcher.Solid camera with a great range of fun apps: filters, lomo, panorama, editing.Dedicated shutter button.Only fits halfway in my front pants pocket, but the rubberized coating on the back keeps it from slipping out.The default automated backlighting setting is surprisingly accurate. I haven't yet had to go in an manually change it once.CONSThose external buttons are too flush with the casing so they're hard to find just by feel.Tinny sounding speaker phoneAfter two months of daily use, the rubbery coating has started to wear away on the bottom corners. After a year will there be any coating left??Now, here is my review of the Windows Phone 8 experience, which is basically the same for all WP8 devices.I found the switch to the Windows Phone 8 OS was super easy. WP8 is incredibly intuitive. I was prepared to confront a steep learning curve but I found I acclimated far quicker than I had with my first android phone. All the most commonly used smartphone apps are integrated into the operating system and they talk to each other in a way that Android apps, created by myriad different developers, do not. TO use an SAT motif...WP8 is to Android as Facebook is to MySpace. Android, like MySpace, offers maybe too much freedom of customization for the average user, which can lead to a mess of cluttered home screens and buggy widgets and third-party apps that don't talk to each other. However WP8, like Facebook, gives you a clean, simplified interface, with limited customizations that everyone can use. This of course also contrasts with iPhone which offers no customization what-so-ever.I LOVE the live tiles! I can basically see what's going on with all of my various communication accounts in one glance: phone calls, SMS, Gmail, Yahoo mail, Whatsapp, Skype, Twitter, Facebook and Gchat. Kind of similar to the pull-down notification tray on Android...but so, so, so much better! First thing in the morning, I'd actually rather check all my accounts on my phone in just one look and a couple taps than boot up my laptop and open all the applications/web pages separately. Super intuitive!I LOVE the built in address book which links all of my contact accounts to consolidate the info for each person. From any single contact page I can call them, text them, email them at multiple addresses, message them on Facebook, mention them on twitter, see all our recent interactions, and see any of their recent status updates and photos. Without having to enter all that information manually into the phone. This is what I mean when I say the apps are well integrated!I LOVE the design aesthetic of the user interface, which carries over to all the different Microsoft apps. It's clean, minimalist and a little iconic. Whatever colour and background I set for the live tiles, is used within all the apps as well. Makes the user experience feel much more unified.I LOVE the Bing search built in features - local news, suggested activities based on recent searches, local deals based on recent searches, and movies based on your location. The movies feature in particular makes me happy. It aggregates everything you would want to know in one place - all current moves, locations and times near you (uses GPS), synopsis and info, user reviews, and ticket apps like fandango. This is a good example of what I mean when I say the UX is intuitive!I DON'T LOVE the Bing Maps app. It's a solid app, but after many years of using Google Maps, it just doesn't measure up. It really annoys me that it doesn't include public transportation directions, only walking and driving. I live in a major metropolitan city and public trans is a big deal. Also it doesn't do a great job of guessing what I'm searching for if it doesn't immediately recognize the address I enter. And NO turn by turn navigation! I'm sure Bing Maps will get there eventually, it's just not there yet, and if you rely on you phone for directions frequently this could be a problem.I DON'T LOVE the app drawer. It's one loooong column so you have to scroll forever to find what you're looking for. What's wrong with a grid like iOS and Android have? If it ain't wrong don't fix it.I DON'T LOVE the limited app market. I'd be very careful to check if all your favorite apps are available on WP8 before you make a switch! Microsoft has actually been pretty good about communicating upcoming app developments to their users. They announced a forthcoming Pandora app in December for launch in spring 2013 and we just got it...right on time! But, it's a bummer knowing that every time a hot new app is rumored, it probably won't be available for windows phones. At least not for a while. This is of course a growing-pains issue that will get better as WP becomes more popular which I really think it will!", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yet another awesome HTc", "Author": "Mugetsu", "ReviewID": "R3T47GZLEIR426", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great all around phone. I was kinda worried about coming from an android phone, but the ability to have most of the android capibilities on a Windows phone. i had all my music and email accounts from my android phone and could find most apps for the 8x as I did on my android phone.

In fact this is the first review I have ever written.  To start off this phone was amazing and at first I did not regret not buying the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Looking back I probably should have since they never failed me.  This phone worked great for about 4 1/2 months and then the problems started. The volume button wouldn't work certain apps would suddenly stop working. I turned it off and that seemed to help until one day it started turning on and off continuously for about 6 hours before the battery finally ran out and it turned off.  Then it would not turn back on.  I received a replacement phone have had it for 6 days and the screen froze the image pixilated so bad you could not tell what the image was. The phone got hot and then it turned off.  Will not turn back on and it won't even charge back up now that the battery is dead.Overall the phone has a lot of potential and it did help me since I was able to work on things using office.

I practically shout it from the roof tops. I've tested about 10 different HTC Android phones and they simply get better and better.  So when I `accidentally' won an HTC Windows 8X phone and was asked to test it out, give it a whirl... I sort of pouted.BUT THEN I'll have to learn a new operating system? I'll have to figure out all the bells and whistles of a whole different PHONE, not just upgrades and cool new features of a system I already know and love, right?SURPRISE! I cheated.I made my 15 year old daughter test out the phone instead!She was MORE than happy to oblige. And I'm kinda jealous, cuz within 24 hours she was up and running and had the WHOLE thing figured out. (Dang, I'm old. Shut up.)She came up with a list of Pros and Cons to be all Legit about this `Teen Review'!First the LIKEs:  1.  I love the physical, exterior look of the phone, it's sleek and smooth and BLUE! How cool is that? My friends were all: is that the new Windows Phone? LUCKY!!  2.  The phone is recognizable and the whole Windows tile thing is sexy!  3.  It's fast. Like, the websites load crazy fast, love that.  4.  The CAMERA!! Wide angle and great quality shots!  5.  The Beats audio... rocks of course!  6.  I like how the photo gallery is set up. The `Live Tile'--browse, save and `what's new' in the Facebook Album is totally awesome.  7.  Um, it holds up even when I drop it. (Shh don't tell my mom!!)  8.  Apps that are available make me happy: Angry Birds and Temple Run of course!Now the Don't LIKEs:  1.  The side button for the camera is cool, but I hit it in my pocket and it takes pictures without having to unlock it first. Tons of pocket photos on my phone now!  2.  Popular apps aren't available for the Windows OS, like Instagram, Pinterest and Pandora. There are third party apps that make it almost accessible to run Instagram and Pinterest, but it's really not the same. (NO PANDORA? Mom says.. DEAL BREAKER for her.. Pandora is a MUST!!)  3.  Because apps are different it was hard to navigate the different versions at first. \"Facebook is Strange\" -direct quote. But still usable. Just had to learn it.  4.  The sound settings are odd, normally when you press the sound down button it will adjust to vibrate or zero sound. But on this phone I have to click 3-4 steps in the settings to change it to vibrate only. And as a teen, this is a real must since phones are not allowed in school etc!  5.  And the worst of all, text messages cannot be set to `vibrate only' as a notification setting! So annoying.Notice she never mentioned a word about how the actual PHONE works as a PHONE?Yeah that's because she never uses the phone as a phone!  And seriously no Pandora?  What would I do?  Is there another music streaming app that can match Pandora for Windows, cuz I would die without it!Overall, my teenage daughter LOVES the Windows 8X phone, I think if I tried to take it back from her I'd have a Russian Revolution level teen revolt on my hands!Please note, I won this Windows phone direct from HTC, but my thoughts (and my daughter's) are our own.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, Looks great", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R1532BV27TJV98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love how thin and sleek this phone is.

You're pretty much forced to use VZ nav which is complete garbage, AFAICT no way to zoom out and look at the route map! Your only option is to follow directions blindly based on the 50 yards of map the screen shows as you go along! Hope you're trusting.Also the detour functions are pretty useless. No real easy way to avoid a bridge for example. Try driving into nyc NOT via the GWB, impossible thru this app! you must memorize the route you need till the phone reroutes you. And why can't I just set what route I would like to take before leaving?Hmm guess I'll sprinkle in some.....LIKES!-Skydrive, so handy and versatile you can upload full length HD movies to watch on your phone. Never lose phone data again. So cool!-Sleek design, it's nice to call and text on. I've dropped it several times (once even denting it), can't say it affected the phone noticeably.-I love the \"tabs\" function. Holding the back button allows you to view \"history\" tabs, handy when multitasking.-The copy and paste function is nice too. Although sometimes it's tricky using the touch screen to pick what you want to copy.-There are some nice ebook apps that let you sync right from skydrive.Dislikes(yes I know I already mentioned the GPS, should have been more organized)-Camera is not very good. It often won't focus correctly when photographing something close up. Ex: trying to take a picture of the texture of a flower is about impossible. Granted, it's not the worst camera ever just lackluster.-Some of the apps aren't very good from the windows store or are missing. Don't expect to get all the popular iphone apps. Although there will usually be some generic replacements.-If you don't have strong interrupted service or Wi-Fi this phone really struggles. For whatever reason the phone can't bring in a signal (3g is not enough) like my older two droids did. This is frustrating because I live where service can be spotty. I've failed to send text messages where my 4 yr old droid previously could.-The \"in call\" speaker is not loud enough!!!!! so frustrating not being able to hear people on the phone. Just let me turn it up till my ears bleed!! Sometimes the only way to hear someone is to put it on it speaker (not that loud either). I'm a young guy and I have good hearing and I almost always have to make sure I'm in a quiet place to make a call.OVERALLNot a bad phone it has it's strengths and weaknesses.

I already have a small crack across one corner of mine.-Physical buttons, specifically the power button, are hard to push.

Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review.

Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year.

I went into the Verizon store with a open mind, but was leaning towards a Samsung Galaxy III (another Android OS 'boring')going in, but know I wanted a change for something just didn't know what! The salesperson showed me the Galaxy and a few other Android phones, which I wasn't feelin, but then he walked me over the Windows phone section and handed me this phone. The moment I held the phone I didn't want to put it down. The design was so sleek, it reminded me of a miniature tablet and it had Beats Audio (I'm a sucker for ish IPhone don't have lol). In my opinion this phone is the best design and looking phone out today!!! I'm still wasn't 100% sold though the Windows OS is completely new to me, however we all have seen the commercials with the live tiles, which I think is cool, but as a gadget guy I needed more!! It wasn't until I was walking around the store with the phone looking at accessories when I accidently placed it on a wireless charging pad and it automatically started charging (wow was totally not expecting that). Needless to say I was sold!!! I immediately brought the phone and the charging pad (the salesman didn't know it did that straight out the box).After having the phone for about a month now I noticed: (1) I love the simplicity of the Windows OS and live tiles, (2)I love the way it syncs your contacts and your social networks, (3) the camera is awesome, (4) I DON'T LIKE the music player and how it skips and only plays one song when I'm connected using Bluetooth, on some device, (why only 4 stars), (5) of course it needs more of the apps I use like amazon player, big oven and some mobile banking apps", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone...", "Author": "diana woodard", "ReviewID": "R1L2RK5QS53IM5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is the tiny font on the daily version of the calendar.

The screen has a higher PPI then the iphone 5, and you can see the difference when looking at them side by side. The Gorilla glass provides welcomed protection and added durability to the vibrant touch screen.The HTC design team clearly thought the phone through and aimed to make it a cut above the rest in an increasingly crowded market. The color accents give it that extra personal and unique look.The audio is above average. No static, and voices are crystal clear. The speakerphone is plenty loud. Call quality and reception was at the top of it's class and I did not suffer any dropouts. It does not support wifi calling yet, though that is a minor nuisance.The operating system is where this phone really shines above the others. The iphone's iOS has become stale and boring. Little has changed in the years since it's inception and is frequently playing catchup to android os and now windows phone os. The windows phone takes the phone os to the next level. Instead of boring rows of icons, it uses live tiles that provide instant information and you can launch the app directly from it.WP8 is also a master of pulling information. The people hub links with facebook, twitter, my Exchange and LinkedIn accounts and feeds updates from my contacts together. It does not matter where the updates are coming from, information is presented cleanly and uniformly for each of my contacts. How simple; how revolutionary.When you post an update it sends it to all your services. Something neither iOS or android currently do natively. You must download a 3rd party app to do it with them.As far as applications, most every application that I used on Android and iOS are present on WP8 or at least an equivalent that works the same, or in some cases better.This is a phone that needs to be seen in-person to appreciate the full experience. The operating system is fresh and unlike anything you have used before and is a pleasant relief from the antiquated iPhone and Android OS's. This phone sets the bar with innovation and people are pleasantly surprised when I put it in their hand. This is definitely a phone you need to have on your list to checkout when you pickup your next smartphone.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely amazing!", "Author": "Kai B", "ReviewID": "R2LO80KLB9KT7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is one of its kind!

I am a tech savvy person and understood in my switch to a windows phone that I would be giving up a lot of the apps and conveniences of the android market, however, I was not prepared for the absolute lack of functionality of the windows phone. Only sinks every other contact, terrible terrible terrible app market, won't work with zune(or the new xbox music) that is supposed to be such a selling point. The black lit screen with bright neon colors was constantly giving me a headache, even after I changed the colors of the tiles. It was impossible to scroll quickly to find the app you're looking for on the home screen because, although each app has an individual logo, most of the tiles are still the same color with a white logo, they all blend together and I found myself scrolling back and forth multiple times to find what I was looking for. I think the ideas and concepts here are innovative and smart, but unless you have a windows 8 laptop and tablet, they won't sync together.

Forget USB!  Unless you have a Microsoft Exchange Server you will be unableto sync your spiffy new phone to Legacy versions of Outlook (Outlook 2003,2007,2010) .  Microsoft willgladly sell you a service (cloud based Microsoft Exchange Server) for $6.00 per month and $5.00per device for automatic syncing. You will need Office 360 also.  Of course to do this, you will have tobuy and maintain a Domain name. But really, who wants to trust Microsoft with their personal data???Well after many frustrating hours of work (about 12 hours over two days), reading MS propaganda,trying their \"solutions\" and searching independent Blogs,I returned the HTC 8x Windows phone to Verizon and paid the $35 restocking fee.I picked up a Samsung Galaxy S3, two hours later Outlook 2010 was synced and workingwith the Android based phone, with 10X the functionality of any Microsoft mobile implementation of Outlook!This winning combination uses DejaOffice CRM app for Android (free), and CompanionLink on your PC.The CompanionLink for your PC is a $49 dollar program, but it is worth every penny!  They havea Free 14 day trial  [see CompanionLink Software review on Amazon.com for hotlinks].Syncing is performed through USB, so it is secure (no cloud needed)DejaOffice.Hint: Go to Samsung website, and download and install the USB drivers for the Galaxy S3before installing CompanionLink.Bottom line, Microsoft put together a great little phone. If you want a fun phone, iteven has a kids corner, then you are set.  If this is for business you need to have an IS department todo the grunt work for supporting MS Office Outlook, it will work great.However, if you are a home / small business user, you need significant technical resources,and must be willing to pay monthly fees to Microsoft to make this phone work with Outlook.Of course, you must also trust them with your data...If this sounds scary and just wrong then walk away from this device.Go with the Samsung Galaxy S3...
