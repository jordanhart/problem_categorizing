Since that first incident it happened a few times after but has started to increase in frequency now that I am 2 weeks in with this phone. I suspect it won't last as long as 4 months. Also, there was a very small gap left at the top when the screen was fitted.When the screen works it looks really nice but then every now and again it scrambles and I have to press the lock button then unlock it and it returns to normal.
