{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's an Xperia ZL and it's Red.", "Author": "Kevin Calendris \"AKA Tofu\"", "ReviewID": "R1QWA81KC0K8KN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, poor quality control", "Author": "Ike Mcfadden \"Ike Mcfadden\"", "ReviewID": "R3JPW5AU7LZA1F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology.  Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say \"died\", please allow me to be more specific.  I'm fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble.  Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone's touch-screen stopped responding to input.  So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead.  I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) \"Repair\" option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked.  The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony's warranty department.  And unfortunately, since I'm in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I'm basically out of luck.  No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony's entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several \"instant death\" problems.  Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon.  Just dig around google a bit; you'll see.So...if you'd like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Colts187 \"Drew\"", "ReviewID": "RLQ0MU0QK3YK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ultimately returned the phone to get something cheaper but this phone is every bit as good as a gs4 or htc one.

Thank goodness it was within the return window, because looking through the reviews here it seems that I definitely didn't want to have to deal with Sony customer service.What I do worry about? I couldn't delete all my private info off the phone because, as I mentioned, it stopped working. Argh.As for the phone before its unexpected and early demise? It was fine. I liked the Walkman sound. I liked the quality manufacturing feel. It was, however, too heavy. I first started regretting my purchase when I was out with a friend and we decided to view movie previews. My phone would not play the video without stopping to load. Her iphone, sitting right next to me, played the movie without hesitation. I thought it was likely the Family Mobile network (I think she was using Verizon), and it might have been, but after a month of using the phone I think it was probably also the phone itself. Other reviews have commented that it isn't good for watching video.I ended up buying a Moto X. I also found out about Republic Wireless, so I'll be saving money on my monthly bill too (note that you can't use an unlocked GSM phone purchased here on Amazon with that network - it's CDMA and the phones they sell are modified for their service). The Moto X cost me $100 less than the Xperia ZL, and it totally blows the Xperia out of the water as far as I'm concerned. It's lightweight and lightening fast with all sorts of amazing features (my favorite: you can talk to the phone without unlocking it and it will do what you say, so you don't need to have it in your hands to make a call or listen to music or whatever). I'm actually GLAD my Xperia died so I had the opportunity to buy a phone that I love.

When you plug it back in the wall charger it work and showing 100 % battery.So the 100 % battery cannot operate the Xperia ZL alone ??? something not adding up !!! I have done everything the support forum suggested only to come to the conclusion that their is a fault in the power circuit. sony has kept quiet on this.

I've had the C6502 version before with the alledged installed pressure sensor (as per SONY's own white papers!!) it wasn't, though. SONY, in the meantime took it out of the white papers.The one this review refers to, however, is the C6506, which is the one with LTE instead of the pressure sensor. It is really a great phone hardwarewise. SONY have the \"companion\" software in place which helps you to stay up to date with your phone along with some other services. The transfer software  didn't work, so I started installing from scratch which I didn't expect. But then again, this is software which you wouldn't need all the time anyway and therefore shouldn't diminish the value of this great hardware.This phone is one of the few smartphones that has the T-Mobile 3G AWS (1700) band on board. It truly is a phone that you can use with most of its features worldwide!If I have anything that could be improved then it is the phone reception. My HTC Incredible S which I had before, has better reception. About everything else onboard my new SONY Xperia ZL (C6506) is so much better, and it still has a valuable SD card slot on board, which the NEXUS does not have -a political Google decision as they want you to use their online storage.I highly recommend this smartphone.

It has a dull anodized aluminum look and the shade of red is just right. The phone looks great and I am glad I didn't go for the tepid white or the faceless but neutral black (black even costs a lot more on amazon, for some reason).It updated as soon as I got it to 4.1.2 with some fixes and late June, another update took it to 4.2.2. The phone has radio capable of HSPA+ and LTE on almost all network operators in the USA, at least. The battery life is average for the phone on usage; the standby life is pretty good. The screen is gorgeous. The Sony customization is minimal and I like the themes it ships with. It has nice walkman, album and video ( and reader) apps. Call and sound Q are good. You can receive calls without unlocking.The phone is worth the money. I had considered HTC one (google play) edition for its hardware/build quality but it does not have 1700 Mhz support for HSPA.
