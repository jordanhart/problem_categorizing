I was skeptical about buying this device as it was not the real item. However I received it in about 14 days, so shipping was fast. After receiving I had a question and seller gave a quick  helpful answer. The phone is an exact 1:1 copy, the gold color gives the phone a sleek modern real look. The user interface is just like the ios7. The only drawback is that apps for App Store are not in English, however if you touch the search icon and type in the names of the app, it will show the English version of the app. Some pre-installed apps are in Chinese. This has 16gb of storage as well. Over all very satisfied. It was also purchased for my 13yr old who loves it. Any iPhone 5s case will fit this item.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android OS smartphone(Special UI)\nGolden color\nSupport GSM(2G): 850/900/1800/1900MHz, WCDMA(3G): 850/2100MHz\nSupport Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth.......\nUnlocked", "Name": "TeHi \u00ae Dual Core Smartphone Android 4.2 Single Standby with Wifi GPS 4.0 Inch Wvga Capacitive Touch Screen Cell Phone (Golden)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uEhtzuBvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GFSWZ5O"}}
