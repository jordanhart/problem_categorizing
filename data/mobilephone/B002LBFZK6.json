It is always reliable and there when I need it. The camera on the LG Vu is outstanding! It seems like it takes 6MP pictures but really it is 2MP. It has a simple user interface and easy to use for the average consumer. The call quality is good too. The only flaw I found really is texting, with a full touch screen QWERTY keyboard, it can be a little inaccurate sometimes. Overall 4/5 on this phone. Long battery life, great pictures, and this phone is meant to last!Michael.S - OhioAT&T; Wireless User", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone!!!!...horrible seller!!!!!!", "Author": "Thomas A Faro", "ReviewID": "R13YF2YZYMWQCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is really great. This was my first purchase online when it comes to buying a phone. This was also my first touch screen phone. The 4 Star rating goes to the phone. I've only had it a day, and it's performed very well, but the condition of all the other things that came with it weren't exactly \"new\". The OEM shop in NYC said that this phone was new. I knew that it was coming with a charger and all the other ammeneties (sorry for wrong spellings) that a phone comes with. When the phone was opened, someone in my house informed me that there were minor tiny scratches on the back and several finger prints. I saw these as well and didn't really care, but it made me think about if the phone was actually new. I started using the phone today, and the battery was obviously not charged well because it just wasn't because it's a new phone. I went to go charge it, and the charger didn't work at all. I thought maybe it was the plug, but when I tried a different plug, the charger still didn't work at all. I recommend contacting the seller about what kind of condition he/she thinks a phone is in when it's considered \"new\". I'm very disappointed with the seller, not the phone.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thought it was a nice phone...", "Author": "LJTPjr", "ReviewID": "RZAPEXM75YO05", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a gift for my mother during Christmas...She had some trouble with it so i master reset and the problems seemed to go away.

Reception is good, quality of voice is very good. The camera surprised me. It is 2.0; the picture quality is very good, but it has no flash. It has a solid tap screen. LG CU920 VU has the standard functions: email, messaging, camera, mp3, calculator, alarm, display, TV (will not work unless your carrier is AT&T;) and Cellular Video, with a few more features. Battery charge is low-it came with a generic battery. Maybe a LG battery would last longer. This is not an iphone, google phone, etc. But neither is it an \"ordinary, simple\" cell phone. It's easy and uncomplicated, and has the look and feel one would like their newer, low cost cell phone to have. I purchased this phone for $79.95. It's basically, an \"AT&T; prepaid phone.\" It's not listed as such, but that's what it seems to be. The sellers OEM, were okay. I received the phone one day before its expected arrival date. The box, the phone, and all required accessories were also new and packing unopened. My carrier is T-Mobile, and this is an AT&T; phone. Configurations need to be changed to allow this phone to work with T-Mobile. I searched the web for assistance in changing these configurations, and found the info I needed. I still have one issue with email.

I got the phone and right away the \"t.v\" didnt work but i didnt care i just wanted the phone so i didnt make a big deal about it, about a month after i was using the phone it started acting weird turning on and off by itself not letting me click on the items i wanted to click on but i didnt pay to much attention to it since my 30 day refund or exchange had already expired. Well two weeks after all of that started happening the phones battery wouldnt charge and if it did it would die super fast and i had to recharge it again and again throughout the day! then after three days of that crap the phone completely gave out on me, said it was dying and when i would hook it up to the charger it said it was charging but kept making that noise to tell me it was dying over and over again while connected to the charger but had the charging icon on the screen like the charger was connected! so then i just left it connected to the charger the whole day and when finally stopped making those noises it said it was charged so i disconnected it from the charger and two minutes later the stupid noise comes back and my phone is dead again! i went on with this for about a week till i went to go get the phone checked out by at&t; they checked it out and it wasnt the charger, it wasnt the battery it was the stupid phone so i after leaving i got the phone and smashed the crap out of it! i will NEVER get another phone from here AGAIN!!!!
