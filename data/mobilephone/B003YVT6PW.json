It is the express music normal, with a car holder. \"He does not come with the car charger\" and the memory card is 4GB, whereas the Navigation edition is 8gb.The notice should contain all the information on the phone.The phone is good, but I was disappointed because I wanted to Navigation Edition, 8gb with charger and everything.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but misleading publication", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R1Q9GCW68W915F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Regarding the phone itself, it is excellent. Nothing to complain about it. I have been using it for about a month as phone, gps, photo/video camera and everything is ok. I found that the synchronization of contacts/calendar with my PC software (Lotus Notes in my case) was very easy and works perfectly. I guess this is also due to the software (pc suite/ovi suite), but anyway it was a great improvement over my previous phone (motorola).But regarding the publication, at the time I bought the phone it was misleading. It said that the package included all the necessary accessories--charger, holder, suction mount--for vehicle use, the holder and the suction mount were included, but the charger was missing. Also, no US maps preloaded on the phone.The box containig the product mentioned that the package included a DVD (with Ovi suite), but this DVD was also missing. Ok, the software can be downloaded from nokia, but it is strange to receive a box that mentions that inside the box are a series of items, and then one of them is missing.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Form - Classic with full touch user interface\nDisplay - 3.2 size, resolution 640x360 pixels (nHD)\nAspect ratio 16 - 9\nAutomatic orientation sensor (Accelerometer) for display rotation\nStylus, plectrum and finger touch support for text input and user interface control (alphanumeric keypad, full and mini qwerty keyboard, handwriting recognition, full screen handwriting for Chinese language)", "Name": "Nokia 5800 Navigation Quad-band Cell Phone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2jjwddWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003YVT6PW"}}
