{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT Basic Phone!", "Author": "jbking", "ReviewID": "R25CBF0KTPZXC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Disclaimer: I did NOT buy this phone on Amazon.  I purchased it with a Verizon contract.  The purpose of this review is to support only the quality of the product.)I have had my Samsung Intensity for 2+yrs.  I am 100% completely satisfied with this phone!  It's the perfect phone for those like me who are only interested in using their phone for calling and texting.  I like having a QWERTY keyboard even better than the few times I've tried to use my husband's smart phone's digitally displayed keyboard.  It might be hard for someone with big fingers but I think the buttons are normal size for QWERTY boards.I recently tried to help my mom get set up with her first cellphone and got a headache trying to find my way through the menus and features (and hers is a pretty basic refurbished flip phone with only a few more features than mine).  After I got done helping her I was glad to go back to mine!No headache with the Samsung Intensity!  I still remember easily navigating through it to get everything set up the way I liked and all the features are easy to manipulate.  It's probably easier because it doesn't have so many \"bells and whistles\", just the right amount of tools for what you need without all the extra stuff.This is a great phone!  I've dropped it maybe a handful of times in the 2+yrs that I've had it.  Nothing has broken yet and I've had no issues with any of the functions as other reviews mention . . . maybe they just got a bad one out of a bunch.  That could happen with any phone.  As far as I can tell the battery is lasting just as long as it did when I first got it.  I don't spend hours talking on my phone so I usually charge it every 3-4 days.  Even if I were to spend more time talking and texting (as has happened infrequently) I think I would only have to charge it every other day.It makes me sad that others have not had a good experience with this phone 'cause as far as I'm concerned I'm gonna be REALLY sad some day when I have to give it up and switch to another one!", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "hater but changed", "Author": "darrell", "ReviewID": "R2I8T7Z8KFAIFH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone and originally hated it because I had a battery problem and it wouldn't charge and so I was without a phone.

I have used it for a while and it has worked wonderfully. I do not want to pay the $30 a month but I really needed a phone to text easily and this was great. I love the keyboard.

You can text in class easier with a smaller phone, not saying I do that ;) I always have signal, the phone is easy to use, and it has cool basic features like calculator, calendar, alarm, etc. In the end, I think anyone would be happy to spend 2 years with a great phone like this and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't connect calls!", "Author": "Daniel T Adams", "ReviewID": "R1Z8D1W5U2HBKM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had my original phone (on a replacement now) for 3 months and from nearly the beginning I had issues with making calls. I'd go to a contact and press send. The timer would begin counting as though the call connected and you would expect the ringing to begin. My phone wouldn't ring once the timer started yet it rang on the receiving end and my recipient would answer and hear me, but I couldn't tell they were there because my phone never rang in the earpiece. I learned to watch the timer and if it didn't begin ringing I'd hang up and call again. Luckily I mainly call family but it was annoying because it would ring for them and then I'd hang up and try again and  they would get a missed call. I had my phone replaced recently. I have had my phone replaced with a certified like new one for less than a week and the issues have begun again.

I didn't want to pay for the data plans or be tied to that type of access to the internet at all times.  This phone is GREAT for my needs. The buttons are intuitive and easy manipulate.  My only complaint is that it is NOT easy to lock the phone....you have to go through many screens to activate the security lock EACH time. There is no shortcut button for the lock, and that drives me bonkers.

It has a really long lag time between pressing a button and getting a response.  It is always showing these wierd ads.  But most of all, the keyboard is terrible.  Even when I first got it, you had to 'mash' the 'y' button to get it to work.  now, only about 7 months in, about half the keys require you to mash buttons, so texting takes about 4 times longer than it should to correct all the errors made by dropping key strokes.I had wanted a simple phone that I wouldn't need a data plan for, but this phone made me want to pay the extra 30 bucks a month to use a phone i didn't want to throw across the room and stomp upon.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good practical phone.", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1WWKNWVVCZV3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice compact, simple phone that's great for texting.
