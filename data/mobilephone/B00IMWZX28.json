The phone has internal issues which i feel if was fixed they would have a winner. The phone is slow as crap, it freezes up, the speaker and phone volume is super low, and the camera is too zoomed in using the front view option. And not just the front view the whole camera in general is terrible..and i love taking pictures so that sucks for me. I gave three 3 because I have only had the phone for 4 days and already was experiencing these issues on the 1st day. Using with straight talk the T-Mobile SIM only gives me Edge network so that's no fun. I wish it was better but I should've took heed when I saw a review wasn't done on this phone before i brought it. Really wish someone could fix it because it is a nice phone just with bad internal glitches.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IMWZX28"}}
