{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone, crappy camera", "Author": "Bandora Fox \"Bandora\"", "ReviewID": "R1QAXLL0FKUJEX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only been playing with this phone for a couple of hours so this is a preliminary review of first impressions and comparing it to my previous phone the LG Motion 4g.  While I really love my old phone, I needed a sturdier phone to survive my toddlers so my reason to select this model was due to its durability claims in resisting drops and water.This phone is larger than I am used to but not extremely so, it isn't much thicker or wider than my old LG, just taller.  It doesn't feel too heavy or bulky and still fits in my pocket. The textured back gives it a sporty look.So far the features are what I am used to expecting from Android, setup was a breeze as it quickly restored my settings, apps and everything from my Google account so all I needed to do was customize my wallpaper and icons to feel at home.  I was dissapointed to see that the menu setting to display the battery percentage that I always use on my Android phones is missing, not a big deal but inconvenient to have to download an app for that.Activation was the only challenging part as MetroPCS web activation and phone activation didn't work and I had to call MetroPCS customer service from another phone, I didn't have to hold for long and the rep was able to get me setup and running very quickly.My first impression when turning on the phone is that the screen has a blueish hue, mainly noticeable when looking at something with a white background.  The resolution and quality of graphics isn't impressive but it's adequate, the touchscreen material gives all images a grainy look which only annoys me when viewing photos or video.Call quality is decent, I find the sonic receiver technology weird as it makes the whole phone vibrate with sound at max volume, lowering the volume fixes this. The speakerphone was loud enough for my needs.  On board memory seems very limited so I ran into insufficient memory errors while updating apps during setup, I fixed this by moving apps to the SD card although this option isn't available for all apps.  For this reason I recommend getting a larger SD card so you can have room for apps, pictures, video and music.My biggest disappointment is the camera.  It is S-L-O-W! I have 2 toddlers that I am constantly taking pictures of and from the time I press the shutter until it actually takes the picture the moment is completely lost.  The auto focus feature also sucks when compared to my old phone.  Most indoor pictures taken on \"auto\" come out blurry and blueish, when trying to photograph kids I don't have the luxury of taking my time changing settings manually for each shot and this is the reason why I don't give this phone 5 stars.  I also wish that I could use the volume button as a shutter while in camera mode like with my old phone but that doesn't seem to be an option.  The camera performs better in outdoor daylight settings with great photos and faster shutter speed.  I still managed to take some nice park pictures with maximum zoom.So far battery life has been good and the Eco and MaxiMZR features help prolong that.  The antenna doesn't seem to be as good as my old LG phone, I get 1 less bar with this phone than I did with my old phone in different parts of my house.  I wonder if I sometimes don't have a signal when my phone is in my pocket as it seems to go from 0 to 1 bar when I pull it out to do something but so far I haven't missed any calls.The Wifi calling feature is really cool, but make sure you have E911 configured in your account or you will need to make a call to Metro PCS.The bottom line, this phone is a nice entry to mid level device.  It has room for improvement but it gets the job done.  If the camera is an important feature for you I would continue searching for another model.  If you have a history of dropping your phone or getting it wet (or in my case have 2 toddlers that love destruction) then this phone is a good option.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "volume issues", "Author": "Josie", "ReviewID": "R1CL3GJFQIRW9I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok first off got this phone came on time just one problem been having since i got the phone people that talk to me says it's hard to hear when i talk i have problems hearing them then when you turn up the volume it echoes and it's hard to hear", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "My review of the phone and Metro PCS", "Author": "T. Morrow", "ReviewID": "R7500AN5YRV18", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The smart sonic earpiece sounds awful, sounds like the bottom of a well with a bad rumble. The other thing I find irritating about it is part of the screen is wasted on the home keys which should be on the chin so it's not actually 4 inch screen.I didn't bought mine at a metro PCS store in the Dayton area that used to be a Cricket store which should have told me something right there. The only reason I bought this phone was because all their other phones were out of stock. Tried to buy another phone later from them because of the earpiece problem but none of the stores around here had any phones at all.The phone service itself is pretty good good coverage and clear call quality (only if you put this particular phone on speaker or bluetooth)mainly because they are on the T-mobile network. The 4G LTE works good but the website is doesn't work properly. It took countless attempts to set up the online account and customer support really blows although I did get some entertainment from listening to the indian guy butcher the English language with his accent.Here's my ratings of the different aspectsPhone 3 starsNetwork service 5 starsCustomer support minus 1 starStores 0 stars", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "The MODEL NUMBER OF THIS PHONE IS C6522N", "Author": "Perry Bruner \"SmoothlyOperating\"", "ReviewID": "R3QI5X4WACCZUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Model number of the MetroPCS and most other versions of this phone is \"C6522n\" and NOT just \"Kyocera Hydro XTRM\" as the Amazon.com ad would lead one to believe. If you ever need warranty service or any other help with this phone, you will need to know \"C6522N\" as the Model number, and NOT the one they have in the ad as the model NUMBER...being \"HydroXTRM\".. that is the NAME of the phone.. NOT the \"Model\" of the phone :-(I find myself often disappointed with incorrect or more commonly, INCOMPLETE information in ads here on merchandise specs.Everything else about Amazon.com is so perfect and this makes this CONSTANTLY REOCCURRING PROBLEM all the more surprising... You guys are poised to rule the world, especially with your excellent customer service... everything else about you is top notch.. which makes it rediculous how I ALWAYS find a very important piece of information almost always missing completey, or (more seldom) wrong, in the \"specs\" section of your ads . Get with it Amazon... WTF?How can you be so very lacking in just ONE dept when everything else about you is so exceptional that I refuse to shop anyplace else if I can find it on Amazon for the same price. Your only problem is your SEVERE lack of information being correct, or there at all, in the \"item description\" or \"Item specs\" section of your ads.I certainly DO LOVE THIS PHONE!

It turns on2.  It makes calls, eventually, but may take you an hour.3.  It actually receives most of the calls.  Keep in mind I said \"MOST\".  Not all, but most.Moving on.....List of dislikes/problems/issues/complaints1.  Sound quality on regular ear speaker is terrible, tinny, metallic, nasty sounding.  Seriously, it's terrible.2.  GPS location on this phone sometimes takes 30 minutes to find itself.  Useless for the most part.  Except for one time, it's never worked on its first attempt or under 2 minutes to find itself.  Terribly annoying while driving and using voice commands.3.  Voice commands in any situation is garbage.4.  Bluetooth is HIGHLY unstable.  Connects and disconnects for no reason within 3' of phone/headset.5.  HotSpot is even more highly unstable than bluetooth connection.  It seems picky about its location, some places it works great, others not at all, despite being in coverage area where old phone/tablet combos worked just fine.  It will come up with \"Authentication Problem\" and not work at all with 2 tablets, despite those having worked with old LG phone perfectly for hours on end in the exact same location.  Not exactly useful.6.  Trying to import contacts?  Best of luck to you.  Metro's backup didn't work.  VCF files didn't work.  It seemed to lose info on a couple of contacts, despite showing up when they call you, trying to find them in book, they don't show up.  The name might, but without their number being visible, which means you can't call them.  Had to download a VCF viewer to find all of my contacts bluetoothed from other phone, which still don't work properly and load them, but at least I could see them, remember their number, then dial it.7.  Web surfing is very picky, some sites, like AOL for mail now don't work, \"Too many redirects\".  Great, have to download another app for that.8.  Camera doesn't focus before you take a picture, which is annoying.  My old LG you could pick what area to focus on.9.  When camera does work, up close pictures tend to have lines in them because it's just junk.10.  Apps seemed to uninstall themselves.11.  It keeps asking me, for instance when trying to view a picture out of a text message, \"Just Once?\" or \"Always?\".  Well, \"Always\" doesn't work, as it asks me to do the same thing the next time.12.  Sound quality on the speaker phone is also terrible.13.  My old LG had a function of where you could dial in the last 4 numbers of a phone number and it would bring it up to where you could dial it.  Hadn't seen that feature in years on a phone.  Well, it's not on this phone and I miss it dearly.14.  Oh wait, the spell checker!  Turn that crap OFF!  It's in the settings somewhere, but since I use my phone for business and am inputting model numbers constantly, the phone keeps putting in words.....Until I turned it off, it was about the most annoying thing ever, except trying to then use my tablet that wouldn't connect!15.  I am sure there are at least another 2-3 things I am forgetting, but so ticked off at this phone that I wanted to write a review to save someone else the misery of ownership.Gee, Tmobile and more coverage?  Yeah, haven't seen that yet.Faster web than LG on Metro's setup, yes.  And yes, when the tablet works through its hotspot, it's faster, but it's hard to work on a tablet that you've since thrown somewhere, ran it over, and smacked it with a sledgehammer because it won't connect where you work!Better working than older LG phone that was cheaper?  Nope.  LG had MANY advantages, except for missing calls.Just don't waste your time with this hunk of crap phone, thanks Kyocera for wasting my money.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy This Phone!", "Author": "blissfullinsanity", "ReviewID": "R29QXKX9NQ4PL4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recently started using this phone for my job.

Was my introduction to T-Mobile, and will be my exit from T-Mobile, if you are with a real carrier make sure you understand what your getting from tmobile or metro for that matter. T-Mobile blatantly lies about the service area. I live in an excellent lte area according to tmobile but yet I have no service. Tmobile never updated their service map for my address even after sending a 600$ booster. Tmobile sent me a booster at no cost but still not like a real cell phone. I use my landline constantly thankfully I have lines at my house. If your lower income or live in an area where there is service you might like this phone on tmobile or metro. I live in port st Lucie fl, and have used the phone all over south Florida from homestead to Vero, from psl to Tampa port Charlotte etc. they do not compete with the others by any stretch of the word compete.
