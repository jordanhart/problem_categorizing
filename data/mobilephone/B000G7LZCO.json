{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Candid & Impartial", "Author": "Denise L. Fultz \"The Random Heroine\"", "ReviewID": "R2HKLOESRL3AUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Pink Satin Razr v3 back in August `06.  I upgraded from a Nokia 3595 to this lovely little piece of technology.  This was a careful buy as I read every possible kind of feedback on the Motorola Razr from many different sites.  At best, the reviews were mixed from other users/critics.  But for me, this phone is working out great.  I'm going to touch on a few points (negative and positive) about this phone.What Amazon doesn't add in their product information is that this was something manufactured overseas for use in Europe and China by the looks of it.  What tells me this? The charger that was manufactured for non-american voltage as well as the advertisement slips and instruction booklets in the product's box that are in both english and chinese characters.  I immediately went into panic mode when I saw the charger's plug but, noticed the little white US adapter which is nothing more then a piece you hook onto the prongs that have the correct voltage plug to fit into your outlet at home.And what I haven't been able to note in any reviews for this phone is that if you're buying this unlocked like I did, the only compatible providers are T-Mobile and Cingular since they use SIM cards with the GSM network.  I'm sure there are others internationally but, these are the only american providers I know of.  As for the SIM card in your current phone, just slide it out and slip it into your new phone.  Just make sure to copy your phonebook to your SIM card before doing so.  You may have to tweak the network settings to make sure they are compatible and functioning correctly.  Your mobile phone provider should appear on the screen once you've finished.The cons with this phone:-When porting your phonebook over from another phone, the Razr breaks down each number into an individual entry.  So even though you may have had 3 phone numbers for your husband or Mom in one efficient entry, this phone's does not have that organizational feature.  On the flip side of this, you can put the specific icon next to the entry in the phonebook like the little mobile phone, house, office, etc.-It's easy to get the large screen and flat keypad greasy from the oils in your skin. I find that it's enough just to wipe it off with the corner of your shirt gently should it get cruddy.-The flat keypad could be annoying for people with thick, large fingers.  I personally have no trouble with this.-No MP3 player.  Or any other fancy bells and whistles for that matter.  Honestly, I don't think this is bad since you can buy a nice MP3 player from Apple or one of the other manufacturers that have decent space for thousands of songs rather then what you are limited to with a cell phone.  I'm not a big fan of \"all in one\" gadgets since it tends to degrade quality.Pros:-It's quite aesthetically pleasing and sleek, no matter what color you purchase.-The camera.  It's not a fantastic camera, so if you're a photographer by trade you will know it is awful by professional, digital standards.  But if you're like me, you just use it to take impromptu silly snapshots of friends, things, pets, etc.-Volume.  Seriously, I do not know how people find issues with the audio.  My hearing is rather questionable but, I can hear my callers unless their provider's coverage is less then great.  Any calls made from a normal phone are also sharp and clearly audible.  And the Ringing Volume is a lot louder then my Nokia ever was so I'm satisfied.  You have to bear in mind that a provider's area of coverage (or lack there of) will effect your phone call and how well you can hear.  It's not always the mobile phone.  I think people make the mistake of where they put the receiver of this phone since it is very small.  And if you don't have it in the right spot at your ear, you will hardly hear a word.-Price.  The unlocked models have become reasonably priced. So if you have wanted one of these, now is the time to buy one.-Bluetooth Technology.  End of story.On a side note, I just purchased the H500 bluetooth head set in magenta since it seems close enough to the shade for me.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "THIS IS A AWESOME PHONE!!!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R68MW9L3JYEMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello! I got this Pink Razr cause i had a pink pebl and it had to go in for repair and Edge Wireless lost it. But, they found it at the last minute. But i did not want to take the chance of having it being broke again, so i got the razr. The phone is sooooooo cool!! Here are some of the Pros and Cons of this phone:Pros:1. The color is really cool.2. The Grapics are great when you are playing games.3. The picture quality is awesome.4. No dropped calls.5. You can hear perfectly on the phone.6. It is nice and thin.7. It fits in your pocket really nicely. You never know it is your pocket because it is so thin.8. It is light weight.9. I like that you can put pictures on the front of the phone.10. I have unlimited texting, so i text alot. If you are a person who likes to texts, this is the phone for you because the keypad is nice, and you know how some phones are slow at texting? Well, not this phone. Thia phone keeps up with you no matter how fast you are going.Cons:1. The battery life. The battery life is good but sometimes  the battery life does not even last a day. I do not talk on the phone alot. But i still love this phone.I hope i was helping you pick out this phone. I am just a 12 year-old kid but i hope this helps.

So I purchased my 1st unlocked phone, and it was very easy to use on the current AT&T; rate plan. When your new in the box phone arrives, all you do is save your phone numbers to the SIM card in the old phone, remove the SIM card from the old phone, insert the SIM card into the new phone, power on the new phone, and it works on your current AT&T; rate plan with your old phone number. This phone is great for every normal cell phone function, but is lacking on the ability to save other information in a notes type file for non phone functions. Go online to the Motorola Web Site and download the complete user manual for how to use all phone features.

Teves", "ReviewID": "R2ZEX52BZLXBKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased a Motorola Razr V3 cell phone through Amazon.com from Ace Photo and Digital. This was to replace the phone my wife received from Cingular Wireles that passed away after she took it swimming. Since a new phone costs $250 from Cingular, we opted to purchase an \"unlocked\" phone for $168 through Ace.The phone arrived promptly, but upon turning it on we found discovered there were phone numbers on it that were not ours. The phone, we suspected, was not new. Three hours after we started to use it, the screen went dead. So much for that!After two emails to Ace that went unanswered, I called their customer service line. Their service was great. No hassles from them. They emailed me a form to fill out and I sent the phone back ($7.50 in postage). We received a replacement phone about two weeks later. This one worked, but the battery compartment cover would not stay on. We were able to use the one from our old Cingular phone. Thank God we had it!I don't have a problem with Ace's service, but I do question the quality of their product. If these are refurbished phones, they don't reveal it. It's now been a week since the new phone arrived, and all is well so far. I'll just have my wife keep it away from the swimming pool and wait until my Cingular contract is up so I can get another NEW phone!", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Item Was Not What Was Advertised", "Author": "S.

When I saw the free  $20 Global SIM card offer, I thought it was a good deal.After I received the product, I tried to activate the SIM card over simactivations.com as per the instructions in the packaging. The second step of the activation asked me for a credit card albeit this SIM card was supposedly pre-loaded with $20 credit.I didn't want to do that since the calling rate from India to US was a ridiculous $3.95 cents / min(one of the highest rates, you can buy a local SIM card in India which can be as low as 50 cents/min).  I decided not to use this card because its purely an attempt to get you as a customer with credit card in file and start charging you on a monthly basis once the $20 credit runs out after a 5 minute call.If you really want to keep the same phone number across all the countries you travel and don't mind paying a higher calling rate for that convinience, it may not be a bad deal.Buyer beware.

It's been several years since I bought this one for my daughter. Personally I prefer the clamshell type of phone, but my daughter has moved on to the smartphones. Anyway, at the time these were first put out, they were amazing phones. Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again.These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them \"throw back\" phones now. Funny, I just call them a good buy :) But not this one, not any more.

While I was able to get a bit used to it, it wasn't very intuitive and it would take me awhile to locate the correct button or menu.Part of the phones programing is an auto fill in feature when you are texting. It starts to guess the word you are trying to type as you are typing it. This was very counter productive and caused me to have way more errors than usual. I wasn't alone on this one, I have had friends that use the same phone and I get some of the weirdest text that make you go \"huh?\".Lastly was the keypad.

They couldn't send a replacement because they said it was out of stock, and I couldn't return for a full refund, because I had brought the phone with me to Germany, and didn't have the original packing, and the charger had been lost when my an outside pocket on my luggage ripped.
