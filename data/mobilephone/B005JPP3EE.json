{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great as a first Android phone", "Author": "Panther", "ReviewID": "R17M05O40GHOG2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is an entry-level Android device that will be a best fit for those making a transition from a regular phone to a smartphone. Had it for four months and recently traded it up for Samsung Exhibit II, which actually doesn't feel as convenient as Optimus.The phone supports most of the tasks you'd expect from a smartphone. Processor is rather slow, so be sure not to overload it with multiple widgets running on the home screen.Supports tethering (i.e. using it as a USB hi-speed internet modem) as well as portable WiFi hotspot. No need to pay extra to the provider for these features. Need to install a whole bunch of drivers from LG web site before you can connect it to a PC.Comes with a lot of useless demo software and games pre-installed, removing which requires rooting - again, a good exercise that helps to embrace the full power of Android.If you go out of country with this phone, T-Mobile provides a priceless WiFi calling app for this. No more international roaming fees as long as you have WiFi access.A few disadvantages: no camera flash; no front-facing camera (only matters for video chat e.g. Skype); screen resolution good but not great (480x320 pixels); internal memory rather limited so most of the apps need to be moved to the included microSD card; can't support Adobe Flash player (YouTube still works). The phone is not future proof - no software updates from LG or T-Mobile are expected.Various versions of this phone are available from all major carriers under different names (LG Optimus One, LG Phoenix, LG Thrive, Optimus S, Optimus V).Currently (January 2012) the Amazon prices are way higher than at major retailers. This phone usually sells new for $130 at BestBuy, Walmart, RadioShack, etc. Often it can be found for $100 on sale. With a 2-year contract, it's free.If you haven't had T-Mobile before and not sure about the coverage in your area I recommend purchasing it in a regular store where you can return it without a hassle and trying it out for a couple of weeks. T-Mobile coverage can be spotty especially in rural areas. Keep in mind that even though they provide free roaming within the US, as soon as you start to roam you lose 3G data speed and drop to slower 2G speed.I would recommend this phone as a quality value smartphone.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO memory makes this one painful to own!", "Author": "AlexJouJou", "ReviewID": "R3U1XWL39ZPRRV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As others have noted this phone has less than adequate memory internally - I'm not sure what the amount is you can use but right now ALL I have on it are Kindle and Dropbox. That's it. It's FULL. No space. Phone storage space low. So if I want to ride a train I have to delete off the Kindle App and put on the Metro App. Then when finished I have to delete off the Metro App and put on the Kindle App. I put the Kindle App on the SD card - still no good. My experience has been even with a SD Card you will only get 1-4 Apps on it because many of the Apps cannot be put on the SD card. It comes pre loaded with a bunch of bloated Apps such as youtube, twitter, and facebook that you *cannot* get rid of. I am serious that I get a phone storage space full about every 5 days and end up constantly deleting one app to use another then reinstalling it later. It is a bat you-know-what crazy way to have to live in 2012 with a Smartphone!The battery seldom lasts a day. If I don't even use it I HAVE to charge it every night or it is dead by morning.Don't even get me started on the swipe (which worked great on my Droid and barely works at all on this one!) or the keyboard which is awful and either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. I spend so much time backspacing and deleting on this every time I have to use the keyboard that I'd rather do ANYTHING than use it!Additionally the camera is flat out awful. You might as well not bother at all. I know this is considered an entry level phone but I'm not sure who would enjoy it. Even entry level people deserve a camera that actually takes a non fuzzy picture and a phone that can have more than 2-3 apps installed at a time to be used! Highly unrecommended! I am actually paying to get out of my contract early just to get a phone that actually works that will perform to 2012 standards!", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life is one day or less, pocket-dials 911, freezes all the time", "Author": "Niki", "ReviewID": "R18HO2YZB864QR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone... I bought this phone seven months ago and can't wait to replace it. I've been waiting to replace it pretty much since day one. The first month I had the phone it would freeze all the time. I don't have a house phone and was living alone at the time so returning it was more of a hassle than keeping it. Wish I would have returned it. It was a great upgrade from my MetroPCS phone that wasn't a smart phone, but the excitement seriously died down in a few weeks. Here's why:I have to charge the battery every night. Most days I don't talk on the phone, just text. Maybe read a news article and check my email. Sometimes, the phone doesn't even make it through the day because the apps stay on in the background if you don't go to the settings screen and manually turn them off. All you need is one app running in the background to kill your battery before the day ends.It freezes. It's too slow. It can't handle anything. My boyfriend's Droid is three years old and works better and faster than mine.It pocket-dials 911 waaay too easily. When you lock the phone, it allows you to call 911 by touching two buttons, one to activate the screen and one to call.This phone has all these great features, but what good are they when the phone can't handle them, or when the battery is dead?! I'm seriously not even in to the latest technology and the most exciting phones and I still would not recommend this phone, to anyone!", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone Issues", "Author": "Tay", "ReviewID": "R3S6VZO0CWQLTS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product came a day earlier than expected. It was also in better physical condition than advertised. I fell in love with the phone until a few days later it suddenly began doing things on its own.  First it began by not ringing or vibrating for incoming calls, then it began opening up random apps, then powering itself off and on and then it went into safe mode.  The owner worked with me in resolving the issue and when the issue was unable to be resolved, gave me no problems in returning the product with a full refund.  The day I returned the product it had went into emergency mode. Would have been a great product had it continued to work properly.

It could hold maybe 6 or 7 apps, even if I made maximal use of the storage on the SD card.

I've had it for two years now, and even though it was really cheap, I would never get it again.It has a terribly slow processor that makes it difficult to run most applications.  I deleted Angry Birds after a while because I couldn't even play it because it was so laggy.  Also, it lags while typing pretty consistently and has a hard time doing even simple things like slide from screen to screen.  It also does other random annoying things, like when I click on a date on the calendar, it opens the wrong day unless I exit and open it again.  I also disabled the screen rotating feature because it lagged so much.Also, the camera is pretty terrible.  I never really use a phone camera, but the few times I needed it, I found it lacking.I also had hardware issues.  I used it to listen to music a lot, but one day when I pulled the headphones out, it didn't register that they were out.  The headphone icon was still on the screen and it wouldn't play anything through the speakers.  This meant that when people called me, I couldn't hear them unless I put it on speaker because it thought I had a headset plugged in.  I've tried tons of things, but I could never get it to work again.  To this day I have to make calls using the speaker phone, which is unbelievably annoying.It also has a tiny amount of memory, and adding an SD card doesn't help the problem.  I have a 32 GB card in, but still it sometimes tells me it has low memory and then refuses to send or receive texts.  The issue is in what is stored on the card and what is stored on the phone.  Some things had to be stored on the phone and I could never figure out how to get it off.  Then, sometimes it reconfigures my SD card so it has to reload all the apps I have stored on it, and sometimes it doesn't work so clicking the icons does nothing.  Then I have to reconfigure it and hope they load the second or third time.Another random thing is that periodically the screen would stop working.  I would hit the wake button and the screen light would go on and all the buttons would light up, but nothing would be shown on the screen.  The only way I could fix it was restarting the phone.It also pocket dials 911 pretty consistently when using a password to open feature.  I had to stop using it.My brother had the same phone and one day it just stopped working and he had to get a new one.All that being said, it does have some good things.  I liked the wifi calling feature.  I got coverage in the library basement with it when others consistently couldn't make or receive calls or texts.  Also, it is pretty durable in the since that I have dropped it on concrete a few times but never seriously damaged anything on it, including the screen.  Also, it's darned cheap.Also, people keep complaining about the battery life, but I never had an issue with that.  It charged quickly and lasted for multiple days with moderate use.  I did use an app called Advanced Task Killer which may have helped.In summary, don't get it.  It's not worth the hassle.  I wouldn't use this phone again if someone paid me to.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "not satisfied", "Author": "brutus leaderson", "ReviewID": "R9UGZZEM197X7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "product is not new. it was advertised as new. plastic wraps were opened. hand marks were all over the products.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the Phone", "Author": "Sheryl the Poet", "ReviewID": "R1NMGBM1TAHS7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the phone and it arrived in a timely manner, just as described in the  amazon ad, also im very pleased with the phone as well.

Bought the new batteries which happen the same. Surfing with wifi has a reasonable download time but not really fast, with daily plan(I believe is 2G)is very slow. It is a 3G capable only not 4G, don't expect to watch watch movie, TV etc. on it because it doesn't support Flash player (No one mentioned it ever, made my mistake to purchase this model), but youtube does work.The T-Mobile serviceIt is very very lousy & rough, finally got resolved my 2 different issues through FCC each time (each about 1 yr. apart, which works the great). I signed up for daily plan and couldn't discontinued it for more than 2 weeks, calling their customer service daily either was told that my issue was forwarded or forcing me to listen to their commercial comments with no sense, asking for credit was a pain as it is very time consuming. Moreover, they cannot promise if it won't happen again, it scares pretty much that I can't go further with their any plan rather than just purely the call mins..The Phone priceT-mobile has phone on-sale once a while.

This is good phone and allows wifi calling on t-mobile network. The ability to turn of wifi, bluetooth and cellular data from quick launch bar was big plus. Froyo 2.2.2 is a big plus as it allows mp4 playback. Battery life was much better than some other phones.The only shortcomings are (1) The processor can be slow for some intensive applications. (2) Low phone memory means you cannot have too many apps installed in memory, but you can install them on SD card.Overall good starter phone.

Wang", "ReviewID": "R2HS5POVAA231A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used this phone for more than one year.Fairly to say, everything works fine except for the pocket-dial 911 issue.It pocket-dialed to 911 almost once to twice per week, before I spent $3 to buy a 3rd party app to lock my phone.After checking with the LG's user forum, I found out I am not the only one has this issue. Although LG's customer service knew the pocket-dial problem, their software department never tried to solve this bug via updating its user interface. As the result, the user need to find the way to solve this pocket-dial 911 nightmare by themselves...  :( I spent $3 to buy an lock screen app to add one more layer of lock screen before the default lock screen, but this can only decrease the chance of the Pocket-Dial E911. Also, this method lets me feel very stupid since you need to pass through THREE different layers of lock screen in order to use your phone.Overall, this phone has solid hardware with very very poor UI.

I never had a smartphone before, never even had an lg phone before. This will be the last lg phone ever. I was happy at first, then it start to say \"emergency mode\" from time to time. I also received the notification that my phone was low on space, it only had 150 Mb of memory!! So that means I can only have a couple of apps. Of course I could send them to the sd card, but they stop working after a few days. So I was stuck with the internal memory. That was the sd card because I switch with my mom, ( she has the same phone), and I had the same problem. So I bought another card and it did it once. The switch is pernament and although it is better than the other one, I still don't like it, sometimes when I try to turn off the phone, it locks instead. I should also mention that playing games on it sucks. They stutter, they're glitchy, and they have trouble responding, (even an app I paid for), its probably not the phone, but still. Although calling is good and texting is easier than my old nokia phone.

If you have any dispute with them, their customer service will promise you the reimbursement first then deny it a few days later.  What makes you know about the denial is when you call them again. T-mobile's customer service are all provided by overseas call centers. They are not authorized to make any decision but just keep giving you empty promises.  If they tell you they are tranferring your call to a place which can better help your case, it is a lie.  All they do is transferring your phone call from one call center to another call center.  Your case will not be escalated at all.  By the time you find it out, it has been almost 3 hours later.  This is what'd happened to my refurbished LG Optimus T of which I just asked for warranty service.  I switched out of Verizon Wireless in August and thought T mobile was cheaper.  I chosed the $50 T-mobile unlimited usage prepaid plan.  Now is December and here is the breakdown of the money I paid:Refurbished LG optimus T: $120Shipping cost for the Phone broke (totally freeze and irresponsive) two times: $304 months subscription of $50 unlimited plan: $2004 weeks lost time on repairing the phone at Fort Worth, Texas: $50(every time your phone break, it takes at least 2 weeks to get it back.  they don't send you any substitue or replacement right away, so you basically have no service at all)So, now add them up. It's about $400 for 4 months.  So, if I stay with Verizon, it will be $20 cheaper each month plus I get a much better brand new phone.  I am not trying to advertize for Verizon but it is just my case.  I am leaving T-mobile for sure and probaly will soon swith to Sprint.  I spent some time to write this and hope nobody will go thru this again.  If you google any review on T-mobile, you will find all the good reviews were from people whose phone are still good, and all the bad reviews were from people whose phone were broken or not working under warranty.  I checked several websites recently and I was surprised the complaints are very similar to mine.  I wish I did this checking before I switched.
