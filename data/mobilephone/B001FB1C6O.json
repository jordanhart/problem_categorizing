See \"Stan\"", "ReviewID": "R189P4EA2IBMW0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this unlocked phone with T-mobile for a year (since thanksgiving weekend 2009). I do not recommend it. Here is a pro/con list, starting with cons. 6 and 7 are the MOST IMPORTANT:1. Touchscreen only works with dialing. It is a huge waste, you cannot use the touchscreen for texting. I have a feeling it also contributes to the low battery life2. Low battery life. With unlimited texting, I charge once every 1-3 days, depending on the day. Really, its that bad. When you go to one bar (out of three viewable) you will have about 5 hours before it will run out of battery and prevent you from doing anything but making calls (aka no texting on low battery)3. Turns off randomly. Very randomly. I first thought it was turning off in my pocket, but one time it turned off overnight. I use my phone as an alarm, and woke up late because it had turned off by itself.4. Takes forever to turn back on. About 5-10 min. The loading screen is fast, but once you get to the regular screen, for about 5-10min it will say \"loading\" whenever you perform an action, then NOT perform the action. Its prettymuch on but unusable for 5-10min after turning it on.5. Phone lags. Every screen change is a huge, minimum 1s lag. It will \"freeze\" for a second, either in the screen prior to whatever you go to, or in the screen you want to go to. Inbox? gotta wait a second to load it. Check call history? Takes about 6 seconds (yes, a full 6 seconds. I used a stopwatch.) Switch between call histories (missed, recent, etc)? 2 second lag.6. Outgoing calls lag. I mentioned above it will \"Freeze\" on the screen you want to go to. When you make a call, it will show a picture of a phone with concentric circles expanding. That is supposed to be the \"call on its way\", which disappears when you start getting the dial tone and THEN it starts timing the call. But that doesn't happen. Instead, it will show that screen for up to 15 seconds, and then it will go to timing the call. BUT WAIT, the timing will start at 00:15. Does that mean you've been on a call for 15 seconds with no sound? Yes. Absolutely. When I call people from my phone about 40-50% of the time it does this, and when this happens people will say \"hello? hello? hello?\" for about 15seconds before I can start hearing them (and them start hearing me). My friends know my phone does this, but this makes it IMPOSSIBLERead that: IMPOSSIBLEto make calls to people you don't know. That means no takeout places, no customer service, no nothing, because 50% of the time they will hang up on you for not responding. Note: pressing \"reply\" from your calls list will always 100% cause this lag, except worse. Record: 34second lag calling from \"missed calls\" list7. Keyboard lags impossibly. The keyboard has directional keys over the O (up), K(left), L(right), M(down). When you type at a moderate (read that: moderate) pace, you will notice that your texts get jumbled when you type O, that your cursor moves backwards when you type K, and you will often be missing O, K, L, and M from your texts. Yes, that is because it lags so bad it reads those key presses as directional keys. Instead of typing that letter, it moves your cursor. Right and down don't do anything but it makes you miss words. K is annoying, but O will really, really mess up your texts. You will in essence start writing in the middle of the text. This means I have to type at a slow (read that: slow, not even moderate!) pace to make texts without errors.8. Threaded view is broken. When you view threads, it will list them fine, and if you choose \"reply\" while in the thread, it will list your text in the thread. But if you are at the menu and press the text message key to send a text (aka not \"replying\" to a thread) your text will not be listed in the thread. The person's response will, but yours won't. It also gets times messed up really often.Pros:1. Nice keyboard. feels great. but completely canceled out by con #72. SD card slot, easy to customize with own ringtones.3. Nice layout of buttons and menu buttons.That is all. The two major functions of this phone (calls, texts) are absolutely ruined by the firmware, it is almost like this is NOT a functional phone.

I bought the Lg KS360 and she bought the Lg GT360. The only difference is that the KS360 is a Tri Band and the GT360 is a Quad Band. My wife uses hers daily and she loves the qwerty slide out keyboard. She has small dainty fingers and the keys suit her fine. This is the only draw back for me since I have relatively large fingers but I manage. The touch screen comes in handy for dialing especially if your in a hurry. We both have a 1GB Micro Memory SD Card in ours and use them to store photos and music. The camera takes very good photos and video. The performance and reliability are there. Can't comment on the web browser because we never use it. The camera does what it is supposed to do.UPDATE 01/03/2011Having problems??? Phone not detected in device manager with Win 7(32bit) we always took out the memory card and used a USB Memory card reader for putting photos on the card then one day I tried to use the supplied USB cable to charge the phone and the phone was not detected in device manager. I went to the LG web site and there are Updated USB drivers available for our phones but impossible to download them. They simply will not download and I am not a newbie, believe me!!! Lg support is only located in the United Kingdom. I e-mailed customer support about a week ago and still have not heard from them. They don't offer a toll free number either. What a joke!!! The real problem I am having is that we are not receiving photo attachments with text messages. I did some searching on Google and apparantly we need to update the firmware in the phones. GOOD LUCK with this. I spent over 3 hours and ended up very frustrated and ready to throw the phones away I was so mad. Except for the NON-Existing support and not being able to receive photo attachments and the device not being detected in device manager the phones work well, I guess? Never again will I get an LG phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I suppose when I finally hear from customer support I am expecting them to say something like this: WE DON'T OFFER SUPPORT/DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS 7. I received a similar reply from Motorola when my RAZR didn't work with phone tools after I upgraded to Windows 7. It's just a scam for you to buy new phones. These companies could write new drivers if they want to but why should they. They make way more money by us buying their new products instead of receiving driver support for their older ones.

Right away, the phone would switch itself off if you slid the qwerty keyboard shut. I took it in to the provider's store and they basically said \"tough, it's refurbished\". After a while however - probably 2 weeks, it stopped doing this, so I thought we were ok.Gradually, the phone started to take longer and longer to connect when I place a call. I would dial a number and just hear dead silence on the other end, and then maybe one ring before the other person picked up. After a while I would hear no ringing and just the other person speaking right away. After a few more months when I finally did hear something the person would be going \"HELLLOOOO??\". My husband told me then that his phone would ring as normal when I call him, when he picks up he can hear me and will say \"hello????\" several times before I'd reply. During all this, I'd still be hearing dead silence on the other end and had no idea people could hear me breathing already. This led to places like doctors' offices hanging up when I called them since they got no reply after a few seconds of waiting.I guessed all the trouble was because it was refurbished in the first place and decided to pick up a pay as you go phone from my provider to just use until my contract runs out. This model happened to be one of the pay as you go offerings and since I already knew all the functions and liked the keyboard I decided to get it again. Sim card popped in no problem, no issues with switching itself off, but the problem with calls connecting and me not being able to hear the other person started again after about a month. This is an issue with the phone model, and not just an issue with the first one I had because it was a refurb.I had to up my txting plan and mostly send txts if I want to communicate, or wait for people to call me. If I was only going to score it based on how well it works it would be half a star, but I give it two starts because I like the design of the phone enough that I bought it twice.

This was the only one with a good solid keyboard (for At&t; anyway). It's got a really dumb interface. The camera is comparable to a Fisher Price Kid Tough thingy...or a disposable. Don't even try web browsing or video.But, for a messaging phone it works. It's cheap. And, doesn't require a data plan. Just what I wanted and expected. I'm deducting a star because they call it *touchscreen*. The only thing touchscreen about it is the dialer. I think this cuts down on the bulk of the phone (it's nice and small). But, definately is not true touchscreen.Also, I noticed it's rebooting sometimes when I send a text. I've had an LG VU that the mic quit on. This is a problem with LGs. Also, the speaker on it is beyond dumb. My droid ringtones sound corny. As long as it does what I need it to do for six months I'm happy.
