{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect phone", "Author": "Ricardo V.", "ReviewID": "R2OC873AQFKPTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is just an astonishing phone, out of this world. There are others out there with basically the same hardware but the design, the robust finish, the materials, EVERYTHING about this phone makes it the best there is available.I would never say something like a G2 or a Nexus 5 are any short from excellent but this Z1, it is just perfect.I am just too happy, I have used it just for a few hours but it feels really special compared to other top smartphones,You must've already read a lot of technical reviews (and you should to make a good decision) but let me remind you, the camera is pretty good but it's still a phone camera, even with those 20MP it still lacks specially in low-light. The hardware is simply and literally the best there is. The Snapdragon 800 is the most powerful processor available and the 2GB of RAM makes switching between applications feel like alt-tabbing on your computer.The waterproofing is an amazing feature, just washing the phone to clean it is almost as fun as using it, keep in mind it also adds some weight so this is not going to be as light as any other of the big smartphones out there but it's totally worth it.And the good side about the few extra grams is that the phone feels sturdy and well built, it doesn't feel plastic (because it isn't) or delicate it's like holding a sculpture, nothing compared to any other phone or gadget I've ever had.Bottom line: Just buy it, you will not regret it.Best hardware, Good price, Amazing looks, Awesome features. I don't think you could ask much more from a phone.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone!", "Author": "Ruben B.", "ReviewID": "R1K261IE2NDX8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is really fast and beautiful.

Its still oem, but if you expecting the box to be like the phone unboxings on youtube, you are sadly mistaken.the camera? oooo 20.7 mp camera. the overprocessing messes up the beautiful picture. im not photographer, but when i take a picture in the auto mode, the pictures are undersaturated sometimes, and grainy... oh yea... GRAINY... if you put it in low lights, its like 2005 again....is it waterproof? who knows? im just this broke college student who saved money for 2 whole years waiting for the xperia z (but then changed to xperia z1) for a phone i thought i would be amazed by it. no. im just pissed by it now. i took a shower with it. it works fine. close the ports though.now that im done ranting, lemme tell you its good features... the battery saving mode is amazing if you know how to use it.... i was doing an all nighter at my college with no charger... i was down to 12 percent. i turned on the power saving modes and kept the display off for the majority of the time. that 12 percent will last forever.... seriously.. i only opened it to check a few things from time to time. from 11:30pm to 7:30AM, it only dropped down to 8 percent... thats insaneIt's also very fast and snappy. quick to charge. never lagged.. ever. the white is this amazing white i show off to random people on the train. jelly people.....this is my second sony phone in a row. im very impressed by the quality and the design of their phones... who doesnt love a double slab of clean plastic? if only sony was smart to lose few pennies to dollars for a free screen protector. id give them i hug and the most sexually hot action in the bedroom.conclusion. if you are expecting this special phone that unbreakable and takes the best camera photos EVER? stop it. its not here. go away. WE DON'T LOVE YOU.  if you love the design and you want to buy something sexy with flagship specification? sure. its got that nice 1080p display that has very nice viewing angles compared to what youtube viewers say. phone call is exceptional--------------->read on if you plan on updating this phone to jellybean<------------THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THOSE WHO WISH TO UPDATE THEIR PHONES FROM 4.2.2 STOCK TO 4.3 STOCK USING OTA OR SONY PC COMPANION.the flashing process takes the craziest amount of power ever. either its that or theirs bad battery calibration between firmware. when i finished flashing from start to finish, my battery dropped from 87 percent to 41 percent... remember if you phone is disrupted from the flashing process at any given moment, the phone is soft bricked. period. you would not be able to turn it on and you would have a very expensive piece of paperweight. there is a possibility of fixing it. if this is the case, charge the phone for 3 hours (assuming thats a full charge) and repair the phone using SEUS or PC COMPANION.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Android 4.3 update sucks", "Author": "dannyou", "ReviewID": "RC4RQFZO2INTM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When i got the phone i was woooowed, not that it ha been updated, the phone has some issues, i downgraded it to 4.2.2 and its working fineUPDATE:I made a video showing the issues that update brought to me.By the way I already returned it, I hope the Z2 does not have this issues cause im planning to buy it, using my old note 2 for now.[...]", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Screenshots", "Author": "MissKeet", "ReviewID": "R1NQNMO5A2TIB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone but can anyone tell me how to do screenshots or if it does them???
