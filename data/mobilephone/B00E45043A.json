But then you realize it doesn't carry a 2-year agreement. You can use this phone out of the box on an AT&T; Prepaid (GoPhone) line or on AT&T; postpaid (contract) plans. It comes with a Micro SIM card and GoPhone activation kit in the box.It performs great! I've owned a Lumia 920, HTC 8x, Lumia 822, and a few older WP7 devices. This, just like any other Windows Phone, feels smooth and fluid throughout. Sometimes when a larger operation (filtering a photo, opening a big app) takes place, you will notice a \"Resuming...\" screen for a split second. Otherwise, it's every bit as smooth as any other Windows Phone. You can't really say that about an Android device at this price point.Pros1) Price! This phone can be used as a daily driver, backup phone, \"I dropped my other phone in the toilet and I'm not due for an upgrade\" phone, or even just a device you use with WiFi only.2) The software library for Windows Phone is getting there. It still doesn't have Instagram, but it has everything else you could really want.3) Comcast Xfinity remote lets me control my TV/DVR with this thing. It's like I got an amazing touch screen smart remote for free.4) First-party Xbox apps. Xbox Smartglass lets you use this as a makeshift Xbox 360 controller. Xbox Live lets you keep track of anything like achievements, recently played, your avatar, etc.5) Nokia Music lets you stream lots of music. FOR FREE!6) Nokia HERE (Maps, Drive) are awesome! You can download GPS maps for offline use. Use it in the car for turn-by-turn directions, or use it while you're out and about for mapping. If this was the only feature this device had, it would be worth the MSRP!7) You can swap the cover! If you get tired of the plain black color on this device, you can easily buy a colored variant from Nokia and just swap it out. The yellow one looks amazing!Cons1) There's no Front Facing Camera, so video calls are out.2) It only has 512MB of RAM, which limits some apps. I've noticed very few that haven't been able to install, and none of them are deal-breakers.3) The camera is 5MP, has no flash, and rather poor. But - it's still comparable or better than any Android device I've tested at this price point.4) The display isn't the best, but what can you expect for the price? It's crisp and readable at WVGA resolution, and the nature of Windows Phone really makes up for any other shortcomings the display may have. The colors are pretty good, considering it's an IPS panel.Note: I purchased this device directly from AT&T; at full MSRP + sales tax. Any of my comments are based on that price point, which is definitely the upper limit you will see for this device. This phone is already listed cheaper here on Amazon just 3 days after it was released.UPDATEThis phone (retail packaging from AT&T;) DOES come with a USB cable. I previously stated that it did not, which is incorrect.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great off contract phone at a steal of a price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SDMX6V2UKA80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an iPhone 5 a year ago and then it got stolen. I can't afford to buy another iPhone because it is off contract with AT&T; and even the iPhone 4s would cost me over $350 off contract. I've been curious about Windows Phone 8 and thought this would be a good way to try it out. It is a Go Phone ( marketed for prepaid plans), but if you already have an AT&T; post paid phone plan, simply swap in your own SIM card and it will work right out of the box with your current phone number and plan (If you have a larger SIM card you can buy a SIM cutter for under $5 and it should work fine).I purchased this Nokia Lumia 520 phone from Amazon in mid-august 2013 (about 8 weeks ago). Anyways, I figured that for $100, I could try out WP8 operating system and if I didn't like it it would be not much of a risk or loss to me. So far, I have been really, really happy with it. It is pretty much equivalent in performance and specs to the iPhone 4s. With the Lumia 520, you lose the front camera and flash of the iPhone 4s, but you get a bigger 4-inch screen and bigger battery. The 520 only comes with 8 GB of storage, but I added a 16 GB SD card for a total of 24 gigabytes, which is more than enough for my purposes. Including the SD card, the total phone cost $115 (w/ free amazon prime shipping). I'd be satisfied with this phone if I paid $200 for it, but at $115 - I'm very happy indeed.The only shortcoming I can think of is there are not as many Windows Phone apps as there are for Android or Apple iOS, but I will not take any stars off of the phone because that is not an issue with the phone and there are more WP apps coming every day. If this was my first smartphone, there would be no complaints whatsoever. I know Apple and Android really have the smartphone market locked up in the US, Japan and UK, but I think Windows Phone will really get a foothold in EU and the developing world, so lots more WP apps should be coming down the pipeline soon form enterprising app developers internationally.My phone use is for texting first, camera second, phone calls third... fourth would be browsing the web while taking the bus to/from school, fifth as a music player and sixth for maps/directions. It does all of those things very well. The Nokia Camera app is great - I'm a photographer and I like that I can change the exposure by +- 2 stops, Nokia Here apps are awesome (maps, public transit and turn-by-tun driving)  - the driving app even lets you download maps to your phone so you can get directions and view maps where there is no cell phone service (came very handy driving through the mountains in Western Nevada). The Nokia \"Transfer MY Data\" app was great and pulled all 300+ of my address book from an iPod Touch in about 20 seconds via bluetooth. I like the Windows Phone integration with SkyDrive and find it much easier to use and more user friendly than iCloud - there is a lot more customization options with SkyDrive whereas iCloud has a really dumbed down and simplistic interface over the web.I've even been able to do a small amount of data tethering with my iPod Touch. I've only had to do it once when I had no Windows Phone app for what I wanted to do. I've hear AT&T; locks out tethering from data plans unless you pay more, but I think it was only a small amount of data and since it went to a mobile device it was able to get thru the system. I think if I had tried to tether with a laptop, it might have been blocked. I wouldn't say this is a feature, and your mileage if you try this may vary.I really like this phone and for the price ($100), I LOVE IT! I think my next phone may be a Windows Phone with LTE and I may end up getting an iPad for those few iOS apps I can do without.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent nokia phone", "Author": "Sundar", "ReviewID": "R3IU2RMQXIUS2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to own nokia feature phones 6 years ago and loved everything about them.

I ordered my phone directly from AT&T; because Amazon said it would take 2-5 weeks (after I ordered the phone from AT&T; it became in stock on Amazon go figure)For $100 your getting a really good dealScreen quality looks nice, you can still see outside in direct sunlight-The pictures look good for a 5 mp camera ( I have a iPad 4 and the photo quality is very similar/just as good as what you get with the Nokia)- the call quality is great, even if you use the speakerphone! I called a friend and asked if the sound quality was good he said yes. After I told him, he was on speakerphone he said I sounded amazing and he couldn't tell-Listening to music is great on the phone nice and loud-Offline map with turn by turn navigation. This is why I bought the phone for this feature, figured if I could use this feature without any internet connection I could save myself from buying a GPS.-Keyboard is easy to type on-Interface is easy to use-Message title has a winking face when their is an unread text message ;)-I have 2013 Honda Civic and the phone does work with hands free Honda Bluetooth that is built  into the car, and it will support the read you your text messages feature :)One thing I'm missing on phone is when you send picture messages it doesn't do the little up and down arrow showing that its trying or receive or send a message(Hope this makes sense) so you kinda just have to guess when your picture message has been sentThings you need to know-If you are already an existing go phone customer you will need call AT&T;, so they can transfer your number and money to the new micro sim unless your last phone already had a micro sim (currently the only go phones on AT&T;  that have a micro sim are the Samsung Galaxy Express, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone.)-If you don't have/want to pay for data you need to disable data otherwise you might see GPRS charges on your account. I had one that cost $4.44 and I wasn't happy. Disabling data will insure you don't receive any of these mysterious GPRS charges. However, if you disable data you will no longer see 4G on the phone and you won't be able to send or receive picture messages (you can still get regular text messages)-Battery life varies depending on how much you use your phoneI am grandfathered into the old $1 a day plan which doesn't have any data, so I'll guess have to change to one of the new plans or I will end up paying more with the random GPRS charges when data is enabled-Not as many Apps compared to Apple and Android, but has the most common apps people want and Windows seems to be trying to get more...As I previously stated I have an iPad 4, so any games, emails, or video calls are done on there.My phone is just for calls, texting, picture messages, taking pictures and very light web use when wifi is available and I need to look up something when I'm out and about, and now GPS :)Overall, if your someone like me who upgrading from an older android, can get used to the Windows OS  and can live with the fact that not every app is available in the App Store then I think you'll be very happy with this phone.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing, inexpensive phone", "Author": "Morphling", "ReviewID": "R1HKUX57IINE8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned flagship phones, prepaid pieces of junk, international phones, flip phones, etc.  This Lumia 520 is by far and away the best deal on a phone I've ever seen.  That's not to say it's the best phone ever, clearly you can spend hundreds more to make that happen.  What this phone did was show that an inexpensive phone needn't be cheap too.  As others have said, if you're on the fence, just purchase this already.  It's a no brainer.  I will note, I did get mine significantly cheaper than the price listed here - the brick and mortar store that makes the OS on this phone was running a demo that knocked off many dollars on any item.  Anyway, onto more of the review.Overall build/design of the phone - The phone is a very basic look which I find better.  It's functional and nothing more, but it isn' also abrasive looking or ugly.  The back is made of that soft touch plastic and I love that stuff.  It provides grip, it doesn't feel 'cheap', and it doesn't scratch/dent easily.  All the physical buttons are on the right side of the phone - which is nice too.  You can grip your phone in your left hand without pushing some volume button or what not.  The buttons are OK to push - the power works best and so does the camera button(which has two stages so you can focus and snap a pic quickly).  The volume rocker is harder to push and push quickly, but you can just hold it to turn volume up/down.  Also note, if you take the back off to pull the battery or SD card or what not, make sure you put the cover back on very well - mine was off by a tad and the camera button didn't engage.  Overall, the phone is built solidly, it's good looking, and everything is laid out well.Screen - This is always hard as you have to physically look at the screen to decide if you like it or not.  I find the panel to be good given the price, size, etc.  The resolution is just fine for a 4'' screen.  Yes, a full 1080p screen is good, but even as a tech guy I thought it was overkill for a phone.  The screen gets bright enough if you set it to high.  You can only set it to low, medium, and high.  Also you can leave it on auto, which I do.  It works well enough and I can always read the screen.  Colors are bright and accurate as far as I can tell.  You can adjust more specific color things in the settings too.  The IPS makes it so you can view it well without having it dead on.  I will say it's  a very glossy screen so reflections do get noticed.  There is some of that dark 'banding' I'll call it at the bottom of the screen.  Many phones, laptops, etc. I have, have had this, so I get over it.The touch screen works very well and while I'm not wearing gloves in the Arizona summer, I did put a cloth over my hand and try it - it worked just as well.  No bad touches or anything amiss with the touch screen.Call quality/data/signal - I'll put these all into the same category as I don't wish to review any specific network.  The calls on this phone work well, they sound OK.  It's a bit fuzzy, as if you're talking on a cell phone (go figure, but I've had much clearer calls on cell phones recently).  Nobody has complained that they can't hear me well.  Data on this sucker is HSPA 21, which is fast enough for me.  I get the typical 2-5mbps down in my area and about 1.5mpbs up.  Things load quickly on the phone, it syncs stuff well, and it doesn't stop my day.  My signal strength is about par for my other Samsung, LG, etc. phones, so it's nothing to write home about, but it's acceptable.  My old motorola phone still holds a great signal where my other phones struggle, so it could be better.Software/OS - I won't be reviewing the Windows phone 8 in depth.  It's a very nice OS, slick, good looking, gets stuff done without getting in your way.  Yes, it has limits.  Sure, the available applications are behind iOS and Android, which is a valid concern.  The store is also confusing compared to the others, so finding stuff isn't as easy, which is odd given most apps are very easy to use.  The included Nokia software is awesome I'll say.  Their version of maps and navigation are very good - hasn't failed me yet and just as good as google maps/nav.  The Nokia music is great - it beats pandora and google music hands down - simply because it's free.  Also, it does work very well.  The included software for the camera is nice - nothing mind-blowing but it's useful and I like it.  I'll talk about the physical camera more.  Mail, messages, phone, etc. are all very easy to use and look nice.  Overall, Microsoft did well with the OS here and partnering with Nokia provided a bit of extra 'oomph' to the mix.  Go to a phone store and tell the sales people to leave you alone and try out a windows phone for a while to see how it works.  That's the only way you'll know regardless of how many reviews you read.Camera - It's a basic camera.  Nokia does well with optics so even though this is 'only' 5mp, it takes decent looking and clear pictures.  It doesn't have a flash, which I don't mind anyway - any cell phone with a flash makes pictures look washed out or if you don't use a flash, it's just dark and grainy.  It takes pictures quickly and as I said about some of the nice software, you can flash 5 pictures quickly to pick your favorite. I don't get why people slam cameras on phones - they work well enough and aren't the main attraction - some phones come with respectable cameras now but you'll pay for it.  If you need that, get one.  Otherwise, buy a good stand-alone camera you can use lenses and such on and enjoy excellent pictures.Overall - I'm impressed with this phone and even more so given the rock-bottom price.  It has some signs of a 'cheap' phone such as you must manually pull your SD card out - no spring loaded ejection (this phone can take an SD card, unlike MANY new Android devices and all iPhones.  The ability to add a lot more storage, cheaply and quickly, is good regardless.)  The screen is a bit glossy, but oh well.  It's a full, honest smartphone that has good specs and works scarily well for the price of an impulse buy.  Purchase this phone and save yourself money upfront with a cheap phone.  Purchase a prepaid plan and save yourself money every month.

I\u2019m no technophobe (I work in an IT related field) but I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m a cheapskate. I\u2019m not interested in putting a large amount of my paycheck towards a fancy phone or unlimited-everything contract. By managing my phone use and relying on wi-fi as much as possible, I can get all the calls, texts and cellular data I need for 10 bucks a month. The problem is, there hasn\u2019t been a good selection of phones that give me the performance I want, at the price I\u2019m willing to pay. That\u2019s where the Nokia 520 comes in! I give it 5 stars not because it\u2019s necessarily a perfect phone or OS, but because the value here is incredible. I can see why this is being snapped up all over the world. A lot of reviewers have commented that it\u2019s a good \u201cstarter\u201d smartphone, which it may be, but the only thing \u201cstarter\u201d about it is the price. Sure, it doesn\u2019t have the specs of a flagship phone and won\u2019t appeal to everyone, but in my estimation it\u2019s a very good phone that should be fine for most average users.After using the phone for a month, here\u2019s a few specific thoughts:- I haven\u2019t experienced any lagging, freezing, or need for restart \u2013 something that cannot be said for my previous phone which cost over twice as much.- I like the feel and responsiveness of the phone hardware. I have used other Nokias in the past and they have all been solid as a rock hardware-wise. I hope this does as well.- About the battery, with wi-fi discovery turned off and screen brightness set to auto, I typically have about one-half of the battery left at the end of the day. There was one day that some app or another (I\u2019m guessing) drained the battery way down so I\u2019m being more careful about what I leave open.- Camera so far is working well for me when the lighting conditions are decent. I use a real camera anyway for stuff I really care about. Plenty of options available for editing and uploading photos.- So far I like using the Windows Phone 8 OS. It was really easy to set up personal and work email accounts, etc. Navigating around is easy and kind of fun. I like all the info you can see right on the lock screen, let alone the home screen \u201clive tiles.\u201d The web browser has worked fine for what I need. I\u2019ve adapted well to the onscreen keyboard and I\u2019m becoming a big fan of the predictive text. I\u2019m also using the voice commands more as I learn about the phone\u2019s capabilities. Recently at a day at an amusement park, I used the voice command to speak and send texts back and forth with my wife, and it translated what I said great despite all the ambient noise. I understand some of the criticism of WP8 regarding some nuances and settings it would be nice to have. But here again, nothing for me has been a big deal and they seem to be listening to customers and adding improvements with each release.- Nice to have the free downloadable maps and turn-by-turn navigation. Works great with no data costs.- Availability of apps for Windows Phone has been a deal-breaker for some. Statistics show that most people REALLY only use a handful of apps and this is true for me. So far, I\u2019ve found what I needed. (I\u2019m a busy dad and mostly use my phone as a tool, not something I spend hours entertaining myself with.) A warning though, I\u2019ve run into a couple apps and games that require a higher-powered phone, but nothing I really cared about.- It\u2019s nice to have the Office apps on here so I can open docs I get from work, etc. I\u2019m also getting into using OneNote.- The latest thing I\u2019m loving is the Xbox Music Pass. Unlimited music downloads and/or online listening for a REALLY reasonable subscription price. I\u2019m on a trial now but I think I\u2019m gonna keep this one. Music is my one big weakness for spending money!To sum up, all I can say is, I think a lot of consumers (in the U.S., particularly) are hoodwinked into thinking they HAVE to have such and such phone on an expensive monthly contract. But if you\u2019re like me and you have better things to do with your hard-earned money, then get this phone with a prepaid service and join me in laughing all the way to the bank!", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a cheap price", "Author": "poison_ivy", "ReviewID": "R3UJIYIFBQ4VJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for $85 on another site, I missed the lightning deal that Amazon had on this one.

It would seem logical that we would gravitate to the iPhone but given our limited phone usage, but it didn't make sense to make the required investment.  The Nokia 520 provides all the functionality we need and for $59, it was an incredible bargain.

You can't compare $199 contracted Galaxy S4 or iPhone 5 because you are stuck with a contract and must pay or companies come after you. I bought when it was $90 but at $100 it still can't be beat.  You can't get an iPhone for $100 bucks and Android phones at this price range just plain suck.  This baby is a dual core processor with 512mb of ram and it runs smooth. Windows phone might not have as many apps as android and iOS but it has quality apps that would satisfy most user (Pandora, Mobile office, Angry birds, Cut the rope, Netflix, Youtube, Hulu etc.) 97% of the apps on the other stores you would never use anyways.Best part I think is Nokia Here maps. Better than google maps as you can download maps for just about any country in the world with turn by turn navigation.

I have big hands or above average hand size and when I hold it with one hand my thumb can comfortably touch every part of the screen.  The Galaxy S4 is about 4.8 inches I think and the Galaxy S3 is slighty smaller than that and my thumb can't touch the full screen without stretching.Camera is a 5MP snapper with autofocus and such.

My son (the gadget guru in our family) said I was an idiot to not go android, BUT I'm an older professional woman who doesn't need (or want) all the apps that son needs for his job.Sound is good.  I can hear and those on the other side of the line can hear me.  That's a huge plus....I've tried phones with much higher price tags that are awful in this area.  Texting is very easy even with the onscreen keyboard.  Battery life is amazingly good for what I use it for.  Days at a time instead of hours.  It also seems to charge quickly compared to those my family uses.  Photos are FANTASTIC on this thing.  LOVE that feature and now I don't need to carry my camera when out on a research trip.  It also has GPS in it that can work WITHOUT being connected to the 3G which is a nice touch.  I don't always have to carry my GPS now.I was also pleasantly surprised at how easy this screen is to read.  The colors can be altered to suit your preference and vision and it's large enough that I can read a text without my reading glasses if need be.  The windows interface was quite simple for me to use.....much easier than my son's android, actually.My only complaint was that while decorating for an event recently, I had the phone in my back pocket so it was handy.  During this day, it froze on me three times.  It's never done it BEFORE that or SINCE that day.  SO, I'm not sure what that was about, although I never keep it in a pocket.  NOt sure if it got hot or whatever, but it did freeze up on me.  Rebooting it fixed it, but I was concerned.  It's not happened since, though, and has been a real workhorse for me.I\"ve been a user for over 5 months now, and so far it's doing its job. I even have service in places I never have before, and living in rural America, you can imagine how important that is.I think it was a good purchase, especially for the price I paid.  However, if you're really into the gadgets, you WILL be disappointed in the app offerings....didn't matter to me because what it DOES do is perfect for my lifestyle AND the call quality was really the important feature for me.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great, inexpensive phone", "Author": "Omineca", "ReviewID": "R340YSNXSLRXHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not a flagship device.It doesn't have a front-facing camera. Reviewers say that it does not have the greatest display (it seems fine to me though, and I have other phones to compare it with). The battery life is a little on the short side. It feels a little light in your hand.But it's under $100 and it's a great phone.I have experienced no difficulties with this phone. The dual core processor is excellent. The touchscreen is very responsive. The animations are fast and smooth. Netflix streams well. The browser is great, rendering pages quickly and nicely. The audio sounds good through both of my sets of earphones, and the built-in speaker is loud. The wifi and data connections are stable.Oh, and Windows Phone 8 is a revelation. I'm so surprised by how nice it is. I have an android tablet, an iPhone 4 (from work), and an HP Pre 3 (with WebOS), and Windows Phone 8 compares nicely. In fact, I would say that it's the most elegant interface of all of them in terms of appearance (hats off to the typographers and designers). In terms of user interaction, Windows Phone 8 is more intuitive and less clunky than Android, about on par with iOS, and not quite as nice as the ill-fated WebOS. But I digress.Now for the really good stuff: if you're a Canadian like me, you can buy this phone from Amazon.com. Shipping is FAST. It took about a week.If you don't put a SIM card in the phone at first, you can still start it up. It complains that there's no SIM, you press \"OK\" or something like that (\"Dismiss\" perhaps?) and on you go. If you put the phone in airplane mode, it won't repeat the SIM-missing message, and you can still toggle the wifi on and off. So you could just use this as a media/internet device, and not use the phone functions.The phone is carrier-locked to AT&T.; However, if you're outside the U.S. and you're somewhat technically inclined, this phone can be unlocked for a few dollars and used with a local cell service. Google and eBay are your friends. Do not unlock the phone yourself if you're an American, since it is illegal to do so in the U.S. AT&T; will unlock it for you (I can't tell if there's a service fee) after you've used the phone on their network for six months. [edit: apparently AT&T; has made the phone more difficult to unlock since I did it. Have a look at the forums on redflagdeals.com for more information]I highly recommend this phone.

Here are my reasons for loving this phone:-Incredibly inexpensive, especially when combined with the Straight Talk $45 plan and various discounts you can get on those cards.-Fast, smooth performance and excellent Windows Phone 8 interface just \"gets things done.\"-Excellent Microsoft Exchange integration.-Good podcast directory, although fetching the latest podcast sometimes seems a little delayed.-GREAT sound quality from the headphone jack (I would describe myself as an audiophile).-Durable and replaceable casing.-Replaceable battery and SD card.-Solid IPS display.-Great battery life.-Excellent call quality, including the speakerphone.A few downsides:-Apps are still lacking in some areas, particularly an issue for me when it comes to medical apps.-Bing really is terrible, it simply cannot find the results you are looking for with the high performance of Google.  I avoid the Bing integration and just go to Google.com in the browser.-Music should be drag-and-dropped from Windows Explorer.  Windows Media Player syncs are unreliable.-Nokia Maps sometimes has outdated POI's, and it gives you too many voice commands so you are constantly being interrupted.  For example if you are on the highway, it will sometimes tell you to \"keep left\" if you go by some random exit.-If you run the navigation app in the background, be aware that it may quit on you without warning.  I missed an exit the first time I used this phone for navigation because of this weird issue.  For example if you want to listen to music while running the navigation, you need to put the music in the background and put the navigation app in the foreground.  If you leave the navigation in the background, the phone may close the process leaving you flying blind, unaware that you lost your GPS guidance.To conclude, I think it is utterly ridiculous that so many people happily pay $100/month and $200 up front (+/- activation fees) for fancy new smartphones when you can pay half or less with the excellent Lumia 520.

It has a smaller-than-standard SIM card, so we took it to an AT&T; store to get it activated; had no issues.

I owned all iphones except the first one. Last year, just for change, I sold iphone 5 and bought used lumia 900 cyan. It was a great change after owning iphone for years. I still remember the clear black display and glossy curved screen. Within 2 months I bought lumia 920 off eBay before release. I used it for 4 months and was very happy with everything except the weight. I usually keep my phone in upper shirt pocket ,so I always felt lumia 920s weight. This year I sold Lumia 920 and bought HTC One. Great Phone, great resolution, stable OS, great speaker etc.Recently in Amazon Deals I found lumia 520 for 79 dollars without contract. Amazon has made one click too easy. So without thinking I just clicked.I got the phone within one day.My notes on this phone:Stable OS. I love windows 8. Clean OS and a good change from ios and android. Once it gets good apps then I think It will be on top soon.Great looks and availability of swappable multi color back covers.Awesome battery life. It reminds me olden days. I always used the battery saver mode. I charged this phone 3 days ago and it has some 35% left. I have to admit I didn't use it more than an hour for past 3 days. But doing the same with my HTC One, the battery will be dead in just 1 day. May be non availability of LTE runs it longer.Screen is good but not great. Though the resolution is almost same as lumia 900 ,I feel lumia 900 screen is much better than this one.The PPI on this phone is more then lumia 900 but lumia 900 screen looked sharp.I never found pixels in lumia 900. In this phone certain colors clearly shows pixels. The color of screen does makes difference. Green colors show pixels more then blue.If you planning to cut SIM and use it then be careful. I think the thickness of regular SIM  gives very tight fit on this phone. Though micro Sims slips very easily.Camera is not great. It's an average camera for basic photography.Price is unbeatable. Spend 3 dollars and its unlocked.I didnt feel there is any signal problem on this phone. You can hold any ways unlike iphone.Speaker is average. Sound is just enough.Voice is clear over conversation.Overall i recommend this phone for the low price.Can be a great secondary phone.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprising Performance!", "Author": "R. David", "ReviewID": "R18FU5UI8RLH11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a replacement phone for a Galaxy S3 phone where the screen had cracked and I didn't want to invest in buying a full-priced phone since I was still within my contract.Opening the phone, placing the micro-SIM (pay attention to the picture symbol that tells you which direction it goes in), and going to a fully usable phone, took about 5 to 10 minutes.Coming from an Android/Galaxy phone, was a big change. As with any transition, there's always pro's and con's, however given the price/value of the phone, I'm not disappointed because I think it was the best choice I could of made.Remember I'm coming from a Galaxy S3/Android phone, so my opinions are based on that:Pro's- Shipped with the latest version of Windows Mobile 8.0.10327 (GDR2) that supports Amber alerts- Display screen was better than expected. I was expecting a display that was going to be subpar. Of course, it isn't as crisp as an OLED based display but good enough!- Responsiveness - I was expecting a \"slow experience\" but was surprised at the performance. It handled the scrolls and display pretty well- Sound - pretty good and on-par with my previous phones- Keyboard - good word prediction- Apps - Contrary to what I've heard, most of the apps that a business user needs, is there. Sure, the app market doesn't have the breath of games etc, but for what a business user needs, it's good enough.- Nokia Radio - Impressive.. I was able to store off-line radio stations. NICE!!!Con's- Battery : I'm not sure of the battery. I was expecting better performance compared to the S3 but so far it looks to be the same from a perspective of percent usage throughout the day. I'm still tweaking the performance, so I'll see.- Configurability of email sync options; doesn't support the ability to setup regular versus off-hours schedule. I would of thought that this would be supported but perhaps it doesn't because this is the lower-end version of the Nokia.- Keyboard - I miss Swype. It was fast to just draw the words that type, however I think it will be just a learning curve- Browser - Internet Explorer doesn't support the ability to remember/save login info on a web form.- Notification bar - I wish the battery and wireless indicator has the option to be persistent all the time. Right now, I have to swype it down. However, I believe the proper way is to have tiles setup to show this info.- Camera Quality - I wasn't prepared for how poor quality the megapixels was going to be.. coming from an 8 megapixel down to a 5 megapixel, was surprisingly very noticeable.Anyway, the Lumia 520 isn't an exact replacement for a Galaxy S3, but it's good enough!

I purchased it from the AT&T; store, and I later purchased a second one on Amazon.  I wanted to use the phone a good month before giving it a review.I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy S3, which I owned for about 7 months.  Prior to that, I had an iPhone 3G.  I also have my wife's iPhone 4 to compare to.  I love the Android OS the best, but decided to sell the S3 because of a battery plummet issue that I could never get resolved other than a soft reset, and the miniUSB port went dead.  I could not charge nor connect my phone to a computer (no rooting, no transfer of files, etc).  Because I am anticipating some flagships Android phones to be announced soon, I've held off on buying another Android.  I eventually plan to have an Android as my primary phone.I purchased the 520 as a transitional phone.  WP8 has always intrigued me.  I briefly thought about the Lumia 920 back in November when it came out, but I really like Android and it's integration with Chrome Browser.  I use a lot of Chrome extensions that make it a pleasure to use with an Android phone.I am a Google fan and many apps are important to me.  Google Voice, Tasks, Keep, Chrome to Phone, Gmail.  During my day, I check email on my phone, text via Google Voice on my desktop Chrome browser.  I also like youtube.  I don't do much social media such as Facebook/Twitter.  I'm not a gamer either.  I rarely use navigation as my sense of direction is pretty good, and I don't drive into unfamiliar territory very often.  GPS is not of great importance to me, but it's nice to have when I need it.Likes (in no particular order):- Price.  What else can one get for $100 or less?- WP8 is smooth, fast, no lagging, responsive, and stable.  I've had a couple random reboots when an app crashed (UC Browser)- FM radio!!! with Amber/GDR2 release.  I enjoy listening to local talk radio.  Also, in an emergency situation where the cell towers may be overloaded, an FM radio may be essential and the only way to get critical information.- Reasonable syncing with Google Contacts and Calendar- Size.  Although I do like phablets and screens > 4.7\", when I'm at work, it fits in my pocket.  However, I do plan to get a larger phone.- Wifi and Bluetooth radios are excellent.  The 80211.n wireless is very stable.  No dropped connections.  On Speedtest, I get up to 30 mps down and 4 mps up with Charter cable.  The bluetooth reliably connects to my Hyundai's bluetooth with no issue for over a month.  With my iPhone 3G, there were times that the phone would not connect, and I would get this annoying \"pairing failed\" message that would not stop.  I would have to turn the bluetooth off on the phone, and reconnect.  No so with the Lumia.  No dropped connections.  It pairs with my Windows Vista laptop, and can stream music, send and receive files easily.  That is one feature missing on iPhones (being able to send/receive files via Bluetooth.  Also pairs with my Plantronics 320 headset easily.- Supersensitive screen.  I can use ferromagnetic objects to tap, scroll and swipe.- Easy drop and drag of music and ringtones by connecting the phone to a computer via the included USB data cable.  I can easily add custom ringtones by dragging to the ringtones folder.- Decent mapping/navigation app.  I like how Here Drive displays your speed and alerts you if you drive above a set limit.  The GPS finds a signal quickly, better than my prior SG3.- Camera can be used while the phone is locked by pressing the dedicated camera button.- Battery life is decent.  I charge the phone overnight, and at the end of the work day, it's often at about 60-70%.  I check email, light browsing throught the day.  I don't do much calling because my office does not get a good cell signal.  I just had one incident of rapid battery drain for some unknown reason.  It was at 24% at lunch (I didn't charge it overnight), and  then dead a couple hours later.  I don't know how it happened.  BTW, I have wifi/bluetooth always on, screen set on medium brightness, and double tap to wake disabled.- User replaceable battery and expandable memory via microSD card.- 4G (technically 3.5G with HSPA+) has been speedy enough for me, but I use wifi mostly.- Works with AT&T; postpaid.  I popped the SIM in the phone, and got 4G/data right away.  As I understand, it may work with other AT&T; MVNO's without unlocking.- AT&T; unlocked it for me!  No problems.  I called customer service, gave them my IMEI #, and in a little while, I was given the unlock code.  I am a Premier Member and have been an AT&T;/Cingular customer for 11 years.- Customizable back covers.  I plan on getting a red battery cover.  Red looks sharp to me.Dislikes- Screen is a fingerprint magnet- App selection, for me, is poor.  It's not Nokia's fault and I knew that prior to purchasing the phone.  With time, I'm hoping that the selection will improve, and that Google will develop some more apps.  Some of the 3rd party equivalents just aren't as good.  For example, Goroovester is inferior to Google Play.  I used multiple browsers on Android.  I wish Flipboard and Google Current was available as I enjoy those.  Banking apps such as USAA and VALIC have no WP8 apps.  I probably could go to the mobile website.- App quality is often inferior to the Android equivalent.  Skype, a Microsoft product, is better on Android than WP8, in my opinion.  WTF???  On Android, I can send files and images.  WP8, absolutely not.  Not a deal breaker, but Skype was purchased by MS.  I do like to check traffic before going home, but Nokia Here maps don't often report traffic incidents and conditions as accurately as other platforms.  I compared it to my wife's iPhone 4 (Apple maps and Google maps), which reported incidents that were absent on Nokia Here Maps.- No Adobe flash support.- No wireless file transfer (save bluetooth), but on Android, there's ES File Explorer and Airdrop.- Personal preference, but I'm not a huge file of the Tile look/GUI.  I prefer icons and widgets as on Android.- Camera quality is OK, but not great.  It serves its purpose for pics I use for eBay/Craigslist, and sending to family.  I realize that this is an entry level phone.- No notification center (A WP8 issue more so than the the Lumia 520).  I know that others have said that you can arrange the tiles so everything important is near the top.  However, a notification would give all my important info at a quick glance.  Besides, some of the live tiles do not update constantly, but rather every 30 minutes.- Lack of customization.  On Android, I like being able to have individual email accounts give a notification sound and others silent.  On WP8, that isn't possible.  I hope that is something Microsoft will add in a future update.  Also, I'd like to be able to have the volume set differently for specific apps rather than one master volume.Lack of a front facing camera, camera flash or NFC is not an issue for me as I didn't use it on my SG3.I miss my Android, but for the last 5+ weeks, I have been able to survive on WP8.  The platform and app selection will likely improve as the Lumia 520/521 has probably added a lot of new WP8 users.  I will keep the Lumia as my backup phone and media player once I get a new Android.  Overall, this is a very nice phone, but as a Google user, it doesn't work for me as well.I think this is a great phone for new smartphone users.

This is a feature packed phone for the price. For under one hundred dollars, users get a great smart phone on a great network and in addition, no one is locked down to a two year contract. I tried to cover as much as i could in the video review, but due to file size limitations, i maxed out if i exceed a three minute video review. I am a huge Windows OS fan. I think their OS is great and offers users a different experience. It is NOT the most exciting OS out there, but at the same time, it is a very solid OS and runs very smoothly. It is not a battery hog or glitchy like the Android OS. My pros and cons are below. I know my cons list might be a bit long, but remember that you are getting a lot for the price and there is only so many cons because it is on the AT&T; network. Get the better model for the T-Mobile network instead. Feel free to ask me any questions and i'll be happy to respond.Pros:- Price (A smartphone under one hundred dollars and no contract)- 4G (HSPA Plus Network no 4G LTE but faster than 3G)- Built in Wi-Fi- Mobile HotSpot Feature- Windows OS- Features packed smart phone for the price- LCD display (LCD is brighter than AMOLED displays)- Expandable memory up to 64GB via micro SD card- 720P Video recording on the phones built in camcorderCons:- No HD display- Display is 4 inches (5.2 inches would be perfect)- No front facing camera for video chats- A larger battery- Not a 13 megapixel camera- No flash on the camera- No Starbucks or Hangouts App yet- No 4G LTE (Runs on HSPA Plus which is faster than 3G)- Price (A smartphone under one hundred dollars and no contract)- AT&T; Network is not that reliable and very conjested- AT&T; plans are a bit expensive- No Wi-Fi Calling (T-Mobile version has wi-fi calling)- No 1080P Video recording", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "a great smartphone for budget conscious folks!", "Author": "Jonathan Hefner", "ReviewID": "RZSEUGCG2PFJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I love Windows Phone. I admit it. I bought this phone as a back up to my lumia 920. Having had to recently send my 920 in to be fixed (dust under the front camera), I find myself using this phone every day, and I absolutely don't mind! There are features from my 920 that I miss, but otherwise the 520 is more than up to the task at hand. Also, this phone takes pretty good pictures, considering it has no LED flash. Low light pics come out pretty decent too!This phone is locked to the AT&T; network, which means you can use it on an pre-paid service that uses AT&T;'s network, such as GoPhone, AIO Wireless, Red Pocket Mobile, H20, Consumer Cellular, Straight Talk/Net10, and others. I also managed to get an unlock code for this phone and have successfully used it on T-mobile as well.If you are looking for a cheap smartphone, then this is the phone for you.

Her contract is not quite up yet, so I decided to get her the Lumia 520 as a temporary phone. My wife, who loves her iPhone has really started to like this phone. It does almost everything that her iPhone, does something's better and some other not as well. But when you consider that this phone is only $100 CONTRACT FREE, and she can use a feature rich OS, charge the phone every alternate day, stream music on Bluetooth, navigate using offline maps, listen to the latest songs for free using Nokia music, this is just an awesome package.Now my wife is seriously considering getting a Lumia 1020 instead of the new iPhone that will be released in September", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Uh oh its CARRIER LOCKED what do I do with it!", "Author": "MWebb", "ReviewID": "R34NHZCCGYUEEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you made the mistake of purchasing this phone thinking to use it overseas, or on TMobile over here, and just discovered it is \"locked\" to AT&T; (even though you own it and thought \"no contract\" meant \"unlocked\"), there are still a lot of useful things to do with, apart from fuming:1. Out of the box, insert battery, power it up, and go to Settings.2. Set \"Airplane Mode\".3. Power off, remove battery, insert the provided GoPhone SIM.  - The SIM is essential for downloading Nokia Here Maps, which are GREAT.4. Go to Settings, turn on WiFi mode. Don't turn off Airplane Mode! Leave it the way you set it in step 2.  - Airplane Mode keeps the phone from searching for a cellular carrier and forcing you to activate the phone.5. There are some advantages to having a Microsoft Outlook free email account. Go to outlook <dot> com and get a free account if you don't already have one.6. Go to Settings and add some Accounts:  - Microsoft (your new or existing Outlook account).  - Nokia (for free and purchased apps from the Store).  - Google, FaceBook, Yahoo! Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, IBM Notes Traveler, and generic POP and IMAP accounts are your other choices.7. While in Settings use the \"left arrow\" a permanent below-the-screen left arrow to move back to the main Settings menu and set Brightness to High with no automatic control. This works best except in dim settings like on an airplane with lights out, where I use Low for Kindle reading.8. On the same first page of Settings, scroll down to Phone Update and check for system updates. You should already have the \"Black\" update set, 8.1 will come out in a couple of months. Check about once a week.9. Apps will update too, a number will appear on the Live Tile for Store. Sometimes important updates like FaceBook are announced but the Store won't auto update right away - you can force an update by searching for that app, then clicking on it, and clicking manually on the update bar that appears.10. Download these apps (my favorites, YMMV):  - WhatsApp, Line, Viber. Or your favorite message/free phone call solution.  - Most of these require an active phone number to work. If you use your other phone's number, that will erase your account on that other phone, when you use the text supplied PIN to activate on the Lumia 520. That might change someday, but for now linkage to phone numbers is a limitation.  - Skype. Works REALLY well on the Lumia 520.  - Kindle. Works so-so. I read a couple of books inflight so it isn't screen sharpness that is the problem. The problem is a little Amazon software funkiness that occasionally cuts off a line or two of text between pages. To fix, rotate from book orientation to landscape to read your text then rotate back. The rotation seems to fix the problem.  - Facebook. Fine for consumption, not so fine for editing your posts or comments. Much improved over last year.  - Facebook MESSENGER. Yes, it is a separate app, and more and more people use it, is a good substitutes for WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and Facebook doesn't care how many devices you have it on. A mature product on Lumia 520. Be sure to pay attention to the little delta wing that rats out your location - default is on, so you WILL be tracked by friends and frenemies. Well tracked when you answer a message.11. From the home screen - press the Home soft button on the bottom of the screen - flick the screen to the left to see the list of apps, all the apps, and open HERE Maps.  - Choose your state and download your map.  - Going to Dublin? etc? download that map. The maps don't take up a lot of space.  - Yes, GPS works without cellular service, so long as you downloaded the map. Remember, the maps won't download if you didn't put your SIM card in (you can remove it later, but why bother?).12. Some good exercise apps that work well with the LOUD speaker on this tiny phone:  - 7 Minute Scientific.  - Tabatas.13. For music:  - Because it has the necessary licenses from MicroSoft, 64gb and even 128gb micro SD's fit and work fine. I use a 64gb to hold almost all my music.  - It will play current iTunes tracks fine (everything except the early DRM digital rights management copy protected tunes), mp3. it will not play Ogg Vorbis.  - The player is called Music & Videos and comes stock; until updates, it might appear as Nokia Music or as xBox, Nokia Mix Radio is a separate app which provides free streaming music from Nokia. Very cool!REMEMBER, all this is WITHOUT cellular phone service!You have a camera, music player, GPS unit, e-reader, and minimalist web browser, all in a $60 or so package! And the option of using it to back up your AT&T; and AT&T; driven phone service, if you need it.SHORTCOMINGS:1. Due to the 512mb memory limitation, app switching is painfully slow. NOT unusably slow, but by modern standards PITA slow.2. A few games and rare apps won't run in a 512mb footprint. Before you go ballistic on this memory limitation, keep in mind the iPad 2 and original Mini are both 512mb. Like Apple, though, MicroSoft uses compiled code for its apps - more efficient - than Android, which \"compiles code\" on the fly via an interpreter - hence Android needs faster processors and more RAM (but in current editions and with modern hardware, Android is plenty fast).3. This is DVD resolution, not HD. It is 800x480, not one of the higher resolutions. The type looks crisp, not pixelated, but you don't get as much information per screen on websites or Kindle, and the screen - for resolution AND quality reasons - isn't good for serious video watching.4. No front camera. This is a BIGGIE for many selfie fans. On the rear, no FLASH but the camera DOES autofocus. I don't like flash, I prefer natural light even if the picture goes grainy etc. so I'm ok with this.UNEXPECTED SURPRISE:1. The battery life is absolutely incredible, with cellular radio turned off via the Airplane Mode switch.2. Nokia continues to roll out major software updates for this amazing little helper - even Win Phone 8.1 is coming to the 520, which means being able to run apps from the uSD card and, finally, being able to set ringer and music volumes separately (saves ears, that).So I've found plenty of uses for my Lumia 520, even if it isn't good for travel or TMob. I wish it were unlocked, and would have paid more for an unlocked one from Nokia (if they sold unlocked phones direct, like Google and Motorola and Apple do), but my buyer's mistake hasn't turned into buyer's remorse.You will be blown away by the design, looks, and quality of this little bargain.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value and functionality", "Author": "CanesFan", "ReviewID": "R1H28ZAPM3L53V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My background...I've used webOs (palm pre), iOS (iPhone 3GS, 4), android (Nexus 4, 5), and now the windows 8 (Nokia Lumia 520).

It features excellent build quality and a great no contract price.  I happen to have a contract with AT&T; and I simply put my sim card in this phone and I was up and running.  It doesn't do LTE speeds, but the faux 4G is good enough.Windows Phone gets a bad rap for lack of apps, and in some cases it is true.  There is no Google support, so if you use Google Voice, you have to do it in the browser.  Gmail can be checked with the built-in email client.  Other than the lack of Google support, most of the big name apps I use are there.  I'm missing Nest, but I can also do that in the browser.If you want to, you can pin webpages, such as Google Voice or Nest to the Start screen and they essentially act as apps (albeit in the browser).This phone is fast enough.  It isn't lacking in speed, as Windows Phone is seemingly optimized for Microsoft's minimum requirements.  You'll see it repeated in tech blogs and videos, and it is true.  Windows Phone feels the same no matter if you are on a 1Ghz dual-core processor (like this phone) or the more expensive models, which are 1.5 Ghz dual-core.  The new 1520 is a quad-core 2.2Ghz.  It will be interesting to see if a quad-core 2.2 Ghz processor makes a difference.Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by the entire package here.  It has enough speed, a very nice screen, and (mostly) all of the apps I use for an incredible price.  It also feels very comfortable in-hand.  If you are curious about Windows Phone, this is the perfect phone.  If you are on a budget, this is the perfect phone.  If you need a backup phone, this is the perfect phone.

The windows app store is not right there with apple or android app store but it offers most of the commonly used apps such as Pandora, you tube, whats app, wechat, Facebook, Google maps, etc.2. Nice and smooth browsing experience. Its just $70 and it makes you feel like you have a high end phone.3. The Nokia apps for GPS and music are freaking awesome. Music browsing features and associated options are very user-friendly. Nokia music app lets the user to create his own music mixes while also letting the user to download up to four mixes which can be used offline. Isn't it awesome, huh?4. Storage: This phone comes with 8 GB on-board storage capacity, which is good for storing as many apps that a regular person could use. Moreover, it supports micro SD cards up to 64 GB, which is humongous to store loads of music.5. The only thing i would have preferred to have is a high capacity battery. This phone is equipped with a 1430 mAh battery which could last no more than one day. I wish it had a higher capacity battery, and wouldn't have regretted paying $15-20 for that.

I purchased this phone after destroying my expensive HTC one X.1. The phone will do an online backup, but after a resetting the phone, you only have one chance after the first reboot to restore your phone.  The problem is that you have to use your phones data plan to do the restore and since you have to change the APN setting to use straight talk, you will not be able to do a restore.  If the phone isn't unlocked, then you will have to borrow a SIM card from someone with AT&t; so you can connect to the internet and download the restore.2. The restore doesn't remember how you have your tiles positioned.  A lot of time can be spent organizing tiles.3.  AT&T; has the internet sharing locked down on my phone.

I was a die-hard Android fan and was displeased at the prospect of giving up my \"preferred\" platform......until I sat down and actually USED it.I got this phone as my personal device the other day and it's been a gem like the other 2 Windows Phones I've had. So what if it doesn't have a 100-megapixel camera, 32-core processor, 64 GB of RAM, etc....my point is that Windows Phone doesn't NEED all that hardware to run properly (except for the camera if your only camera is your phone, but you can get a better camera with other Nokia models ;)).Windows Phone doesn't come with TouchWhizz, MotoBlunder, HTC NonSense or any of that other bloatware, and runs very well without that stuff bogging it down like it does with most Android devices. Windows Phone isn't twitchy, touchy or glitchy like Android and doesn't have thousands of non-sensical unvetted garbage apps that don't work properly either (or conflict with the operating system). I haven't had any issues with my Windows phones acting like they're possessed (i.e. starting stuff up on their  own without user intervention), haven't had to restart my phone because of a misbehaving app, and haven't had to pull the battery because it's frozen up.....EVER. My Windows phones have just worked, period, without fuss, and this one's no exception. Windows phones get their updates directly from Microsoft, without having to go through the manufacturer and carrier first. All Windows Phones operate the same; no learning curve when you switch phones. Best of all, they're as easy to use as an iPhone, and can be a whole lot cheaper.Windows Phone also comes with some nice features built-in that would need to be downloaded on an Android phone via the Play Store. A mobile version of Microsoft Office is preinstalled, so no downloading ThinkFree Office to view or edit your Word and Excel files. Bing search includes a song-identification feature and barcode/QR code scanner; no need to download SoundHound or barcode scanner apps, as on an Android device. When you register your Windows Phone on windowsphone.com using your Windows Live (hotmail.com, live.com or outlook.com) account, you're able to view the content of your SkyDrive--pictures and documents (7 GB free storage for as long as you have your Windows Live account) from any computer connected to the internet. If you lose your phone, you can find it via GPS, make it ring, lock it, or erase the contents of the phone all from the windowsphone.com site. Again, all this is BUILT IN; no need to go download a bunch of apps to get that functionality. If you don't have a Windows Live account, you can create one using your existing email account if you want. Microsoft doesn't force you to get a Hotmail email address like Google forces you to get a Gmail address for Android phones. Syncing your music and pictures with your Windows 7/8 or Macintosh computer is a snap; no \"drag and drop,\" it automatically downloads your pictures into your pictures folder and you can choose what music you want to sync and it happens automatically.One built-in app that's worth special mention is \"Local Scout.\" For travelers, this can be a lifesaver. Local Scout uses your phone's GPS to tell you what's near you, like restaurants, attractions, and places to shop. All you have to do is to tap on a business or attraction name and you can navigate to that business or attraction, call them, add them to your favourites and more, without leaving the app.I guess what I'm saying is that if you want something as a playtoy and don't mind the fragmentation, frustration, glitches, force-closes, and misbehaving apps, then by all means, go get that 100-megapixel, 32-core, 64 GB RAM Android phone....it's gonna need all that hardware! However, if you want something that is useful, has a lot of built-in features, easy, doesn't fuss or fight with you, is fluid and smooth, and just plain works, then get a Windows Phone. If you want a great Windows Phone on a budget, get this one. It won't disappoint you.Edit: It's been a few weeks since I've bought this device for personal use and it still runs like a champ. Recently, I had to switch my work device to a Galaxy S3 and this Nokia runs rings around the GS3, even though the GS3 has a better processor and 4 times the RAM. As soon as work is over, the GS3 gets put away and I switch back to my Nokia 520, and I'm happy again. I get 3 days out of this Nokia; the GS3 won't last a day without charging it.Second Edit (6/7/2014): I downloaded the developer preview for Windows Phone 8.1 on this device and it works beautifully. Yes, great things are coming to Windows Phone, as the general release for WP 8.1 won't be out until summertime. WP 8.1 brings a notification bar that you can swipe down, showing missed calls, emails and texts, as well as toggle switches for wi-fi, bluetooth, airplane mode and screen rotation; you can also set a background wallpaper that shows through your live tiles; and the most important feature......CORTANA! Yes, Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Siri (Cortana works a whole lot better too) is even available for use on the \"lowly\" Nokia 520. You have to be a US resident for Cortana to work in the developer preview, no word yet if Cortana will be available outside the US in the official WP 8.1 release. Cortana takes the place of Local Scout, but with Cortana, Local Scout is no longer needed. Cortana even understands some sequential requests.....something Siri can't do. I put her up against Siri on an iPhone 5S and Cortana outperformed Siri by a comfortable margin.Budget-minded fans take note: When Windows Phone 8.1 comes out this summer, you'll have the best features at an off-contract price that can't be beat.

I start at 3 as a base-line. Secondly I want to disclose that I was never a full-blown smartphone user. I text a little, listen to music a lot and make a few calls and if I need to use the internet I just go someplace there's Wi-fi. Therefore, according to America's cellphone providers and manufacturers, I don't deserve much of a mobile phone in the first place. And that's mostly fine with me.My first GoPhone was a keyboard Pantech that had a microSD slot for MP3s. One Christmas though I inherited an iPhone 3GS on its last legs and I was somewhat converted. I resolved to get an actual smartphone once it finally met its maker, however AT&T;'s GoPhone selection almost always consisted of grocery store flip phones and AT&T-rebranded-Chinese; Android knockoffs. Eventually they rotated the Lumia 520 and Samsung Galaxy \"Express\" into the lineup - and I took the 520 because I could afford $100 (August 2013 price) rather than the Galaxy's $250.Pros:-Slick design. Not too long to get adjusted to Windows Phone's button scheme from iOS.-This thing has survived more than a few nasty battery-ejecting drops including on concrete with the screen intact!-Easy to use and intuitive interface, Metro is all it's cracked up to be on Windows Phone.-I like the contact manager, especially when it comes to linking e-mail contacts with phone and social network ones given all the nicknames people use on Twitter, Facebook, etc. I probably use the e-mail client more than I use the one on my PC.Cons I Can Excuse Because It's A Baseline Phone:-This phone can get SLOW when you have enough apps running, plus the 8GB is already 1/4 used with \"system files\" which may or may not include the usual bloatware after updates. Be sure to clear out \"temporary\" files every now and then, and store your music and photos on a microSD card instead.-Not that many apps for it, because it's obviously not iOS or Android. The ones I do find tend to be stripped-down versions, no wonder some of them aren't even advertised alongside \"Available on App Store/Google Play.\" Fortunately this is compensated for by IE (of all apps), which can run many equivalent sites in desktop mode almost as good as using it on a desktop.-No front camera. The rear-mounted camera takes decent photos but uploads them to SkyDrive at a measly and highly unusual 750x1150 resolution. It's also slightly hit-and-miss simply tapping the screen to auto-focus and shoot, about 20% of photos I take tend to focus badly with that method.Cons:-Nokia MixRadio is straight up bloatware and grinds this phone to a halt. I just use the Xbox-\"branded\" generic music player and Pandora if I want streaming music.-Speaking of bloatware, my Windows 7 PC recommends I download this utterly unsatisfactory Windows Phone app for transferring files. Dragging-and-dropping files works just fine, as well as Windows Media Player syncing, thank you very much.-I bought a new microSD card for it recently and it apparently lumped everything I transferred from the previous card into the Other storage category, rendering it unplayable despite formatting the card. I actually had to hard-reset the phone to get it to work and I'm thankful I had app backups enabled.-YouTube. The videos are fine but it's one of those supposed apps that's really a link to the website, and I have to switch IE to mobile mode because apparently the phone doesn't have an updated Flash Player for desktop mode - which is the only way some videos will play, apparently. Why?-Virtually every video I've ever taken that's longer than 5 seconds is unplayable though take that with a grain of salt since my aforementioned previous memory card was a non-branded \"Class 10\" POS.To summarize, it's actually quite packed for a GoPhone at a great baseline smartphone price and not too shabby for a starter. If you're not too into the world of smartphones but still want its capabilities, you won't go too wrong with it unless Windows Phone goes the way of Blackberry (which given Microsoft's deep pockets won't be for a while.)", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "gave my daughter a phone", "Author": "Stev", "ReviewID": "R1MBC8W8TC60RK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "boredom is an ugly thing.a few weeks ago, while bored, i was trolling through amazon looking for an prepaid android phone to play with. the only ones i could find for cheap ran an ancient version, so i wasn\u2019t really interested. but i did run across a nokia 520 att phone for 50$. this, as it turns out, is currently the most popular windows phone. i decided to give it a shot.so, it arrives. i open the package, and find that not only is it a pay as you go phone, it is an assemble as you go phone. the battery, sim card, and back case all need to be added. i decided that i didn\u2019t want to deal with the phone part now, so i just installed the battery, and put on the back of the case, and turned it on.sure, it whined to me about the missing sim card, but seemed willing to continue. it booted up, and told me that it needed to finish installing itself. wow. the iPhones i have been getting do something like this too, but this took me back to the last time i installed windows.now the interface during this point is very old school windows. black background, white square outline buttons, but interestingly, no windows, just messages and buttons floating at the top of the screen. it foozles around for a few minutes, and then tells me it needs to finish, and it just sits there.it sits there for 5 minutes. not obviously doing anything. at this point, i assume it is upset because the sim card is missing, and it doesn\u2019t know what to do. i turn the phone off, open the back, remove the battery, and install the sim card, and put it back together. i turn it on, and the windows phone tile interface appears.now the interface is interesting. you are presented a screen with tiles all over it. there are two sizes of square tiles, small and large, where large is the same space as a square of 4 smalls, and the gaps between the tiles. you can delete tiles, and the interface leaves the space blank, until there is blank space all the way across. when this happens the interface squeezes out the blank row. you can scroll up and down through the tiles. if you can\u2019t find what you want, you can push the tiles to the left, and get a list of all the applications on the phone, consisting of smaller tiles with a name printed next to them. this list you cannot edit, and includes all the crap that both nokia and att added to the phone.for the first day, the phone behaved oddly. items in the system menu did not seem to work, taking me to a blank screen, and then dumping me back. there was no way to find out various things about the phone, like the IMEI number, or even the option of finding the phone\u2019s phone number.some of the nokia apps didn\u2019t work since i didn\u2019t have a nokia account. the nokia maps app would not work because i was not willing to let it use my current location.the app store needs an email account, and seems biased for a MS Live account. i decided to go ahead and get one, since i didn\u2019t want to use my other email addresses here anyway. now, Live won\u2019t give you an email account unless you already have an email account. they maintain it is so that they can email you if the account becomes compromised. i suppose it never occurred to them that i might not have another email account. so, after thrashing around for a bit, i decided to try and create a hotmail account. as it turns out, i guess hotmail accounts don\u2019t get compromised, since they didn\u2019t require another email address. i gave the new hotmail account to Live as my second email address, and it was fine with it.amusingly enough, when i entered them into the email application on the phone, it coalesced them into one account. with the Live email address. at first i thought that i had screwed it up, but when i tried to add the hotmail address again, it told me that was already there, even though i don\u2019t seem to be able to access it.aaaannnnyyyyyway, this allowed me to log into the windows app store. the app store is interesting in that it sort of follows a combination of the tiles interface and the list interface in a confusing jumble. i never figured out how to search the store. i did, however, find minesweeper, the one thing i really miss from windows. since it was free, i purchased it, and it started to download. i also purchased preview copies of one or two other games. they were all downloading.three hours later, they had not finished, not one of them. the system app told me that while the system had take up about 5 gig of the  8 on my phone, the rest was empty.the next morning, still without minesweeper, i played around some more. one thing that was available in the system app was the opportunity to return the phone to factory settings. i gave it a shot. i plugged it in, and hit the reset. when it got to the screen telling me that there was more configuring to, i walked away, and came back about 10 minutes later. it was still right there, with nothing to tell me that it wasn\u2019t hung, but i just walked away again. an hour later, when i came back, it showed me the tile interface.the system application had about \u2153 more options, including the ones i was interested in. the mail app loaded my two email addresses, and the store app downloaded my three games quickly without issue.clearly, i had f***ed the phone over turning it off to put the sim card in. clearly, that is my fault. i will also compliment the windows team that a broken installation worked as well as it did. i do find fault, however, that an install could fail to complete and not be noticed when it rebooted. clearly, there were substantial pieces missing, and there was no error reporting to the user about it. there was also no feedback that something was happening during the install. if it is going to sit there blankly for 30 seconds, i suppose i can understand that. if it is going to take more than 10 minutes, it should provide some useful feedback.first, the hardware:pluses:the phone feels crisp and fast, and the screen is bright and sharp.the phone vibrates for a fraction of a second to let you know that it read your touch of one of the capacitance buttons on the front.minuses:the resolution is not great (while i did buy a cheap phone, it is also their best seller, and this is the introduction people are going to get).all the real buttons are on one side. the power/wake button is between the volume buttons and the camera shutter button. all are the same shape.no forward facing camera.and second the software:the UI is classic microsoft. interesting where they paid attention (the tile interface), and cluttered and inconsistent where they didn\u2019t (like the system application). rather than buy into the tile interface completely, they include a listing of the applications on the side just a swipe away. the screen includes a capacitance \u201cback\u201d button, which behaves inconsistently, sometimes moving you backwards inside the application, and sometimes backwards through the applications, depending where you start. if you are in email, the button will run you up levels until you reach the top, and then jump you back to the tile interface. if you are in internet explorer, it will just go back through web pages, including pages from previous sessions. there is a button of stacked lines that appears in a lot of applications. unfortunately, it not only means different things between applications, it sometimes means different things inside the same application, depending on where you are. some messages are presented by darkening the screen, and floating some white text near the top, with one of those classic square white outline buttons to press.if this was the way the iPhone looked when it was released, it would have gone nowhere. microsoft has something interesting here, but they need to forget the desktop for a moment and give a raging a***ole with a vision and  an OCD complex the power to fix it and make it consistent and usable.in the end, i bought a 25$ go phone card. by enabling the phone on their web site, and using the phone card, i was able to enable the phone with 250 minutes of talk, and unlimited text, for 25$ per month. no data is included, but i don\u2019t care. i am under the impression that since it is now set up like that, i can add it to my att account as a feature phone, for 10$ per month, again with no data.i gave it

For $99, you get the basic experience of a Windows Phone minus the high CPU capability for games.  This is fine if you have another gaming device or tablet, so for me, this was a no brainer.Windows Phone does what you need simply and without much hassle.  Bluetooth works great and with Win8Phone, it plays the audio from your videos over bluetooth with no noticeable lag for me.  Connection to Microsoft Exchange accounts is seemless (I've connected to my work Exchange server and my Office365 Exchange server with no problems).  Calendar sync, email sync, and contacts sync works well also.This is not a super fast phone but I don't necessarily need that.  I had a Nokia 820 and this is along those lines but just a little slower.  I got used to it fairly quickly.One good thing about this phone is the micro SD card slot which takes a 64GB Micro SD card without blinking.  No issues there.  Built-in GPS navigation is provided with the HERE apps.  Xbox music works fairly well also and if you need to sync the music with your PC, you can just copy the files onto your SD card by taking it out and putting it in your computer or just use ANY audio sync software (except for Zune) to do that.  I use MediaMonkey which works out of the box since this uses regular MTP.Sound quality is fairly good and unlike other devices, this plays the absolutely superb WMA Pro 24-bit format (48kHz/44.1kHz only though with 2 channels, but still that's something) just like every other Microsoft music player (Zune).  It can announce caller ID, incoming SMS, it has voice control also which is great for hands free SMS reading and replying to people.  I used it once while driving with a bluetooth headset and didn't need to find the phone or push any buttons.  My bluetooth headset was in my ear and I could hear the SMS text and reply back.  It's not a published feature, but there is a setting on the phone to turn that on under Speech and Ease of Access in Settings.Still, compared to low priced Android phones, this one just works great.

H2O and Straight Talk are AT&T; resellers (=MVNOs), and are much more reasonable.This phone body may be used with H2O and Straight Talk without unlocking, which since November 2013 is very expensive. H2O gives you unlimited talk and text + 50  MB data for $30.00/month. Straight Talk gives you the same deal, but with 100 MB data.

As a previous iPhone (3G and 4) and Android (Galaxy S3) user, I figured I'd give WP a shot. Bought it, threw in my AT&T; sim and was good to go. I bought this because I broke too many phones this year to warrant spending any more real cash on a new phone.My 5 star rating is mostly about the Windows Phone operating system more than it is about the actual device. The device itself is OK, though it lacks some features  I prefer to have. My biggest gripes are there's no front facing camera and there's no flash in the rear camera. That aside, the phone is light, feels solid, and has a bright, clear screen. The device to price ratio is exceptional though.I must say, I'm impressed. The OS runs very smooth and the live tiles are fun to configure to your taste. It's easy to nagivate and to configure the settings. Apps launch quickly. The battery life is decent on this phone - better than the S3, and maybe slightly less that the iPhone. Having a bunch of Live Tiles can also drain your battery, though I found on the Android platform, I always had to switch off bluetooth/nav/etc. in order to preserve battery life. That's not the case with this. Unfortunately, there really is a lack of Apps for WP when you compare to iOS or Android. However, your basic apps are all here - facebook, twitter, instagram, pandora, what's app, (a good 3rd party) snapchat client, etc. There's plenty to keep me entertained, and this is really the only drawback of WP I can find. I'm running WP8.0 at the tiem of this writing and am looking forward to 8.1's release.Overall, at $50-60, this is a great introduction to WP or if you're looking for a cheap replacement phone until your contract is up. Would I buy this again? YES. When my contract is up for renewal, am I going to buy a brand new shiny Windows Phone? Quite possibly - this thing is growing on me.

Best $40 purchase ever.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Using it for entertainment, not as a phone.", "Author": "Quiet time", "ReviewID": "R830FGCR1WKZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just took over ownership of this Nokia Lumia 520 Windows 8 Phone from a close friend that had used it as his cell phone. He had trouble with reception in his mobile home and used up a bunch of data before he realized there is a toggle to turn data off when not needed. Generally unhappy with his choice, he offered it to me and replaced it with a basic cell phone. I, on the other hand, was looking for an MP4 player with a decent screen, lots of storage capability and easily played converted MP4 movies. After spending months eyeballing and searching the web for such a critter, I found out that many smart phones have these attributes and don't require a phone service to operate. Wi-Fi is the key for activity outside the MP3 & 4 functions! Since we have wireless in our house ... Bingo! Hot spots may also be helpful.As far as this device goes I couldn't imagine anything being so functional and enjoyable than what Nokia and Microsoft has offered! Every day for a week now I have tried everything I can think of to experiment with its capabilities and have yet to be disappointed.To start, the IPS screen is phenomenal. Of course it's small, but every movie, video, picture, even streamed Netflix, are all crystal clear. Haven't tried watching outside in bright sunlight because if I'm outside in bright sunlight I should be doing something other than watching movies. I've been able to read from a Kindle app I downloaded on it and email isn't a problem, though I use my actual Kindle for most reading (they out perform anything for reading).The sound volume took me by surprise when using it without ear buds or head phones. Does the job clearly. For quality listening though, the head phones were the best. Sometimes that matters, sometimes it doesn't, the choices are wide open though. No, it doesn't have a fancy equalizer and such, but have you noticed it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars to buy?The OS, Windows Phone 8 (WP8), gave me a challenge to work with as it was my first experience. I have W7 on my laptop and have been holding out going to this next version like so many others. Change for the sake of change without a need for change isn't my first choice. Knowing W8 was developed for the touch-screen industry I just didn't feel the need to change. Now that I have had time with this WP8, I'm liking it more and more. Very customizable. Because I can still be very visual, I miss the little pictures (icons) used for W7 and my android devices. However the tiles seem to keep things simplified and \"clean\" looking, so I can understand some of its attraction. The screen commands have been very stable and consistent. No jitters or jags. Zooms smoothly and is very fast to respond generally. Once in a while there may be a slight lag downloading, loading an unread Kindle book or some other task, but not troublesome in my opinion. The smoothness of all the transitions make it a pleasure to operate in.I'll also note, as have others, it is very easy to access the battery and sd card. Pay attention to the \"instructions\". Hold your fingernail on a top corner between the screen and back, then push in the middle of the back until it pops opens. When closing, be sure to stay away from the buttons! Jamming will occur.I guess the battery life is par for the coarse, but I tend to compare to my Toshiba Ultrabook and Kindle. They are both mega-hour lasters and shouldn't be used for comparison. I have watched 2 & 3 hour movies and still had over 80% left (Wi-Fi off). On the good side it charges really fast, whether from the laptop usb or the wall charger, so with a little diligence I should stay in the clear of a dead device. I've heard of phones getting really hot but haven't noticed that during those long movies I've watched so far.All-in-all, I am really, really happy with this new tech-toy! May try it as a phone someday, but for now I'll be enjoying it's pocket/mobile entertainment qualities (maybe like an ipod?) that far exceeded all my expectations! And what a great value for the price. Or a Big Bang for the Buck! Hope your time is as rewarding as mine ... Thanks.(4-17-14 UPDATE) - Now that I've played with my Lumia 520 for a while I would like to throw some caution to you music lovers. The sound is still great for my needs but 2 issues have surfaced. On a minor scale, the \"sound\" (adjusts equalizer, etc.) found under \"settings\" is not functional on this model, though it and the Nokia website says it is. All you can do in advanced mode is silence the ringer if you turn it face down. No equalizer.On a major scale, songs will duplicate themselves both in menu and while playing. Even songs I love get old when heard 3-5 times in a row because of this malfunction, so multiply that by every song on some albums and you might agree that it is unnerving at best . My research with Nokia and MS support sites show no updates yet to fix this complaint that is well documented in many threads of Q&A;'s. They also indicate it has nothing to do with the hardware, but seems inherent with the WP8 platform. Just thought I'd throw out a warning and save you 6+ hours of figuring out what went wrong. One fix for me was to remove the sd card, delete the songs/albums being repeated, then drag and drop the individual file/folder of music back in, not using the 'sync' in Media Player or the WP8 PC app. This means taking apart the phone, etc. each time and not a preferred way of doing business.Besides this glitch, I'm still loving my toy with it's decent battery life, clear screen and simple controls. BTW; I added a silicon skin for minor protection and it eliminated accidental activation of the power, volume and camera buttons. Guess I'm easily pleased ... Thanks.(5-17-14, another UPDATE) Two big changes have taken place.1) Because of the trouble with my music files I found an unusual solution. Check the WP website for the Windows App Developer app, apply for it, and then you'll qualify for the WP 8.1 web developer preview version. \"No going back\" they warn, if you choose this method. \"System warranties will be disqualified\" they also warn. But I took the chance. Over-all I spent nearly 3 hours with downloading updates via our slow dsl line, reformatting, re-doing some settings , etc., but glad I did. Look up the additions that are included with this new OS to see if you want to risk the early use of it. Eventually it will be publicly available for you patient people. It eliminated the file duplications on my music, some apps are working even better now and it allows 3 medium size tiles on your start screen of this phone. Not a game changer, but something I quickly took advantage of. There's more but I won't go there.2) I just found a phone service plan that will work perfectly for my limited mobile phone use. H2O wirelessnow. Amazon's FiestaCellPhones store offered the SIM starter pack for a penny (no shipping) and H2O has a pay-as-you-go plan for as low as $10 for 90 days service. It works out to $40/yr for 800 minutes or 400 mg of data. They use AT&T; towers throughout the country (supposedly) and as you may know, this Lumia 520 is sold with an AT&T; goPhone SIM card. Works Great! Same reception we had with our little goPhone with the addition of using this Wonderful Windows Phone and the Super Nokia apps. Now I'm even using it as a cell phone/smartphone too!

Probably bought by Samsung from some North Korean sweatshop... a true scam of a phone... read my review if you want a laugh.A lot of what I like about this phone is the Windows O/S... so simple and user friendly... very thoughtful layout and operation.  Every I-Phone and Samsung owner my wife has shown her (cheap) Lumia to has said they will buy one of these.  I won't go through all of the features, I just want to say they work, they are easy and logical and quick.I'm sure I'll add more to this review as I continue to marvel at it... it's at least 1000 times better than my old Samsung side slider and half the price!Oh... forgot to mention the good service at ATT when I had them set my phone up with the same number I had before. (since the old phone was dumb, not smart, I couldn't just swap sim cards). I had a hard time finding the right number to call, but the tech (name Ty) was so helpful and so kind, taking as much time as I needed to magnify the tiny numbers on the sim card, looking for the mislaid back cover so I could turn it on, etc.  Thank you so much ATT....OK a little confusion to me because I was originally told these phones would do wifi even if you've never turned on AT&T; data service... that's TRUE, but my router had to be changed before I could do it... something to do with static dns, which I don't understand much about, but my savvy brother helped me get it going.  I don't really need internet on my phone though because our home has a desktop, a chromebook and two Tab 3s :)  Maybe someday I'll be somewhere that I need internet and there's wifi available, but I can't really foresee that.Favorite feature:  (not that I advocate driving and using a cellphone) ... but you don't even have to look at your phone to make a call, just press the windows button at the center bottom, it beeps, then say \"Call (Name)\" and the phone voice responds \"Calling (Name)\"... ring ring talk talk, eyes on the road.UPDATE:  Still very pleased with this phone and discovering new features every week.

Also fair to point out that this device retails for about $150 in the rest of the world. I think, had it been priced globally for $59 like here, it would be the world's best selling phone of all times.Now having rubbed in the affordability of the proposition, let's look at what it has to offer:- Genuine high quality Nokia smartphone. (And those US-run-Finns know how to make quality products that appeal to the US market.) The device is just beautifully made with nothing to complain about.- Robust to drops even without a protective case. Having used it for a month I realized that I had dropped the phone so many times on hard surfaces (including pavement and bathroom tile) and it is still fine aside from minor scratches around the edges. I know my iPhone bearing friends broke their screen this way. Nokia Lumia 520 just pops the back cover off and keeps safe.- Size it a perfect fit in your hand and it's slim too. Nice to grip in a call or hold while tapping away an email.- A great introduction to Windows Phone 8 (key reason I got it). WP8 is notorious for great integration with Microsoft Outlook service and I really wanted to try it out without getting stuck with the device for two years or committing $699 for a \"contract free\" top tier Lumia.- The device has MicroSD slot so for another $36 I got a 64Gb memory card and effectively got more storage than the largest iPod Touch to put most of my music collection on it.- The battery is removable, and while there is no reason you would want to swap it often as the charge last a full day of use, it is useful to have that functionality to swap the battery (removable BL-5J) and keep going in case you plan to be away from outlets for more than a day. I have a separate charging stand for Nokia batteries (DT-33) that can top off spares.- And last but not least, this holiday season as most places get wintery cold, you can keep your gloves on and still use the touch screen. Tested and it works!Bottom line: for under $100 you get a device functionally comparable to a 64Gb iPod that can also make calls and access high-speed LTE data. And no monthly commitment required.UPDATE: After about one month of usage I'd like to add that the quality of the DSP (digital sound processor) put into it by Nokia is terrific!!! It is clear, more or less powerful to drive common cans (headphones), and has crisp trebles and substantial lows.Surprisingly plugging in my Fiio headphone amplifier does very little to improve on the great base line this phone has.

In the event that you grip the phone tightly and push against the rear cover, the battery will lose its connection and turn off the phone. To fix this simply bend the leads down, and they will maintain a constant connection.The second issue is the lack of a built in compass, initially i was unsure how this would effect day to day use. Basically what it boils down to is that the phone has GPS so it can tell you where you are, but without a compass it cant give you turn by turn directions. In fact most apps will simply quit when the navigation icon is clicked.Aside from these two things the phone is amazing for the price, if someone told me two years ago that I could buy a dual core smart phone from a retailer for $85 including tax I would've called them a liar.

I was an original iphone adopter and stuck with it for years of upgrades, then switched to Android with a HTC One X. Unfortunately, my HTC died on my 17 months into my contract. That left me trying to decide if I wanted to pay my ETF and switch carriers, or pay a hefty upgrade fee, or just get an el cheapo phone until something else came up (like the next Galaxy Nexus which may be offered at a cheap price). I went to my local AT&T; to see what the cheap options were and it was a pretty bad set of choices. Generic flip phones that are useful to just make calls (I need IM and web capability for work). And an android phone for $80 that was terrible, laggy and slow. And then there was this phone.I don't know how they do it. My only guess is that this phone is sold at a loss in an attempt to lure you to windows mobile. I can't fathom how they could build this phone and sell it for $100. No, it's not an amazing phone, but it's a darn good one especially for $100. None of the specs are top notch, obviously, but it works and it works well. It's responsive, fast and reasonably good looking. Replaceable battery and SD card slot? Most android phones aren't even doing that anymore. Oh hey, bluetooth AND 4G?!?!?! Woah baby.My only real gripes are with the OS. If this is your first smartphone you'll probably have no complaints. If, however, you're coming from Android or iOS, you'll notice the lack of apps in the app store. Yes the big things are there, but if you're heavily invested in google service you'll probably be disappointed. On the plus side, the native tools sync with google contacts, mail and calendar pretty darn well. But google music, maps, keep, etc? No sir (there are some apps that work ok-ish). Also compared to Android there are a distinct lack of web browsers (there are a few, but they all use the same IE engine it looks like, no firefox or chrome), alternate keyboards, mail clients, SMS clients, etc etc.But bottom line, for $99 it will get the job done and do it pretty well.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just getting it out of the box made me smile!

Like WOW, it blew my mind when I got it out of the box considering I came from the Huawei Fusion 2 which is only $10 cheaper and is cheap to the touch and smaller. The screen is nice and vibrant, and the fact that you can change the temperature of it is SO cool! The glass will drive you nuts at first, but you'll get over it soon enough. The back cover is rubbery and soft, easily replaceable with another color later on, feels great in your hands. The buttons on the side are pretty weird, but you'll learn to love them. The dedicated camera button is a nice touch, but I find the power button on the middle a bit weird.Flipping it over to automatically silence is is a GENIUS feature!Going from the iPhone 4, to the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, to the Huawei Fusion 2, to this, I can definitely say that 4\" is the sweet spot for my preference in screens.The live tiles are pretty cool too, more useful on here than Android widgets are on a phone. I have the 627.AM on the top and it has my alarm time, the weather conditions, and tasks all in one small space. The apps are so nice on this screen too. I actually find flipping through the menus much faster than wiping to the menu and tapping on what you want. And unlike on Windows, Internet Explorer is great on this. Love the shortcuts I can pin too!The picture quality is WOW too. I took a picture of a tree through a fence (my dad asked me since he was trimming the branches from it), and I was on the other side of the wire fence. Well, the fence was in focus, but then my dad and the tree were blurred. LOVE that! I'd rather have that than a flash any day! Best camera I've used by FAR for just the focus alone. The photo apps on the app marketplace are awesome aswell. Lots of goodies to edit them with.My Jot Pro stylus also works fine with it.Overall I'm very happy with this phone. Syncing it with my Mac is a breeze. Android is a really nice OS, but on low end devices, it's a no go. You'll be happier with this one vs any of the other GoPhone options because it's so much smoother and the bloat is completely removable, just find it in the list, hold and uninstall.

The \u201cSIMM\u201d area on the card is exactly the same mini-SIMM and Standard size SIMM so you just need to trim off the extra plastic.The speaker is very loud with the speaker port uncovered but put your finger over the hole and you can cut the volume down to nothing.  The reason I tell you this is that you need to keep that in mind when you purchase a case or cover.  I found a great cover for the phone here on amazon.. it\u2019s the Dual Tone Skin Fit Case Cover for Nokia Lumia 520 and it fits great and makes the phone much easier to hold.

When I'm out and about, I have no use for data but do use the phone quite a bit on wifi when I'm at home.I love the tile setup on the phone and the ability to change colors of the tiles.  You can rearrange however you want (the tiles can do 3 different sizes).  There's also an app that you can install so that allows you to group apps together in folders.  You can use your own wallpaper for the lock screen.  Apparently there's a way to shuffle between favorited pictures but I've not figured that out yet.I was in between this phone and the Moto G.  The Moto G doesn't have expandable memory but the Lumia 520 does.  I purchased a 32 Gig card to expand and the phone has 8 Gigs of internal (which comes down to around 6 accounting for the OS itself).  I still have a ton of space and will likely never use it all.The Nokia Radio is my favorite app that comes preinstalled on the phone.  Having a mix of offline music works great for me.  The sound that comes from this when playing music is excellent...I didn't expect it to get very loud but it's perfect.  You can go up to 30 but I usually have it set around 15ish (I listen to it when I go to bed) and it's more than enough for me.The picture quality is great as well.

I even ordered one but then had Amazon recall the order before it was delivered.  The problem was I just couldn't bring myself to sign another two year contract for something I wasn't certain I would not regret purchasing for the length of the contract.  Nothing out there in late 2013 and early 2014 fit the bill - for me.I looked at this little Lumia 520 and after reading a number of reviews decided to spend $60 and test drive it. The upside of owning the phone outright and it's reputed performance far outweighed having a device with a larger screen and higher specs. So far, I am quite impressed.  I really need a phone for email, calendar, some music, a few key apps, maps, and making calls.  I am not one to stare at my phone or obsessively check it every idle moment.  This little Lumia delivers on all accounts with a very intuitive and eye friendly user interface.  I love the live tiles and the ability to put everything right where I want it to be.  The settings give me enough control and once you get the hang of the OS it really is very intuitive.Some other pros:  Very decent battery life.  Nice form factor. Fluid and responsive OS that behaves predictably and isn't constantly pestering me to download an update for everything.  It was $60 and NO CONTRACT!  I already have a plan with AT&T; so I just took it in to a store and they gladly put in a micro SIM for me. Phone calls are well balanced and clear.  The user interface for making calls is refined and uncluttered.  The added value of the included Nokia apps is also a significant plus, i.e., the ability to use maps offline with a great GPS.  The ability to easily delete AT&T; bloatware - without rooting!  The latest and greatest updates from both Microsoft and Nokia!  And, finally, I love the baked in integration of MS Office.Some cons:  I really wish Microsoft would move away from requiring that all the buttons be located along the right side of the device.  At least move the power button to the top.  The camera, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is adequate.  The screen is somewhat reflective. It is not Gorilla Glass, but it is very bright and clear and you can adjust the tone and white balance of the screen.Honestly, if Windows phone literally had just a few key apps (not big name ones - niche apps that I use frequently) I would have zero hesitation about going all in for a Windows phone - probably a Lumia 1520. In fact, I may go for it anyway and try to come up with an acceptable workaround. It's a great OS for people who want to use their phone and not constantly fuss and tinker with it.  I need my phone to get things done, I don't want it to be an all consuming distraction.  I guess that's the difference I notice with Windows phone over Android (my last phone), I am more productive due to not always needing to tweak it.  I like that, its a better fit for me.

My trusty zune music player finally died, I was considering buying an IPOD TOUCH, they are nice but also close to 400 bucks.  I use ITUNES and the Windows Phone syncher to get podcasts and music on the nokia 520.  This works great!.  I heard that to activate this as a phone on ATT (on a regular \"non-GO phone account\") you are required to add a data plan.  I dont know if thats true or not, I'l stop at the ATT store one day and find out for myself.  So what I do is carry my no frills cell phone AND the nokia 520 with me wherever I go.  My wife has an apple Iphone with data plan, so if we are out and about and need to access the internet we just use hers.  So I cant really justify to myself the additional 30.00 per month for a data plan (for my own usage).  Another neat use for the nokia 520 is to use it as a wifi device at home or while you are out and about (wifi is more and more prevalent in places like Starbucks, Mc Donalds, Sams Club etc.) App selection is not  as varied as Android or Apple devices, but its getting there.  The phone has a built in web browser that works great.  Another nice feature is the ability to search bing using spoken search terms (like SIRI on apple iphone and the google search feature on android).Out of the box, the 8GB of built in memory goes quick, so I bought a 64 GB microSD memory card, now I can store tons of music and podcasts on the NOKIA 520!battery life is average, if you use the onboard gps, it seems like battery life is used up much quicker.  but smartphones nowadays all have batteries that are used up fairly quickly because of the many features smartphones have.Thanks for reading my review.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy from AT & T", "Author": "rachel burgess", "ReviewID": "R1NYT0VEX917N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased my phone from Amazon for 30 less than AT & T.

I've never seen it happen with any other product. Bottom line this phone is one of the best ones you can get right now. We use the straight talk service and it works great and they even now offer the 4g service so that's amazing! Its 3 times as good as the 100 dollar plus phones out there with many more features. So if you are looking for a fast, reliable, fun and sharp new unlocked, smart phone that won't break your bank account. Get this one! Try and wait for it to drop to at least the 59 range which it does. Still baffled by the price fluctuations on this though. FYI if you will be using this on the straight talk network make sure you buy the AT&T; micro SIM card thru straight talk or get it at Walmart for 7 dollars. Once you either switch your number thru that or creat a new one you will need to reset your VPN settings. The instructions are included with the micro SIM card. If you already have a micro SIM card you use thru straight talk you should be able to just use that. Enjoy the phone :)", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazed!

The transition was abrupt but reasonable, iOS has a stockpile of apps. But because of iTunes lock, music and bluetooth just don't like iOS. I have been on the lookout for a new unlocked device and still with the pain of a new Nexus device, I didn't want to pay out again, until I saw this holiday deal.Keep in mind my expectations were very low, of all the review of Windows Mobile OS and the market reaction being mildly negative, but for $60 why not give it a shot. So I'm not expecting a retina screen, super fast GPU etc.I am blown away by this device. I can't say if it is WP8 or Lumia, but as a lover of UI and design, I am very impressed by the fluidity of the device, the seamless integration of apps etc.Big wins:- Google Voice integration. MetroTalk rocks. iPhone sucked at this.- Music, both Nokia MixRadio and Xbox Music are very very good. Makes up for what I missed from Google Play Music. The iOS app just didn't figure out offline syncing, it sucked my cellular data constantly.- Live tiles and shortcuts. I love this stuff, we all have favourite things we do within all of our apps, let me make dynamic shortcuts to them! Very very good. Now I have a live tile of movie showings in my area. Awesome!- UI. Much better than Android. Seamless power management. Nokia(or Microsoft) has done a lot with less hardware. Very impressed.- Phonebook integration and social integration is excellent. Nokia devices always did excellent at this.\u00a0- Apparently office integration.. haven't tried it yet so I'll see..Some misses:- Misses apps like Stitcher, Aha and\u00a0- Existing apps like Kindle need update love- IE is very fast and fluid, I give them kudos to that, but c'mon guys look at Chrome mobile.

I used to have top of the line phone for many years until my most recent phone was damaged due to water.  I was expecting this phone to just get me by with maps, podcasts, and minor browsing.  I can say I am extremely happy with the Lumia 520.  It is very fast, has a great user experience, excellent navigation and maps, and vibrant colors.The 512 mb of ram may seem low but Windows Phone OS uses it wisely.  Websites load fast due to the dual core processor and I experience no lag when zooming in and out.  The screen resolution is not as high as my last phone, but with the screen being only 4 inches and the general user interface of windows phone, I feel like I'm viewing an HD device.  The material and design of the phone on my matte black version is very high quality and gives a unibody feel and appearance.The only cons I experience with this phone is the lack of camera flash and non-backlit bottom 3 keys.  The  flash I can completely live without because I don't take photos, though it would be nice to be able to use this as a flashlight if needed.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and consider it a steal.

This function is currently available on Verizon and T-Mobile but instead AT&T; offers a bookmark to their \"MyAT&T;\" page which actually makes you use your data to see how much you've used.To get this you will need to flash your phone with a CV (Country Variant) ROM, once you do this is done and you get all the goods. I won't get into the details of it but just know that it is an option and google can be your friend. This will certainly void your warranty (but flashing back to it's original ROM should right the ship so be sure to have that before you begin).Throw in a monthly unlimited Talk/Text and 500MB data plan for only $30 and I'm sold, I use Wi-Fi most of the time but if I needed unlimited data I could always upgrade to the $50 monthly.The difference between this phone and the T-Mo branded one (521) besides the $10-$20 price difference is that that phone is unlockable right out of the box, with this one you will have to wait for after at least six months of continuous service on AT&T.; This may be a deal breaker for some but not for me.

For those who are big YouTube watchers like myself, you cannot fast forward or rewind YouTube videos on this phone like you normally would on a PC but rather simply, keep hitting the fast forward button. At,first I didn't like that, but got used to it, so it fast towards by the minute. Also, camera is pretty darn good. It is a better camera than the iPod 4, that's for sure. Finally, battery life,lasts really long and charges quick. It is so convenient it even comes with a charging plug, so you can charge your hone by,a near by outlet.

Playing games beyond Ruzzle or Words by Post will the battery drain quickly (like Halo.) If I charge it in the morning a normal workday I will have maybe have 30-40% left by the end of the night.Talk/Text/Pics:The size and shape of makes it great to talk for long periods of time 2-3hrs. Less awkward than talking on the S3. Typing on the screen is getting easier with less mistakes but also I don't usually need to type much since it knows what sequence of words I use. Again I don't take many pictures but most pictures look pretty good and have good color balance. Definitely decent enough to post on social networks. Nokia Smart Cam is a great app.Apps:From some of the reviews I read, I don't think many people research the phone before buying it. If you are invested in Apple's or Google's ecosystem, then you will be disappointed. It wouldn't be any different if you were going from an Iphone to an Android phone.Using app discovery programs helped find quality apps (App Social, myAppfree.) Haven't had an issue with the lack of apps yet. Wish there were more choices of web browser as IE covers about 80% of my needs. UC Browser has a lot of features but is very buggy. The calendar is okay but like IE covers about 80% my needs. Been using Simple Calendar to get the other 20%. Haven't had an issue with syncing with my wife's google calendar.Like the People's feed more and more as well as the ability to create groups. Weave RSS reader is awesome. MyShopi (shopping app, crossplatform) replaced One Note and while it doesn't sync, the develop told me that the next version will. Using Bing for search has been fine for me but a big negative is that searching on the phone is not tied to MS Bing Rewards.Don't know why MS doesn't advertise it voice capabilities but you can answer and sent text by voice and search by voice for example. Haven't done too much with it but will probably start digging into it more. Also can translate using Bing Translator by voice, text or using your camera.Before buying the phone see what apps you need first. Just go to [...] and run a search for the apps you use.Conclusion:Great phone. Wish I had a data counter but using *777*1# been working out okay for me. There are limitations to this phone just like a multitude of other phones. It is a $100 no contract phone. It does not have all the apps that iOS or Android has. This is a locked phone but can be unlocked (haven't done but plenty have -- search \"how to unlock lumia 520\".) I see this phone as a phone that cost 1/6 the price of a flagship phone with maybe 80% of the features. See this review for more info ([...]By the way, Airvoice has been great so far. Good customer service and unlimited talk/text $30 (100MB data), $40 (1GB data) or $60 (3GB data.)Original 8/9/13:I was looking for a phone to use with one of AT&T; MNVOs, Airvoice Wireless. I am OS agnostic since this would be my first smartphone. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it is a great phone but I didn't want a contract or pay $600+ for a phone due to the nature of my job.Iphones new/used are expensive unless you get a very old version. Android phones less than $200 are flawed in one way or another (too slow, old version OS, bad battery life, etc.) Realistically only the Nexus 4 was acceptable to me.The Nokia Lumia 520 does most of what I need it to do. It had all the apps I needed except Out of Milk (I use One Note instead). The speakerphone works great, the call quality is good. Using the WP8 is much better than I read and is very easy to use and learn. So far every app/game I installed runs smooth. I really like how I can sync Facebook and twitter and get everything in one feed without installing either app.Battery life could be a little bit better but it does last all day and while I don't use a phone to take pictures but it doesn't have flash or a front facing camera to use for Skype.This phone or the 521 are the best phones for under $200 if they fit your requirements.Overall a great phone", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reformed android user", "Author": "Jeremy Lowe", "ReviewID": "R15223F5RS97WT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone competes with a Samsung Galaxy S3 performance wise.  I found this hard to believe because the specs on hardware are no where near that of the most popular android phones.  The operating system has much less lag and glitches compared to android.  One of the reasons is windows standardizes everything.  This helps make a more uniform experience and causes less conflicting OS issues.  Windows also requires a hardware min requirement for the phones.  This model has the bare min of 512 MB so you won't be able to run all the apps but most of them.  The screen of this phone is the same as the high and much more expensive 600 series.  The screen (turned on brightest in settings) performs well in outdoor sunlight.  The speaker lets you turn on the music and enjoy a very high quality.  The phone also comes with a ton of standard apps which save money and come as a nice package.  I would check with friends who use ATT on the 4G HSPA+ network ( Not LTE!) before buying.  The area I live in does not have their backhaul capability.  So they said I would get 15 meg downloads...

There is a battery shipped with the phone as well. The phone also includes a Mini Sim (or micro sim, whatever) which is what this phone requires. The phone also has expandable memory via a MicroSD card of up to 32 GB with an internal storage of around 6 GB of usable space. Pretty good if you ask me. Please note the Nokia Lumia 520 does not include a MicroSD card. You can also remove the back cover of the phone as well as the battery and such.The phone runs on Windows 8 OS, and it's very sleek and simple for the average phone user; however, similar to Android it has a decent amount of customization (although not to the extend of Android.) The live tile system is quite nice to look at and the OS is rather intuitive. There is little to no lag whilst using the phone for everyday uses, but some apps may run a bit slower as this phone doesn't have the best specifications. The camera is 5 MP I believe, however there is no camera above the screen, nor is there a flash on the back side of the phone.All in all, this phone is very cost effective for what you are paying. You can use it as a primary smart phone, or a backup phone in cases of emergencies. It functions very well and gives you a very good taste of what the W8 OS has to offer.Some problems or cons this phone has:- The headphone jack may be faulty on your phone. I had to ship one of mine back because both the headphone jack and the charging port stopped working correctly for some reason- Odd screen feeling. It doesn't feel like the high-end smartphones, and in my experience my finger doesn't slide across the screen as easily and creates more smudges. Perhaps it's just me.- No flash or front-facing cameraI hope I've helped anyone that had any questions or concerns about purchasing this phone. Again, I would recommend this phone  to anyone looking for a nice GoPhone without running you or your family into poverty. The support at Amazon is great whenever I had to return my phone. I would buy this for a young child's first phone or something similar, as this is an extremely safe purchase at the low price in the event that it gets lost or broken.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone for the price & great for people upgrading from feature phones!", "Author": "Deeps", "ReviewID": "R2BK666UAHS6Q8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It costs as much as a feature phone and is worth so much more!I was looking for an uncomplicated smartphone for my parents who seem to be all satisfied with a feature phone. I wanted to get them something that they can easily catch-up and be as simple as possible. Ofcourse, iPhone will probably fit that requirement better but they wont need that many apps and its too expensive for their type of usage.Before I could recommend this phone to my parents, I decided to get one for myself to try it out. Being a smartphone geek that I am, guess I needed a reason to try another phone anyway :)Here is what I feel about the Lumia 520 and a little bit on the Windows Phone OS itself without going into their detailed technical specs:Fit and finish: It is a well made phone and something that I'd like to hold it in my hands.Touchscreen: I found it to be responsive and didnt miss my touch inputs any time.Ease of use: This comment applies more to the Windows Phone OS rather than this Lumia phone. If you are really looking for a smartphone with a simple operation, this is what it is. There are no multitude of \"screens\" with apps on all those screens. All apps are on a single page that scrolls vertically. If you dont have hundreds of apps, this is a really good user interface.Availability of apps: Again, a Windows OS related comment: There is no doubt that iphones and android phones have the best availability of apps. Microsoft is catching up and I find that if not the very same app, I have always found other apps that has met my need.Tiles: I like that I can resize the size of the apps and that they can display some information on them even before opening them. I also like this feature so I can resize the tiles in a different way and change how my phone looks! Its like having a different face anytime I feel like it! Its like not getting bored looking at the same looking screen of the phone.Data transfer: While I like the iPhone in many ways, i find it irritating that I have to use iTunes to transfer files from my PC. And, this is where I find this phone very easy to perform data transfers. I prefer to just connect the phone to the USB port, drag and drop any files I want to transfer and be done with it.Cons:* No front facing camera. I have had little use of the front facing camera, but as it is almost a standard on a smartphone these days, this could be classified as a missing feature.* The keypad (virtual keyboard) could be improved. I dont have big fingers but still I end up pressing the near by keys more frequently than my iPhone. I do also like the way the auto-correction works on my iPhone so much better than this one.* Apps and their access rights: (Windows phone OS) I would like to have the option of choosing what type of access (contacts, photos, GPS, etc.) I would like to provide to a specific app myself. May be, then this phone wouldnt be so simple...but this in my opinion is a very needed feature. If I choose not to let an app have GPS access, it wont even install the app on the phone. I think i am comparing this to an iPhone, but I think this feature should be on all smart phones.* Auto-dimming is not perfect: I can clearly observe the auto-dimming coming into effect and sometimes it does it a little brighter or dull. Nothing unusable, but could have been better.Before you get all worked up on the cons, note that these are minor ones and remember this is not a high-end smart phone and you did not pay a whole lot of money to get this one too. I can definitely live with these cons.All in all, I highly recommend this smartphone for the following type of users:* You dont need a high-end smartphone* You dont want to spend a whole lot on a smartphone* You are upgrading from a feature phone and want to take it slowly* You wont be using hundreds of apps* You dont need this phone for video chattingNote: I use an iPhone for regular use and this is my backup phone that always stays in my backpack.

My previous Go Phone, an AT&T; Fusion 2 (Android OS) smart-phone was a great deal at $40 bucks, but its operation was somewhat sluggish, and I decided to take a chance with this Windows phone.The FEEL of the phone is much higher quality than you are going to get with other non-contract phones at this price-point. This is easily the nicest build of any model of Go Phone that I've put my hands on. The Nokia 520's hardware is powerful enough to run everything very smoothly; I was able to noticeably recognize its superiority over the Fusion 2 instantly. Nokia's \"Transfer My Data\" app was able to very easily import all of my contacts from my microSD card (I had previously exported all of my contact information to the SD card using the Android phone). Thus, I was up and running very quickly.Some more tidbits:-A problem that I've had with three previous Android phones was that the volume of my media files was consistently weak--this phone pumps the volume when you want it!-Many people (including myself) probably look at the Windows home screen and see a lot of junk. The things that you don't like can be easily unpinned or resized. It is not difficult to set up a home screen that will suit your desires.-Another problem I've had with ALL Android phones is that they come loaded with many junk apps that cannot be uninstalled. I was able to uninstall ALL junk apps from this Nokia Windows phone without any fuss, a MAJOR plus for me.For someone like myself, who primarily uses their cell-phone to text, read emails, listen to music, and browse the internet, I cannot observe anything wrong with this phone. The build quality is FANTASTIC for a $50 dollar phone and given the rapidity of obsolescence for any contemporary digital device, I cannot justify spending over $100 on a telephone. I have been an Android user for several years, and I still enjoy using that operating system on my tablet, for which I feel Android is better suited. When using my tablet, there are a number of apps (bit-torrents, comic book readers, game-system emulators, etc.) that are not available for this phone. For me, this is a non-issue. I don't care to do my reading, gaming, and other such activities on a tiny phone display.

The ability to store to an SD card is coming in the Windows Phone 8.1 update.  The Nokia drive app is awesome- and it does not use data- unless you want traffic.  When you do get traffic- it is a minimal amount of data.  One thing to note- since I am on wifi almost the entire time I use the phone- I had planned on not getting data.  It turns out there are two areas you need data- one to be notified you have a message and for receiving texts from certain phones.

I've had a flip phone, a QWERTY keyboard Blackberry-type phone, and an Android smartphone. This is probably the best of the lot, easily accessible, really good photo and sound quality (both of which the Android lacked, even though it was $50 more).Issues: it breaks very, very easily. I dropped it, in a solid protective case, on the carpeted floor of my dorm room and the screen shattered despite the phone falling back-side-up. Apparently that messed it up pretty badly, because I am unable to \"end\" phone calls - the screen goes black and doesn't respond when making a phone call.(Which makes angrily hanging up on someone just not possible. My mother is delighted that I can't furiously hang up on her any more. Curse you, Nokia!)Limited accessories - good-quality cases are hard to find, as are screen protectors.The power button has basically fallen off - I know that wasn't due to the fall, as it seems that's a common issue with this phone.I don't have a contract with AT&T; so I'm just going to buy a new type of this phone, get a more expensive case, and find some way to not drop it.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Need to know info for \"post-paid\" (AKA contract) plans and this phone", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R29L1E87LQ0KU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I really like this phone.  There is one semi-major flaw in its design - the power button is located on the side of the phone.  This makes the phone turn off in my pocket from time to time, which is annoying (and why I gave this phone four stars), but I'm ordering a belt-case, so in the end, it's not a big deal for me.  In addition, the price on this is great, so I'm not going to complain too much.********UPDATE: I discovered that it was not the power button being located on the side of the phone that was causing it to turn off.  Instead, the battery was a little loose, and if pressure was put on the phone in just the right way (apparently my pants pockets knew just what to do), the battery would lose contact and the phone would turn off.  EASY FIX - just cut a piece off of an index card, folded it a few times and wedged it between the battery and the case to ensure the battery had a tight fit.  Problem solved, phone hasn't cut off since.********Now, down to what a lot of you need to know: does/how does this phone work with a post-paid or contract plan?The following information comes from dealing with AT&T; customer service (which was incredibly helpful throughout this process).First of all, you can use this phone with a contract or post-paid plan.  At least they didn't stop me.Second, AT&T; **WILL** eventually add a data plan to your contract.  Their customer service rep told me that their system is designed to recognize smart phones and will automatically add a data plan to your line at some point.  A data plan IS REQUIRED for any smartphone on AT&T;'s network, so eventually, they will get to you.Third, you HAVE TO HAVE A DATA PLAN in order to send and receive picture or video messages with this phone.  If you are having trouble sending or receiving picture or video messages, go to settings --> cellular -->  turn data on.But here is the good news.  AT&T; recently released a new plan, called the Mobile Share Plan, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and a set amount of data to share between up to 10 devices.  You can find this plan on their website, but I will say that it SAVED ME MONEY compared to my old \"family-share\" plan and I went from having around 700 minutes a month to UNLIMITED.  So, needless to say, it was a win-win for my family.The real kicker of upgrading to the Mobile Share Plan is that IT DOES **NOT** REQUIRE A NEW CONTRACT - which is important for me, as my family was all out of contract.  If you upgrade a phone through AT&T;, you will have to enter a 2-year agreement in order to get the discounted price on the phone, but if you are already out of contract, you can switch to this new plan without entering a new agreement.Finally, the amount of data is variable with the Mobile Share Plan, but it is SHARED, so you don't have to buy multiple data plans.  We went with the smallest amount (300 mb) to save money and because we plan on using mostly Wi-fi with this phone.Also, as an aside - this phone takes a micro-sim card.  If you have a contract plan, you will have to pick one of these up from your local AT&T; store.  You can have them activate it at the store, but this requires the phone's IMEI number (located under the battery).  I wasn't sure if there would be an issue since this is a \"go phone,\" so I decided to call AT&T;'s customer service line to activate my new sim card instead.I bought this phone because I wanted to use the smartphone features on wi-fi, not realizing that I would be required to get a data plan.  Thankfully, I ended up saving money in the end and getting unlimited talk in the process.

The battery in the phone she currently had was dying so often and impossible to replace making this the perfect gift.  The lower price of this phone made it an appealing offer should we decide to dump AT&T; at a later date, and much much cheaper than an unlocked phone.What I most like about this phone is the simplicity of the user interface.  I upgraded my mom's computer to Windows 8 last year so she was able to get familiar with this phone real quick.  The live tiles are easy to move, position, and understand.  This phone has everything you need at start up: Office, Onenote, Offline maps and much more.  I was able to download the Facebook app and Kindle for Windows Phone app from the marketplace with ease.  She was most impressed with the voice feature for calling and sending text messages.  The best feature I like about this phone is you can turn off cellular data, and only use Wi-Fi, meaning you don't have to sign up for an extra data plan if you don't want to.Everything you could need is in the box: The Nokia Lumia 520, Power adapter and charging cable, user guide and setup info, and a SIM card ready for activation.Window's phones are not for everyone, but if you like the user interface of Windows 8, this phone might be for you.

You do have to be still as the pics will blur a lot easier, but again, the phone is only $60. The only negatives that I can come up with (right now) are these 2: 1 - no flash means no flashlight. 2- it uses a micro-sim card so I had to switch my old sim over (no problems there, ATT was very friendly and helpful in this manner). This could be a problem though as if this phone dies, I can't just put the sim in one of my old phones and use it. To fix this problem, I will just get another Lumia 520 as a back-up.

I use this as a personal media device, GPS recorder, backup camera, and GPS navigator. I haven't used the phone features yet so I will not be reviewing those.Hardware:For being the lowest-end Lumia model, the user experience is surprisingly fluid. My 3yo Android Captivate kept frustrating me by struggling to respond to my input, but the 520 responds almost instantly and there's no lag in the animations - it's a pleasure to use.Not a single issue with the GPS, it's worked every single time so far (I've been using it to record my bike commutes and hikes). Love that I can hold the camera button and go into the camera without fumbling with the screen - even if I have gloves on, that's a big win right there. The image quality is so-so, you won't be printing any of these, but I didn't expect anything great. However, the best camera is the one you have with you, and this one does work for capturing a moment and sharing it with friends/family.Software:Huge, huge nod to Nokia Maps. The device is worth the money just for this functionality alone. Free offline maps? Hell yes! OK, the maps may not be as detailed as Google's or OpenStreetMap's, but they do have POIs and they still work - and the Drive app works BETTER than a standalone Garmin unit I have (rant: why can't Garmin, in this day and age, fix their damn POI search algorithm - it never works!). The directions the Drive app gives are excellent, I have even been using it without looking at the screen, and it always gives timely, clear directions.Nokia Transit is also great for finding bus and train routes, and Nokia Radio is a nice little bonus, though the sound quality could be better. The default music player app is a little lacking in usability, so it takes away from using this device as a music player (but I haven't tried any 3rd-party apps yet). Sound quality is just fine.The email app is easy to use and the keyboard is not intrusive as it can sometimes be on Android. In fact, I prefer checking my email on my Windows device now, it feels a bit more business-oriented.I won't be reviewing the Windows Phone OS in great detail (yeah, not as many apps), but I'll just mention that having experience with Android and iOS, I like the live tiles better than having icons all over the screen - though I probably would want to group the tiles by folders.Overall, this phone is great as an entry-level Windows device, and definitely got me interested in a more serious Lumia with a better camera.

I decided that I was not going to spend the money on another one. Not sure how I always lose those things. Before searching them I decided to look at cheap smartphones to purchase as an alternative when I stumbled upon this guy. Yes it has only 8gb of internal memory. Big deal, I have a $15 16gb micro sd card (which I've had for years) and now I have 28gb of memory, less the pre-installed hardware. The phone will allow you to use up to a 64gb memory card! Not only can I achieve the same thing with this as I could an iPod Touch, but I didn't have to spend half as much. Having been an iPhone owner since 2009 I'm not sure I could use this as my primary phone, but for an mp3 player I couldn't be happier, intact I enjoy it more than I ever did any iPod. Why is that? Mostly because of the queuing system, I can play a song and then queue the upcoming songs I want to play. While the Windows app store is lacking there is enough to satisfy when I have an internet connection at home or on the go. I especially like the Text Me app that allows me to text even without the sim card, so long as I have an internet connection. This is a good piece of hardware and assuming that you're new to smartphones, needing a backup phone, or just looking for an alternative mp3 player, this device will suit you just fine.Update:Since having used the 520 as my mp3 player for a handful of months I decided to give it a try as my primary phone as well. My old iPhone 4 was beginning to show it's age so I switched my SIM card over to the 520. It was an adjustment but I've been pretty happy with it so far. Every week I find myself missing my iPhone less and less.The Windows app store does not provide a lot of reasonable options when compared to what you can get on an iPhone. I have been pleasantly surprised however with the apps that I have discovered. There is at least a third party version for most of the apps I used on my iPhone. You aren't likely to find the newest released apps for iOS and Android on WP8. It takes a while for their developers to send them over to the Windows Store. However, once they do make it they seem to run as good or better than their iOS counter part. Anyone who has tried to use the official Facebook app on the iPhone knows how slow and painful of an experience it provides. This is not the case for the Windows Phone version, at least not in my experience. For apps that don't have official support I have to rely heavily on third party apps to make up for their absence. I have found many of them to be better than official versions I used on my iPhone. While WP8 provides many versions, in one form or another, of most of the popular apps do note that you shouldn't be surprised to find that some simply don't exist on the platform yet. An example of this would be Wunderlist.The call quality is great and being able to use the touch screen with gloves is a plus while winter lingers on. The phone provides a very minimalist UI so the experience is great for anyone looking for simplicity. The OneDrive cloud storage is great. I've installed it on my Mac and haven't looked back to Dropbox or iCloud since I started using this device as my everyday phone. You wouldn't think that in today's market you could find such a great phone for under $100. I spent 5 years with an iPhone and the only thing I miss is the app store.

Battery life is stellar. The first charge pasted me 3 DAYS with the wifi and location services turned off. I also had batter saver on. As far as 3rd party apps, I am not a big app person. Even so, I found all the apps I needed: alarm.com, Wemo switch, nissan leaf, Audible and other random apps, whose existence kind of surprised me. If I broke this or lost it, I would buy another one in a heartbeat. For me, it really is the price. I'm sick and tired of subsidized phones that force you into contracts.

I think it is a great value.  I've had an iPhone and an Android.  This is my first Windows phone.  It seems to be pretty slick feature-wise though I am an atypical cell phone user--I only make a few calls and rely on my home wireless for internet access. I'm not an app freak so I'm satisfied--so far--with what is offered with the phone.It seems to have a nice variety of photo options although published reviews tell me I won't become the next Ansel Adams with this phone. I was able to take the Micro SD Card from my deceased Android phone and put it into this Windows phone without losing any photos. I didn't need any software to accomplish this.  The photos are even organized now by month & year.  I like the way the photo button slowly rotates through my actual stored photos on the main screen in between the several buttons.AT&T; activated the phone for no additional cost and doesn't require a data plan since it is a GoPhone.  I bought a  $2/day unlimited talk & text plan with a $25 initial refill that is good for 90 days.  By my count that is a minimum charge of $8.35 per month for talk & text (although that only equals 12 days of talk & text over 3 months.)(I asked for a phone number that hadn't been used for a long time to cut down on \"wrong numbers\" to the former owner of the number.  Incoming calls or text activate the $2 charge for that day. The AT&T; rep complied with my request.)For someone who uses the phone infrequently, my plan is a pretty good deal--certainly better than $40/$60 per month for talk& text plus $20 or more per month for a data plan.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best inexpensive smartphone on market today", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R2EFX2WCCDDEN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumia 520 is an excellent low-cost smartphone. It runs the easy-to-use and rock-solid Windows Phone 8 system, and unlike Android, WP does not track and keep tab on everything you do on your phone and then secretely spy on you.  The 4-inch screen is IPS and it has great viewing angles and fast response time.  Color reproduction is quite good if not 100% accurate yet (you get that on the Lumia 1520's new IPS screen).  The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.AT&T;'s GoPhone plans really suck and are not really good values, especially when compared with T-Mobile (our family also has a Lumia 521 for T-Mobile), but its network is lightyears ahead of T-Mobile's, so the trade-off is acceptable to me as I give this to my son and being able to make and receive calls is more important than anything else for a youngster like him.  Speaking of a phone for kids, Windows Phone's Kids' Corner feature is truly excellent.  It sandboxes apps and games you select for kids, and also disables to capacitive Search button at the bottom.A tip if you use Kids' Corner but want to let your kids browse the web: you can't add Internet Explorer to Kids' Corner, but you can download the free yet excellent UC Browser and add it to Kids' Corner.  Be sure to use Bing as your search engine as it does not invade your privacy as much as Google does, and you can turn off tracking entirely, again unlike with Google's services.  Bing also returns better search results than Google, and is extremely friendly for kids (save for the \"Trending today\" links on its homepage, but you can semi-hide them).This phone is super-light. The back cover is plastic and can be removed, which means two things: 1) you can replace the battery if you want, and 2) you can get a different-color cover if you want.  Be sure to get a replacement cover and/or a case specifically marked for the 520, as its cousin the 521 is slightly longer.  The 520 feels much lighter than the 521 for some reason, even though spec-wise it's not really that much lighter. Both are light, perfect for kids and any pocket.One more thing: to cut cost both this 520 and T-Mobile's 521 include only 512MB of RAM (plus 8GB of storage supplemented by MicroSD support).  Not all WP apps run on 512MB phones, although the vast majority do.  It's mostly a few games that required 1GB.  All the popular non-game apps and most games do run on 512MB phones.In summary, this is an excellent low-cost phone that actually beats most mid-range Android phones in quality and feature set.  It's also robust, and does not spy on you like Android.

Using the wifi, you apparently need to search and connect by tapping on it, such as open public. But might work without searching at an AT&T; area such as McD. I believe it might also store these in the memory. I've seen these around $59.00 on line and seriously thinking about buying another one for back up at that price. I bought a solid black rubber style back cover at an AT&T; store for $15.00. Glad I didn't buy the two toned 'gummy' generic one. I would recommend also buying a $100.00 ONE YEAR SERVICE card if you want it as an AT&T; gophone. Wmart might have these (somewhere) I only use BASIC service, but that option might NOT be available other than grandfathered or through an AT&T; store.

My current rollover is $109.00 I buy 90 day $25.00 cards. (Check the back of the card for 90 days) Having to buy one and refill BEFORE the end date is annoying and I always lose days every time, especially, if it's a week or so early.That's why it's best to buy a years service or even REFILL at an AT&T; store.

AT&T; GoPhone charges extra for data use overages while T-Mobile prepaid will throttle your data speed on the overage but doesn't charge extra for the overage.  Also, the 520 doesn't have the Data Sense app which is comes with Windows Phone 8 devices sold by other carriers.

Screen is slightly better in sunlight than my iPhone 4.  No noticable difference in colour (FYI, I'm not colour blind) compared to my iPhone.  Resolution, at the distance we look at the phone, shows no difference either.  Cover over the battery is a little cheap/flimsy, so I'm glad I picked up a case to protect it.  Put a 32 GB microSD card in it so he has plenty of space for video and photos.Wifi worked fine with no problem.

Most of the buyers of these phones throw the packing materials in the garbage, and some of them land on the sidewalk or street, or somewhere they are not supposed to be. The sharp edges of the packing are not child friendly, at times can be harmful.Using simple recycled paper boxes for packing the Gophones is not only the way to save the future of Earth. We have only one Earth. The future generation would like to see the planet the way it is now, or better and not polluted.The study says the hard plastics take more 20 years to decompose some of them stay forever.  Even the Earth has limited resources, not meant to last forever.  AT&T; can make great contribution by changing the way of the Gophone packing from hard plastic to paper boxes.Some of the prepaid mobile companies have already started using paper boxes.Save the Earth and Go eco-friendly.Thanks for your time.----------------------------their email address is attcustomercare@att.comThanks.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Henrietta Angelle", "ReviewID": "R3HVQ1PHV6J67N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought 4, and all 4 of us love this phone.

You still pay for the calls, but the quality of the service is far better.Potential buyers should also check with AT&T; to see if the phone has been updated with the latest GDR-2 update, and if not, whether they plan to release the update, and when.

No app-data can be stored on the expansion-card. No Map data, no PDF's.

The original version of the 520's \"Phone Storage\" Settings app had a specific option for storing Maps on the SD expansion card. So clearly there is no technical reason for this option to be removed.

As a long time Android user, I figured I would purchase this phone and a Moto G, but I'm not even giving serious consideration to the Moto G anymore. I think modern Android is fantastic, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the Lumia 520 was. Read on for my full review.My absolute rating for this device is a 4.5/5.Camera:When using the camera, you will find it to be better than expected. The low light performance is some of the best I've personally seen out of a smartphone camera, but you will encounter weird demosaicing issues that result in color banding sometimes. Overall, the camera is hit or miss. It can easily produce blurry, undefined photos, but if you hold it steady, you can get some very nice photos out of it. The shutter speeds just seems slow, which explains all of this except the occasional demosaic issue in low light. This camera is remarkable for a $70 phone and good for any affordable phone. The two stage shutter key is a nice touch, even if it is a bit mushy.Display:It may not be 720p, but it is still very nice. If you tilt the phone back so that you're looking at it with the bottom closer to your face than the top, you'll see a distinctive band of bright pixels at the top, but otherwise the display shows no light bleed or distinctive off angle discoloration. Saturation and primarily brightness suffer a bit when viewed off-angle, but color seems to stay fairly accurate.Battery:The battery life is excellent. If I stay connected to WiFi all day, I typically end each day with nearly 40% battery remaining. If I keep WiFi turned off, I'm still able to end the day with at least 25% left. \"Day\" here is defined as a 14 hour time span starting when the phone is removed from the charger. I have no complaints in this regard. The battery is removable as well. Obviously keeping the display on all day will make the battery life shorter, but know that it is easy to make it through a full day.Performance:Excellent. I have no issue multitasking, and the device is pleasant to use. Even Halo: Spartan Assault runs beautifully. Sometimes, Halo: Spartan Assault would hiccup for a moment right after loading a map, but it doesn't happen consistently, and it isn't noticeable unless you're really paying attention. Web browsing is very smooth, texting is a breeze with the ultrafast touchscreen keyboard built into Windows Phone.Call quality:Overall, no complaints here. It makes phone calls, and the calls are usually clear. The audio was muddy during one phone call, but it could be due to any number of external factors. Most calls sounded good, and I had no dropped calls.Build quality:This is one area that I have to complain about. Originally, it felt very solid in the hand and was excellent, but I've taken the back on and off too many times, apparently. The phone has developed an unsettling creaking by the buttons on the right side of the phone. I cannot stand creaking in a device. Replacing the back shell with a new one fixes the creaking completely, but it shouldn't be necessary. Either the microSD and microSIM slots should be accessible without removing the back cover, or the cover shouldn't be so frail. I can see no visible distortion or damage, but apparently the alignment is wrong by a few micrometers now and it can slip past the edge of the phone just far enough to squeak in a most annoying fashion. I recommend carefully doing everything in as few removals of the back as possible. The build quality truly is excellent, as long as it doesn't creak.Storage:The microSD slot provides ample opportunity to expand the mediocre 8GB of internal storage. However, that doesn't help when Spotfiy can only use the internal storage, and when Nokia Here can only download maps to internal storage. If I could put my Spotify music on the microSD card, I would be perfectly content with the storage situation. This is absurd. We're talking about a change in file paths being all that stands in my way. This should be fixed, yesterday.Overall, an excellent device I have no trouble recommending to anyone.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone for a great price and it works great on straight talk", "Author": "Derek B.

It would be hard to recommend this phone if you had to take a two year contract to get it.But for no contract and $70? Incredible. A steal. It is cheaper than a lot of mp3 players. And a hell of a lot better. You get a camera, GPS, web browser, internet radio, FM radio, smartphone apps (just don't expect a lot of games), full media player, including video. You even get a micro-sd slot, so you can turn an 8 gb phone into a 40 gb phone for about $15 dollars extra.And, of course, it is also a very cheap phone, if you add minutes to it. $25 a month provides basic service, a pretty good deal.I will say that the battery issues are pretty annoying.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1C3KSUW8ET704", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When considering the Lumia 520, you have to take into consideration its price.  Some reviews will knock it for not having a front-facing camera, or for its comparatively low-resolution screen, but those comparisons are really unfair.  If you go to a Ford dealership to buy a car, you don't expect to be driving away in a Ferrari, so anyone looking at phones in this price range needs to be honest in their expectations.What Nokia has done is to create a phone that works spectacularly and prices it as a budget model.  And they've done that very, very well.  This little phone does everything that most $200+ (off-contract pricing) phones can do and does most of those things at least as well if not better.  A typical Android phone priced at less than $150 tends to have some major compromises, the primary one being performance.  Apple doesn't offer anything in that range.  The Lumia 520, on the other hand, (unless you count high-end games) doesn't compromise performance, and leaves out very few features.The phone even makes a great alternative to something like an iPod Touch (which start, BTW, around $200).  It makes a nice music player, especially if you add a microSD card for extra storage.  It makes a great GPS -- you can download maps ahead of time so you don't even need to have signal coverage for it to do door-to-door driving directions, and it uses Navteq maps, which are even better than Google's.  There are tens of thousands of really good games.  It holds onto weak cellular signals better than most phones out there.  And with Windows Phone 8.1, it makes a great personal assistant too.Here's the best part -- you don't really even have to sign up for an AT&T; account to use these features.  (An AT&T; SIM is required to get past the initial activation, but surely one of your friends has a SIM they'd let you borrow for a few minutes.)  Once the phone has been through its initial configuration it doesn't need cellular coverage any longer.  It continues to function great on WiFi only for everything except phone calls and texting (and even those issues can be overcome with something like Skype).  AT&T; probably wouldn't like me telling you this, but it is true.This really is a fantastic little phone.  Just don't expect to be getting all of the features of something else that would cost you $400 or more off-contract.  For what it costs it is an absolute bargain.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Even if you never put a sim in it, this is a great value", "Author": "T.

It is every bit as capable as the other two, and infact is a very easy to use and snappy mobile device OS. If the App ecosystem worries you, do know it is growing everyday. I think they only real concern should be if you absolutely rely on an app that is not currently available on the OS.Nokia makes a very solid phone, I've dropped this phone quite a few times (because at this price point I'm less careful than I was with my iPhone and Nexus 4) and it has held up very well. There are a few apps that can lag a bit, but one must remember that this is an entry level phone for WP. Nokia's apps, especially the camera, HERE Maps, and Nokia Music are all fantastic, and don't cost you a penny. If you're worried about data, the maps you'll use in HERE Maps are all downloadable, which means your Turn-by-turn GPS is snappy because it isn't downloading the map as you go.As for service I'm using the Lumia 520 on Straight Talk's network, using one of thier AT&T; SIMs, and am having no issues. The phone is able to make calls, texts, and use MMS and Data.All in all, if you set your expectations correctly for the phone (don't buy it thinking it is a flagship device, because it just isn't) then you'll likely be very happy with your purchase.

I'm am not a heavy phone user. I'm always late to the technology party. This phone is replacing a 'flip phone'. I've never texted.

The price on this phone was very reasonable, so I figured I'd try a 'smart' phone and see how it goes.I've been really happy. It is surprisingly simple to operate. Windows 8 has not been a problem. It comes with One Note and that's a nice feature. There are decent instructions on-line and a printed sheet with the phone. It's not as small as a flip phone but fits in my jeans okay. I haven't tried any apps so I can't address how might work with them. My connections are much better I've only had one dropped call (although this may be do to the change in service - not the phone). Texting has been very easy - this phone has a built in microphone and speech recognition software so you can talk into the phone and as you do the phone types the message!!

I want to share my experience. I've had this phone for about 3 months. I use my phone quite a bit. I sell things online, so I do lots of emails. I also text with friends and family.Here are a list of things I use most often on this phone:Email (lots of issues with it, will explain more below)Text (ok most of the time. Once in a while the recipient doesn't get the picture)Internet Explorer (works fine. Can't upload pictures on Craigslist on the desktop version)Phone (ok most of the time. Sound quality is good. Can't switch when a 2nd call comes in. Keypad is not very responsive when making entries during a call, such as entering a credit card number or press a number to make a selection)Camera (average camera. Used to get a green flickery screen once in a while when entered into camera mode. Hasn't happened since I did a factory reset on the phone)Nokia Music (works)Nokia Here (map and navigation. It's the best feature. Uses GPS instead of data. Very helpful when traveling outside the coverage area, which I often do)Calendar (allows to set reminder up to one week ahead which is nice. I had an iphone 4 prior and reminder was up to 2 days ahead which I found useless)Whatsapp (notification is delayed. Sometimes by 30 minutes, sometimes by 3 hours)More detail regarding the native email app. I have 4 yahoo accounts, one aol account, and one gmail account set up on this phone. The most frequent it can fetch email is every 15 minutes. I don't like it but it is what it is. The biggest problem is it randomly and constantly prompts for password, saying the password stored is incorrect. I don't fight it. I just enter it again, based on the forums I've read. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I would have email sitting in the OUTBOX because my password is \"incorrect\". I have tried deleting the account and setting it up again, and again, and again. One account eventually kept syncing so I couldn't even delete the account. It would drain my battery in 2 hours. I had to power down my phone. But as soon as I power up the phone that account would sync again nonstop. Finally I managed to delete that account and re-setup. I called Nokia. They told me since I've done everything they would have told me to do (remove email, power cycle, take battery out...), the only other thing is to do a factory reset. I've done that 3 times but the problem didn't go away.The phone would have been a perfect phone for me (and great price) if the email would have worked properly.UPDATE May 13, 2014I sent the phone back to Nokia for warranty. It came back saying \"water or physical damage\" and is not covered by warranty. I know the phone has never been dropped in water. The only water exposure would be little splashes by the sink when I brush my teeth or wash my hands. The error I get is obviously a firmware issue (I used to work as a test engineer at a cell phone company). Nokia just tries to find every way not to admit there are issues and refuse to honor their warranty. Bad ethics.

I took the phone into a AT&T; retailer and she was able to port/transfer over his current number to the new gophone which was a big deal as he uses this number for work. After that it's been smooth sailing.This phone works great and currently uses the $25 plan which includes 250 minutes of talk, unlimited text and he just uses wi-fi so there is no need for a data plan. Besides I heard if you enable the data it will take the money out of your plan and your left with a balance of $0.

Windows phone 8 is fine as long as you not an app-aholic. I purchased this phone to replace a defective Samsung android phone and just put in my current contract sim card (AT&T;) and everything works fine. I will say that there are 2 important limitations. First, there is no flash for the camera. Not really a big deal unless you really dig taking lots of photos with your phone or want to use it as a flash light. The second limitation is with playing music on WP8. It is absolutely stupid how difficult it is to make a playlist on this OS. If you want to make a custom playlist, you basically have to do it by connecting to your pc. Hello Microsoft??? This really needs to get fixed. As far as the hardware goes, the phone seems well made for the money and I have no complaints with Nokia.Bottom line...if you can live without a flash for the camera and the pain in the a** it is to make a music playlist, then this phone is a good value.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "More features & performance than expected from such a low-priced phone", "Author": "ReviewsYouCanUse", "ReviewID": "R165IKIDJHV00M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is one of Nokia's lower-end models, but a quick look at the reviews from cellphone/gadget websites will show that the Nokia Lumia 520 is a capable smartphone that performs well. The camera doesn't have a flash but good pictures are possible if the light is adequate. The photo editing software that comes installed will correct a multitude of photographic mistakes, and the 520 can be configured to automatically upload photos to Microsoft SkyDrive (now renamed to OneDrive). The Map application works well and almost always finds my location quickly; the navigation app is just so-so.There is a hard shell back that pops off easily (sometimes too easily if the phone suffers even a minor fall). Underneath the back is access to the phone's battery, SIM card, and a slot for a micro SDHC card.All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of this low-end phone, but there are a few negatives:1)  It's a Windows phone; don't expect to find many apps for this platform. Facebook and Twitter have apps for the Windows platform, but many remotely operated gadgets such as the Belkin Wemo don't.2)  Packaging: the phone is encased in a thick plastic tub that must be cut open with a good deal of effort. This isn't the fault of Amazon (the Lumia 520 is packaged in plastic by AT&T;) but I needed a stiff, very sharp knife to get the 520 free of it's container.3)  The price: About a week after I bought this phone from Amazon I saw that a local big-box retailer had the Lumia 520 for $10 less than the Amazon price.

The phone is very easy to use although it does not have the same amount of customizability that you may come to expect after using an android phone but instead will probably be more comparable to an iPhone (at least based on my experience) the nice thing about this though is that everything just seems to work better together. The camera is pretty good albeit i'm sure flagship phones would do better. It performed better than my HTC G2 though which was what I was aiming for so i'm pretty satisfied. It has a good build quality and i've dropped it a few times without it exploding which is a plus. In addition it has yet gain sentience and try to kill me in my sleep...yet.

Can even be used with thin gloves!*About 4.7GB of free space (OS takes up the rest) built into the phone.*Great audio quality and reception. This rivals or beats every other phone I've had except maybe the Lumia 710. Can't vouch for the microphone quality as I haven't asked any of my friends how I sound on the other side.*WP8 (up to each individual to perceive this as a pro or con. I personally like the user interface but am eagerly waiting for a notification center and the ability to pin settings to the home screen and IE to save user names and passwords and... the list goes on).*Snappy speed when it comes to accessing built-in features.*reasonably good camera, especially for its price.*Nice responsive keyboard. I've had a few android devices and am always amazed that the touch input is still about twice as laggy as Iphone. I'm glad Microsoft chose to go the Apple route and design their OS on responding to touch as fast as possible. It isn't always consciously noticeable but the keyboards on IOS and WP8 have quicker hap-tic feedback and feel more \"crisp\" than any Android device Ive ever used (including the 2013 Nexus 7). The only area Android bests their competition is with swype. Swyping is FAST once one gets used to it.Now the cons:*About 1.5-2 days of battery life with light usage. I know this is typical for smartphones but I would love to have 5 days with light usage like I used to with my Nokia E71.*Mediocre display. Some people might complain about the 800x400 or so resolution but to be honest that is enough for a phone of this size. The issues with the display are its viewing angles, washed out colors, low max brightness, and no oleo-phobic coating.*3-5 second load times (sometimes up to 10 seconds?!?) when opening applications, including Nokia applications that have first party status.*sharp feeling corners/edges when the phone is pressed to the ear. This is fairly bothersome, and I need to always keep the phone away from my ear a little because of this.*WP8 eye candy is kind of slow to transition between views. Microsoft should include the ability to speed up the animations.*capacitive buttons at the bottom of the screen are hard to press consistently, the active area is not well defined visually. This has been a problem I've had with all my touchscreen phones. I guess I just hate capacitive buttons at the bottom of phones...Bottom line, the hardware in this phone is above average for late 2013 (taking into account more than just the CPU). WP8 lags less than Android for user interface touch actions but it takes longer for applications to open. If you don't mind WP8 and considering $70 price tag, the performance of this phone is phenomenal and is definitely worth it.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "cannot beat this phone for the price", "Author": "D.

Two things that ARE missing are a front-facing camera, so Skype is not too useful here if you want to do video chat, and back camera flash. The 5MP camera works really well outdoors but can be grainy indoors, typical of medium-range phone cameras. After all, this is no Lumia 1020 or even 92x. The LCD screen is very nice, though, and the touch function works as well as on an iPhone which is to say the best!  The large icons -- you have three sizes to choose from -- are super easy to read, a great break from the tiny icons on the iPhone and Android. A recent reports says over 70% of American adults suffer from eye fatigue due to using smartphones and tablets. I can tell you that after I started using Windows Phone my eyes have gotten less dry. The 520 makes clear calls. Like all Nokia phones, though, the vibrate function is a little lame. But I don't use vibrate at all, so it's not an issue for me at all.While the phone is the best smartphone for the price, AT&T; Wireless stinks, period. With smartphones, AT&T; does not allow you to add a pay-per-minute plan. You must choose a monthly plan, starting at 25 dollars per 30 days.  T-Mobile is better in this regard, but AT&T;'s network is 10 times better than T-Mobile's, so it's a trade-off I'm willing to accept.  I use a Lumia 925 as my main AT&T; phone, but leave a 520 in my car as a backup phone and also my son carries a 520 to school. He loves it, too. Windows Phone has Kids Corner which limits the phone's functions, for instance it limits the maximum volume, and it's a great and reliable way, unlike a few Android offerings, for kids to use the phone.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best cell phone I've ever had!", "Author": "Carbenmadness", "ReviewID": "R2J3U7ZB4LUXB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the best service and reception.

The first problem with the phone is that the top right corner gets warm when running larger apps for extended periods, this is the only phone I have ever had that does this.  The other is that the back comes off when the phone is dropped.  This would be easily fixed with a case, but most of the cases out there for this phone are made for the Lumia 520 and 521.  Despite what they say, these cases do not fit both phones as the 521 is longer than the 520, which means that there is extra room in the case.

My contract didn't allow for an upgrade for another year, so I decided to buy a go phone. I stumbled upon this phone on amazon (as Im sure most of you did). I was quite impressed with its performance initially. After two or three months here is what I have to say about it:If you are buying this phone for the purpose of just using it as a short term replacement (from your lost or broken \"nice\" smartphone), then you found the right product.HOWEVER BEWARE: I would not recommend buying this phone if you need a reliable phone for longer than a two or three month period. Like many users have stated the hardware isn't the most durable and your main operating buttons for the phone WILL eventually FAIL. My home screen button stopped work after a week; but, this was fine to me because everything else operated seamlessly.. that is until today, one of my volume buttons stopped working. This makes it impossible for me to control my volume. And even under settings the operating system does not allow you to scroll up or down for sound. So basically I can't play music anymore through bluetooth, can't hear any alerts, or even turn up my alarm. This is a great backup or temporary phone but the quality of the hardware build is not top notch and that should be taken into consideration.P.S. the App store sucks(terrible apps besides Netflix and Spotify), and sure its no galaxy S4 or iPhone5, but for the price, it functions as a great temporary backup phone until your contract allows for a cheap upgrade on your actual smartphone.Summary: As your normal everyday cellphone you plan to use for two years = 2 Stars **  As a temporary or replacement phone = 4 to 5 Stars ****", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "gift", "Author": "john vanschaick", "ReviewID": "R1UX2ZBTC7GP6D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this was a great gift for my girlfriend, she loves the phone and got some nice cases for it she loves it", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Vonnie \"Vonnie\"", "ReviewID": "RA1FQ08TBS3NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great for the price- so great I bought my mum one too.

In fact I really dislike them.  I owned a Lumina 820 a few months ago that's LCD screen died, and I was actually pretty happy that it did so I could move on to something else.  My problem with windows phones is not the OS, it is the app market, and that has not improved at all in the past few months since my previous windows phone died on me.So why did I buy this?  Quite simply it was because if the price.  I still have 11 must months to go on my contract and the phone I was using became very unreliable.  When it came down to it I needed a reliable phone to hold me over for a few months, and for $59 the Lumina 520 was too good a deal to pass up.I does the basic things that I need from a phone, I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I have to give it 5 stars.Windows phone 8 runs beautifully on this device.  It accepted my 32gb micro SD card with no problems.  Give me some apps that really let me take control of my phone and I could become a big fan of Windows Phone...The only con from the phone hardware itself is the lack of a flash for the camera.

Coming from the iOS background, I was not expecting much from what is essentially an entry level Windows Phone.

Even though the screen isn't HD, it is actually quite good, the colors are vivid with good contrast.  You do notice a bit of jagging but definitely livable.  What is most impressive is how fluid and quick the touch screen and the system respond.  Something that can't be said for the lower priced Android phones which tend to be quite laggy and not fluid at all.  Although Windows Phone doesn't have a lot of quality apps just yet, the few essential ones like Facebook and Skype are there and work really well.

The interface, though tough to get used to at first coming from a 2 year tryst with iPhone, is very pleasant and fluid.The processor has plenty of \"oomph\" and adds to the fluidity of the interface, my key presses register basically without delay and the scrolling happens without lag or jitters.Another cool thing is that, for now anyway, Microsoft will be updating all their phone operating systems very similarly which is nice when coming from Apple where they basically stop all support and updates for their devices relatively quickly when their latest and greatest comes out.I mean, Windows XP still has updates being released (until April 2014, that is) , that's a 12 year old operating system that they are still supporting and it really means a lot. Back on topic, I am pleasantly surprised with the windows mobile layout, and while I don't care to see people's faces on live tiles such as Facebook, I dig the weather and email tile updates.All in all, I don't have any buyer's remorse, I don't miss my iPhone and plan on looking at the Lumia phones in the future.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, but awkward keyboard", "Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "R3026G6G9UEPYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone and basically, it's good and also my first Smart phone. I figured out how to use it in no time whatsoever. What I like best is how easy it is to create an address book and then to make calls or send texts. What I don't like is that the letters on the keyboard in this phone are just too small and too close to one another so that I always type the wrong letter and constantly have to correct. What makes this somewhat easier though, is the auto recognition of words that appear, so that I can select the word, rather than type it in its entirety.  Also, the proximity of the letters only allow for the use of one hand to text. The number keys are situated much better, are larger and easier to use. I don't know why Nokia couldn't have done the same with the letter keys.  Voices are not quite as crystal clear as they used to be in older Nokia phones, but I think I can live with this.  When turning on the phone, it seems to take quite a while until the main display screen appears. There's no physical manual that comes with this phone, so you have to look things up on line, which is an annoyance.  There doesn't appear to be a data plan for this AT&T; Go Phone unless you change your plan, however, AT&T; does offer data on a pay per use at 1 cent per 5 kb. I find the battery life to be poor because even if you don't use the phone, the battery dies.  Creating a microsoft account on the phone comes with its own difficulties and frustrations.  You have to type letters that appear so they don't think you're a \"robot\" trying to create an account, and no matter how many types you repeat this procedure, it fails.  The volume keeps going down, and I constantly have to remember to check it and make sure it's on high. All in all, for the price I paid, I think this phone is so-so.

I currently have a Nokia Lumia 925 and an HTC 8X and love both, so when my oldest daughter was ready for a phone this Christmas I thought we'd try a PayGo before settling into a contract.The biggest issue I have with the 520 is the screen resolution, because so many other issues stem from that.  For starters, the Windows Phone app marketplace is fairly limited already, but many of the apps were created when Windows Phone had a minimum resolution of 720p (1280x720).  The 520 has Windows Phone's new low-end 480p resolution (800x480), which means a good percentage of the already-limited marketplace is closed off to the 520.  The was really highlighted when I tried to download apps I had on the other phones to this one and found even old basics like Doodle Jump and Fruit Ninja can't be had on the 520.  On top of that, Microsoft never updated the UI fonts when lowering the resolution standards for the manufacturers, so it is a pixelated frustration at times to read emails and web pages.  Furthermore the 520 manages to be the only AT&T; Windows Phone without a front-facing camera, which means you can't even use Microsoft's own Skype with it.I had low, but I felt reasonable, expectations for a phone at this price and Nokia still managed to deliver under expectations.  If you need a cheap smartphone to text, email, and other basic functions that don't require apps you'll be fine with the 520.  By not having apps, it has plenty of space for music, the Bluetooth works excellent, so it works for us as a My First Smartphone to see if she can handle the responsibility (also, Microsoft's Parental Controls work excellently with Windows Phone).

His (non smart) phone was recently lost, and he was begging for a smart phone (\"everyone at school has one\" - sadly, he's not wrong about that!).  I really did not want to pay $$$ for an iPhone (especially given the high probability that this phone will be dropped/lost/etc.)  I stumbled across this phone on Amazon and, given the great reviews, decided to give it a try.  It arrived quickly and I took it immediately to the AT&T; store where they gladly activated it with his existing number (part of our family plan).  I played with it for a couple days before giving it to him.  I'm an iPhone user myself, but not really techie.  The screen is really nice and the Windows system seems easy to use.  It doesn't look cheap.  I think it has all the features and apps that he needs.  When I finally have it to him, I could tell that he was disappointed that it wasn't an iPhone but after using it just a day, he told me \"Mom, this is a really nice phone.  Thanks.\"  I can't believe I only spent $60 for this phone.  I don't know how it will hold up in the long run, but for now I'm super-happy with the purchase.  I feel like I got a tremendous bargain.  (And, when I activated his phone at the AT&T; store, I switched us to the family shared-data plan that AT&T; has been promoting heavily.

I actually like the \"tile\" idea and that it continuously updates my e-mails, messages, weather (etc) so I don't miss anything. Also, the GPS is just as good as any other phone I've had (maybe even better in some cases.) I also like that I don't have to call my voicemail because the name/date/time is listed along with the ability to play back the message like a regular audio recording. What are the downs? The biggest issue I have is that some of the free apps available on other markets (Words with Friends for example) aren't available or you have to pay for them.

For example, with other GoPhone's you can buy a plan for as little as $10 that will give you 100 minutes with 30 day expiration or a $25 package with 250 minutes with 90 days before expiration. The \"best\" plan with this phone for a light user is $25 for 250 minutes and ONE month expiration. Effectively, that is 3X the cost for the infrequent user compared to GoPhone plans available on other phones. If your use of cell phones is similar to my own, you will want to get a 3G smart phone that has the more flexible plans available.

The real kicker is of course the price, and I must say it\u2019s well worth the money. If you\u2019re a pc user the 520 is a great companion to your Windows 8 or 7 PC, documents, pictures, videos are sent to Microsoft\u2019s Sky Drive without effort at all and are on your PC almost as soon as you take a picture or save a document. There is no need to sync you PC to your phone to complete this task so the worry with USB cables is all but over. Syncing your music is easy I would suggest picking out a SD card 16GB or larger the Phone supports up to 64GB. Once you have installed your card download the software to your windows 8 PC free from the store or stream it from X Box Music either way is fast and easy. The screen is bright and clear even in sunlight and does work to touch even with gloves on. Call\u2019s a crisp and very clear both over Bluetooth and the handset. The browser is fluid and opens quickly as expected from a 4G device pinch zoom and scroll work very well. It\u2019s a smaller Phone very light weight and slim. I find it slick and hard to hold but the device does feel built well and sturdy and slides easily into a pocket. Battery life is just ok I was able to get a normal 10 hour day with ease. Here drive is a standalone GPS navigation app built into Nokia Devices it even works when you have no cell service by downloading maps and storing them on the phone. The app is clear easy to use and so far exact with directions and guidance. Over all it\u2019s a great phone for the money the windows store is still growing and more apps seem to show up every day. After looking for many months and even thinking of switching back to apple we thought we would give a windows phone a try. Were so glad we did and are looking forward to upgrading to a device along the Nokia line very soon. Not this this phone is bad it is very well priced and works well above the standard of any entry level android or even I phone 4. The phone is smart fast and a joy to use.

It's my first after my daughter bought a high end Nokia Lumia and I got to see it's features. I decided that I wasn't about to spend what she did for hers and found this little gem. Some other relatives and friends have much more expensive phones and have more problems with them then I'd ever care to have. I wanted a phone that would simply connect me to everyone via call or text message and possibly to the world around me and this phone does just that. Lots of free apps, lots of games that are pertinent to me and an easy way to keep track of my usage. Simply dial *3282# and you have your data usage anytime you want it. Only thing about this phone that's a negative to me is that the camera is lacking. No flash and I'm, probably like the rest of you a photo nut!  A lot of lighting fixes that though. It's a pre-paid phone so you have to bring it to your nearest AT&T; outlet to have it set up but they do a good job. It gets 4 stars from me only because of the camera and that's probably not fair because I own good cameras. Oh yeah, one more thing, not a lot of space.

Since I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet and I wasn't willing to spend the $700+ to replace the iPhone, i opted for an alternative. Since I am already an ATT customer and this being a Locked ATT GoPhone, I just inserted my SIM card in and worked. I did buy a nano SIM to MicroSIM adapter since iPhones use Nano sim and this phone only takes MicroSIM.Since its a budget smartphone, it lacks many of the premium features that the iPhone or other premium phones have such as a fast processor, high quality display, multiple sensors, better quality camera with flash, front facing camera, noise cancelling microphone, LTE etc. etc.What I love is that its light, screen is bright enough and color is decent, resolution is adequate, touch response is good and the processor snappy enough for the average app. May not be fast enough for some graphic intensive game but I don't play games on my phone so no issues there. With this phone, I'm able to do the things I need to do which is, email, facebook, twitter, internet, call messaging and music. Even though its not an LTE phone, 4G is fast enough. This is enough to keep me satisfied until I my contract allows me for an upgrade with subsidized pricing.Battery life is good. GPS. Call quality is decent. The volume on the earpiece is loud enough, speaker phone is adequate and WIndows8 is easy to navigate. 8GB internal memory and expandable via MicroSD card. Good music playback as well.  WIndows8 is pretty good. What I don't like it's that many of the apps I had on iOS, they are not available for Win8 which is why I gave this phone a 4 out of 5.Overall, this smart phone has enough features and I was actually impressed with it. The more I use it, the more i like it but I still do miss my iPhone. For a phone less than $100, I think its great. Biggest draw back is the lack of apps from MicroSoft because of WIndows 8 but the OS if very nice.

Also, lot of applications are not compatible with windows phone. I couldn't access my email provider because it is not the common provider. Bottom line, good for people who don't use the smartphone capabilities. Sound is good, cannot custom ringtones, even following instructions. Good experience with the phone for the call part, for the rest, Windows spoil he fun of having a smartphone.

Post repair, it lasted 4 weeks and the same issue returned.  I'm VERY disgusted with Nokia customer service and repair center and will never buy a Nokia cell phone again.(this was my review when I first got the phone in October) It's easy to use, functions are readily accessible.  I got this phone to replace my Fusion, but to also replace my iPod...fewer devices.  My only issue, so far, is you cannot set up playlists on the phone.  So, I'll be doing that on my SD card, eventually.  Windows needs an update for this problem as the SD music plays nicely, speakers are very good.  That's my only complaint.  I do very much like this phone, and would recommend it to a friend.I just found a Windows called CUSTOM PLAYLISTS.  It was .99 and well worth every penny. I can make playlists on my phone with no problem.So, this is now a really terrific phone!! I'm very happy with it, and it is now 5 stars in my book.12/11/13...after 2 months this phone will not make or receive calls.  It turns itself off when I try to answer a call.

For the most part the reviews were spot on... a decent phone for an excellent price... all was good and no complaints.However,  3 months into our purchase the on/off button stopped working.  Took the phone to At&T; store nearby who forwarded us to the AT&T; warranty dept.  They acknowledged that the phone needed to be replaced but even on a 3 month old phome they replace it with a \"Remanufactured\" one. Not so Great!  They assured me the replacement would be as \"good as new.\"A week later Phone #2 arrived.  Right out of the box it had an issue...The phone would completely shut down and restart whenever a text was sent.  Back to At&t; Store and again we were put in touch with the AT&T; warranty dept.  Again they acknowledged that the phone needed to be replaced.  After spending 30 minutes with the representative begging for a \"new \" phone, the only thing they \"could\" do is send out a remanufactured device.A week later Phone #3 arrives.  It seems to work fine but a week into using we noticed the battery was being depleated even when it was turned off.  Back to AT&T.;  This time warranty sent out a new battery hoping to resolve the situation.  It did not.  Trip #4 to the At&T; store.  By now I enter the store and I feel like Norm on \"Cheers\" everyone knows my name.  This time I let a store represenative help me with the warranty people.  As in the past we were offered a remanufactured device.  I refused.  They told me at first this was my \"only\" option.  I told them I wanted a differnt phone altogether. They told me they could not do that.  After having the store rep speak to the warranty people they offered me a $29 slider phone as a replacment.  What a joke!  After 45 minutes on the phone they finally offered an LG Optimus G.  We took it.So you as a buyer haved a decision to make.  Do you take your chances on the Nokia 520.  Sure we could have had a run of bad luck and gotten 3 bad phones out of 3.  I am not sure of the odds on that but it seems to me like more than bad luck and more likely a qualtiy control issue with Nokia.  Further, I can assure you that you do not want to deal with the AT&T; warranty dept. My experience is that they could care less about you as the customer... it is all about the bottom line and giving the customer the least they can get away with.My adivce would be to at the very least look at other phones.

I originally really enjoyed the phone, but after two months I can't stand it.  It works extremely well as a phone, but as a smartphone it's mediocre. There are hundreds of positive reviews.  I'll list the negative aspects I found with this phone.-Lack of RAMWith only 512mb of RAM, multitasking on this phone stinks.  If you are browsing the web, and reply to a text message, you will see \"Resuming...\" when you try to switch back and forth the two apps.  Not only is this annoying, but Internet Explorer will lose your 'recent browsing history' so when you hit the back button, instead of going to the previous page, it will take you to the main launcher screen.  This is incredibly annoying.-Lack of storage spaceIt has 8gb of space.  Over 5gb is used by Windows Phone operating system.  There is a Micro SD card, but you can not install apps to the Micro SD card.  It can only be used for music, video, photos.  So you only have a few gbs to store apps.  I never experienced a problem with lack of storage space on a phone until I used this phone, and I ran out of space within two months.-Lack of appsThere are games on Windows Phone.  But that's about it.  I only use a few apps, and none of them are on Windows Phone.  The store has a lot of fake apps, too.  You may think you are downloading Google Chrome, but its really a fake app that is filled with ads.  When using Internet Explorer, you will find 'bugs' when trying to access some websites.  There aren't very many alternatives (and many are just overlays based on Internet Explorer) so it will be impossible to do some things.  For example, I can't log into my local bank's website because every time I try to enter my user name the keyboard pops down as soon as I type one letter.-No File Explorer, And Poor File HandlingThere is no file explorer on this phone.  When you connect it to a PC, you can see a couple folders for your Photos, Music, and Videos.  It's locked up tight.  If you use an app to create something, you have to store it on the cloud.  That's a big pain in the butt.  Not only that, but the only way you can add music or videos to the phone is by either purchasing them through the store, or connecting the phone to your PC.  If you try to download an MP3, you will be able to listen to it, but you won't be able to save it.-Random \"Find My Phone\" GlitchesI set my phone up on windowsphone.com so I could log onto the website and have Microsoft ring my phone, or lock it whenever I couldn't find it.  It really worked awesome the first couple times I tried it.  Then one day, I tried to do it told me \"Windows is having trouble locating your phone.\"A couple days later, at 4:30 AM, my phone started ringing.  It was the same 'ring' that comes on whenever Windows is trying to find my phone.  I tried to silence it, but guess what?  It kept ringing.  I had to take my battery out, because when I restarted the phone it did it again.  I don't know what happened, if hackers are able to ring Windows Phones, or what, Microsoft did not reply to my support email on the subject.-Alarm Not LoudI used to use my phone as my alarm clock.  Unless I've developed a medical condition in the past two months, this phone does not work very well in that aspect.  The built in alarm sounds are pretty weak, and overall volume is pretty low.-No notificationsUnless you have a bunch of live tiles set up, there is no way of getting notifications, like in iOS or on Android.  If I get outbid on an eBay auction, for example, I don't know unless I check.  Same goes for text and emails.  Although, I guess I should say that the phone does make an alert sound when it receives a text or email.-No Siri or Google Now ThingI always thought Google Now was stupid.  But I used it more than I realized.  Lumia has voice search which can be accessed by holding your finger over the Windows button, which is pretty good when it comes to converting my voice to text.  The problem is, if I say something like \"Set an alarm for 2:30PM\" instead of setting an alarm for 2:30, it searched Bing for \"set an alarm for 2:30PM\"-Bad CameraMaybe I got a dud.  It's 5 megapixels, but it doesnt have flash.  So, I can't use it as a flashlight.  Seriously though, I'm not impressed with the camera.  When I take a picture of my kids, it usually turns out blurry.  My old Nokia 5800 from 2008 has a 3 megapixel camera, and it works much better.  I'm not a photographer, but I like to take pictures of my kids. I pick up my tablet, or use my digital camera when its picture time.There you go.

I am looking to move from the Android world as Google's latest version of Android is both more invasive (in terms of privacy) and really a step towards the mediocrity that often happens when management changes in the technology group responsible for the device. In this case, the stellar vision of Andy Rubin has been replaced by the more middle of the road corporate manager who shipped Chrome OS to the world. That's started to show in Android and thus, it is time to look at alternatives.As this phone was offered on a pre-holiday discount, I decided to take a risk and try it as opposed to joining the Apple side of the force.I was extremely disappointed. I found the tile based interface somewhat too constricting. Due to the unwanted AT&T; supplied crapware (one of these days carriers will realize that their business is to provide connectivity/bandwidth and leave apps and app-based services to those who know what they are doing), I wound up going through the settings to customize the phone. While there were some that were useful, some were just missing and thus I could not eliminate things I had no need for or no desire to pay the battery/bandwidth freight for.In the end, I simply powered off the phone and put it back in its packaging. There was absolutely nothing in the software that was in any way compelling at all. On top of that, the app store was a bit thin in terms of functionality. The final bit of missing functionality was tethering - always present in Android phones and an option for Apple phones. Without tethering, you really can use a phone if you have any other mobile devices you travel with that would benefit from WAN access.The 1 star is for the physical design: good form factor and fits in your hand well. Not so good on the buttons and battery though.Microsoft needs to pay more attention to users and less to carriers. I can see that they are trying to woo the carriers with all sorts of opportunity to add software from the carrier and brand it appropriately. The problem is, no one wants that software.I might have had a different experience if I'd received and unlocked Windows 8 device with pure Windows 8 on it (i.e like Android on a Nexus device from Google, or any iPhone with iOS).So, misses not just by miles but by parsecs.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "tell me what's wrong", "Author": "tekucuna", "ReviewID": "R25BQC7558B6AL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Once I turned on the phone and looked at it a bit, I turned it off and can not turn back, the phone is switched on the screen logo appears at & t and the screen goes blank.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations.awesome phone for under $100 until screen kept cracking.", "Author": "Putrid Cadaver \"Infinite Nothingness\"", "ReviewID": "R2QA9L2UABHK6M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the price you can't beat it.

Not a substitute for a real smart phone.Edit: Sorry I wrote a negative review fanboys. This phone doesn't work well at all and just wanted to warn others. Maybe this phone is awesome if you live in India or whichever random South American country but in the U.S.A., it's junk. Forgot to mention the part about when you lock the phone and then want to quickly unlock the phone it won't work. It just goes to a backlit black screen and once the backlighting goes out in a few seconds then you can unlock it again. I've never had any phone that took so long to do such a simple thing.If your just cheap and don't mind it working slowly all the time, otherwise just get a phone that's unlocked for maybe $200 and more powerful.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Needs 8.1 update Yesterday", "Author": "Winston Middleton", "ReviewID": "R3CDKK434FOY5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good1.

The images flip sideways when you turn the phone.  Unfortunately, I am more concerned with things that disappoint me, such as the quiet alert tones that come with the phone and which cannot be replaced with downloaded ones.  One Note, a quick note taking program, requires signing up with a username that stores your notes in a cloud and not on the phone.  You can pin each note to the start page, but otherwise, you must store it off the phone.  There is no \"delete\" button and you must use the \"Back/Left\" arrow to backtrack, leaving all your paths to be retraced.  My biggest beef, however, is that I need browser flexibility which the phone does not have.  I need to link quickly from emails to a work website, but the Internet Explorer browser on the phone requires that I sign in with a password on that website every time I link to it.  Explorer can be bypassed for other internet browsing, if you download another one that Windows phones will take (not Opera mini), but emails still must use Explorer, so that doesn't help me.

Blankenship", "ReviewID": "R1DDE340W918C4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I've used almost every phone OS currently out (except the newest blackberry 10) and was stuck using an old Palm Pixi Plus on AT&T; as my nexus 4 phone screen cracked due to LG's poor manufacturing standards/quality. I figured I would either go back to an iphone, try another android device, or take my chances with windows phone 8. I have to say, initial opinion was fairly high. Nokia mostly makes a good quality phone. But as the days and weeks went on too many problems reared their ugly head. First things first:1. THE REAR BATTERY COVER- I currently have an incipio case covering my phone. Whenever the phone is in my pocket (by itself to avoid nicks and scratches) the back over separates and needs to be re-snapped together. This happens literally every time I walk around and the phone gets a little jostled. Very annoying!2. LACK OF APPS/POORLY CODED APPS- This has been addressed before, but seriously! I thought that Palm's app store was barren! Well microsoft does have more apps, but less that you'd actually want to bother downloading. There is just too much garbage in the store, and that's saying a lot coming from android! Not to mention, some apps you download can cause the phone to freeze, or worse yet, crash and reboot when launched. Where's the quality control?3. NO NATIVE YOUTUBE SUPPORT- This kinda falls in with the lack of apps above, but deserves it's own section because of how big and persistent youtube is. Granted, microsoft and google ARE working together to make something happen, but as of me writing this review, nothing yet. Unfortunately your only option is to watch youtube through a clunky mobile site through the web browser. Not acceptable for ANY smartphone in 2013!4. RANDOM FREEZES/SLOW TO OPEN PROGRAMS- This probably has a lot to do with the lack of RAM this phone has (512MB vs the usual 1GB and up). But seriously, I've used low end android devices (not including the nexus 4) and many iphones (from iphone 4 on back) that had 512MB of ram OR LESS and never had the clunky slowness that this phone has. Hell, my back up Palm pixi only has 256MB ram and a 600mhz single core processor and responds faster than this phone half the time.It has to be Poor optimization, as it is running a dual core processor, that shouldn't be a problem, but it is.5. UNRELIABLE BLUETOOTH/WIFI- This could be due to me keeping the phone in power saver mode alot, but I constantly lose connection to wifi(and I've tried using it at AT&T; hotspots, libraries, my home network, and friends home networks and it's always the same). It connects just fine but constantly kicks off after anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes after connecting. The bluetooth function also has trouble staying connected to a bluetooth speaker I have. Very spotty reliability.6. ISSUES WITH THE SD CARD- I have a decent sized music collection that I keep stored on a fast CLASS 6 8GB Micro SD card. There are about 2300 songs that I compressed down to 64kbps mono mp3 (cd quality mono to conserve space) so most files are 1-3MB depending on the length of the song. The integrated Xbox music app is basically unusable. Constant freezes and some of the slowest reaction times I've seen anywhere. It literally takes anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds to change a track. The built in Nokia music app is slightly better, but still chugs along slower than it should. This card was new and formatted by the phone and works flawlessly in my windows 7 desktop, but this phone takes forever to read off of it. I can only imagine that the uncompressed 8-12MB original files would take minutes to load up. There has to be some issue somewhere because I've never had similar issues with android phones that support additional SD storage like this.7. NO APP MANAGEMENT- This I will never understand. Every phone I have ever used has some way to easily close multiple apps, not so with windows phone 8. When you hold down the back arrow key all open windows/applications pop up so you can easily scan through what is open and logically you think you would be able to close apps from this screen but you can't. Microsoft actually expects you to mash the back key from the homescreen and \"back through\" every open app to close them. This is THE WORST implementation of app management that I have ever seen! Silly!So, those are the glaring issues. I will give credit to Nokia (besides the rear battery cover) that the phone is generally excellent in quality at this price point. The preinstalled nokia apps are probably the best apps available for this phone. I've really been enjoying nokia music plus and here maps/drive. The only thing that holds this phone back is the buggy, beta feeling windows phone 8. It's not like this is a brand new OS either. It's been out a few years and should be more polished than this. Before I get the pro-microsoft goon squad on me, please know that I am a microsoft fan... to a point. I own a 360, windows 7 desktop and laptop, hell, I still have my Zune HD and an old windows ce based phone floating around here somewhere! This is just not a good product. I like windows phone 8 better than the windows 8 OS because I feel that of all places, windows 8 and it's derivatives work best on touch screen devices like phones and tablets, but they have a long way to go before they can think of competing with google or apple. So realistically, can you find a better NEW phone for less than $100? Probably not (I've looked pretty extensively) but this phone is better as a second device or emergency phone until microsoft gets it's act together and actually improves it's mobile operating system.

However, if you are a current AT&T; customer and you plan to use your old sim card in this phone, you may have a big problem. The sim card in my previous AT&T; phone is too big for this phone. I called AT&T; and the representative told me to cut my old sim card to match the micro sim card slot for the new phone, and it should work immediately in this Lumia phone. Well guess what? Not only did it not work in the new phone, but now it won't work in the old phone, so I can't even view my contacts to at least copy them to the new phone. I had to go to an AT&T; retail location and all they could do for me was port my phone number to a new sim card so that I could at least use the new phone. I do not know why AT&T; would not clearly indicate that the phone's sim card may not match, instead of saying all we have to do is put our old sim card in the new phone and everything works fine. That is a lie! And unfortunately I lost my contact information as a result.
