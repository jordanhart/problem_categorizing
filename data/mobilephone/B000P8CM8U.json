But since then their customer service has become hopeless.  Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing.  I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it.  They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features.  But the processor is slow.  I have to reboot it atleast once a day.  If you have the phone , wife and gps on , most time it hangs.  Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess.  For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc.  Not worth the price.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Missing features and bad (zero) customer service", "Author": "Tony P \"Tons\"", "ReviewID": "R2FPXQ1EN1NN5J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years).
