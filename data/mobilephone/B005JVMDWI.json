The multitasking and speed are exponentially high quality, kicking Ios and Android while there down. what this phone lacks in apps makes up in productivity and the community. this phone is the absolute golden trophy amongst all great phones, and for 125 it feels like robbery! if you want one of the best for the price, you are getting more than your money's worth with this phone! if you want more apps rather than productivity and creativity, then go for the other generic brands.

I went from an overclocked Pre + on VWZ to Pre 2 and it's a very nice improvement.  WebOS was slow on 1st generation Pre devices and with the faster processor of Pre 2, webOS is wonderful.  The big question is the fate of webOS now that HP has stopped making phones and webOS is open-sourced.  If you want a compact elegant smartphone and don't needs 100's of thousands of apps, then this is a inexpensive smartphone with remarkable elegance.  WebOS has remarkable features for day to day use that iphone and android still don't have.  But webOS has a very uncertain future.  So that has to be weighed into your decision. I would give it 5 stars if webOS had a definite future and larger app selection esp of \"big name\" apps that iOS and Android enjoy.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Susannah", "ReviewID": "R3AHSSDB5ZB0XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this 3 weeks ago to use on Page Plus after a ton of research. It's a terrific phone. The physical design is really nice; the phone is a pleasure to handle. Great reception, great sound, etc. I bought it from USA Discount Inc. and it came fast and was in perfect new condition, all the plastic on, etc.The camera does not zoom, afaik., which is a little annoying.Saw someone commented on battery life: if you turn the wifi off when you don't need it, that will make a huge difference.I did have to do a software update b/c I could not get downloaded applications to install, which took me some work to figure out, so here's the info. on how to find it: google \"developer palm update support application update\" (I think Amazon removes links so not bothering to c&p; it).

My original Verizon Pre+ was overclocked to 1ghz but its performance never matched the smoothness of the 1ghz processor in the Pre 2.  Performance wise software just \"snaps\" on this phone. Hardware wise, It was worth the upgrade just to have a reliable keyboard. (a real joy to use after typing on the abomination of a keyboard that was on the Pre+).  Battery life is better and the phone runs cooler than my Pre+. Yeah they both have small screens but these phones literally drop in your pocket, and is nearly as easy to retrieve back out. The only down side to upgrading to the Verizon Pre 2 is the loss of the free mobile 5gb hotspot, but there is home-brew software to fill that gap.If you're into using webOS, upgrade before they're all gone.

Phone has an elegant size, (nice and small- just drops in your pocket) and I love the Qwerty keyboard which is much better then typing on a screen.  Web OS has great features that outdo Android, and the swipe, card view, and gesture area are nice features for a smartphone.  Phone calls, emails, and texts perfectly!  I like adding favorites to dialer menu, which makes it easier to find your most contacted people in the dialer app.  Wi-fi works great to cut down on data usage, and if you can live with 3G when your out and about, the phone is for you.  Stock battery life for a Pre 2 is a joke, so I went with the Mugen power 2800 mah extended battery and back door.  I average 5 days between each charging cycle, and the extra girth makes it easier to type on the keyboard.  Kind of light on apps for a killed operating system, but it is fine for my usage and homebrew apps and tweaks fill in the gaps.  It's too bad HP killed off the line, and we probably won't see another Pre on the market.  Get the phone now while you still can, and I'm sure you'll find you can't live without it.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Over heat problem solve with software upgrade", "Author": "M.

It's compact, attractive, stylist. The swipe features are also really nice and I've found this phone to be relatively easy to use. My Google contacts synced right up and within minutes the phone was ready to go. Tomorrow it's going back to Amazon.Here's why:-The phone runs hot. And not just a little warm, or a lot warm, it's hot. So hot it was uncomfortable and I tried to hold the phone by its sides when I used it.-When charging, the phone got even hotter. I'm not joking when I'm saying it burned my hand. I'm wondering, now that the phone is packed and ready to go back, if my unit was defective. Because if a lot of people experienced this, they're either ignoring it or they don't know how unusual it is for a phone to get that hot.-My Yahoo! mail wouldn't sync. I kept getting an error. I deleted the account and set it back up 4 times.-The battery life is terrible. The first day it lasted almost 6 hours and I hooked it up for an hour, after which it lasted for another hour.-The second day the battery lasted 5 hours. I was barely on it as I was busy and every time I checked the screen, my battery had dwindled another 15-20%. So when it got to 55%, I set it on my desk and walked away from it. Two hours later it was dead to world, in the middle of the afternoon.I'm coming from an iPhone (due to mine being water damaged). This seemed like a suitable replacement until I could afford to replace my iPhone. But after using an iPhone which lasts all day and doesn't get warm to the touch, this Palm Pre 2 was unacceptable.I liked the software, but the hardware has some serious issues. I wanted to give it two stars because I really liked the design of it, but two stars meant that I simply didn't like the phone.

The Pre2 with double the storage, almost 2x the CPU speed, much improved camera (5mp vs. 2mp) and larger screen has been incredible. It includes the charging back so it is compatible with the docks I own already and the upgrade was very easy. Of course you will need to \"unlock\" the phone with Preware in order to use mobile hotspot (Freetether is incredible!) and to use the \"torch\" app that uses the flash LED to provide a blinding flashlight. It is too bad that support for WebOS is waning. Now that the TNT1200 plan includes 500mb of data I know that I will never go over my limit. At less than $30 per month for a no contract plan I am very satisfied. Verizon does have the best network coverage so I get service everywhere.

You have to change the date to July 1 2013, install the store update, then switch the date to network time right away. If you don't, you won't be able to update the store or any apps.The device itself is old, outdated and unsupported. It has a single-core processor, while phones nowadays have dual and quad core processors. It has a quarter of the RAM used in most modern phones. The display has a low pixel density. At the time this phone was released to the world, none of that stuff mattered. It was considered fast enough at the time. Please don't forget that this phone is almost five years old at the time of this review.However, you can use it to access your email, calendar and contacts, listen to music, and podcasts, access Facebook and Twitter, and (sort of) take pictures. It's better than the $150 basic phones Verizon is selling off-contract and costs significantly less.Owning a NOS (new old stock) Palm Pre 2 has some geek charm to it, but it's a pain in the butt sometimes. You'll never be able to use Instagram, Pinterest or anything newer than Facebook or Twitter. Using it can be frustrating if you're coming from a newer device, simply because the hardware can't keep up with the modern you. A lot of have become conditioned to tapping and swiping through screens quickly.There are homebrew (community maintained) apps and patches that you must sideload onto the device that add features and functionality that never made it to Web OS due to it being abandoned.The cost of this phone is the only reason I can think of to buy one. If you can afford even a used iPhone, Android, or Windows phone, go buy one of those instead. If you're poor or just want something to play with, go for a Pre 2. I would not buy a Pixi or Pre Plus if I were you. These days, the Pre 2 or Pre 3 (which is much more expensive) are the only viable Palm devices to use.

The camera also will not boot up at times or it takes a while to do so. I really think this is a fluke but based on my experience I would not buy another palm pre.

Transferring service from my old Palm Pixi was a snap (there are plenty of tutorials online) and I save a bundle while still making use of verizon's network ($12 a month for 250 min, 250 texts, and 10mb data compared to the 80+ that verizon ends up costing). WebOS 2.1 still stands up today as a clean and user friendly OS. The swipes and shortcuts become very intuitive and it's a shame that HP decided to ditch the webOS line. As a result, no new official apps have been made for webOS in little over a year. Luckily there is a homebrew community that offers tweaks, overclocking, and apps. In addition, all the accessories and parts for the Pre are dirt cheap since the phone line left production.The phone itself is a relatively small and pocketable (3.1 inch touch screen) although it feels a bit chunky depth-wise due to the slider mechanism. However, the phone feels good in the hand and the overall build quality is solid. The keyboard is a little less clicky than the Pixi's, but much improved over the original Pre's. There's something about the tactile nature of a well-built slider that taps into a combination of nostalgia and some deeper human need for physicality. In short, it's satisfying.The 1Ghz processor zips through everyday use and the battery life is reasonable for a smartphone (charging once every one or two days). With a 320x480 resolution, it's no retina display, but it's more than enough to check emails and watch youtube clips. The 5-megapixel camera doesn't include autofocus and lacks any setting control (except for turning flash on or off), but I wasn't looking for something to instagram food with anyway.What you'll be getting is a quality budget smartphone with plenty of life still in it.

Populist", "ReviewID": "RYD19RX1W6S91", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Palm Pre 2 as my first smartphone.In some respects it's a great phone but there are issues with this phone.First the good:The phone reception is very good. Rarely drops calls unless I'm in a location where there is no or poor service. I don't count that against this phone as the same thing has happened with other phones that I have owned.Navigation is easy with the way the screen is layed out.Wi-fi connectability. This comes in handy when you want to regulate how much data you use.You can charge this phone with the Touchstone base. That's a big plus in my book! It charges rapidly.The USB cord makes for easy connection to my desktop computer.Now the bad:Battery life. This phone drains the battery rather quickly so plan on charging the battery often if you use the 3G feature. I charge mine at least once a day depending on how much I use it.There is a known issue with the \"Too many cards\" error on this model. The only fix I found is to use the three-button reset. This is simple enough, but the issue is a reminder that Palm phones are \"orphanware\" after HP bought Palm. They just don't update these old operating systems much anymore. This problem acts like a memory leak since I experienced it after using data on the phone.The keypad is too small for me. The keys in particular are too cramped. If you get this phone picking up a stylus would be a good idea.Overall this phone had potential and it's not exactly junk. It has a few issues that you should weigh before buying it.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't buy again", "Author": "Juke \"extraordinaire\"", "ReviewID": "R3I4EJHJZ1KXNU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not a big phone user, but this one is annoying.
