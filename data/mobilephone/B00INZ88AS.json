I paid $250++ Wife likes better than our Samsung Note 2++ 2 Gigs ram. Anything less is futile.++ 5.7\" screen is nice++ Decent battery life. lasts all day when wife aint playing solitaire for hrs. Has second battery, may come in use when traveling this Summer.- T-Mobile is not a good carrier for this phone if Data is important. When we can move from them we will try out Aio Wireless.- Duel Sim OR Sim & SD card- Off size, looks impossible to find cases for. (about 1/2\" longer than a Note 3)I am interested to see what Ulefone will bring out in future. I would like to see a more true Note 3 clone.I was told that I wouldn't receive from shipper until mid April on a Feb, 27 order. Actually received in two weeks. Nice surprise!", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00INZ88AS"}}
