It is quirky, often not charging when the phone is on, but having to be turned off to accept a recharge. It has a proprietary connector, so you can't use the same cables as other devices. The menus are not overly intuitive. I had thought being a Samsung was a safe bet, but this is not their top product! But it does work, though.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung M2310 flip phone", "Author": "oraldo garcia", "ReviewID": "R27029ERQ6O6TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I liked it  so much, so I ordered a second one. For anybody that want a handy cell phone without. Not a single complaint, reception is super and much better than other phones I had before. O.
