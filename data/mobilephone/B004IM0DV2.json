I only wish they floated. I lost one overboard so I reordered a phone from Just Cellular. They sent me a defective phone which had a charging problem. I didn't activate the phone for about a month, because I was traveling, Once I activated the phone I threw away the orginal packaging and lost the original receipt. I thought I would be screwed. I contacted Just Cellular and explained everything to them, they looked up their Amazon records and found my purchase info. They gave me an address, told me to send the defective phone back and let them know when I shipped it. As soon as I shipped it they sent me a new phone in the orginal boxing and apologized for the inconvience. I now have my new boulder and am VERY happy.
