I've had numerous phones over the years and they all developed problems, most serious enough to deserve a one way trip to the trash dump.A big point in its favor the jelly bean os is very stable and capable and even the basic single core processor and 768 Mbs of ram have proven to be entirely adequate. There is clearly a reason why Samsung is the biggest phone maker on the planet.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Young S6310l Unlocked GSM Cell Phone Deep Blue Android.", "Author": "Marie", "ReviewID": "R19FSOVETK3Z34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I love it; still learning but its not difficult; every day I learn something new on this phone. Its a smaller Galaxy for someone that doesn't need a lot of stuff on their desktop, but it has enough memory to keep chats and different applications from the play store. I bought this phone unlocked because I am planing to move abroad and all I have to do is change the Sims to be able to access the country's network. I recommended for traveling", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bang for Buck!", "Author": "Robin Payne", "ReviewID": "R2Y9F5IF2ZD911", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone for those who are on a tight budget and require the basic features and functionality of a smart phone.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phoneth", "Author": "Ryan Lester", "ReviewID": "RGQFKWBJJ55JC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a really nice phone. It has 1GB RAM with 2GB storage. If you do buy this phone I recommend you get a micro sd card. It makes the space alot bigger. The phone is not good for gaming. The processor is only a single core so it can only do one thing at once. It is a 3G phone. The battery life is really good. The phone lasts a couple days on standby and 1 day with constant use. The sim card is Mini SIM (normal). It will work with any phone carrier that has Mini Sim cards or smaller. My old phone took a micro sim card. If you position the card right it will work. The wifi is great on the phone with no lag at all. If you are one for constant speed with having lots of apps running at the same time this is not the phone for you. If you are looking for a smartphone that has all the support of a regular galaxy but you do not plan to do alot of things at once this phone is for you.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Meets my expectations", "Author": "Francisco Ferreira Cardoso", "ReviewID": "R32BYMHD2I6T26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is a great buy for people who doesn't wan't to spend a lot of money in a smartphone, but still want to have all its funcionalities", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Stefan", "ReviewID": "R1J82YOMZ56RWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my mother the OS is silky smooth...

My local phone company wanted almost $500. to buy a phone without renewing contract.  But even renewing contact they wanted $300.  I live in an isolated rural area and services are very limited. I did my research and bought this phone.  It immediately connected to our wireless service with the help of the wilson  signal booster ( which we need regardless of phone or company) It had excellent sound and fits comfortably in my pocket. It's a low end starter phone as it's advertised. But it does the job of being a phone just fine. I would buy it again.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Marcy Leon", "ReviewID": "RWFO7U3LAPRR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my mom, and it works perfectly!!!
