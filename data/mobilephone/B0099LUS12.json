It is very crisp than any other phones but colors are not spectacular and seems washed out.I switched to Xperia SL to Xperia Arc and even Arc seems to have more accurate colors than SL.The phone feels very good but the overall build quality is just alright. Quite a lot of dirt might get into edges.I was quite worried about the embedded battery since it's amount isn't very much (1750mAh) to power dual core processor and HD display.However, sony did a good job of managing the better life quite well. It will last a full day use with normal usage[web browsing, txting and calling] w/ 50% brightness of the screen.Snapdragon S3 1.7ghz dual core processor is quite outdated(2011) but the phone itself is pretty fast.However, the phone has stopped and been non-responsive unexpectedly twice already and it was pretty frustrated since it's battery is embedded.I don't know what's the deal with unexpected stop and it happens when i watch youtube videos.. hopefully sony will fix this problem by software update or something.Navigation touch buttons on the bottom of the phone is not really responsive and you kind of have to figure out where the touch sensor is and then once your fingers get used to it, its no problem.The camera takes little bit longer to capture and focus than such phones that has Snapdragon S4, S4pro, Nvidia Tegra3, Exynos 4412 Quad, A6 processors. (Ex. IPhone5, Galaxy S3, HTC OneX, LG Optimus G)But the quality of the picture is comparable to any other phones.Lastly, Design of the phone is the best out of all the other phones in current market right now.Transparent bar at the bottom makes the phone look distinctive and unique. It's square and arc mixture of design makes it look very sharp, clean, and makes comfortable in your hand.I would give this phone 3 and a half stars cuz of it's overall build quality and price but since there arnt any option for half star and I'm a sony fan so.. yeah:]If you are a sony fan and care about the design the most then this is it.Pros.-Unique & distinctive design-Matt finish and rounded arc design makes not slippery and comfortable in your hand.-Camera-Battery life-Clear and loud speaker-High density pixels(342ppi) HD displayCons.-Colors of the display is not as accurate and seems to be washed out.-Unexpected stop issues-Non-responsive navigation touch sensor.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "mako", "ReviewID": "RX3KP02BRE148", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent product just received it today from the courier costs in Venezuela but everything perfectly works perfectly with my account of Digitel in Venezuela recommend movistar tried it worked well with fast and reliable", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Tyler", "ReviewID": "R3IR6D4M21VGBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and a \"Straight Talk\" micro sim card from Walmart so I can use their unlimited service (talk, text, data) for $45/mo.

I was going to order a protective case for it, but have yet to do so because the phone seems VERY sturdy to the point that it seems like it really doesn't need one.

But it was well worth the wait, since my previous smartphone was an aging iPhone 3G. I bought it for using it in venezuela, I just put the SIM card (well, the micro one) in, and it worked perfectly. Works well  with all the cellular carriers here (movistar, digitel, i guess movilnet as well). It's fast, has a really nice screen, and a decent amount of memory. It mounts automatically once connected to my laptop, you don't need an intermediate programm at all. There is no SD slot, but I don't miss it. One charge lasts for the entire day (of course, provided you do not use it for intensive gaming). Antutu gave it 8341, which is good enough for me (for tweeting, some browsing, a few games, etc). It can even handle CPU demanding games, for instance riptide, which is a reference when it comes to benchmarking. I haven't tested other features yet, as the hdmi output, nor the cameras. but i strongly believe this is a good choice if you are looking for a decent, not so expensive, fully featured smartPhone.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "JOSE LUIS PALENCIA", "ReviewID": "R31I5N4LWEGG2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best android phone i've ever seen although i'm a really iphone fan. it has a great camera and video record. as a CON i would say its plastic cover is too fragil and the battery top comes out too easy. but considering the price is the best phone you can get", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "Penname", "ReviewID": "R2L9XIOPDHM9LI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, it's a good buy, price is reasonable.

The back is curved  making the phone easy to hold. On the front there is a clear strip indicating the back,home and menu buttons. The phone has some weight to it but it's not a bad thing as it feels more sturdy then other phones like the Galaxy S 3.  Overall its design is unique and will appeal to people who want something different.Display: The 4.3\" screen is bright and with a 1280 x 720 resolution the picture is very clear. The display is also scratch resistant which is a nice added bonus.Camera: The 12mp camera is great. It took well detailed photos in all environments including low light. There is also a front facing 1.3mp camera that's perfect for video chat.Battery: The battery is about middle of the pack when it comes to smartphones.  I was able to squeeze about 12 hours with moderate texting and calling.Network: I use AT&T; 3g and have found the speeds to be in line with other phone i have used.There are some negatives about the phone including a non user replaceable battery and no expandable memory card slot.

Not wanting to deal with converters and possible compatibility issues while traveling, I settled for this dual core phone with the HDMI output.  After a few weeks of use I am very happy with this purchase.  I have noticed a few hiccups while doing multiple processes, as I expected.  For instance, when playing music and downloading/installing app updates the music will cut out for a split second when the install starts.  I've never had this issue on my quadcore tablet so I assume that is likely the issue.  The battery life isn't great, but I expected that.  I plan to purchase a portable battery charger for long trips.  The Home and Back buttons don't always respond well to my touch and require several attempts (even prior to applying a screen protector so I won't blame that).  I only used the camera once as a test and it is much better than my old Xperia X10 mini, but I won't be giving up my Cybershot anytime soon!  The video quality is good although in my test video it tended to go in and out of focus quite a bit (dim light and 2 kids).  I haven't used the front camera for video chats yet and will update later for that.  Overall the phone responds and performs well and was a nice upgrade from my old Xperia.

Time proof. And it passes very well. At least, since the hardware scope.The phone behaves just like the first day, in terms of speed, OS, apps, wireless connectivity, storage... Great.Of course, I've installed some new apps (Games mostly), and I figured out that despite the app runs smoothly in the most cases, the juice runs out faster. Example: Fifa 14 consumes almost the double of energy respect to Fifa 12. And the phone warms a lot, but never compromising the phone's functionallity; I mean, the phone never shuts down or gets melted. In other words, the physical resources of the phone (RAM, proc) are used at 100% in larger amounts of time.As the phone still being competitive despite being released in 2012, I think LT26ii is a great long-term option (And IMHO deserves, at least, JB 4.3. Here is the problem with the phone; and is not really a phone's problem, is a manufacturer problem). The phone has some little dents in one of the corners (A 3 ft. fall).

With the last update you can activate the Extended Battery Mode, some sort of Stamina mode for this phone model and you can get a respectable one or two days of battery but sacrificing the push data notifications, but you can always get a car charger and problem solved.You can update your phone if it doesn't come with the latest update from sony, and it will be very stable and fast, the only thing I miss from the 4.0 system is the ability of taking 3D pictures which is one of those AWESOME for showing to your friends features, I think it could get the same functionality using other apps on the Google Play Store, but with the update to 4.1 you get Google Now a really cool assistant feature from google (so smart that it really scare me).Another cool thing is that Xperia S has a lot of fans on the market, and the Xperia SL is basically the same phone with a faster processor, in that way almost any custom rom and customization of the Xperia S can be used on the Xperia SL, including Cyanogen Mod, you can easily get the root for this phone searching on the XDA developers forum for \"Doomlord easy rooting toolkit for Xperia S\".You can also play games and watch movies on your tv if you order the micro hdmi to hdmi cable, it is PlayStation Certified, that means that you can play very cool 3D games on this phone like Call of Duty, N.O.V.A, Asphalt 8, etc... and the graphics are like a PS2, you can also connect a Dual Shock pad using the corresponding USB OTG cable and you instantly have a PlayStation that can be hold in the palm of your hand. On the manual says that you can use the control remote from your tv to control the phone but the tv has to be HDMI control enabled, and it doesn't work in all the TVs from the market, until now I haven't been able to test that feature, because I have and old Sony Bravia TV, one of those 720p that first came on the market.In general I am very happy with this phone and by the time it is going to stop receiving updates from Sony I probably going to get a custom room like Cyanogen Mod, it cost me about 340$ that is a lot of cheaper than an unlocked iPhone, it have a cool 12mp camera a fast processor, it is PlayStation Certified and I like Android far more than iOS.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Lemmiewinx", "ReviewID": "R1FNE0NYFSC3XO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like this phone, but after 3 months it started freezing up and simply turned off on its own.

It's not possible to get accessaries at your local mobile store due to it's unpopularity (that's what I want, hate to use Iphone or Samsung like millions of others) and the cases sold on Amazon are not appealing to me.And also the phone I received is with an European/Asian charger and seller did include an adaptor for US use.

This is my 3th Xperia cellphone, and I was really exciting to check this new model.Good: Really nice shape, the screen in HD is amazing to watch videos. The camera is fast and high quality as well. The battery have a long duration compared with others smartphones. The software is much better than the previous version, the touching keyboard works nice in double languages and switches automatically. Its is really  nice. The system to recognize the voice is amazing too, you just need to shake the cell phone to activate the Google voice. The frontal camera  is nice and high quality as well, I am using it to skype my mom in Brazil using this phone and works fine, like my laptop in video conference. The backcover is quite easy to remove to insert you microSIM chip, which is much much better than the others models, so far.Bad: The size is too big for me. Its is thin, but for example, you can not do a call easily with a unique hand for example. It is bad in some situations, for example in a cold weather,  but if you have big hands this will not be a problem for you. The quality of the sound is bad compared with previous Xperia mini pro and Xperia pro for example, and I like Sony due the high quality of the sounds in their devices. Another problem with the sound, is that it is too loud, even at the minimum volume. If you are in a shared environment  and want  listen music in a low volume do dot expect the low volume with this phone, you will need to use your headphones. This is bad, because sometimes my hears are \"tired\" from headphones. Another problem is that If you are using headphones and wanna pass for the next music, the control of the headphone can do that. The same silence button of headphone can be used to pass to the next music, which is cool, but sometimes its simply does not work.... I will keep it with me but I guess the Xperia pro is a better option after the last upgrade of the software provided by Sony. This model sometimes became frozen, and you can do nothing, once that the battery are non removable.  This last problem improved after the upgrade. However, that last thing that you wanna do after buy a new cool cellphone is waste your time doing a software upgrade in the fist week with your new phone. Good luck in your choice. --Marcelo", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "un problema", "Author": "Juan Diaz", "ReviewID": "R2GNKC29JVXF49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "el telefono me vino con un problema el cual es que la SIM card se desmonta cuando el telefono se pone en stand by", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "POR FAVOR  INFORMACION", "Author": "henry jayaro", "ReviewID": "R32UO4GNQV8YA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AMIGO BUENAS TARDES QUE DIFERENCIA HAY ENTRE ESTE APARATO Y EL SONY LT26I CON QUE BANDA TRABAJA EL 3G Y 4G ES LIBERADO PORQUE LO VOY A USAR EN VENEZUELA", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible battery", "Author": "KJ", "ReviewID": "RX0JHGM5IK4PB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All things are good except battery.
