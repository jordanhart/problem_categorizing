Consumer Cellular is an ATT reseller with no contracts and great rates. I've had the LG Thrive for a week and I now see why everyone raves about the Android OS. Thousands of Apps, fast response and easy to learn. LG makes a quality phone and the Thrive is solid and fast for the money I paid. Definitely a good phone. I'm looking forward to learning everything it can do.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Karen Halley", "ReviewID": "R1VUUE8NCFEVRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a relaible phone.

LOONEY", "ReviewID": "R2ATXFPED8CFSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone over a year ago, and it has worked perfectly for me. It is a locked att phone and I am currently using straight talk. I get unlimited, talk, text, and data for 50.37 a month. The description of this phone being for children is misleading.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it being locked. At the time I bought it I was a satisfied att customer. I was on a prepaid plan and my bill kept going up. So, I switched to straight talk. Because the phone is locked it will go back to to att sometimes, and that can be a pain. I have to switch it back to straight talk. At this time I have an 8gb micro-disc and 24 aps downloaded, not counting the ones it came with.I plan to buy an unlocked LG thrive in the future.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value.", "Author": "Konrad Finck", "ReviewID": "R1SLA9AQKFA2SD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these phones 2 1/2 years ago and I have been well satisfied with it.  I recently purchased a second identical phone for my wife.  It's not the most high powered phone, but it works well, runs all the apps I need, and can be used on AT&T;'s pay-as-you-go plan without a data plan. I wanted a phone that could be used as a wi-fi only smartphone, and this one fills the bill.  Since I don't do a lot of calling, my total average phone charges for most months is about $14.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Thrive", "Author": "Victoria", "ReviewID": "R10PU6FKZ8XKY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone a few days ago and I love it!

Perfect size and relatively easy to work.  My first ever phone smartphone.  Had no idea how to text or anything fancy.  This phone is only 3G, but I'm too new to this to care.  Fits my hand perfect. Crystal clear display, easier than I thought to work.  Voice record is fab since I am always needing to remind myself to do things when I have no pen or paper.  Good camera and video is easy too. I have only had it 2 weeks, but overall I'm glad I bought this one.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "100% better than palm pixi", "Author": "Melk", "ReviewID": "RBX0PXM0AVXGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For less than the Palm Pixi's we originally bought, we bought these phones (after losing 1 palm the 1st month of having them and another 3 months later) and it is such an amazing difference in the phone quality.  The phone has been easy to use (we are using it on T-mobile), it downloads apps easily and the call quality is great.  I recommend a case if you are as clumsy as I am, there are some really nice ones (the hardcovers protect well).  This has been a great product, you will need a mini sd chip to store anything, I would recommend a 16 or 32 MB one, they are cheapest online here.

It would call 911 for no reason. It was on my counter, and then it dialed 911. Also, I would have full service, and it would act like I didn't, and I could make emergency calls only. I would have to restart the phone then it would work, but it would do it any time I had no service and I lived in a town where the most bars you would have is 2 or 3. It was a huge pain in the ass.
