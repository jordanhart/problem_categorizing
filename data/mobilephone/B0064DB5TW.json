{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Stellar little guy", "Author": "Helm of Morgul", "ReviewID": "R18OV4WSEQVQMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Slender and surprisingly fast.  Sturdy but lightweight.  Mine's scratched up pretty bad -- I have this habit of dropping it on the sidewalk when I'm walking somewhere -- partly due to the phone's small size but mostly my clumsiness.  There's no video recording or flash which is a bummer (but the camera's so pathetically low quality that it doesn't really matter).  I've read people's complaints about pocket dialing and getting extra charges for using the web, but that's an easy fix: Settings & Tools > Phone Settings > Set Shortcuts > Set Directional Keys.  Here you can change the default directional keys (Mobile Web, My Verizon,  Ez Use Handsfree) to whatever you like.  That way if the joystick is accidentally activated, it'll end up in a place that's completely harmless and charge-free.  Despite some of these minor flaws, the Glance still gets an A+ in my book.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best basic phone", "Author": "tz", "ReviewID": "RM8VBLIMA50I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is NOT a smartphone, so only has the basic functions, but they work well.  The battery lasts a long time (especially an extended battery).  It powers on or off in a few seconds, is simple to use, and works well as a phone.  It even does bluetooth.  (I have a Mifi and Samaung Galaxy player 2 and a few other things for Apps when I need them).  Small, but with a good sound.  Only problem is that BitPim doesn't seem to be able to allow upload/download, but Verizon stores will do this for $10.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for basic phone needs", "Author": "Nathan W.", "ReviewID": "R13CYF86UZWA6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently purchasing my second LG Glance, with the first one I owned serving me well for a little over 4 years. That is with a fair amount of (unintentional) abuse--dropping it on the street/sidewalk. The call quality is very strong and clear, much better than I expected. The camera's not great, and only captures still images and not video, but that's not what this phone is about. Once you get used to the centre analogue stick, you'll find it more convenient and quicker than conventional buttons. By far, the strongest attribute of this phone is its small size. In technology, as with many other areas, bigger is not necessarily always better. It is very easy to slide this phone in and out pockets on even the tightest of pants.Overall, this is a great phone that does basic phone functions flawlessly.If all you need to do is send/receive calls, texts, pics, emails, and/or voice messages, this phone will do the trick.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great simple phone", "Author": "nancitanner", "ReviewID": "R1MA64GZ126PRH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm happy with how slim it is and the fact that it works with Verizon's most basic plan.  The only thing I'm not used to is the central knob, which is a little hard to operate because it's small and operates as a \"swivel\" (instead of the basic up-down-left-right clicks, it can move in all directions).  Other than that, great quality calls and easy use.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Durable little phone!
