{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone, nice features, and reasonable price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R11BGMX1JVQTW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a Nokia user for a few years with 6610 as my last handset, and I was little hesitant to buy a phone from a different brand, so I ordered the V330 through T-mobile ($100 upgrade) after I was sure I could return it (within 14 days). When I got the phone I was pleasantly surprised that I liked and I was able figure out and use the most useful features at once, so the phone stays! I will give my detailed reactions to the phone to the paragraphs to follow based to my last phone (Nokia). It is a lengthy review, but you can go directly to the features that interest you.Phone Manual: Covers only the basics do not expect to learn everything from the manual; I was kind of frustrated at first but, as I was discovering features of my own I had a discovery satisfaction.Sound Quality: I will only say that I get the filling that the other person is next to me! The speakerphone is not super, is just ok. The volume for both modes is sufficient.Ring Styles: You can select vibrate, vibrate and ring, vibrate and then ring, soft and loud.Ring tones: I have tried it with midi and mp3 songs. The midis are always excellent, however, with some mp3 the sound is not that good, probably because of the process of converting them to smaller file size for the phone, and I plan to find a good mp3 editor to edit my mp3's for the phone. If you upload a regular song the sound is great, but probably it will use most of the phone's memory. The volume of the ring tones is loud enough but compared to my Nokia is not as loud; however, I never used my Nokia to its maximum anyway but it is nice to know that you can.Personalization: You can personalize the wallpaper, colors, screen saver like most phones, but what I liked most is that you can personalize the home keys (cross in the center), left/right menu keys, and smart key functionality: You can assign them anything you want from the main phone menus like: Phone book, AIM, Ring styles, phone status, e-mail, Bluetooth etc. With that feature I have very fast access to the features I need most.Shape: I like the clamshell design, I really like it when I use games, t-zones or any feature because I can hold its keypad horizontal with my fingers and have a pleasant view to the screen.Screen: Very bright and clear screen.Outside Screen: Blue letters, I like that I can easily see the time. I wish if the ringing mode was shown on the outside screen as well.External buttons: With the volume key and the smart key when the phone flip is closed you can change the ringing style by pressing the volume key first, and then the smart key. In addition, when the phone is ringing and you press the volume key the phone goes to a silent mode of ringing, that's useful because sometimes I might not be able to answer it and I might don't want to reject the call.Camera: VGA: 640x480, nothing to be exited about.Java: You can install java games and applications, there many free on the internet, so if the phone misses a feature you would like to have, there is still hope that it might be a java program for that. I install mine either using Bluetooth or WAP, it took me a while to figure it out. If you want to send a java game or app to game or app to your phone from your computer, somewhere in your pc's Bluetooth application it should have an icon named: OBEX Object Push on \"Motorola Phone\", where \"Motorola Phone\" is the Bluetooth name of the phone. The only thing you have to do is to drag and drop the \".jar\" file to that icon and follow the prompts on your phone to accept and install it.Internet: You can even have an HTML browser on Java (there is one available on the internet to buy), but you have to have the Internet plan in order for that to work. In my opinion it does not worth it to have the internet plan just for that, but if you have it anyway is not a bad idea. By the way, you can access many useful sites just with t-zones like: mobile.google.com, mobile.yahoo.com, in addition to them there many other sites if you do a search for them. For the t-zones e-mail to work you have to have the \"T-mobileWeb\" feature on your plan which I believe is the same as the paid t-zones option T-mobile used to have.The phone is listed to have its own POP3 email capabilities, but there is not dedicated application for that, I am not sure if it is something on the messages area.Messages: I am not a heavy text messages user but I have send a few regular SMS and MMS and I liked the messages application, however I think this phone (I wasn't able to find it) does not have delivery notifications option for SMS, however, there is for MMS.Bluetooth: Is a nice to have, you can transfer files and use wireless hands free. I have tried hands free operation by connecting my phone to the computer as a head set but the sound was not stable, it will be ok for 1-2 minutes, and then it will be terrible.  However, I tried my phone with HS-850 and the sound is great, in addition, I am using the HS-850 with my computer for internet phone conversations and the quality is also excellent. It seems soundwise my phone and my computer are not a good much, it's not a problem anyway I just wanted to test it out of curiosity.Networks: Quadband (850/900/1800/1900) which works with all the GSM frequencies available. In addition, you have the option to select the mode manually (instead of auto): either 850/1900 or 900/1800. In that way I believe you save power because it only scans in two bands instead of four. I have mine in 850/1900, the USA bands. The reception is as good as my Nokia's, maybe slightly better. The nice thing about V330 is that you can attach an external antenna on the back, this is very useful for me because on the office I have 1-2 bars and I have to be still whenever I am talking to the phone, which the external antenna I am expecting things should much more better.Battery: It takes 3-4 hours to charge when it is empty. In terms of battery life it lasts a day or two but keep in mind I used the phone a lot for calling, wap access and Bluetooth usage so I believe will last much longer after I settle a little and I don't \"play\" that much with the phone. I am a little bit disappointed for the battery status indicator, is only three bars, I wish it had more steps like in the phone status, battery information which has six bars on there.Phone Book: Not as good as my Nokia, but is ok. If you want to add more information to a name make sure you transfer it to the phone's memory, you can have more numbers for each person but you will have his name appearing as many times as its phone number's. The good thing there is an option to group the same person's numbers when you go through the menu.Voice Dialing: I don't use it much, but seems to be fine.Calendar: It's called date book and is has what is expected from a calendar, does not have a birthday mode like my Nokia. I think this phone does not have to do lists (some sites list it that it has, at least I was not able to find it).That's my experience with V330 so far, thanks for your patience reading my review.", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "A very sweet little phone", "Author": "D.

It feels well made and has a beautiful quality generously proportioned screen; a definite plus for folks who like games on their cells. Although the Amazon listing calls it a Tri-band phone, it is in fact Quad-band. Most importantly for me, it speaks Mac. Using a data cable ( pick up a cheapie on ebay ) it functions flawlessly with iSync for iCal and Address Book. The only thing that I'm not very pleased about is that contact email and addresses don't seem to transfer to the phone ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ). There might be a way to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem. My phone uses the T-Mobile network, and combined with the \"  all the data you can eat \" program ( around $20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter, and I'm good to go. The set up is a bit complex, but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the  info.It's controls are very easy to use and it looks great, I live in a signal challenged area, but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned. The photo quality isn't anything to write home about, though the zoom feature is pretty effective.  Generally speaking I like my cell phones to have data card capacity, particularly for photo storage, but T-Mobile has a nifty Album feature which lets you store your pics online.

It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating.  Also, I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus, but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time.

Brown \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R2IP72AW5C8X4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies. Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it's blue, not the de riguer black or silver, I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies.

I also purchased a data cable to tranfer pictures onto my laptop, easy!Unfortunately, the signal reception is poor at my place.  Before you buy this phone, check the reception of T-mobile in your area.  This is a great phone if you are lucky to live at a 5-bar region.  Otherwise, get ready to apologize (to the other side of the line) over and over again every time your call gets dropped. :PBy the way, I'm not sure if this is sth. about T-mobile or the phone-- summer daylight saving time doesn't get adjusted automatically, you have to restart the phone (twice a year).", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Phone... if you got a non-defect phone", "Author": "goodluck", "ReviewID": "RMZ6WTX1KILQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The two V330 phones are working great in all functions for three months, then one of the LCD screen went blank.

So far I'm pretty happy with it.  (As some other reviews pointed out, this phone only became available in May.  Reviews saying people have used it for months are probably mistaking it for the v300.)  The jury's still out on T-mobile.Pros --Pretty good voice sound quality-Good sound quality on mp3 ringtones-can communicate with laptop using bluetooth without additional software (I was able to add mp3s)-Screen is very bright-Very long redial list - 10.  (My old phone had 5)-Works well with the Motorola HS820-The size is nice-Plenty of faceplates available (I noticed someone gave it a bad review because it's blue - that's changeable!)-Speakerphone's clearer than I expected it to be.-Buttons are easy to use and intuitive-Outside display is easy to readCons --I'm sure I read somewhere it has USB connectivity. I want to clarify that it does NOT come with a USB cable.-Motorola didn't include any sync software.  It's available for an additional charge.-Menus are not intuitive.-The phone takes FOREVER to turn on.The camera is a typical phone camera.  I certainly won't be using it to take any special shots I want to keep forever. I wish it could store addresses along with phone numbers.I've been using T-mobile for 3 years.  I had a samsung phone from Voicestream, which was bought out by T-mobile quite some time ago.

When I contacted T-mobile, they told me I needed to get a new phone.  Unfortunately, that didn't help.Although it isn't perfect, I like it better than any of my other cell phones or any others I have used.Just a tip - if you are replacing a phone, you can transfer the sim card long enough to copy your phonebook.

And the white outlining was horrible, not that i care that much, my cell goes in my purse.  So i really had to shop.  Finally I ran into the V330 (didnt like the color) but the sturdy look was perfect (i have two small kids).  When the associate was exlplaining all the features i was impressed.

The camara I didnt care about because I have a digital camara of my own but it became a plus because my husband decided on the Razr so we could pic message eachother (his in the army so his gone alot).  And the fact that both the razar and the v330 are both international its a plus too.We are stationed in hawaii and get fairly good reception here but I have noticed that our previously owened v180's didn't get as good reception as the V330 and the razr.

In that time period I managed to drop my phone a number of times, sometimes on very hard surfaces. Other than light scrathes and a slightly misshapen antenna, the phone works perfect. Does it ever drop a call? Yes, if the reception is poor. This is a function of the network rather than the phone. Our phones have not frozen up a single time. I can send and receive text messages just fine, no problems. I never turn this phone off. It needs a recharge every 3-5 days depending on usage, which is quite reasonable. Recharging does take a rather long time, several hours, but hey, nothing's perfect. As far as displays \"just breaking\": please do not store your cellphone in a cement mixer, people! This is a brilliant and sturdy phone, and all the people writing bad reviews have some sort of grudge against T-mobile or Motorola, which is OK, but don't knock a perfectly fine phone in the process.UPDATE: a LOT of the negative reviews are about the V300 which looks very similar to the V330 (identical really, except for the keypad) but lacks many features and in general is far inferior. Any reviews starting with \"I had this phone for a year\" and similar are NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS PHONE. This phone became available in April of 2005.I have owned about half a dozen cellphones over the years. I never paid (after rebates that is) for one and I intend it to stay that way, so this review is not for those willing to blow wads of cash for the latest and greatest because they use it professionally or have an all-overriding need to hear people gasp when they take their phone out of their pockets. Obviously, you would not expect a \"better than free\" phone to have the absolute greatest specs available. Still, the V330 is a surprisingly full-featured phone.I also believe that discussing coverage issues is largely moot in phone reviews, because depending on your geographical location, you may think that signal strengths are absolutely perfect, or that (put your provider here) is the worst carrier ever. I get five bars at my house, but only two or three at my work.So far I only talked to customer service once, but they were perfectly helpful and hold times were not excessive.When I was shopping around for this phone I had a few requirements that I definitely wanted:1. It had to be a flip phone. I had enough of the \"bar\" type devices, especially the cumbersome process of locking the keypads and difficulties of answering calls quickly when fishing it out of pockets, backpacks, etc.2. It had to have a camera. This was just to make it a bit more fun. Seems like you only have half a phone without it.3. I would have liked a quad-band phone so that I could use it anywhere during my travels.I was not too worried about bluetooth, voice dialing, or speakerphone capabilities, but it is definitely nice to have those as well. Bluetooth is especially sweet because you can easily up- and download pictures, games, create new ringtones, etc. without having to pay all those fees to T-Mobile. It is too bad that they have no games on their T-zones yet though.The phone has a decent battery life as well, although leaving bluetooth on does shorten it considerably. The keypad is well laid out and handy, and the \"joystick\" button is easy to use and fairly intuitive. All in all it is a good phone, voice quality is great, and I can actually hear the person at the other end which was not always the case with my previous (Nokia, Samsung, Mitsubishi, etc.) phones.Now for the few and minor shortcomings: The manual is much too brief in the discussion of the many, many features of this phone. Most of the omitted stuff is fairly straightforward to discover though. The built-in memory is not all that plentiful (5 MB). This could certainly be improved upon. Voice dialing takes a bit of patience and I am not fully convinced it is a very useful feature. And the phonebook lists each number separately even if they belong to the same person, resulting in tons of duplicate lines. This is probably the most annoying feature of this phone. But for the money, I can live with that.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "One feature away from perfect!", "Author": "A.

Having bluetooth and mp3 ringtones is awsome; I will never pay for another ringtone, AND they are the actual song (MIDI can go to hell). Quad band GSM is cool because I know that I can get service anywhere in the world. I havent had it freeze or anything. The main display and the camera look great, in some cases the digital zoom is actually useful for shots that will stay on the phone(normally throwing away pixels make cameraphone images look horrible). The quality of the speakerphone and the voice quality  is average, but nothing to complain about. The external screen is sharp and is quite legible even w/o the backlight, imho. Its up to debate whether not having an external color screen is a bad thing, as a color screen needs the backlight and therefore wastes more power. The phone is compatible with any standard 2.5mm headset, which is nice. So the only feature that I really regret is the lack of a flashcard slot. I guess they do this because thats one of the few features that only the high end phones have, but if this had a transflash slot I could use this as an MP3 player (although this this would obviously require the data cable instead of bluetooth). Another very minor quibble I have is that the photos are too small when you have them for picture caller ID, they could easily be a sqaure inch, but the images show up in 1/4 of that size (even though the extra area is completely wasted!). All in all, however, I am very pleased with this phone, I paid $100 for it AFTER rebates, so the price here is a steal.

This phone has the following pros and cons (IMHO):PROS:------1.  Bluetooth: Amazing feature which allows you to download all the pictures and videos from the phone apart from ofcourse the hands-free option. The bluetooth features included are File Transfer, Dial-up Networking etc.2.  Speakerphone: The speaker on this phone is of a real good quality. Of course the quality also depends on the signal strength.3.  External Display: Well light for digital time display, signal strength, battery life and bluetooth indicator. How much more can we ask of an external display?4.  Keypad: Well organized, decent color schemes, ergonomically designed and everything in its place. Some people whine about the T-Mobile logo but its no bother for me.5.  Software: I have always liked the software on motorola phones. Good amount of choice in ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers with download options too. The networking and connectivity is great and office tools (calendar, calculator etc.) live upto expectations. The only flaw in the phone book (as one reviewer pointed out) is the lack of categories (home, work, mobile etc.)CONS:------1. Dimensions: It is a bulky phone which requires a belt clip if you want to save yourself the embarassment of a bulb shaped pocket. If you don't want to wear a clip I'd suggest the RAZR for a few $$$ more.2.  Weight: It is certainly one of the heavier phones in the market. So if you are moving from a lighter instrument you might want to consider this issue.3.  Display: The display screen has the magical powers of going black when the display light goes out (default is 20sec but I had to set it to 60sec to work with bluetooth). Ofcourse by pressing any key it will get back on.4.  Antenna: Considering the fact that this phone is heavy and bulky the MOT guys could have shown some mercy on the size of the antenna. It could have been more like the antenna you would find on a T722i.5.  Camera: It's not the best resolution but would work if you are not looking to make a photography career by using the camera on this phone.I have been researching cell phones for 2 months now. If you are looking for a decent flip-camera phone which won't cost you very much but has the latest features (bluetooth, speakerphone) for a 1 yr contract ... go for the V330.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Motorola V330", "Author": "Albert M.

I travel all over the world, and its good to always be in touch with people no matter where I am (and believe me, I've been to some strange places.)I didn't buy it for the Bluetooth technology or for the built-in camera, though I'm sure they work great too.  To me, a camera phone is a camera phone, and while the Bluetooth technology is exceptional from what I've heard, I have no intent of looking like a cyborg walking down the street.  So scratch that from my decision making.Anyway, the last phone I had was the Nokia 6610 (tri-band.)  It's also a great phone, just a bit outdated (that, and I've superglued it back together twice.)  Comparitively speaking, here goes:1.)  The V330 definately needs to be clipped to your belt, otherwise you have a big bulge in your pocket (no pun intended).2.)  While it weighs 4.3 ounces, is not heavy.  Compare it with all of the new stuff coming out, and it's light.  Besides, if you can't handle 4.3 ounces, then how do you drink beer, with a straw?3.)  My biggest annoyance is the phone/SIM card memory.  Obviously, the phone does not work without a SIM card.  If you're like me, you want your numbers to be storred on both the SIM card and the phone memory, just in case.  However, if you copy everything over from your SIM card to the phone memory, you end up with every number you have being listed TWICE.  There is absolutely no way to tell the phone to only show SIM memory or only phone memory. (I even asked tech support.)The only way to see the numbers once is to have them saved ONLY to your SIM card or ONLY to your phone memory.  The problem is that the SIM card holds 250 entries, while the phone holds 1000.  Given the choice (which I shouldn't even have to do), I use the phone memory.  I actually had to put the SIM card back in my old phone to erase it, as the only way to do it in the V330 is one at a time.4.)  My other quirk is the users manual, primarily the phone book.  The instructions are terrible!  I'd like to think that I'm an intelligent person, but I litterally had to experiment to figure out how to use its features.  And this goes for almost all of the features.  1-Touch Speed Dialing, which you can only use from the phone memory, isn't even talked about.  And the \"Smart Key\" on the side of the phone, I've yet to figure out what it even does.  I guess I'm not smart :-)5.)  The last thing I care about is the fact that I can't lock the phone without going through about a 5 step procedure to do so.  If you don't lock it, the outside butons get pressed, which changes your ringer settings (vibrate, loud, etc...).  If you do lock it, then you have to press a code to answer the phone if it's ringing (hope you remember it), and meanwhile, it keeps ringing and bothering everyone around you.So that's my critique.  I plan on keeping it, just to see if I like it better over time.  It was painful to get it set up the way I want it, buut I eventually got it there.  Just a few leftover annoyances that I'm sure I'll get used to.  Personnally I like the Nokia 6610 phone (as I don't use all of the bells and whistles).  the only reason I got this one is because of it's quad band capabilities, which I haven't yet tested out.", "Date": "July 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE!!!

I'm not saying it should live through that very often. But generally I keep it in my backpack in its own little compartment, and I don't use it very heavily - one or two calls a day, usually no more than 10 minutes. I open and close it gently and I don't drop things on it. It generally has a good life.Lately it has started to flicker on and off when I open it - meaning that if someone is calling, the call gets dropped.

IM can probably be installed- Message inbox memory limited to about 30 messagesUpdate: 14FEB06 - I have had to have the phone replaced because it would not maintain a strong signal and kept dropping calls.  It took about a week of calling customer service to get them to replace the phone, and then they made me return to the dealer to have the problem verified.

The earpiece in my first phone went out (I'm on my second one now), and I had to put everything on speakerphone or dig the phone into my ear just to hear somebody.

Most thematic elements can be changed including Polyphonic ringers, wallpaper, screensavers, etc.So, what is wrong?1.  The phone book is misorganized:  Almost every person I want in my phone book has a home phone number, a cell phone and a business phone.  I want a phone book that has one entry for each name, and then a subdirectory for each of the different phone numbers and e-mail addresses.2.  The 5 way navigation key with center button is hard to use as it is too small, and the button in the center is hard to push, particularly if you have large fingers.3.  The \"call\" and \"hang-up\" keys are not properly backlit so that it is almost impossible to see them at night, even in a nearly pitch black room.  (Why is the camera button well lit when you have no need for a camera in the dark?)4.  The hands-free voice dialing requires such precision in the timing of saying the name, and you have to say the name loud, and in a quiet environment, or it won't work.  This virtually requires you to look at the phone when saying the name, which defeats the purpose of \"hands-free.\"  A person can look pretty stupid yelling out someone's name over and over again in the middle of the shopping mall.5.  The phone is a bit on the heavy side, at 4.3 ounces, although not horribly so.  (For example, the Motorola Razr and Sanyo SCP8200 weigh in at about an ounce less.)6.  The front screen is the typical little motorola blue/gray clock display instead of a proper color screen.7.  The built in speakerphone is not loud enough, particularly when using the Motorola/Cingular leather phone \"glove\" as it covers the speaker.In summary, it is a good phone which, if Motorola had invested a bit more creativity and care in developing, could have been a great phone at the same price.

Ok, so I've had the phone for about a month, ignore people that say that they've had this phone for around a year... they're DUMB... this phone came out May 2005 so they're referring to the Motorola V300 NOT the V330... they look exactly the same except for the awful keypad on the V300. The V330's keypad is more like the V551... it's nice and organized and not crazy looking like the V330. The phone has a nice screen, it's bright and colorful, and if you put it on the brightest setting you can see it outside in the FL sunlight which is great.  The battery life is good too, I get around 5 hours of talk time which is better than my old phone, I use my phone a lot for text messaging, making calls... so far so good. The camera takes good pictures, if it had a resolution of 1 MP it'd be awesome, but the pictures are ok quality and besides I got this phone to make calls and not to take pictures. The menu is great, you can customize it however you want, even the left and right soft keys... you can assign whatever you want. The only downside to this phone is the phonebook, it could be better but unfortunately it takes a while to figure out how to use... those who say you have more than one entry are partly correct... you need to save your contacts on the phone, if you want to add another number for the same person you scroll down to more... then you add a new #, however you're not done yet... in order to only see 1 # for you contact you must go to your phonebook press the menu key, scroll down to setup, then in view change it to \"Primary contacts\", it's on all contacts by default... after doing that you should have 1 entry and you'll have more than 1 number for you contacts, you can even add an email address if you want. Besides the phonebook this phone is great, I'm more than happy with Tmobile's customer service, reception and most importantly my phone... motorola definately made the V330 a great phone.", "Date": "September 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "great deal, bad clamshell", "Author": "Sagar A.

Of course they're not Motorola-sanctioned products, but they can be fun!So far I have had no problems with it, not even with the charger, which several reviewers seem to have issues with.

I even use it as a backup/travel alarm clock!!  The camera is not the greatest, but it is what it is, which is a cell phone camera.  I'm not big on text messaging or games, so the performance of those aspects of the phone are of no real concern for me.I do have two gripes, though.  The first is with the cheap ear piece/headset that comes with it - the little foam cover keeps coming off and it doesn't fit my ear very well so it is constantly falling out of my ear.  I got a Bluetooth headset when I purchased the phone, so I usually use that.  Plus it's nice to have the phone in your pocket or handbag and not have a wire/cord in your way.

There are some things about the V330 that are better and worse than my old V300.For openers, the good things are that Motorola caught on to some of the quick key innovations that Samsung conceived for their phone brands available to Sprint customers:  quick keys to access T-Zones and the camera are the two most prominent.  Also, the V330 has Bluetooth capability, which I can't comment on since I don't have a wireless headset to take advantage of this feature.  Those are the advantages to the V330 over the V300.My disappointments with this phone compared to the V300 is that whenever I am reading or writing a text message, it is interrupted whenever new ones come in.  I never had that problem with the V300, and Motorola needs to work out that issue with all their current and future models immediately.  Of course, the only application that incoming SMS and MMS messages will not interrupt is use of Java-based gaming applications.Also, whenever several text messages come in, or even at unexpected times, outgoing text messages will not transmit to the recipients; the phone has to be turned off and back on, and then each outgoing message has to be manually resent.  This too is extremely inconvenient, and is yet another issue Motorola needs to immediately resolve; otherwise, I may go back to buying Sony Erricson phones as I have never had such problems with their earlier models.Overall, the phone is decent.  It is not superb.

I've had it for about a year now, so I'm under the assumption that it is much like the newer 330 model, except for the new \"blue-tooth\" technology addition. In general, I like TMobile's service. I've been a customer for about 3 years now and except for the gradual decline in acknowledgable customer service representatives (they are so clueless sometimes!), I have no big complaints. But back to the phone...the \"outer\" soft keys/buttons are sooooooo annoying. If you just touch the phone incorrectly it makes that dumb 'churp' noise and changes the ring volume on your phone. It wasn't until I read the previous reviews that I remember how much I hate when my phone does that--it seems that I had blocked-out the whole experience. I'm also having troubles with the charger, and sometimes the words, \"Unable to Charge\" comes across the screen. When the phone is \"Unable to Charge\" you're not able to receive or make calls, use any of the phone's features, or fix the problem without losing your mind (i.e., swearing, throwing the phone, bending and twisting the phone charger's cord, turning the phone on and off and back on again, for example). I've also noticed that if I don't turn the phone off every day or so the phone will sometimes go dead or the words on the screen appear 'encrypted' because they're all collasped on one another (on the outer screen) and the inside screen goes completely blank.

When you're editing a contact, simply go to the bottom of the \"Entry Detail\" and select \"...More...\"  My phone came with quite a large owners manual that taught me all of that.Two additional problems I have experienced is first, with call dropping.  If I don't turn my phone off every few days, when I call someone after 12 minutes it will spontaniously drop the call even though I have a full signal.  This is not a problem if I turn the phone off every 3 or 4 days, perhapse I\"m just lazy.Lastly, if you carry this phone in your purse or in your pocket, expect it to make a LOT of noise.

It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the \"smart\" keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the \"secret\". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Works with Mac and iSync (via Bluetooth!)", "Author": "The Reader", "ReviewID": "R255W25JLZYNPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had my phone for a day, but I wanted to correct some earlier reviews that stated otherwise.

I have never been a big fan of Motorola phones, opting for Samsung since Samsung phones are usually a little more user friendly and offer more fluff.  Let's face it, easy to use and lots of toys isn't always a bad thing.Any way, let's get to the phone.  It is NOT hard to use and I found it much more user friendly than other Motorolas.  The phone is a little bulky compared to comparable flip models but that really isn't a big deal.  All of the fluff features were okay, the browser was a tad on the clunky end and I had repeated trouble downloading from the T-Moblie site.  The speaker phone was phenominal and it allows you to use it with the phone closed, which is very convenient.So the phone itself was great, awesome features and good quality, so why did I not like it.  Two reasons:  1. Weak antenna, and I mean weeeeeaaaaaak.  I lost signal everywhere and got \"no signal\" indications in places my previous Samsung T-Mobile phone received service.  It also seem to take a long time to return signal after losing it.  2.  Weak battery.  I got only about 2 hours of talk time and it took close to 5 hours to charge it.  Not good.I returned it and exchanged it for a Samsung x335.  I now recieve a good signal EVERYWHERE the v330 did not and the talk time on the battery is about the same.  The x335 takes only about an hour and half to charge, is smaller, and packs most of the features of the v330 with the major exceptions of blue tooth (which I don't care about, as I have no desire to walk around looking like George Jetson with that bulky ear piece on my head); no world phone capability (don't care b/c when I am on vacation in Europe I really don't want the phone to ring); and no web browser (don't care, if I want to surf the net I can do it at home).  The only drawback to the x335 is the beyond horrible carrying case and the speaker phone only works with the phone open, which is kind of a pain as it is difficult to put the phone down or clip it back on your belt when talking.If the v330 had the signal and battery strength of the x335 it would win hands down, but it doesn't.  As an added note NEITHER of these phones work as well as my old Samsung S105 variant that finally died after 2.5 years of heavy use.

This phone does just about anything you could want it to do, which is the reason I bought it.  The problem is that it doesn't do any of those things particularly well.  One glaring example is the speakerphone:  it's a very nice feature to have, but you can't use it to dial a number or answer a call.  Your call has to be connected for a few seconds before the speakerphone can be used, which makes it pretty worthless if you intend for it to be a hands-free device.Functionally, I haven't had too many problems making the phone do what I want it to do, but the user interface can be counter-intuitive at times, and I've had several scenarios arise that make it clear that this phone underwent little to no usability testing.  For example, if you miss a call or receive a message while you're on the phone with someone else, the soft-key functions change.  That makes the phone behave unexpectedly if you're not looking at the screen, like the other day when, instead of turning on the speakerphone, the phone put my wife on hold and called my voicemail.Perhaps my biggest gripe about this phone is the charger design.  The connector for the charger is a small, delicate piece of plastic with multiple pins that have to make contact before it will work.  It's extremely susceptible to damage, and any debris whatsoever (such as dust, dirt, or hair) will disrupt the connection enough to prevent it from charging.  Why they won't use a simple pin connector (like Nokia, Sony/Errickson, Kyocera, Samsung, and others) is beyond me.All-in-all, this phone has too many issues for me to recommend it to anyone but the most patient of users.  Trying to get it to charge can be a maddening experience, and after a year of use, the user interface still baffles me from time to time.  I still can't decide if I'm going to use my \"Customer-since-1998\" status to get a new phone, or if I'm just going to dig my old Nokia 3390 out of the closet, but I do know that either choice will be better than continuing to use this phone.", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "LB", "Author": "LB \"lisajbuch\"", "ReviewID": "R19TMZL96II8ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Considering this phone is new to the market, I am laughing at the reviews that say they have had this phone for a year+...Only complaint, wish it didn't look like the v300.Best feature (for me) Blue tooth is compatible with my car...I love driving handsfree:)", "Date": "June 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not that bad of a phone", "Author": "A.

This feature will only become more important. Currently, the only T-Mobile phones that support this band are listed at this website: [...] .

The estimated shipping date has changed to July 21.  I called Amazon customer service 1-800-201-7575 and certainly it wasn't helpful.  I plan to cancel the order if they further delay the shipment.

OMG i find out AFTER, i repeat AFTER i get the phone and t-mobile prepaid service that prepaid customers get NO internet service and can't download games on this phone. OMG this is not the neolithic stoneage period ok, this is the year 2005 people!! t-mobile-- get with the program!! that's like telling me i ordered a flat screen tv and can only watch 1 channel, and that i can't get cable or use my remote control with it. i got a cell phone here that has the ability to do some multimedia stuff, but prepaid customers aren't allowed to have internet access, sheesh.well i was on a monthly service for a long time, and there was a month or two i dished out 1000$ total, because i did not realize i went over my minutes and was making local phone calls for 20-35$/per month. i said enough of this crap. then later i hardly used my phone anymore. my plan was 39.99/mo but w/ taxes, surcharges, etc, it became 50$/month. i said enough of this crap. and i went prepaid.but prepaid companies need to get more competitive. they will get more money and customers that way if you provide customers more options and services.only reason i went with tmobiles prepaid service plan is because they don't charge daily access fee, and other places do. perhaps i might just change to another prepaid service, dole out a bit more cash, in order to get internet service..about the phone, i agree w/ most people the handbook sucks. and all these people talking about you have to put multiple entries in for people w/ different phone numbers- IT'S NOT TRUE. i had thought the same thing but then i went and read it wasn't true, and i read my handbook, and fumbled around w/ the phone. you need to click on PRIMARY in order to maintain one entry per person.it is hard trying to rate the phone in isolation of the service.. i am new to this phone and don't know much about the phone.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Broken after warranty up", "Author": "Bridgett \"Bridgett\"", "ReviewID": "RJYA69YSI4TWB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 1 1/2 years.
