The charger is not a Palm branded one but a cheap knock-off. There was no sync cable.  No CD-ROM with the Windows/Macintosh sync software.Phone is an AT&T; branded phone that has all the standard Palm apps plus a few AT&T; apps.  Phone has been unlocked.  Works fine with a T-Mobile USA prepaid SIM.Biggest issue was after placing the battery in the phone and plugging in the charger - the phone acted flaky. Would not turn on initially. Once on, slow or wouldn't respond to key or screen presses.  Turns out the problem was the battery was shipped completely discharged.  Looks like the phone runs only off the battery and can't run off the charger.  Left the phone on the charger.  The charge light was on but hard to tell if phone was really charging. After about 45 minutes the phone was just slightly warm.  About a third charged.  Phone turned on easily.  Keys responded quickly.  The screen alignment was a bit off.  I aligned the screen.  Phone was working fine.  Put back on charger.  About 2 hours to full charge.  The non-Palm instructions that come with the phone don't suggest charging the phone first.  Says to setup phone first then charge.Bottom line.  Only buy from the Unlocked Kings if you don't want or need the USB sync cable.  And if you get one, charge the battery for 45 minutes before trying to turn on.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective.

I bought the blue one on price alone... I wanted the Centro -now- !Hint, use Cell Phone Kings if you want stuff fast!The only nit-pick I can come up with is, the battery cover is a slightly different color blue than the rest of the phone. Again, I don't care as I want the phone and will most likely be putting it in a case and the blue stuff will be hidden.Standard issue battery... takes a little while to recover from being in storage, just wait it out.The phone comes unlocked but covered in AT&T; logos and infested with applications that only work with AT&T;'s network. Ok, they might work with T-Mobile but I don't have a data account so I can't know.If you are a die-hard Palm user you can edit the ROM but I don't recommend that or do any of that myself. I have an Android phone I screwed-up sitting on my desk to remind me just to leave that stuff alone.Simply set all the AT&T; applications into a Category other than \"Main\" and you don't have to look at them. They are ROM apps so they don't take up any user memory.Several people have mentioned the boxes these phones ship in.
