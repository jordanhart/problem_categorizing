{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Bad...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJX4SV0YN5W7V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone when I renewed my Cingular service about three months ago.  All I've ever wanted is a simple-to-use, reliable, SMALL phone that I could easily carry around.  I have no use for internet features, IM/texting or a camera in a phone... which is probably a good thing as far as this review goes.Cons:1.) The camera is grainy and extremely limited in function.  If you snap alot of pics with your phone, this isn't the one for you.2.)  My first battery wouldn't hold a charge for even one day.  The second one lasts much longer, but still not as long as advertised on the box.3.)  My phone came pre-loaded with only melody and sound effect ringtones, no \"regular\" tones that sounded like a phone ringing.4.)  I gave up waiting on the internet to log on, so I can't even comment on it's functionality.Pros:1.)  It's freaking tiny.  As a guy who likes to carry his phone in a pocket rather than in a belt holster, this phone is the perfect size.  I hardly even know it's there.2.)  Signal strength is great.  I have no problem hearing calls, nor does anyone have a problem hearing me.3.)  The interface is really really easy to navigate though you'll have some problems if you got big fingers.So all in all, I'm satisfied with the Pantech C300 because it does the very basic things I need from a cellphone very well, in a very small package.  All the other features are a bit lacking in my opinion and that is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great reliable basic phone packed with cool features", "Author": "C. DARROW", "ReviewID": "R3579IRB4U31OY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally returned this phone because I thought it didn't meet my criteria for contact info (more than one phone number, e-mail addresses, notes), but I was wrong. In fact it can store 800 contacts with 3 phone numbers, 2 e-mail addresses, notes and other stuff (the SIM card holds an add'l 250 contacts). So I returned my Nokia 6102i (which was too slow in performance for me) and went back to this phone.Cool features:I love the flash with the camera which you can also use as a flashlight (press the down arrow on the outer left side while the phone is closed).  The up arrow pressed down firmly for a few seconds triggers the camera. One button gets you to your contacts, another button directly to the calendar. The navigation performance is FAST! With the Nokia 6102i, there was a delay in navigating. The vibrate mode (which I use) is powerful. The multimedia messaging performance is pretty good. Sending an image to my email took just a couple seconds. Other cool features are a unit converter and world time.This is the perfect phone to carry around your waist even while jogging. I found a lot of the other flip phones out there were too heavy, bulky, long, or wide.The only drawback for me is how long it takes to turn off and on. It takes 10-12 sec to power on and 20-30 sec to power off. Other than this, I love this phone.", "Date": "November 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "better than my last phone, but could be better", "Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "R36GW9YMXHO8T5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want a phone that does a lot, don't get this one.  When I was shopping for a new phone I wanted one that was small, loud, and vibrated strongly.  I had a hard time hearing my old phone (a Samsung x427m) ring or feeling it vibrate in my purse.  I wasn't looking for a phone that did a lot or had bluetooth.  If you have the same requirements for a cell phone as I do, then this phone is a great option.  It's small, it's loud, and it vibrates off the table.Pros:~very small, light, thin~loud~strong vibration~camera (I wasn't looking for a cameraphone, but I like it now that I have it...just don't expect to use it as you would a real camera)~outside screen~you can use the flash as a flashlight...and it's brightCons:~sometimes people tell me they have a hard time hearing me...I find myself having to talk louder than I used to have to on a cell phone~the buttons are small...i often hit 2 at once or the wrong one when texting (not a problem i've had before with other phones)", "Date": "October 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Solid phone with minor flaws", "Author": "Michael Mikkelsen", "ReviewID": "R202INZROY51IL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have only had the phone for a few months but it seems durable enough to last a long time.I am disappointed that you can't put the phone on speaker phone while you are calling someone and it is ringing. You have press two buttons to put the phone on speaker phone and if you have dialed any numbers during the call you have to clear them out and then press two buttons to put it on speaker phone.  If you don't clear out the numbers it flashes over and tries to dial the numbers on the other line.My other big grip with this phone is that it doesn't delete old text messages when new ones come in.  Instead it says your inbox(or outbox) is full and you have to delete the oldest messages one by one or you can delete all messages.  There is no setting to have it automatically delete old messages and that is a pain.I like to color screen on the outside on the phone so you can see who is calling and that you can set personal ringtones for each caller.  You can also assign a picture to a caller.  The only problem is that it can't be a picture that someone sent you from there phone, it has to be one that you took on the camera.  This is very strange since they are both jpg's and both taken on camera phones.  Pictures that are sent to you are stored in a different place than pictures that you take with the camera phone.  They should be stored in the same place.  Conversely you can set the wallpaper background picture to either type of picture.Ringtones and Games - The ringtones that come on the phone suck.  I know this is because they want you to buy rinetones but they should at least have one ringtone that sounds like something ringing.  The phone only came with one game, again because they want you to buy them.I have used the wireless web to read news and sports scores and it works fine.  You have to scroll allot because of the size of the screen but that's ok if you want a small phone.No bluetooth but I'm not a fan of looking like a cyborg any way.The small size of the phone is one of it's best selling points but it should be pointed out that the small keys make it a little more difficult when sending text messages.  If you send more than 2 text messages a day you should consider getting a different phone.  The keys need to be more like the old Motorola Vader.Even with all the things I would change about this phone I still recommend it over the competition.  I hope the designers work out the kinks in the next model and I will buy it again.Here's a Tip/Trick about the phone: Hold down on the external down button to turn on the camera flash and use the phone as a flashlight.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Small basic phone", "Author": "Home Movie Buff \"Riptide360\"", "ReviewID": "RPJWNLE5EF8IS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perfect if you just need to carry a small basic phone.  Not recommended for folks looking for lots of bells & whistles.Call volume and range is good, especially given the small size.Camera image quality is ok for web photos (VGA 640x480), but this wouldn't be the phone for you if you need to make prints from your photos.  It also doesn't take video (surprised).  No memory expansion slot (mini SD or otherwise).The biggest con was the lack of blue tooth support.  If you need to use a headphone you'll need one with wires (argh!).  If your state has a law on requiring you to drive hands free then this might not be the right phone for you.We bought this as a pre-pay Cingular phone plan but were able to get Cingular to unlock it to allow us to use our old ATT SIM in it.", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Allover Great Phone", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1CQAHA2K0J66Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for Christmas.

Sometimes,like when I'm typing in contacts, I'm trying to hit H and it looks like this: .g  It takes a little getting used to the \"back\" button, (the \"on\" button) but otherwise it's great.

I saw the \"worlds smallest cameraphone\" at a decent price $90 and decide that its right for me, especially since it would be my first camera phone. I take it home, after 1 day, I am completely dissatisfied with the phone. Here's why:1) The camera quality is disheartening, something I should've expected when buying a VGA camera, although I've seen MUCH nicer quality VGA cameras.2)The flash is incredibly weak. It basically defeats the purpose of having a flash. At night time, it literally wont have any kind of effect unless your subject is less than a foot away.3)The entire set up of the phone and its features are weak and severely lacking.
