I hesitated because it was as low as it was, but decided to give it a shot, and was rewarded by a well packed, promptly shipped, and perfectly functioning phone - just as described.I would definitely consider purchasing from this seller again (and would recommend them to others).", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really love the system", "Author": "Analise", "ReviewID": "R3EPY5ET3NS4TV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little bit of blemishes on the case but so little I couldn't notice at first.

I bought this phone as \"new\" and appeared so when it arrived in a sealed box. When I took it to Sprint to have it activated, we discovered that the phone had been rooted and a very distasteful bootanimation had been downloaded on it. A rooted phone loses any warranty with Samsung and is very difficult to \"unroot\".
