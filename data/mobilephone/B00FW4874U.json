{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just The Right Size \u2013 Many excellent features in a low cost phone - Detailed Review", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RJAX1VNFAKKB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the low price of just under 200 dollars this is an excellent phone! Personally, I love to upgrade to a new phone once a year and this is my brand new upgrade from my S3 Mini, which also has a 4 inch screen. In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3\" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. After researching this phone before I purchased it, I liked the features all but two things and found ways to work around each! Below are big concerns and how I fixed them!1) The first thing is the low internal FIXED memory, which Samsung lists as 4 GB. This is low and this is the size BEFORE they added the OS and the Touch Wiz to run the phone.So I ended up with INTERNAL MEMORY of 2.15 GB left in which to add my apps. This is no problem I found because I did not install any games or too many apps. Just the helpful and essential MUST have apps from the Playstore. Great news! After I finished adding about 10 apps, I still have close to 2GB left to add more apps in the future!2) Camera has 5MP and this is do-able. At first, I was concerned about this, but found it is not a problem if I take a picture in good lighting or outside. It does have flash on the camera, so this does help. So I took pictures inside and outside and took a look and they looked clear! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Tips using this phone\u2019s camera for CLEAR PICTURES every time: Hold it steady, wait about 3 seconds for the phone\u2019s camera to focus, then take the picture, and use flash indoors.PROS:+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Since the 4 inch screen and smaller phone is sleeker and also lighter, it fits anywhere\u2014no more heavy and bulky phone to drag around.+ MICRO SIM CARD: A couple of months ago I bought a Sim Cutter from Amazon. Glad that I did as I cut my old standard sized Sim card from my old S3 Mini, popped it into the Sim slot and the phone works great! (I could have taken it to my local phone store and bought a new Micro Sim and let them transfer the data to it, but no need). These days, the new phones are going to Micro Sim cards and some new phones (including iPhone 5) will be going to the tiny Nano Sim.+ Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser). Be sure that on the WiFi settings, Advanced that you keep the WiFi on always and to not have the WiFi turn off when the phone is sleeping (or the screen turns off)\u2014this way the WiFi will stay on until you turn it off. Be sure to remember to turn off WiFi when you finish to save battery!+ Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has decent battery life, it is not the best, but the battery is not that large in the phone. I still get all day from the battery IF I turn off the WiFi when not in use and close up apps I do not use. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness.*To save memory and battery life, I wrote an article on how to turn off apps not needed. Let me know if you need this and ask in the comments.**Apps \u2013 I keep my Apps from the Playstore down to 12 MUST HAVE FREE APPS FROM THE PLAYSTORE, and all are pretty small and do not take up much room on this phone nor use much battery. Let me know if you want that list.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE (it is small but do-able):This phone is advertised at 4GB of Internal space. The 4GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 2.15 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.+ CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the LTE model. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the bigger phones such as S4 and S5 etc, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

It was just as seller described.  I have not used it yet as I am still deciding on network usage.  However, I have the Galaxy ACE 1580 and I love it, so I was pleased to see the Galaxy ACE3 out and hopped right on it.  I did check the package to make sure all necessary equipment was in the box and it was.  I also placed the battery in to make sure the phone worked and it did.  I did not go through the entire set up. Once I choose a carrier and use the functions, I will up date my post.  However, as stated the phone so far as features is great, cant't wait to use it, still using my ACE1 and love it so i know I will enjoy this phone even more..I'm still waiting for my protective case also before I actually use it full force, I want to protect it.
