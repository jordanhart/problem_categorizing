I heard, or read, how other users had problems with it locking up,the touch screen malfuntioning, etc...but I have not had one problme with mine.  I bought the phone after all these problems had been fixed.  I rate this high, but I don't think they are making these anymore..shame.  I just bough mine in Spet or Oct of 2010.  Time and technology upgrades just keep on flying by.  The battery lasts a long time.  Not droid or anything, but you can still surf the web and take decent photos.  Great for music! I bought external speakers for this phone, and it sound real good for something so small.  I downloaded two games and I have fun with that too.  Great phone, I think!", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone works for me", "Author": "JHB TX", "ReviewID": "R39WJSIBNB2SO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me, it is small enough to carry in a shirt pocket and light also.

The touch originally had more bad reviews than good, but I am partial to LG phones. I always check out reviews before a purchase. Well the purchase came in a timely manner and activation was a breeze. First couple of days is usally a learning curve. Phone worked well for several days then it just started doing the off things I read about. Touch screen working when it felt like it, signal strength is most likely the most aggevating. My older phones (6) have better strenth. Updated my roaming many times. I live in a rural area so the coverage is some times sketchy. In the big city works great as it should. But it has never been this bad at home. Have not been able to log onto the net after 20 tries. I am not a big user of this feature anyway. I am sure if I contact the carrier I can get it resolved. Gave the phone 3 stars, maybe a little high. The best feature is the MP3 player, mainly why I bought this model. Very Very Loud! Overall you must have patients to get OK results out of it.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone is awful", "Author": "Andy Murdock", "ReviewID": "R3PLVLHYQM76IR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got it, it was pretty cool. I liked that it had a QWERTY keyboard and a touchscreen unlike my previous phone. Everything that a phone should do, it does. The problem is it's so hard to use the phone because of the touchscreen. I haven't had any really critical breakdowns or anything, but the touchscreen comes and goes. One minute, it will work just fine, then I lock and unlock it and it presses the button two down from what I'm actually pressing. The music player is pretty good for a basic phone, but it isn't worth it. You'd be better off getting a different phone.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "more dints and scratches than i expected", "Author": "Kristie Legge \"picky book picker\"", "ReviewID": "R1KN4R63DMOXPZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When we received the phone you could just barely read the packaging addresses. So I was glad to see it made it to me. The phone was listed as \" used condition with scratch and dent \". The picture did not match the phone that was sent to me. The dent was bad enough that a screen protecter could not be applied with out a bubble in its place. Overall the phone works great. If I would have know the dent was so bad on the screen I would not have paid for this one.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "password", "ReviewID": "R1B5EPL1Z1GVXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone a year ago and I found nothing wrong with it I like the style it's cute and it is good quality the touch screen is some times iffy but other than that great phone", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Was great for a while", "Author": "CheyenneHorseLover", "ReviewID": "R39829FU0MEWB7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've got to say that I loved this phone, for a while. It worked great for more than a year, the screen froze occasionally but it was fine for me. Camera was awesome, the music quality is nearly perfect. After about a year and 2 months, it had a breakdown. I didn't get it replaced, at first we thought it was broken but it came back on after a few tries with the battery. It lasted for about six more months, then broke down five times in the same day- either the screen and external buttons stopped working, it wouldn't come on, or it started buzzing like crazy and went black. So if you want a good phone for about a year, then this one is great. If you want a longer lasting one, I suggest you keep searching.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "The worst", "Author": "Antonio C.

It had a pretty tough life in that time.  Occasionally screen would go haywire (not responsive) but it always corrected itself in a few seconds.  Simple, easy to use interface worked very well.  Music player is excellent, way better than the droid x2 I just received. It will not download video (youtube and such)so if your looking for a smart phone, this is not it.  Cruising the internet is marginal at best However, it would get on some social sites, like Facebook, pretty well.  Battery life is also pretty good. I could run a couple days of moderate use without charging it. If your looking for a step up from a basic phone, I think this one would be a good choice.  Did I mention it has an exceptional music player?:)", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Kristina B.

It came out just before I was eligible to upgrade, so it was nearly perfect timing for me to get one. I was sick of my enV2 constantly messing up, failing to send and receive calls and texts, and buttons not working. This phone was really cool, the first month I had it. It has an MP3 player, 3.2 MP camera and a full touch screen. I treated this thing like a baby, and within the first two months I was calling Verizon for a replacement. It freezes a lot of the time, and like the enV2 fails to send and receive calls, even after I program the phone for the newest update and have a full set of bars for service. The touch screen keyboard is a mess, it usually takes me a few tries to get my text messages right with the words I want before I can send it. The T9(Word Guess) system is very poor as well. It suggests words that don't even exist or don't relate to what you're typing. Even my enV2 had a decent T9 system. So overall I would NOT recommend this phone. It's been just over a year I've had it and I'm already on my 4th \"Like New\" replacement from Verizon. And again, this is with treating it like a baby. So please take my advice and buy yourself something else.

But it was Verizon that would not activated the phone.  I have an older cell phone plan that's cheaper than the current plans they offer.  The only way they would activated this phone was if I changed to their more expensive plan even though I did not want the data package.  This is not a smart phone was my argument as well as being a long time customer.  One store manager actually told me customer loyalty means nothing any more.  I went to 3 different Verizon stores and spoke with 3 different managers; I called customer service and always the same response: they refused to activate the Chocolate Touch.  I researched this product for weeks and read there would be no problem to activate.

It worked well enough for the warranty to wear off, and then it was all downhill from there.  This is the third phone I've had, and my other two both lasted more than 4 years each, so I know it's not me as a cell phone user.  The touch screen does weird things.  While I'm composing a text message it will randomly press buttons on its own. When I have it on the home screen, it will do the same thing and end up calling people and I won't even realize it.. Or it will hang up on people while I'm on the phone with them. It goes into the menu on its own, I have to manually lock the screen as soon as I finish using it so that it won't call or send random letters in text messages to people.
