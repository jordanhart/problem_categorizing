Phone was great, BUT she could not send or receive messages with photos.  Went to T-Mobile and spent several hours with their people trying to determine the problem and fix it.  The problem:  the phone would not connect to a data (2G/3G) network.  In the end, the T-Mobile folks declared that the phone was defective.  We returned the phone through Amazon (which worked very smoothly and quickly) and purchased another DEFY through a different vendor on Amazon, and when it arrived, it had the same problem.  After deciding that the likelihood of two separate vendors selling defective phones was unlikely, I did some \"research\" on my own and discovered that the actual problem was that the APN was not setup in the phone (actually found the settings on T-Mobile's web site).  After inputting those settings, the phone works like a charm!My only complaint about the phone is that Motorola, the vendor, or whoever is selling these phones does not include the information about setting up the APN even if that meant consumers had to contact their service providers for these settings!  It was a very simple \"fix\" in the end, but we went through lot of unnecessary run-around to discover it.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEST I EVER HAD!!!!", "Author": "CharlieBoo", "ReviewID": "R2T6O88C53EIY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok I must admit I havent owned alot of high tech phones in my time....this is my second Android. My first was the Optimus Me and its still around :-}. im not any good at specs or going into details but what I can tell should b helpful. Xcuse me if I spell wrong or miss out words, im on my Defy ;~)Ok first off I am too impress with this phone not to leave a review. This is my second day with it and I havnt put it down yet. Its fast...real fast I love that! The design is sleek, the screen is big and its very comfortable in my hands! I love that the camera i have taken some extremly nice pics even in the pitch dark!The most important feature on a phone to me is the camera and this is a extremly good camera for $160! Even when its pitch dark I got awesome pics. The flash works! The sound from the phone is great and I havnt found anything to complain about I am really happy with this phone. a friend of mine purchased it for me from amazon and it arrived ontime as well!I can stream movies from the free movie sites and watch online while im mobile, thats a first for me and here in the bahamas the edge sucks! So beleive me...this phone is fast!Compared to my LG Optimus Me the only thing that would of made this phone more awesome is if i can turn my EDGE on and off as desired. This was a neat feature with my Optimus Me just having to pull down the notification bar and tapping to turn on/off the Edge. Also its not a big problem but sometimes I wish the phone had at least two hard keys like. These are minor things though and I still wouldnt trade my Defy MB525 for anything :DUPDATE** DEC 17 2012I forgot to mention that even thought the box and the description of this phone said that it comes with a 2g SD card...it doesn't! I saw that some others mentioned that in their review and just thought I should let you know that too. This was not a big deal to me. I already had a SD card in my Optimus so I just put it in my Defy when i changed the SIM...Someone also said that the APN has to be set that is true also. I thought all APN's on what ever unlocked phone you purchase would have to be set if your not buying it from your service provider...Any Way It took me like two hours to figure out how to set it KML! Which was really dumb of me considering how easy it was! (im not sure if it was in the manual I didnt read it lol) Any way setting up the manual was simple. All you had to do was1.go to settings2.go to wireless  & network settings3. tap mobile networks4. tap 'Access Point Names'5. instead  of being dumb like me and tapping the screen for the longest and holding it down for minutes and minutes and wondering why its not responding............................just press the first soft key at the bottom on the left side of your phone (not sure what its called the one with the 4 little boxes)6. Then tap 'New APN'7. Set a 'Name'8. Set a 'APN'  if you dont know your service provider APN call them and get it from them, SIMPLE!.9. leave everything else as it is press the go back button and you will be prompt to save.****UPDATE** Decemeber 31 2012I recently found out how to turn the edge on and off. What you have to do is:1. Go to settings2. Tap on 'Data Manager'3. Tap on 'Data Delivery'4. Uncheck the box next to 'Data Enabled'That should do it. It works but with my LG Optimus Me it was easier just pullng down the notification bar to Enable and Disable. But any hows.....this will have to do.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Lamonuwell", "ReviewID": "R24W6GDCPBS1GD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When, the phone first arrived I was quite surprised by the size of the phone. The phone is really really thin and feels as if it ways no more than a lb or two. But, it's a very beautiful phone; it had not one scratch on it and came with everything that a phone out of a regular store would have. I have had this phone since January of 2011 and have not got one scratch on the screen so far. I dropped it in water on multiple occasions and the phone still works perfectly. Although, every time it landed it water the phone acted unresponsive until I dried the water off of it and then it worked like a charm. My only complaint about this phone is that it is a Motorola phone and Motorola updates their phones really late in the game or does not at all. So, the phone came with android 2.1 and the phone was very unstable, froze all time, and just made me want to throw it at the wall, but after the phone received android 2.2 it ran a lot better and was not as glitchy. Also, my phone did not come unlocked it came ready for use at T-Mobile only, but I have T-Mobile so, it wasn't that bad. It still freezes from time to time, but not as much as before.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "An average-good phone, but everything as it was promised", "Author": "Cristina, from Tarrytown , NY", "ReviewID": "R2LESNS7RFSQYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Waterproof, Satellite GPS, Android 2.2, 5 MP back camera.Cons: No frontal camera (and no skype video calls), No HD camera, The processor is not as fast as other smartphones.PROS:-This motorola defy really turned me up since i`ve known it was waterproof, and thats a very good point at least for me, because i already lost two mobile phones because of water disasters. I tested that funcionallity with courage and it really doesn`t do anything to the phone at all.-In the package, there were lots of things, including in ear headphones, a car charging adapter and also a normal wall charger with the europe plug (international version) but it does come with an adapter to the american plug, to my surprise.-The Satellite GPS is a really great funcionallity, because you don`t need to use 3G neither internet to access maps and get directions to places, and it`s pretty fast too, it helps me a lot when and don`t know wwhere is some place i have to go, and i don`t even need to pay anything such as a 3G network.-I don`t have much to say about Android 2.2, it`s a pretty good Operational System and apps (widgets) are pretty nice with a big extension of apps. And you can even update if a new one comes out.CONS:-I think the really big thing that pisses me off is that Defy doesn`t have a frontal camera, and if you don`t have a frontal camera , skype automatically doesn`t make video calls, whitch i like to do it very usually. Another thing is not having an HD camera, but the 5 MP camera is not that bad, although HD is something that much cleaner and with more details (definition).-The `not that fast` processor doesn`t make that much influence in the usual lite applications, but it makes some difference when you play some games and heavy apps.My final conclusion is that this phone is a good phone for my routine and durable, and if you keep it protected it is even going to resist any kind of liquid.

By far this is the best phone I ever bought. I'm tired of having products that break down after 1 year. This phone has the potential to last for years. Honestly Motor Blur a bit too cumbersome, however I changed the ROM and it is as smooth as needed. Forget other phones that can't take a beating, I was this phone daily like I wash my hands. Something about the extra freedom of not worrying about your phone getting damaged. Just as robust as humans are. Battery life is great! I use it constantly for 2 days straight without recharging. Truly well done Motorola. You've fallen far from the tree, only now to sit atop it in the last few years. I hope you continue to make honest products like the Motorola Defy. You should market it as a phone that truly sets you free. No need to worry about it getting wet, or getting scratched as you have the gorilla glass. You can take it into the shower while listening to music, watching TED videos.  Truly a great product. To me Motorola is producing honest products.

When I first got it, I fell in love with it. It is very light and durable, the screen is made of gorilla glass so it is hard to crack. After I had this phone for about a month or 2, it became very slow and started to reset itself on its own. You can't play certain games such as Fruit Ninja because it starts to lag. The only good game that works okay is Angry Birds. Now I've had this phone for about 6 months and sometimes when I get a phone call, the phone will ring but it will not let me see who called or allow me to answer. It only happens once in a while but it is still very annoying. I finally managed to crack the screen and now when I touch the cracked part, it will select something on the other side of the screen.

I actually first got the HTC Sensation from Tmobile, but returned it the next day for this phone cause it suits me much better (I torture my phones). I don't regret the trade at all! This is a 100% android phone with all the awesomeness of the android marked, gps, netflix, and Pandora, and it's practically indestructible. I throw it in my cargo pocket along with keys and what not and it never scratches, I've dropped it multiple times and dropped things one it, still no scratches or cracks.. I actually took it for a 4 hour tubing trip down the river, the ultimate test, and it survived!!! I literally had it sitting in my cup holder on my tube with just the speaker out of the water so we could still have music. I threw it in my pocket and walked thru the river, with it continuously submerged in the water for minutes at a time. I can't believe it survived!! Still works flawlessly. I can't imagine owning any other phone now. Also, it's the perfect size. That's one reason I didn't like the Sensation. It's a monster. The Defy is also very lightweight, strangely lightweight actually.. VERY loud speakers - earpiece and main speaker. Fast processor for smooth operation (8MHz - new one's gonna have 1GHz), bright screen. Good battery life, not great, but I'm used to dumb phones anyways.... and 7 screens.. I don't know what you could possibly do with that many.. I only use 4.5 haha.. Great phone, love it, truly can take a beating and be submerged.

This phone has similar specs. Lighter CPU but better RAM and storage. The main plus is that the phone is durable. Way more durable than the n1. The body is plastic so it WILL get scratched and pitted when you drop it. The screen is gorilla glass and seems pretty durable so far. The USB and Headphone ports have plastic plugs that are supposed to make the phone water resistant. Definitely get the feeling that they will work as advertised. I am not sure how long the plastic will last as you are constantly plugging and unplugging the ports.Software: I immediately flashed the device and installed cyanogenmod 7. Once I chose the China as by baseband (I live in Los Angeles, CA) My reception problems went away. The software is snappy with the occasional hangup. Screen reorienting is slow but no worse than the n1.3G: This is the big one. I have an unlimited data plan with T-Mobile. I have not been able to get this phone to use 3G service. I have been reading up and trying every available patch. It looks like the T-mobile version of this phone is designed to operate on their 1700 Megahertz band for 3g. The phone that I bought on this page does not operate on the 1700 band. I think that this is the reason that I do not have 3g connectivity. It doesn't look like there is anything that I can do to fix this. I will keep the phone even though it is only working on edge as the n1 is broken. 3g would make this phone great even at 2 years old.NOTE: I am going to contact T-Mobile again tomorrow (1.17.2012). If they can give me 3g connectivity with this phone I will post an update. If you never hear from me again then I have had no luck.

Less for me to toss out, though. ;)This phone was *not* unlocked, but I found out (by chance, actually) before ordering, and ordered anyway -- at that price, I could always get T-Mobile to unlock it if I really needed to.But actually, this has worked out for me.

The battery cover was coated in some gel but I really had to mash down the cover when locking it because it wasn't lying flush.

The first one was purchased based on the claim that the phone is \"rugged\".  It fell from my lap onto the floor 24 inches below, shattering the screen.  It wasn't thrown, it wasn't stepped on- it fell.  I purchased a new one, along with an otterbox case.  This one lasted 24 hours before the micro USP port simply lost connection.  It broke off internally, or was possibly never connected to begin with.  I returned it, recieved a new one, and this third one lasted all of 3 months before one day it simply froze and the screen turned blue.  That was it.  No rough use at all, no pushing this feeble device to it's limits by excessive internet use, overloading the memory, no overcharging, no downloading of potentially harmful files.  I had taken gentle care of it in light of my experience from my first phone of this model.  I hadn't expected much based on the price, just the ability to play music and check the news and weather, and the claim that it was rugged.  I've owned a good number of phones, and take responsiblity if I've broken them myself, as has been the case- but this phone is just plain garbage.  Expect 2-3 months of use, if you are careful.  When it does break, you can have it repaired by paying $100USD for a new mother board (yes, seriously!), or send it to Motorola, which will take longer than the time you had with the phone before it killed itself.  Motorola themselves warn you that it will be a two-to-three month turnaround if you decide that this phone was so great that you want it fixed.  But you won't.

I've switched mine over to Cyanogenmod 7.2.I currently have a Lycamobile sim in it that gives me pay-as-you-go cheap service on the T-mobile network.I've yet to see it go into 3G fast data mode ...  it does voice and Edge speed data okay and of course, WiFi.Personally, I would NOT count on this phone as being very water-resistant, perhaps a little more so than the average smartphone, at least it has caps that fit over the headphone and micro-USB ports.  So probably okay to use in a light rain or handle the occasional splash -- but not to leave in your pocket while you go for a swim!For example, the back cover fits niccely and has a mechanical latch so it won't pop off when you drop the phone... BUT NO rubber \"o-rings\" that I would expect to see in a true water-resistant device.When I get to a city with full 3G coverage, I'm going to try the various software baseband switching modes (available via an app on a rooted phone) and see if I can get it working at 3G speeds...  I'll update this review if and when...This phone is circa 2010 technology, but plenty enough \"power\" to do most things one would want to do on a somewhat-less-than 4 inch screen phone that really fits in your pocket.Personally, for me, the next size up is to go with a 7 inch tablet for reading, games, video, browsing...

I was so excited, and this phone really impressed me with its abundance of great features.- Call quality. Since I switched to this phone my wife has commented on how hard it is to understand me and how muffled the calls are. It also drops a significant amount of calls, which is great because who wants to talk to their wife anyway? Am I right? It's fun when the little answer slider freezes, so I can't answer the call and it just keeps ringing. Usually it stays frozen for a little while after that, making it impossible to call the person back or answer if they call right back. I love it.- Auto-shutoff. This feature is perfect for people who use their phone as an alarm or do a lot of business and expect important calls. It's really convenient to check my phone and see that it's not even on, and possibly hasn't been for hours. It was especially useful when I was late for work because it shut off during the night. I like how it doesn't matter if this phone's plugged in or not and this feature still works.- Tons of space. The best thing about smart phones is the selection of apps. This phone has enough storage space to get about 5-6 apps on it before runs out of space. Since many apps can't run off the SD card or need at least some space on the phone, the on-phone storage is awesome. I especially like the low space warning I constantly get to see. It's gotten to be a fun little hobby of mine deciding which app to get rid of so I can try a new one. Hopefully they improve this feature on the next version so we can only fit 1-2 apps on it. I also like how I can't uninstall really important apps I use daily like Facebook and Google stuff. I also like how many apps like notepad, calendar, email, etc. can't be removed, even if you use other apps like Catch, aCalendar, and Gmail. That way you'll always have back-up apps that you don't use taking up space so you can't put more apps on.- Battery. The battery on this phone is great. It usually lasts almost an entire day, unless I do anything with the phone. I'd guess that every time I run an app ten minutes drop off the battery life. This is perfect for using the navigation app. If' you're in a big city and it takes a while to get to your destination, the battery will drop very quickly. This makes it safer to drive since you won't be distracted by your phone, plus you get to see the sights of the city while you drive around looking for your destination. It's also convenient how accurate the battery gauge is. If my phone dies and I plug in my charger, it will instantly be at 20% battery. That's some futuristic technology.- Wifi. This may only be a feature of the Republic Wireless customers, but it's very convenient that the phone disconnects from wifi, won't auto-connect to my home network, and doesn't search for wifi anymore. It used to, which seemed like a good feature considering the wifi ratio requirements for Republic users, but now I see how much easier things are this way. Why would I want to connect to wifi when I can use the 1x cell network and mess up my ratio?- Processing power. This phone is a beast. It's really powerful and can run anything you throw at it. I got Temple Run (1) to run on this and it only lags 60-70% of the time. The heat-up feature is good because then you know when you've played a game for more than five minutes. It helps me control my playing time. I haven't tried most games on it since the first three or so made it crash, so that's really worked out for me. Instagram only crashes 40% of the time.- Camera. My previous camera was one of the first Canon Powershot models from 1996 that a roommate didn't want when he moved, and the Defy's camera is much better than that. It takes really grainy, pixelated photos that have a great film-like look. Setting the color balance is a snap, and it usually still turns out heavy on the green spectrum which is perfect for me since green is my favorite color. The camcorder feature is really cool, too, especially if you aim directly into the sun so there's enough light to pick up video. This camera is at least as good as the VHS camcorder I got from my parents. The footage looks very similar, too, so I can edit video from both cameras together and not tell a difference.A few other features that are cool: not syncing up with Dropbox even though the accounts are linked and auto-sync is turned on; screen dimming time doesn't match up with the settings--to make it dim after 10-15 seconds you set it to dim after 3 minutes; contacts that don't show up after you add them--I can sometimes find them under \"favorites\" or their name and info shows up when they call, but isn't in my contact list anywhere; and on and on.Motorola really did their homework when they made this phone. It has everything you could want in a smart phone. Plus, it's super durable which keeps all that powerful hardware safe and makes it really hard to take the battery out when the phone completely freezes and won't respond to any button you push. Overall, I love this phone and can't wait to smash it, destroy its insides with pliers, and put the video on youtube.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Glenn R Johnson Jr", "ReviewID": "R114FFNGEIW2ZL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is awful.
