HELLO MOTO!", "Author": "bryan", "ReviewID": "R3W34NEBJLQWEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I travel to four different offices across three states and have had trouble getting reception with several other cell phones in the past, but these Motorola KRZR'S ARE FANTASTIC. I bought my first krzr, a blue one approx. four years ago and it was great. I talked to people that most of my friends could not. When it started to get a bit beat up, I ordered a black one from Amazon, which I think is an older model but I love it also. I'm going to order another one for backup for later. I believe that Motorola is probably the strongest sending and receiving devices on the market. It's too bad the other companies can't make cell phones that powerful. Nice and small and powerful. p.s.I don't use internet on my phone. It is most important that I be able to make and receive calls on the road. If that is most important to you, then get yourself a KRZR NOW. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
