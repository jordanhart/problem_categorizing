{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Careful what you pay for!!!", "Author": "Jim F", "ReviewID": "RXL1E3X5HSQOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has been a disappointing and frustrating experience. The gist of the matter is that this phone is not what i took to be advertised on Amazon by Worldwide Distributors. I assumed it to be a Unlocked android device which is updated by Google, like other \"Nexus\" devices.When the phone arrived i noticed that the box itself was not sealed the battery was in its plastic pouch which was crumpled and was already opened. When i booted up the phone it did not ask me to log into a Google account (like a normal, new android phone would do) it booted straight into the home screen. I ignored all this, considering a couple of factors, i had to travel out of the country and needed a reliable phone and since the phone basically worked i was OK with this fact. The phone hardware itself looked new. When i contacted the seller i did not mention the above to them since it was not pertinent to the issue i had at hand which is described below.Just about a month after i receiving the phone it began to reboot continuously and i had to do a factory reset which wiped off all my data. Unfortunately i was travelling at the time out of the country and i was not able to contact the seller (Worldwide Distributors) immediately.When i contacted the seller (Worldwide Distributors) the only line i got to hear in their emails was that i was out of their month long warranty period and they would do nothing about it.After a little digging i discovered another issue, that this phone was a version of Ice Cream sandwich that is not updated by Google but rather by Samsung (This is not advertised on the product page) and even that is not happening (it is stuck on ICS version 4.0.1). This is a Japanese version of the phone which is for NTT docomo and has the yakjuxe version of the firmware.Basically the whole reason for buying this \"open\" phone has been nullified and i feel like i wasted $530 odd dollars over it.What happened to accountability for what Worldwide Distributors is selling?? I would never purchase another item from Worldwide Distributors again!", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Near to Perfect Smart Phone, overall better than any nearest Rival", "Author": "Manish Garg", "ReviewID": "R258DUL73K4003", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just completed two month of owning of Samsung Galaxy Nexus and I have no doubt declaring I am very happy with this. This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being until iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S3 releases. I had iPhone 4 for 2 months and I like many other people who could not be satisfied with beauty and fruit brand alone threw that 'dumb beauty' . For me that was more of a 'show off' rather than of practical use.Apple itself in a recent patent suit directed against google termed this as the \"most creditable competitor to iPhone'. Apple co founder which is not a apple employee anymore and hence free to speak truth freely declared iPhone easy to use but 'Android more feature rich'. He dismissed Siri totally saying he could not understand how come internet could be needed to make a call through Siri. Do I need to say more now? If yes then here is the detail review:Like ->(1) Bigger HD contour display-> Though you can distinguish between pixels while looking closely unlike iPhone's Retina display, Nexus's display is gorgeous. Colors are very vibrant and rich. Black is real black (because of Super AMOLED display technology) which creates the whole difference.The Screen is large and with medium hands I can reach to the whole screen stretching the thumb or fingers. Sometimes I tend to use the other hand (luckily I have two hands and both are fully functional so can't complaint).Because of bigger screen this phone is more useful or convenient for what Apple invented iPhone for ie Browsing web, playing games, watching videos. And because of this I tend to depend lesser on PC/laptop/tablet. With bigger screen, power and customization of Android OS this phone is closer to our old friend PC/laptop.**I run the same HD video both on nexus and iPhone 4S and nexus one was better to watch.**(2) Soul-> The soul of this device is ICS OS which is now equal to iOS in terms of user friendlessness but is better because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power. This is different feeling than using dumb iOS. After using ICS I really struggled to use the iOS or same iOS based apps. ICS is lightning fast and smooth.Face unlock, NFC, android beam and google wallet (not available on Verizon version) are very cool. Face unlock works perfectly.Built-in Data usage monitor is very helpful for not letting you go above your data limit.-> Mine is international unlocked version which within a week got automatically updated to 4.0.2 from 4.0.1.This has Best notification, better customization for web browsing.Ohhhhhhhh... did I tell you android has taken two steps which is miles ahead of time and going to change the things completely? (i) No Physical button-> The buttons are in fact part of OS itself and function well. Hence the buttons can now be context specific and smarter. They change their position depending on how you are holding the phone or what you are doing. While watching video they disappear completely giving you the whole screen for watching, and yes they will reappear on appropriate place when you need them. (ii) Same OS for all devices: Unlike Apple now same application can run on any device running on ICS. For apple the applications need to be written separately both for iPhone and iPad. That's why Apple has lesser applications on iPads. With new approach of ICS now people will just write once and run it anywhere hence number of apps is going to get multiplied faster on ICS.(3) Eco System (Apps)-> Android eco system (or app market) is there on par with Apple eco system. In the same period I have installed more applications than I did on iPhone 4 (because most applications are free compared to Apple). I am more functional on Android than I was on iPhone 4. There is nothing which I want and its not there. And yes now google going to start monitoring of applications so less argument against Android apps.(4) Form factor-> I like its form factor more than of iPhone's. Countered makes it more convenient to use and keep in the pocket. Now to me iPhone is just any another device and I look on iPhone with pity.(5) Battery-> I need to charge it once a day with low to moderate usage which is what other iPhone 4S customers are also doing. And if you are going to use it like laptop you will need to charge it more (is not this same with your laptop?). Better part is unlike iPhone you can carry batteries and change it easily. No complaint here.(6) Reception-> Decent.(7) Call quality-> Nice.(8) Volume/Speaker-> Low, could be helped with volume control plus application.(9) More social-> Very well integrated with google.(10). Build-> Except the battery cover everything else is of high quality. I don't care about plastic versus metal debate. iPhone even with metal and corning glass are equivalently fragile and people have been reporting iPhone being broken having dropped just from 12 feet or so. And with gorilla glass on both ends iPhone 4 is more fragile. Remember gorilla glass is just scratch resistant not damage resistant.(11) Typing-> is a breeze and it seems to read you mind and hence make typing a different experience than on iPhone. And big screen helps every here again.Unfortunately this phone decided to do have some deliberate suicidal traits perhaps to avoid wiping away other Samsung devices. So here are the things which could have been improved upon:(1) Speaker-> Could have been better (Minor+ issue)(2) Reception-> Though not much complaint, Could have been just a 'little' better (Very Minor issue).(3) Camera-> Could have been better definitely.(4) External Storage-> Either they should have allowed adding external storage or given the device with more alternated with respect to storage capacities. (Minor issue)(5) Display-> Should not be able to distinguish pixels (Minor issue but this should be ultimate goal for the display)Conclusion-> This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being if you can live with some minor issue with volume. And all issues reported so far with this device seem to be software issues and should get corrected with updates or third part applications.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Must-Have for any Android Fan", "Author": "Eduardo Ecenarro", "ReviewID": "R258HZ5CCPUU9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon, as usual, shipped it very promptly. The quality of the phone is excellent and it doesn't \"feel cheap\" as you might read in the reviews. The phone BestBuy has on display is the cheap-display version that has a picture instead of the Super AMOLED 720p screen. The screen is big and beautiful. Netflix has it's mobile match. Pandora, it's confident. I must add that the firmware is yakjuxw (at least for the one I got). As soon as it got online it downloaded and installed v.4.0.2 with no problems. It is working great on T-Mobile, 3G is perfect. So far you won't be able to install (legally) Google Wallet, the Market won't let you because of carrier compatibility. I'm an owner of a factory-unlocked Nexus One that I really love, but stock Android 4.0 is soooo much better. This phone comes with a decent set of in-ear Samsung earphones with microphone. It has 16GB of memory, but according to current news Samsung won't be releasing a 32GB for the GSM model. I wouldn't wait for it. With Google Music I have all the music I have stored for free in the cloud. Along with Picasa, Dropbox, and Youtube I SERIOUSLY don't have the need to store locally at all. Cloud services make local storage obsolete and that is the beauty of Android. I rather buy directly from Amazon than any other place it is sold in. The iPhone seems like a feature phone compared to this. This is a true tablet in your pocket. I love the resizeble widgets and all the management features.

It has never (and I mean NEVER) 'misbehaved' in any way whatsoever. It has been able to do all of it's software updates properly and is running now on 'Jelly Bean' OS (4.1.1) The screen is great, its colors superb, it has taken and worked with every single application I have tried for it 'like a sir'.

The animations are smooth, the browsing experience is almost natural, installation of new apps easy. It's slim, light and, for me, the perfect size. Could be big for some, that's true. Haven't tried headphones/audio output yet, nor the headset that comes with the phone yet.Some disadvantages that I can tell so far:- The battery is weak for the device. It should have been a 2000mAh or more, not a 1750. At least the recharge time is fast enough- The volume of the speaker could be louder- For my version I didn't get the last ICS.

I'm was a Samsung fan until about 10 minutes ago when I called customer support for a repair to my poor Galaxy Nexus.  I dropped it and cracked the screen.  I was fully prepared to pay for my mistake; for which I was told that would be somewhere around $150.I called support on Tuesday and was told to call back on Friday because they needed to enter my IMEI number into the system since it was an international phone.  I called back today and was told that they cannot help me since it is international and forwarded me to another customer support rep.  10 minutes later we started over again, collecting my data until they asked for my address.  \"Oh, you're in the US?  You cannot use us because we only service Canada\".  WTF?I was put on hold again for 20 minutes and ended up back in the US, but for television support.  This is when I start to get a bit.... angry.  I bit my tongue and asked for a manager.  I was put on hold again (10 more minutes) and I was back from where I started: US phone support.  I told the new agent my gripes and asked for a manager.  She would not immediately connect me, but insisted that we go through the entire process again.  10 minutes later I was put on hold for a manager.10 minutes later I get a manager and we started the process over AGAIN.  I was shaking saying, \"If I have to tell you my phone model one more time, I'm going to lose it\" kind of voice, but did my best hold on.  The resolution?  \"Sir, you need to find someone in Europe with a European address to get the phone sent to\".  I kinda lost it.  :(I'm sure the manager could care less, but I told him that this is why people pay the extra money for an iPhone.  I love Android, but when something goes wrong, it's nice to know that you can just walk into an Apple store and get it taken care of immediately.  I want Samsung to know this.  I want them to understand that customer care is a big deal.  I like your products and would love to buy more, but what's the point if they don't care?tl:dr  If you buy an international phone (Europe) and want it repaired, you have to find a friend in Europe to get the phone sent to because they will not help you with a US address.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slide in the card and go", "Author": "oh_dhart", "ReviewID": "R2C7FD89ZEYPMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is everything I researched.
