Of course you buy a phone to use as a phone and this one I think is great. Great clarity in the call, so far no dropped calls.  This phone has exceeded all my expectations and has so much more. Purchased it at a corporate metro store and phone was up and running when I walked out. Easy to read and for the most part easy to transition to.  I don't consider myself a tech person and I was able to get the basics down in one day. Used the navigation to go somewhere touristy for fun and it did excellent. Oh and love the voice to text feature!  surprisingly accurate, but please proof read before sending. Ha ha its not perfect. The only reason I don't give this phone a 5 star rating is battery life is a must for a phone, and this little beast is more than just a phone. It's a power packed mini computer which uses its energy. I ran low on on battery life because I forgot to recharge the night before, and it only made it through half the day the next day. I blame myself for the mishap; but I was also using it for several functions too.  I am able get about 3-4 hrs battery life using all the functions: camera, web surfing, email, facebook, app.games, phone, txt, etc... and 5-6 hrs if i used it for primarily texting and phone use only. camera takes beautiful pics and gorilla glass is awesome. web pages load awesomely fast with a dual processor and the option to switch to wi-fi is nice too.  I'm really happy with this phone as long as i can keep it charged. solutions for the battery issues: either purchase an extra battery to have on hand or make sure you have a charger for car and home!  Fyi, my connect is not a prepaid, it is a standard lg connect. so the phone bills either way.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, best on Metro PCS at this time", "Author": "OhhWell", "ReviewID": "R2BX6WI05VCF0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is very fast. The Dual Core Snapdragon with the Adreno 220 GPU is awesome. Plays Mass Effect Infiltrator smooth as butter. The gorilla glass is nice to have and the screen is VERY bright. This is the first phone that I can actually read books on at the beach. It has a 4\" screen but is barely larger than my old Huawei Ascend which had a 3.5\" screen.There are some downsides of course. One that everyone mentions is the battery life. LG included a 1500Mah battery. This is a fast dual core phone with a really bright screen. It will drain the battery. The battery also gets very warm during heavy use like gaming. Remember though, this is a normal size phone, not one of those behemoths that you have to work to get to fit in your pocket. Smaller size means smaller battery and less room for heat to dissipate.While looking for extended batteries, I noticed that several stated that the battery needed about 5 complete discharges and full charge cycles to perform at their best. I thought about that for a min and figured I should try that with the stock battery since it is still very new. I let it drain all the way down to the point of turning itself off and charged it overnight 2 times so far. I get much more stamina out of the battery during the day now and, more importantly, it does not get nearly as warm anymore. Having said all that though, you can find a 1900Mah battery that fits the phone without having to get a larger back case and I would recommend that as a first upgrade.The only other gripe I had was that the headphone amplifier was very weak. It's not a big gripe but I can imagine it would be kinda hard to hear in a noisy room with just ear buds.It's a good phone. It's powerful as all heck. It's the perfect size for your average smart-phone user. I am incredibly happy with this phone.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "L. Phillips", "ReviewID": "R2HP6S8NINCEE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this phone. I have had it long enough now to give a more adequate appraisal of it. My only negatives are: The battery runs down so fast, but part of that is my own fault as I use it on WiFi almost all of the time and won't turn off WiFi.The other is sound quality on YouTube. I do not like the sound quality with it on YouTube. You can barely hear it. If I were using the phone to play music or to listen to other things online, I would use headphones. Since I have never tried it with headphones, I have no real sense of how good it would sound or how loud it would be.I added an extended battery from wirelessground.com. I read that it's a good idea to let the battery run down and then fully charge it a few times when you get a new battery. So I have done that. I actually have a few batteries now and I try to keep them all charged. I have a very nice neoprene case that I use when I am out and about and I keep a spare, charged battery with me.I have now learned most of the ins and outs of this phone and it is really a great phone. I'm so glad I got it. I use it on speaker phone to make calls and it's perfect.I discovered that I can use the phone while charging it with the charger that it came with, but not with any other charger.The screen is as sharp as a tack. I also love that I can turn it horizontally to type more easily, as the keyboard gets larger when turned horizontally. I love that feature.It's really a beautiful phone. It has a ton of wonderful feature that others have commented on, so I won't repeat them.Would I buy it again? Absolutely! It works flawlessly with my home WiFi. The phone sound quality, both out and in is great. The display is fabulous. The Gorilla Glass is so solid and shows almost no finger prints at all.I have been using it as a phone and to go on Facebook and other websites. The display is amazing and it's blazing fast on the internet.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best MetroPCS phone to date", "Author": "Ken P", "ReviewID": "R14E8IZGAMYKA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is the best phone on MetroPCS as of May 2012.  The processor is fast. There is plenty of memory, the 4g speeds are great (for MetroPCS).  There are only two draw backs, the battery life and the power button.  Battery life is a typical problem for all smart phones, I still ended up buying a 2600 maH after market battery so that I could make it through the day.  A car charger and extra wall chargers are an absolute necessity if you want to be sure to have juice all day. The other annoyance is the power button.  It is set slightly more centered on the top, the button is not where you would expect to find it.  It is also flush with the surface making it difficult to feel. Since it is used frequently to unlock the screen you can see how this would be an issue. The screen is large enough that my now aging eyes can see it but it is not so large that I can't slip it in my pocket. The display is bright and sharp.Of course it does all the normal Android things. Since you're reading this, you likely have already compared the raw factory specs so there is no point in listing all the basic info.  If you haven't seen them, scroll up the page give them a look.Would I buy this phone again? YesWas it worth the cash?

Weld \"musicman\"", "ReviewID": "R8HGNGH1OZVU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first cell phone was a Razor T-Mobile and I only used us it a pre-paid phone which I really liked. This past March of 2012 I got this LG 4 Connect and I could not be happier. Living in Metro Detroit I have NEVER had a connectivitiy issue with any calls or texts. I have travelled to Chicago and used the trains without any inference or loss of connectivity. I recently got back from a vacation in Lake County, north of Muskegon, where there is very limited cell phone usage for all service providers. Verizon owns the lines in the area of Irons, MI so when you send text, they supplement the service. Phone calls are limited regardless even if you do have a Verizon account because there are not enough cell phone towers. However, texts are pretty reliable but phone calling is sparse. Anyway, for all the texts and calls that I have made, my monthly bill is still the same price which means my phone has paid for itself well. Also, because I have international texting I can text to my gf in Canada. I do have to have a prepaid phone card for calling her but at a cost of $10.00, I get 12 hours of talk time. That is much better than getting a high bill each month for international calling. I use my car's bluetooth and the calls never get dropped. I also use a jawbone bluetooth and just the same with no dropped calls. I have however dropped my cell phone a few times but luckily, no damage. Lastly the camera almost takes pictures as good as my Sony Cybershot and it is much easier to use. The cost upfront was a bit steep but I used my state tax return to buy it so it didn't hurt that much. One last thing, I really enjoyed doing business with this particular Metro PCS store which I had never considered before a friend of mine kept telling me to try them out. So for one low price I get international texting, long-distance phone calls throughout the U.S. at no additional charge, Internet, and a ton of extras for no extra cost. The night that I bought this phone I was on my way to Bestbuy for the new Samsung Galaxy. I know my bill would be a least double because their plans charge extra for internet connectivity. Glad I just happened to have seen the Metro store on my way.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "RS1FVHA38QAPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably the best phone currently available on MetroPCS.

Galanis", "ReviewID": "R2IVPOKE0Z67WS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for over 3 months now and I am almost sorry that I got them, 2 of them.  I went with Metro PCS because they have good plans for a lot less money than other carriers.  I got 1 for me and 1 for my wife. I always buy the phones like that so if something goes wrong - I will always know if it's phone related or carrier...  Anyhow, here are the good points about the LG Connect:  Excellent screen and very fast.  All the other good points are related to the carrier so there is no need to repeat the applications that it has and etc..  However, here are the bad points and I do mean bad!  Battery life is not what I expected.  The specs indicate 250 hours on stand by but neither one of our phones has lasted the whole day (10-12 hours) and not die on us.  I did a test on 2 different days, just to get an idea and here are my results:  Fully charged at 8:00 A.M., sent 10 texts (100 characters each) to my wife's phone and I received the same texts back, so each phone had sent 10 txt's and received 10 back.  Each phone called the other phone 5 times and we spoke for 5 minutes each time for a total of 25 minutes.  Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and gps were turned off.  No other interaction with the phones until the batteries went dead.  My battery went dead at about 4:00 P.M. and my wife's battery lasted until 4:30 P.M..  Each phone (battery) lasted approximately 8 hours and 15 minutes.  That is bad!  However, there is worse...  We put the phones to charge using the charger that came with the phones and the phones were unusable for more than 1 hour.  One would think that after a few minutes of charging and while the phone is plugged in - one should be able to make a call or sent a text...  Nope, trying to do that after 20 minutes of charging simply turned the phones off completely and we could not even get them back on until the batteries were removed and put back in.  The phones reached 100% of charge after 4 plus hours!  Totally unacceptable for a $300 phone!Here is the other issue that I cannot understand why would LG skimp on it...  There is no indicator light to let one know if there is a missed call or missed text!  There are phones that cost 1/3 what this phone goes for and they have a light indicator for missing calls or texts.  For the people who must put their phone on silent or cannot hear it because they are driving, loud surroundings or what have you - you cannot tell if a call or text came in without turning the phone (screen) on! I have to fiddle with the switch, which because it's kind of recessed - it is hard to press...  This is all my fault but I never thought a phone of this \"Caliber\" would not have an indicator light so I never checked on that prior to me paying for it.Because of these 2 major issues (there are a few bugs here and there too but nothing worth mentioning)I could never recommend this phone.  What good is the 4g and the dual processor and the nice screen if the phone does not last even half a day with minimal use!  I read some other reviewers mentioning that too but I thought it was because they were playing games and had the Wi-Fi or gps on...  It's a shame that LG will put a phone out there that needs to be plugged in 2 and 3 times per day with just regular use.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life kills it", "Author": "Jamey", "ReviewID": "R1UVFFEI1D41C9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "What is the point of having a good phone if you can't use it because it is ALWAYS dead or on the verge of dying?

I have owned my LG connect since May 2012. It is fast and responsive. The build quality, like all LG phones is superb. I have accidentally dropped this phone a few times (I use a simple gel case) with absolutely no damage to the phone.Battery:Yes, depending on usage, the battery life can be as short as 8 hours (with a fair usage of Google Maps / Navigator which seems to eat up the battery).Also, I use the LG HB-700, stereo bluetooth, hands-free unit (another product that you will wonder how you did without) and have found that this also tends to lessen the battery life. the solution is simply to plug in the phone when I am driving or sitting at my desk typing (and streaming music to my bluetooth headset).Negative Comment:The only real negative comment that I can offer is that the location on the keyboard for the \"change language setting key\" is so horribly placed that you will find yourself suddenly typing in a foreign language when you accidentally hit the dreaded key. It should not even be on the keyboard! Aughhhhh!Overall:Quality build (made in Korea). Very good screen. Quick on the web. Syncs seamlessly with all my GMail contacts and accounts.

The Motion is by far a better phone and a lot cheaper right now.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overpriced piece of junk", "Author": "Mandi", "ReviewID": "RHVHNGK00EGR8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, I use Metro PCS and their selection of smartphones is somewhat limited. However, their monthly fees are low and very inclusive and I can't bear to think of paying more money with another company (AT&T; ripped me a new one for ten years).Given the line-up of phones available now, I believe the LG Connect is a great phone for an affordable price.What you get - fast speeds, bright screen, lots of bloatware from Metro. Honestly, this little phone is a powerhouse. But it isn't without flaws.The biggest problem - the dismal battery life (even juice defender and task killer can't seem to stop the drain). If you don't have a place to plug your phone in all day, be prepared to have a dead phone by lunch. My phone spends most of its time plugged in. This brings me to the next issue, while charging and using the phone it gets hot. I mean super hot. While using as a GPS in my car, I had to leave the phone plugged in because it was a six hour trip and the battery would die before reaching my destination. However, I had no choice but to shut it down when the screen actually gave me a message that it was overheating and the battery had to be removed!!! (Mind you, the phone was in a windshield holder, with an A/C vent blowing directly at it - and after 2 hours it was done.) So, this pretty much rules out watching full length movies on the phone or using it to read - anything that keeps the screen on while plugged in for extended periods.As for call clarity, it is hit/miss. Calls don't seem to drop more frequently, but clarity doesn't seem as good as with my older non-smart phone. I sometimes have to hang up and call someone back, but since I am not counting minutes, I don't mind.Overall, I like the phone and I am willing to put up with the battery issues for the trade-off of high speed and low priced service. If you plan to use it heavily, the battery issue may be a deal-breaker.***Update: Now that I've had the phone for a few months, I have had it power down on me several times for apparently no reason. Sometimes I have apps open and a call comes through and BAM - phone shuts down. I have had to take out the battery several times because it would not re-start.**** PHONE IS DEAD:  So, it lasted about a year and a half before it started to constantly overheat, shut off and restart, and give an error message about an unmounted SD card.  In researching the phone, it seems I am not alone - it's a piece of junk.  Phone was returned to store because of these issues.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bitter/Sweet", "Author": "Vella", "ReviewID": "REZW8JWQ1UMA9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have this phone exactly one week today, after switching from Tmobile-which I've been with for years & my last phone was a HTC MyTouch. The connect is sleek,fast & the screen is amazing.However I do not think that the great qualities out-numbered the bad. The most annoying thing is that the battery finishes like every hour.I am not running any more apps than what I did on my HTC. The bluetooth,wifi & gps satellites are all off to save the battery but it doesn't help. I don't get if the phone's nova screen & the dual-processor takes a lot of power,why would metro pcs sell the phone with only a 1500mAh when there are other strengths out there available like the 1800 mAh? smh. Now I have to consider spending another $30-$45 on an extended battery which makes the phone even bulkier.Another thing i dislike about the phone is the front camera, it is not as excellent as the rear-facing camera. I wouldn't mind using the rear-facing camera if there was a shutter button on the side i can use, since i can't see on the screen if i'm trying to take a pic of myself.If the battery & front cam were better i would be more satisfied considering the price paid for phone-not exactly cheap.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone doesn't work", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "R1UN6WR2PCBGOL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed with the seller the phone works for maybe a day during that time i had to keep it plugged in to use it.
