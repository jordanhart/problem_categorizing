{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Open Life. Motorola Backflip with Motoblur", "Author": "Lance Lane", "ReviewID": "R2F9CMHA9LBJ4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product. It is small, yet has a larger screen then expected. It has Motorola's imfamous Motoblur, which, may I say, is awesome, and it arrived so fast that Amazon said it hadn't even been shipped yet. Seriously. That happened. Lol! Battery life is great, and experiencing this phone is quite frankly amazing. It includes access to the Android Market, which has thousands of great apps (not redundant ones like Apple's Appstore has, with repeats of the same thing over and over, which is the reason they have millions of apps), and it has a brilliant screen even though the resolution isn't HD like Apple iPhone's \"Retina\" display. The three touch-sensitive buttons at the lower front of the phone are completely responsive, and it has a great 5MP camera for the average user. It also films digital video for those greater moments in life, and it has a great browser. This phone is upgradable to Google's Android 2.1 OS, which allows you other great new features. It has a GPS that I haven't been able to use yet, but I've heard that it works great. It came in great packaging that was so protective that you could've thrown it off of a 200ft cliff and it wouldn't have done one thing to the contents inside. The box contained in the packaging is small and doesn't impact the environment as much as other older designs, and it also has a unique form to it. The keyboard isn't nearly as bad as it's cracked up to be on YouTube, and it is also very large and special in design. The MicroSD card slot is very easy to operate with a small switch to prevent it from sliding out, and it is hassle-free. If you have $200, I would definitely get this phenominal phone. The only better ones that I can think about that are better then this, are the Droid series, but you will end up paying hundreds of dollars more for those than this bargain. So if you have the money, buy this Motorola MB300 Backflip 3G Android Phone with a 5MP camera, Wi-Fi, GPS Mavigator and Bluetooth. This is also the international version with the warranty, which makes this deal even better.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone should be taken off the market.", "Author": "Anon in KS", "ReviewID": "R2B2PGON1BIB8X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cannot warn potential buyers strongly enough to avoid this phone.  I purchased mine in February 2012 through Amazon from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings. I am a professional who relies on my smartphone when I need to be out of the office.  Specific problems:1.  The phone was very slow to ship.2.  When I did finally receive it, the phone would not recognize my sim card.  Phone support at Unlocked Cell Phone Kings was evasive and did not call back with tech support as promised.3.  The phone's battery cover came bent and does not stay on.4.  Eventually I got the phone to recognize my sim card, and realized then the phone was not really unlocked; it is an AT&T; phone, and as such is programmed to not let you install standard apps that you buy an Android phone for, such as wifi tether and internet radio.  You are forced to use the AT&T; programs, which will not work if you do not have AT&T; service.  (I have T-Mobile.)5.  I spent several hours finding and installing the Z4 root program that would temporarily root the phone, in order to load functioning programs onto the phone.  The root worked such that I could install a few basic essential apps, such as a wifi tether; and I was able to delete some but not all AT&T; proprietary apps that were consuming the phone's memory and operation.  Some programs such as internet radio, simply will not work.  The phone will allow the wifi tether to work about 1/3 of the time.6.  The phone continues to be terribly unreliable:  a.  As others have said, it spontaneously shuts itself off.  b.  It can take as long as 30 seconds after you touch a command button for the phone to react and execute the command.  This includes making phone calls, WHICH MEANS THE PHONE WILL FAIL YOU IN AN EMERGENCY.  c.  As of today, the battery indicator has stopped working.  The battery is fully charged, but there is a big question mark on the battery symbol on the phone.  d.  The phone is telling me its memory is full, although I keep it purged of old data and cache files.  e.  The phone has stopped receiving text messages.  f.  The voicemail indicator will not go away, even though there are no messages in my inbox.I have ordered a new phone from a completely different source, and am attempting to return this phone.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone was not unlocked", "Author": "Ms Khan", "ReviewID": "R3MR51J23YN9UF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone turned out to not be unlocked, which wasn't a huge problem since it came from my service provider.  However it is a seriously flawed phone.  I have been getting error msgs that say my \"phone app\" is malfunctioning and needs to be shut down.  Then the phone freezes and you have to pull the battery out of the phone to get it to reset. It is very difficult to answer the phone because it freezes and won't recognize that you are sliding your finger across the screen until you've already missed the call.In addition for some reason the voice activated calls don't work with my bluetooth.  I still have to physically have the phone in my hand to do voice dialing.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a blue tooth in the first place? Also for some reason the Android marketplace rarely works, and my internet radio app turns on and off for no reason.  That is just a few of the many annoying problems I've dealt with on this phone.  I can't wait to get my upgrade in a few months!!!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not even usable as trash can fodder", "Author": "John K.", "ReviewID": "R3O61XOC95G09Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received the phone as promised. Thats the only good thing I can say for the phone. Phone is set up for AT&T.; I use T-Mobile. All the pre loaded applications were for AT&T; so none worked for me. I couldn't delete any of the app's and I couldn't download any. The contacts list woluld only show a history, not my contacts which I tried to load. Occasionally the contact list would pop-in. I never figured out what I did to reteive it, it just appeared magically when it wanted.  The only things I could do with the phone was to send and receive phone calls. I paid $147.00 dollars for somewhat of a smartphone that would only do what my five year old basic cell phone already does. I'm sending it back to Amazon, thankfully they are only going to charge me $6.00 to take it back. The only accessory in the box was the AC adapter and a owners book which is totally worthless. Don't waste your time and patience with this phone. I'm going to a T-Mobile store and get a real phone.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do your research before purchasing!!!!", "Author": "Dina M. Pavia", "ReviewID": "R2MMXVRV83KG2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had the Motorola BackFlip for about 2 years.  I would love to purchase a new phone however funds are limited.  The phone worked well for about 3 months.  It shuts off whenever it wants and it freezes all the time.  Force close messages all the time.  My advice to anyone looking into purchasing a backflip is to do research.  The update for it does not work.  You can not use alot of applications because of that.  I can say one good thing about the phone is it is durable.  Mine still looks like it just came out of the box.  Other than that I have nothing good to say about this phone. The touch screen works when it feels like it.  I can only make calls when the phone cooperates.  And if you have too many apps like more than 5 it slows the phone down tremendously.

When I purchased the data package/ EDGE I didnt turn the phone off and back on like the carriers reccomend. I was soo excited to get the EDGE on for her I forgot about that step LOL. So i was thinking the phone does not work with the EDGE and only work with WiFI!!! How silly was I?! I felt bad and ordered me a Motorola Atrix for $180 and planned on giving my mom my Motorola DEFY!!! So in atcuality for my supidity I ended up paying $180 unecessarily!!! I was so angry yesterday when i found out kml. N e way look out for my review on the Atrix, I cant wait until it reach! I love these Motorola phones oh and what I noticed from my Defy and this Backflip to set up the MotoBlur I beleive you have to be in wifi connection. I figured out the setup on my own with my Defy but my mom wasnt able to figure hers out so she had to wait until i visited her the next day to get her sorted out.Google Market store is also good.

It seems to reboot from time to time which puts it off line for about four minutes. I was hoping to 'root' the thing but simple rooting techniques don't seem to work. It is also a terrible phone which is not user-friendly.As a mobile device it is not too bad but as a phone it is terrible. The phone is not very responsive in terms of trying to make a call-- I still do not know how to make a call without pressing way too many buttons and waiting far too long, and sometimes it does not want to hang up. Also, the volume buttons are never made and they are on the side of the phone so I am always turning off the ringer. Many times I have become vaguely aware of a slight buzzing when receiving a call-- having inadvertently turned off the ringer.The thing is frozen in time at Android 2.1 so most new apps either wont work or they make it crash more often. The camera works OK but it takes an awful long time to turn on. If you can get this phone somewhere for less than $50 it might make a good first smart phone but you'd be better off buying something else.Also be aware that now that Google, Motorola, and Android are one big happy family everthing you enter into this phone will be sync'd to Google with all that entails regarding privacy.By the way I did not have any problems with the vendor they were fine and shipped the thing as promised.----I got this thing up and running. I saw a couple of negative reviews but I am happy so far. The only glitch is that although the phone is unlocked, it still has all sorts of AT&T; apps on it which will no longer work (I am on another carrier).The biggest problem so far is that the phone has the Android Market app installed and I cannot upgrade it to Google Play, so I can't load any more apps on it.

It seems they don't check them out at all! I bought mine from overstock.com and had no problem. In fact, I have never had an issue ordering from them. You will pay a small bit more but, it's worth it. The phone was new (as promised), unlocked (as promised), and had android 2.1 (as promised). I have bought several phones off amazon.com that have not been what was promised. To be fair, on most I did get a refund.

Updating android will fix most issues. You can even remove MotoBlur if you think it's causing an issue.Granted I don't do all the stuff many do with smartphones. I call, text, browse (with Dolphin HD browser - a must). But the apps I loaded work fast. Also, a note on speed. If you're slow it might have something to do with the way you connect. This phone has WiFi - USE IT! I personally refuse to pay for a data plan, so, I got APNDroid (allows you to turn off the APN function - that constantly pings and tries to use your wireless provider's network).
