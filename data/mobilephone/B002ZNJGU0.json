That phone is awesome. This JAX, however, where do I begin?-Battery DOESNT stay charged for long-Alarm Clock tool is horribly programmed --you can't shut an alarm off from the alarm-screen, you have to go all the way into the menu and do that. WHY??? lol...-Want to browse websites or RSS feeds? The look and feel is almost disgusting (btw the LG101 allows you to use Opera Mini browser, which is very classy for such a simple phone.-No T9, only 'Rapid Text' Mode- OMG!! Again...why?? It's horrible. The dictionary sucks and it's not even worth using...-No customizable wallpapers available from Virgin XL...and the ones that come with the phone are lame.-The battery cover is barely secured onto the back.-There is no way to turn certain sounds OFF...even on SILENT mode...so in certain menus, when you reach the end of the options, a beep sounds off...NOT COOL!I could go on and on...but I'll just say this: This is hands-down the worst phone I've ever used. I bought it because I like old-school type phones like this better than smartphones, but I'll have to try another one. This is the first phone I've ever bought that I almost IMMEDIATELY wanted to toss in the garbage. Don't buy this unless you don't care at all for any features except occasional phonecalls and texts.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Weird Phone", "Author": "G. M. Patton", "ReviewID": "RQTAQ6RR684D2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is just weird it will start going off non-stop as if you have a message but when you check it there's nothing. Sometimes I have to shut it off and then back on to get it to stop and sometimes it will just stop by itself.  I have no clue as to what sets if off. This is not good because one time I ignored it and I did actually have a real message, crazy. I have 2 of these and they both do it so it's not like one of them is defective, they both are.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "For what it is - a simple phone - it is fine", "Author": "Joseph R \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R3MVOW9LD9LNSV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this very phone for almost 3 years now. Bottom line: if you just want to talk and do the occasional text message, it is great. Do not expect much else though, it is simply not built for that nor was it ever intended for crazy multimedia use.A couple of caveats: - The web services, although not very useful with the phone, have a bad habit of activating without you knowledge. A simple call to Virgin fixes this for months at a time, but it does creep back. To Virgin' credit, the always rescinded and credited any charges that happened due to this issue. - Volume in the earpiece is good, but a has diminished over time. Again, I have had this phone for 3 years. - I see some people complain about battery life. This has not been my experience at all. In fact, this phone almost holds a charge *too* long! Because I never get the low battery sound except every 5 or 6 days, I forget to charge it. - As it is not a flip phone, occasionally the buttons will depress when in your pocket. Not a huge deal but when I carry it around with other things in my pocket, it is constantly turning off and on due to this.Look, for the price, this phone is great. Don't expect to be a text maven with it, but reception, battery life, audio and the other basics are good. While my phone has worn out n the past few years (mostly the buttons are unreliable), I am torn between sticking with the  JAX or upgrading slightly. While I would like some more functionality, I would very much miss the simplicity.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done.", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R1HOZER8BOP2DL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just needed a phone for texting and this phone gets the job done well for the price. The only thing that got me was the fact that this phone only can use the paylo plans and I was bummed that it wouldn't do the texter's delight plan but it wasn't too big of a deal, just had to pay about 10 bucks extra. Phone is also super light! It felt like a barbie phone or something but I thought it was nice because I could easily shove it in my pocket or throw it in my purse. My purse already has too much crap in it so this phone was great because it didn't make it any heavier, hahaha.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "hmmmmmmm, wow", "Author": "katiecat", "ReviewID": "R2862Z4DJMHQGE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone free from the government.

He's 86 years old and it just fit's all his basic needs. the speakerphone has great quality sound, the buttons and screen were just right.

Greene", "ReviewID": "R14336RGJMYDOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying: I am hard on my phones. I often drop them, or have them dropped on the floor by my 4-year old. I use my phone all of the time for telling the time while I'm working, and often use other features like texting, consulting the calendar, writing little notes to myself, or using the calculator. It holds a charge pretty well, usually goes for days without needing to charge. Uses more battery power if you text a lot especially. They say this phone can use the internet, I don't have the plan with internet, so I cannot attest to this. But, whenever I whip my phone out in front of my hipster friends, they all fawn over it and remember when they had a phone like this- \"it was the BEST!\" sleek, you can stick it in your shirt pocket or bra easily, is very reliable and best of all only cost $9.99 including free shipping!

Doesn't hold settings (and yes, I'm sure I'm following manual instructions properly).  Will re-set things such as turning off airplane mode, system sounds shut-off, volume, shut-off delay, etc.  Phone is so light that vibrate will cause it to go flying off a surface.  It's like it's designed to try to self-destruct.  Screen is difficult to read and unpleasant to look at.  Sound quality is hideous.  Very hard to hear callers especially if there is any ambient noise whatsoever.  To do anything you have to press lots of little buttons over and over.  The set-up is not intuitive and some features are placed in weirdly irrational menus that you have to basically stumble upon to find them.  Entire construction of phone is very cheap and feels like it will fall to pieces easily; feels like a cheap child's toy you might buy at a dollar store.  I absolutely don't recommend especially if you were previously using a high end smart phone and tried downgrading to save money; you will go crazy with this piece of junk.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok phone", "Author": "kel", "ReviewID": "RBRI5F65EVBSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ok phone couldnot activate do not buy this phone comes from California  called virgin mobile and assurance and could not activate because I did not have a pin number one was not sent.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone.  Poor customer service, and coverage.", "Author": "Gregory J. Burton", "ReviewID": "R19Z47YT0XH0B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Kyocera Jax is a great phone, especially at the price.  It's small, compact, and slips into your shirt pocket.  It has some great features for a phone of it's size.  If this phone is available with any other service I would recommend it without hesitation!  Virgin Mobile has the worst customer service, and coverage.  When I needed it, I couldn't get a signal.  I lost 160 minutes of air time that I purchased, because I didn't have the money to add additional minutes.  Nothing any worse than being a customer who is being told when to buy minutes for a phone.  200 minutes for $20 isn't a good deal either.  How long does 200 minutes last if you actually use the phone?  It won't work for just emergencies, because you lose what minutes you don't use if you can't afford to sign up for the auto roll over plan.  If a person is looking for an emergency cell phone only.  I recommend Tracfone, because they at least have some coverage!", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone", "Author": "C.

One feature I like is the ability to lock the keys since it would be easy to accidentally push buttons since it is a bar phone. Can't comment on texting and web access, I do neither on a cell.
