{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sonim xp 3400", "Author": "mike smith", "ReviewID": "R3J8Q2ON154QFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one tough phone. If you are like me and hate these newer, wimpy phones that everyone is so thrilled with like the Iphones and the androids, this is a refreshingly sturdy break from junk for a change! This thing would make an honest wheel-chock any day and easily live to talk about it. All the same, it is also loaded with enough features both in software and hardware to be very nice and well rounded out. I really like the LED flashlight/camera flash that it has - it's brighter than some flashlights! My only pick is the SIM card deal - I got this phone to use with AT&T; only to be told by Sonim that AT&T; is the one provider that doesn't work with this machine - so I relisted the phone on Ebay and ordered a different model of Sonim that accepts a regular type of sim card. I'm still totally sold on Sonim - the very reincarnation of the old radio phones by Motorola for Nextel and the like. -Mike, in Maryland", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2 inch bright high-resolution display for high visibility\nCalendar, Alarm, Document viewer, Flashlight\nMusic ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Speakerphone\nActive noise cancellation with dedicated mic\nDrop-to-concrete resistance from up to 2m", "Name": "New Sonim XP3400 Armor Yellow/Black Rugged Cell Phone CDMA Compatible", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JA%2BA9isxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BTH2VEG"}}
