{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good USB charger", "Author": "Dave Edmiston", "ReviewID": "R3LYYNAV9XCUZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good charger for charging multiple devices with USB cables.  This charger has two 2A ports for charging devices like iPads and Kindle Fire tablets (or quick-charging smaller devices) and two 1A ports for charging smaller devices like iPhones.A soft blue light displays when the charger is plugged in, showing you that the charger is powered and able to charge your devices.The USB ports are far enough apart from each other that they don't interfere with each other and each port is well labeled so it's easy to find the right port for your device's power needs.This is a great way to charge your electronics from one single outlet.My only small criticism is that the 110 plug is a little too far from the edge, so it covers the second outlet in the wall outlet.  Honestly though, it's more convenient to have access to the ports, so mine is connected to an extension cord and sits on the nightstand, so the second wall outlet isn't an issue.  It works just fine for me.I was provided this item for review.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for as long as you don't need something 'portable'", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R8ST2V1YGW2N3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received one of these as a 'for review' unit but there were no under the table deals involving a positive review in exchange.This charger's distinguishing characteristic is that it comes with two 5V/2A ports and another two 5V/1A charging ports for a total of four. Unlike most USB chargers that try to be all things to all people and provide one 'Apple-optimized' and one 'non-Apple' port or one 1A and one 2A charging ports, therefore making them into 'single port' chargers most of the time, you can actually use all four ports to charge perhaps two phones and two tablets at the same time and this is a good thing.For your money you get the charger body that comes with a status light and non-foldable prongs that plug into standard AC outlets. You supply the USB cables. The 2A outputs are better suited for the larger devices such as tablets but I found that it charged our phones as well. It even charged our HP Chromebook 11 which is happiest when it gets 3A but accepts anything from 1A up to 3A.I can't think of no 'negatives' for as long as you are not looking for something 'small' or 'portable' in which case you should be looking elsewhere.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works!", "Author": "Jeff Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3DPTQTEPJMUF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This charger works as describes however I could not get my nexus 5 to charge in AC mode, only usb mode... and that was with the high-power ports. It seems a 'charge only' cable is needed to charge at full speed.The size of the unit takes up enough space to block the other available wall socket, so I use an extension cable from the charger to the wall.Other than that, the charger offers the convenience of having multiple outlets to charge at once, which is useful..", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well designed, reliable and functional", "Author": "Grady Harp", "ReviewID": "R2HNLRF3L6JIJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amzdeal makes available a compact USB wall charger (30W 5V/6A) with 4-Ports that provides charging for Apple iPhone 5S 5C 5 4S 4; iPad 5 Air mini; Samsung Galaxy S5 S4 S3; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8); Nexus; External Batteries and More USB-Powered Devices - all in one small portable, travel wise unit.

A very professional correspondence with amzdeal who have clearly created a great product and want to let the world know about it. There was no pressure to write a positive review.Firstly, I should say that I would have given the product 5 starts were it not for the arrangement of the charger. The charger could be certainly be smaller. As it is, it sticks out from the wall by a few inches which means that it won't fit behind a nightstand. If the prongs were on the side of the device, the charger could sit more flush with the wall. As it happens, I don't have a nightstand and I normally leave my phone and tablet charging, beside my bed, on the floor. With this style of charger, I can actually rest my phone on top of the charger instead of the floor!The charger has 2x2A and 2x1A USB output. This allows me to charge my tablet and both mine and my wife's phone, all from the same wall socket. I actually put my phone into a 2A output and it chargers just fine, at double the speed.The led light indicates when the charger has power, i.e. my bedroom switch for the nightstands is on. It is a very useful feature.I have been using it daily for 2 weeks now and am confident of its quality build.In summary, a very good product but not for use behind nightstands.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better for Home Use", "Author": "Noname", "ReviewID": "R17TY9HNFSYFS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The very first thing I noticed about this USB wall charger is its size. It's easily double the size of my other 4-port USB wall charger. On the positive side, this means there's more room between the USB ports, which get crowded on smaller chargers.I like that the USB ports are on the back side of the wall charger instead of the back or the side, making them easier to reach without unplugging from the outlet.  On the other hand, the prongs don't retract.  Retractable prongs are a must when traveling, to prevent holes rubbing holes into luggage and bags.  Many USB wall chargers come with retractable prongs.  Size and prongs make this USB wall charger more suitable for home use.How does it perform at home?  Very well.  There are four ports: two 2 amp ports and two 1 amp ports.  At times, I've had them all going at once, charging tablets, power banks, speakers, lamps -- no problem.  For added peace of mind, surge protection is built in.The Amzdeal USB wall charger is not my favorite wall charger because of the massive, bigger-than-wall-wart size.  It performs as advertised, though, and there are some advantages to being big.  If you need room between the ports, this is a viable option.This product was provided for review by Aukey.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tested with Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet, Samsung

It is 3.5\" long, 3 1/8\" tall and 1 1/4\" wide. It weighs 6.4 oz. If you put this charger in the middle of an old fashioned power strip 4 slots become unusable, if you put on the edge of end of the old fashioned power strip 2 slots become unusable. This charger works best in power strips that allow prongs to be in a position that orients the unit perpendicular to a slot. On this new style power strip this charger takes only one slot.I tested Amzdeal wall charger with Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet, Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone,  and iPad Mini.  It charged the phone very fast, but was below average for the tablets.  The charger stayed cool charging all devices.For those who are interested in the details of my tests I am including the test numbers below.\u2b24 How I tested this charger==================================I use a USB current monitor and a charging test to test each port. The current monitor shows the voltage and the current flowing between the battery and the device.The amount of energy transferred from the charger to the device is calculated by multiplying voltage and current. Most of the chargers are 5V devices and most devices show the voltage very close to 5V. The current varies from unit to unit and from port to port.The current varies based on what the device requires and what the battery provides. This communication happens using different protocols depending on the OS of the device. Newer Android OS versions have adapted their protocols to get better performance from ports aimed at Apple devices. An addition variable for  Android devices is whether a data cable or charging cable is used to charge the device. The charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see the cable as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.The 10 minutes test consists of charging each mobile device on each port of the battery pack for 10 minutes and measure how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Since the charging speed is non-linear I start charging each device from approximately the same charge level. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.\u2b24Test Results:======================The table below summarizes my findings:\u2714 iPad Mini tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  3% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.69A and 5.10V2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  4% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.57A and 5.09V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  2% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.92A and 5.18V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  2% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.92A and 5.18V\u2714 Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  8% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.98A and 5.17V2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  7% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.97A and 5.17V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  8% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.03A and 5.17V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  8% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.03A and 5.17V\u2714 Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  2% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.79A and 5.19V2A ~~ AC ~~~~~  1% change in charge in 10 minutes2A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.75A and 5.19V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  2% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.19A and 5.19V1A ~~ AC ~~~~~  2% change in charge in 10 minutes1A: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.16A and 5.16VAli Julia review", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Clunky size but good performance", "Author": "M.

wall and desk chargers that are available. It's so much more convenient and efficient for me to be able to charge several devices simultaneously rather than having a long line of my devices in queue for their opportunity to connect to a single USB outlet charger.This Amzdeal 4-port wall charger provides 2-2A outputs and 2-1A outputs. When the charger is plugged into the wall outet, an LED will light to confirm that power is reaching the charger.The size of this wall charger seems a bit excessive to me. It's clunky. It measures 3 1/2\" x 3 1/8\" by about 1 3/8\". More bothersome than just its clunkiness is the fact that when plugged into the lower outlet of a standard AC wall outlet, the case extends upwards a bit too far thus impeding the use of the top outlet depending on what you might be plugging in to it.On the plus side, this has an LED light to indicate that power is reaching the charger and the LED is not excessively bright.It works well but its clunky size impinges on being able to use the other wall plug so that's a disadvantage of this particular wall charger.I was provided a sample for review.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "works fine", "Author": "David Peterson", "ReviewID": "R3CNUX97WL0T36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this yesterday and have charged my nexus 7 fhd, 1st gen fire, lumia 521 phone, and ipad2 with no problems.I did get an email from Aukey apologizing for the misprint in the manual.It has a pair of 2.4A ports, 1.3A (marked as Samsung Tab), and a pair of 1A ports.The 18 month warranty is nice, too.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Charge 5 items on one outlet...", "Author": "Marilyn Schmugar", "ReviewID": "R24G0USMRVBZHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This compact little box lets me charge 2 iphone 5's, 2 ipad 2's and a Kindle at the same time from 1 outlet.  only have it a few days, but so far I'm very pleased with it.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Charges Quickly", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RH2RG4E9JF2S2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Owned for 3 days.

What does separate this charger from the rest? At first, I thought this was like any others. Then, I realized some cool features about the charger. It is not just a hub of USB ports, but it allows you to charge: 5 ports (5V / 8A total) power maximum-speed charges up to 2 iPad Air (2.4A max), 2 iPhones or Android phones (1A max) and one Galaxy Tab simultaneously. One of the features that I like is the label of Samsung Tab on the product. This avoids the plugging of my Samsung Tablet into a lower powered port.In addition, the size is convenient as it fits in the palm of my hand. It is therefore easy to carry with me during my travel. This has become the newest gadget in my business travel bag. I can now leave behind all those A/C cords for each of my electronics.Anyone can benefit from this product. It is small enough that I can bring it into the office to keep my devices charged.Some of the main benefits of this charger are:\u2022  The ability to charge 5 different devices simultaneously\u2022  The size is adequate to support such amount of devices and yet portable for the office, at home, vacation, and travel.\u2022  I can now quintupled one A/C receptacle at the airport. This is awesome.\u2022  My laptop is no longer a charging station\u2022  My family uses some of my other chargers, as I\u2019ve claimed this oneI would love to see an improvement of a light indicator to state that the power is on.

This is supposed to be a simple item that allows the user to charge multiple types of USB charged items at once....and it does that flawlessly!Pulling this item from the box, I immediately felt that it was well-made and would handle daily use. The soft touch plastic casing was a nice addition and the simplicity of the wall unit was welcomed. I tried various items on this charger with no problem whatsoever.This is a great solution for someone to have in the home, or on the go if you have a ton of USB items you need to able to charge and don't want to carry a bunch of individual plugs.

What I really like is the wide assortment of devices it will charge. And I mean charge rapidly....... Charge everything from a Samsung cell phone to a Apple cell phone as well all tablets, external speakers, portable power banks. Everything from 1A to 2.4A.The device has 2 - 2.4 A charging output ports, 2 - 1.0 A and 1 - Samsung tab output. However you can use any port to charge any device within the 1.0 A and 2.4 A range. It may just take longer to charge a 2.4 a device thru the 1.0 A port but it will charge..... The size of the device is great and the white(also comes in black)looks really good. Comes with a detachable power cord, the charging station and instructional booklet.Love this device I have it on my desk out of the way and its already completely full with device's.Only thing is I may need to buy another one for the rest of my devices.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "A very small, and well built device, tested to charge my device at 1110mA per hour. These are very fast results!", "Author": "Charles Spanky \"Zumina Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R3ICC6OOYNDURQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All mobile devices need a USB port to charge from, and computer USB ports don\u2019t supply enough current to charge devices fast. Fortunately, there are devices like the Amzdeal 40W 5V/8A 5-Port USB Wall Charger to charge your USB device fast.\u25b6 Package Contents1 x Amzdeal 40W 5V/8A 5-Port USB Wall Charger1 x Power cord\u25b6 AccessoriesThe only accessory that is included this device is a 55 inch black 2-prong power adapter. This adapter is very similar to the construction of laptop power adapters, which is good, since this adapter can be easily replaced if it ever were to be damaged. The fact that the adapter is a little over 4 feet makes this the perfect adapter in work stations. I overall like the power adapter concept, and that Amzdeal chose to not include any proprietary charging.\u25b6 Specifications\u2022 Input: AC 10V-240V\u2022 Output:- 5V/7A (Max)- USB1 / 2.4A (iPad)- USB2 / 1.3A (Samsung Tab)- USB3 / 2.4A (iPad)- USB4 / 1.0A (iPhone)- USB5 / 1.0A (Android)\u2022 Size: 98mm x 60mm x 26mm\u2022 Weight: 153.5g \u00b1 5g\u25b6 HardwareThe product images, and typos in technical details, make this product much bigger than it really is (3.9 x 2.4 x 1 inches; 5.4 ounces). ). It is a very small and light device that you can hold in your hand like a mobile phone. This product only comes in a matt black plastic, but looks very sleek and minimalistic without being a fingerprint magnet. On the front are 5 ports with the text \u201c2.4A, Samsung Tab, 2.4A, 1.0A, and 1.0A\u201d over each port. I like that they include the current values for each port, but think \u201cSamsung Tab\u201d is a bit out of place. I understand the reasoning behind this, as tablets take more current than 1A, but think the 2.4A iPad port would be acceptable. On the left side is the Amzdeal name and logo, and on the back is the power adapter port and specifications. I overall like the build of this product, as it doesn\u2019t look a simple USB charger with a plastic enclosure, and the fact that this is a 40W/8A wall charger means that it can withstand all the ports being used simultaneously, without needing to compromise the charge of any port.\u25b6 SetupSetup doesn\u2019t get simpler than with this device. Plug the two prong power adapter into the USB charger, and then into your wall outlet.\u25b6 TestingI tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), using Android 4.4.2 with a 3950mA battery, running no processes except system apps. I performed two tests in the 2.4A USB port, a multimeter test at the start and end, and a fast charge test to calculate the amount this device charges per an hour.Multimeter Test:The multimeter test attempts to test the voltage and current the device uses at the beginning and end of the test. Sometimes, devices remain the same current throughout the test, and sometimes the current lowers toward the end. It is nice to know if the power source is giving out less power by the end of the test. The current is the ampere the device is taking in, with max current the maximum amount of ampere the device is capable of taking in. The voltage is the amount the power source is capable of giving, with min voltage the lowest possible amount of the power source giving.\u2022 5%Current: 0.87AVoltage: 4.98VMax Current: 0.90AMin Voltage: 4.90V\u2022 82%Current: 1.14AVoltage: 5.00VMax Current: 1.14AMin Voltage: 4.90VThese are very high results for my Nexus 7 at this percentage. Usually, you can expect 0.40 \u2013 0.60A, but to get a rating of almost double that amount proves the efficiency of the charger.Fast Charge Test:The fast charge test attempts to find the efficiency and performance of the power source.Time \u2013 Nexus 7 charge %7:02AM - 5%7:35AM - 21%8:21AM - 46%8:59AM - 66%9:35AM - 87%10:15AM - 97%10:25AM - 100%Nexus 7 Battery Size x Amount Charged = Total Charge3950mA * (0.95) = 3752.5mATotal Charge / Time (hours) = Charge per Hour3752.5mA/3.38h = 1110.2mA per HourThis device charges at 1110mA per an hour, which considering my OEM wall charger only charges at approximately 700mA per an hour, this is an amazingly fast result for a USB charger,. These results conclude this charger does indeed charge fast.\u25b6 Final ThoughtsI am very impressed by the speed of this USB charger, as it is capable of charging my Nexus 7 at 1110.2mA pre hour. Because of these results, I recommend this device to anyone that needs a USB charger and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very small, and well built device, tested to charge my device at 1110mA per hour. These are very fast results!+ 5 USB ports, capable of fully charging 4 tablets and one mobile device at one time.+ Multimeter tests showed an increase of charge over time, which makes is unusual, as the opposite results were expected. This means the device charges faster over time, instead of slower.Cons:- It is a similar design made by other companies, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a cheap knockoff either.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well, solid build quality", "Author": "Andrew W", "ReviewID": "R2SMZSCBKSE2LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received one of these items to review and give my feedback.
