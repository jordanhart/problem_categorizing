With just a tap, you can wave hello to your kids, share a smile from across the globe, or watch your best friend laugh at your stories - iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 over Wi-Fi. And it works right out of the box. No other phone makes staying in touch this much fun.  Two cameras, two views  iPhone 4 has two cameras: One on the front, which focuses on you. And one on the back, which focuses on everything else. FaceTime lets you switch back and forth between them at any time during a video call. All you have to do is tap a button.  Retina display  The retina display on iPhone 4 is the sharpest, most vibrant, highest-resolution phone screen ever, with four times the pixel count of previous iPhone models. In fact, the pixel density is so high that the human eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels.  Multitasking  iPhone 4 introduces a whole new way of multitasking. Now you can run your favorite third-party apps - and switch between them instantly - without slowing down the performance of the foreground app or draining the battery unnecessarily.  HD video recording and editing  Shoot your own movies in high definition. Capture impressive video even in low-light settings, thanks to the advanced backside illumination sensor and built-in LED light. Then edit and create your own mini-masterpiece right on iPhone 4 using the iMovie app - with Apple-designed themes, titles, and transitions.  5-megapixel camera with LED flash  Take beautiful, detailed photos with the 5-megapixel camera with built-in LED flash. The advanced backside illumination sensor captures great pictures even in low light. And the front-facing camera makes it easy to take self-portraits.Product IdentifiersBrand AppleMPN  IPHONE432GBWHTCDMACarrier VerizonFamily Line Apple iPhoneModel 4UPC 885909420469Type SmartphoneKey FeaturesCapacity 32GBColor WhiteNetwork Technology CDMABand CDMA 800/1900Camera 5.0 MPOperating System iOSBatteryBattery Type Lithium IonBattery Capacity 1420 mAhBattery Talk Time 840 minBattery Standby Time 300 hrDisplayDisplay Technology LCD displayDiagonal Screen Size 3.5 in.Display Resolution 960 x 640 pixelsOther FeaturesTouch Screen YesBluetooth YesDigital Camera YesGPS YesEmail Access YesInternet Browser YesSpeakerphone YesDimensionsHeight 4.5 in.Depth 0.37 in.Width 2.31 in.Weight 4.8 ozPortions of this page Copyright 1997 - 2011 CNET Channel.

The DC adapter brick says \"Designed by LIXIN\" instead of Designed by Apple. Red flag.The phone itself is very lackluster. The OS is much slower to react than the Iphone 4 it replaced. The touchscreen becomes unresponsive very often, and you must lock and unlock the phone several times to complete a single sentence text message. If you are using an app that has any advertisements, when the ad changes the phone will freeze. The touchscreen in general is not as accurate as my previous Iphone 4.I know for a fact the accessories in the box are counterfeit. I have an appointment with the Apple store, and I'm almost expecting them to tell me the device is counterfeit.
