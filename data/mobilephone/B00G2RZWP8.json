The fact that persuaded me to go ahead was that it was a fulfillment by Amazon listing and I had been bitten not once but many times by Chinese sellers selling trash and making it impossible for you to return.I opened the box to find a very  elegant looking Smartphone with an extremely useful stylus with it.The screen is big with pleasant colors and clarity. The touch response is awesome.Setting up my unlocked AT&T; card was a breeze.Many of the useful apps were already there and I have downloaded quite a few other apps like wechat and whatsapp  and am chatting with friends with clarity and precision.Downloading apps was fairly simple after I set up my Google account.The sound quality is extremely good.I had heard that the sc processor is relatively slow but I didn\u2019t find it as a drawback in any way.Yes you can't compare it to a Samsung Galaxy but what more can you ask for one sixth of the price\u2026..Overall a highly recommended phone.
