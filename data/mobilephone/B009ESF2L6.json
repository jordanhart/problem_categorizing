Rathbone", "ReviewID": "R2D61T2YX439A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previously I've owned a HTC G1 and a Samsung Nexus S.In my opinion the OS is pretty good.  It definitely feels better than Android, at least initially.  After you setup your accounts and get whatever apps you need, it feels pretty good to use.  The internet browser is pretty solid, and there is a decent reddit app available.  I especially like the automatic photo sync that happens with SkyDrive.  So I'll be out taking pictures, and the photos will automatically get uploaded to my PC.  I like not having to bother with cables anymore.One thing I don't like is there is no built in turn by turn directions.  You may have to buy an app for that if this is a must have feature for you :-/As for hardware, this device feels very solid.  One complaint I have is the unlock button at the top could be easier to press.  The screen is bright and vibrant and the glass of the screen feels great.  The resolution of the screen seems very high,  I can't see any pixels!I think WP8, android, and iOS all accomplish more or less the same thing nowadays.  So if you like the style of this OS, I can easily recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my 8X!!!", "Author": "heathbc888", "ReviewID": "R1L6M8IDJ7IJDR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a faithful Blackberry user (and I still admit it) for a long time because productivity is super-important to me. Despite this, all the nice new devices kept tempting me, so I tried the iPhone 4S but took it back after 30 minutes when it choked on Exchange sync. Next I tried the Galaxy SII and I kept that for a whole weekend, but took it back when I got frustrated with not being able to move between apps easily. I just don't have time to peck into and out of apps like that. I was waiting for the SIII to come out as I thought that might be an improvement, but bought an HTC Trophy to test out Windows Phone 7.5 in the meantime, and I was immediately hooked due to how WP syncs my Exchange folders so effortlessly. I was able to move emails around on my phone and those moves would replicate on my work and home computers immediately. This saved me a good four hours per month in email processing, and was surprisingly far more powerful than a Blackberry in this regard. I didn't bother with the SIII and eagerly awaited the WP8 on Verizon as I enjoyed my Trophy.I was able to test out both the HTC 8X and the Lumia 822 in-store. The 8X is incredibly slim and it just looks beautiful, but the screen was slightly larger than I wanted so was seriously considering the Lumia. Then I took a photo of my kids with both devices while I was inside the store and with no flash. Honestly, the 8X photo and screen just blew the Lumia away. I pre-ordered the 8X then and there. I've now had the device for a little less than a week and I absolutely, 100% LOVE THIS PHONE!!! I got a silicon case when I bought it, but the phone itself is just so beautifully designed that I tossed the case after a couple of days. I love to just look at this device and its gorgeous screen. The screen is fantastic - you can't see pixels at all and the glass feels frictionless. I put a screen protector on though, and there was absolutely no loss in accuracy (my Trophy suffered a little and my daughter's LG Android doesn't do well with a screen protector at all). WP8 ROCKS. Live Tiles bring all my data to the surface on one screen, and People Hub sucks all my social media updates and organizes them the way *I* want them (no more facebook timeline - yay!). And really, that's the whole point. I don't have to go digging into apps - it's all right there. It's SOOOO much more efficient than Android or iOS. I can have seven apps open at a time and nine browser windows (maybe more, I haven't tried). That's real processing power in your hands.Skydrive effortlessly keeps all changes between my WP8, work and home computers sync'd, so I'm never without my current data. Switching from my Trophy to my 8X was simply a matter of logging into my new device - everything was there within minutes. I have plenty of excellent games to choose from. The device has a 'Kid's Corner', which means I can put all the games/apps/files I want into that location and keep their sticky fingers away from accidentally emailing or calling my business contacts. So useful!The phone is 4GLTE - blazing fast. I download 3M files in moments. No waiting for mobile web pages at all, and even slow/heavy graphics sites load within a second or two. There are many more features but I'll end by saying that this is hands down the most powerful productivity device I've seen yet, it's totally fun to use, and it's just beautiful to look at. I have the blue one, and after me waxing lyrical about it for three days, my wife is now getting the red one. I highly, highly recommend this phone :)", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone in Windows 8 Space", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "RWWQU992Y8G0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HTC 8X is definitely a incredible design and ergonomic. Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "For My Spouse!", "Author": "Tami", "ReviewID": "RCPGG9H570687", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband knows nothing about computers, but, he absolutely loved this phone.

I love the WP8 OS, and I've been using it since over a year and have had no trouble on any of my devices with Microsoft Updates/Manufacturer updates, etc.This phone arrived just on time, but I immediately noticed the box was not an HTC box. It was a generic box. With self-printed sticker on the box indicating it's an HTC phone. The box contained charger, phone, the sim-card-insert-pin/clip, headphones. No manuals.Also noticed that the screen-protector was not original -- it seemed someone may have removed the original and placed a new phone without much care - and left many streaks/air-bubbles etc.Nonetheless, I turned on the phone, activated it and setup using Outlook account. And phone restarted suddenly -- there was no windows update or anything. I thought may be I did something. I checked through Setup also, and it showed there were no update available. Phone remained on for couple of hours and then it would continue restarting every 2-3 minutes, to a point where it completely died. I could not power it ON.I returned the phone and received the full refund.My opinion of this *particular shipment*: This phone either was not an original HTC, or it was a refurb. Either way, HTC / 8x / WP8 are have never given me trouble until this phone. So again, the problem must be with this particular inventory item.Here is my review of Lumia 620: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZF0XAEUDTLL/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00FP2PE22&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "sound quality is awesome", "Author": "Terry", "ReviewID": "R3G0M8A3SRPR3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as for the platform, its not as gd as ios and android but this phone is really great in sound and camera. it can be used to push headphones directly which normally requiring amplifiers and the front camera can easily shoot 5 people in 1 arm length. loved it a lot", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Hardware", "Author": "Bugdad", "ReviewID": "RAO0313GANC62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The design of the phone with its curved back and somewhat rounded front glass makes it feel really nice in the hand.  The dedicated buttons on the bottom of the phone are easily accessible and easy to understand.My first impression when I opened the box was \"Wow\" I like the color.  I received a California Blue model, reminds me of Lakers Purple - a plus in my opinion.  The other colors of the 8x look impressive as well, would have been difficult to choose if the choice wasn't made for me.Picking up the phone for the first time I was pleasantly surprised.  It felt solid, nice weight and the soft touch back keeps the phone in your hand nicely.  The buttons on the phone are raised just enough to find them without looking.  The volume rocker and the dedicated camera button on the right side of the phone and the power button on the top right are just where I am used to looking.The back of the phone has the speaker and camera and flash.  The speaker is loud and pretty clear when streaming music.  The rear camera is good and almost on par with the EVO LTE (which is amazing).  Front facing camera with wide angle lens produces nice quality shots while getting the \"big\" picture.My phone is not activated on a network so I cannot speak to the call quality.  One of my relatives reports to me that call quality on T-Mobile is outstanding.  Using my beats headphones with the 8x gave great audio.Bottom line is that HTC has followed its tradition of producing innovative, high quality phones with the HTC 8x.  It is definitely a solid phone with great feel in your hand and eye catching looks.

The 8X is my first device from HTC that's so beautifully crafted, so light that I find myself very often weirdly caressing the smooth polycarbonate material. My other HTC devices that I've owned look incredibly bulky and rude next to the 8X. This is most obvious with the grey Titan II sitting next to the lively California Blue device. HTC, through the design of the 8X, clearly wanted to re-invent itself and they have succeeded.However, the HTC 8X is not perfect despite its eye-catching, flashy design. For a device that has a 4.3\" screen, it is unusually tall. This is particularly noticeable when compared to the 4.7\" Titan II. That's kind of weird when I have to reach the soft buttons at the bottom of the screen or the power button at the top. It requires much finger twist and a bit of Fantastic 4 Reed Richards elastic superpowers to use the soft buttons with just one hand. HTC should have gone with at least a 4.5\" screen to make the device more usable. That's the price to pay to give the HTC 8X a gorgeous 1280x720 screen with pixel density of 342ppi. The Titan II is no match at this level. Photos are crisp; browsing the web is a pleasure.The front camera is amazing with its ability to capture more in one photo than any other phones can handle. It's just great to fit in my daughters and myself when doing video calls with Skype, but not so in terms of photo quality. But the pictures are still better than any other phones I've used though. The 8MP back camera offers good quality photos during day use and requires a little fiddling with the settings in low light conditions. That's not a real problem for me as I don't usually take photos after dark. Strangely, I find the picture quality on the 8X to be better than on the 16MP camera of the Titan II.The HTC 8X is definitely the most fashionable device I've used so far. Every time I take it out, it manages to catch the attention of all those around me with an incessant emission of WOWs.

The Nokia phone has become her own merits in the most desired by users of the platform, which makes the Lumia 920 so unique from the competition?For starters, its spectacular display PureMotion IPS technology, which ensures a much higher response rate than that of its rivals, plus a high brightness even under sunlight and an incredible touch sensitivity. Its density of pixels falls below the HTC 8X, but instead offers a slightly larger screen coming up to 4.5 inches. On the performance side, processor and RAM shared with rivals, and stays at an intermediate point on the capacity of the battery, below the Samsung ATIV S.But if there is another feature that is special about the Lumia 920 is its main camera. Beyond its 8.7 megapixel, the largest of the three phones compared, which has led to more comments PureView technology is used by Nokia that offers quality in the photographs as had never before seen on a mobile. His system allows high quality photos in low light conditions and image stabilizer, polemics aside, substance ensures improved video recording from the competition.The dimensions of Nokia smartphone loses out, being the thickest of the three little heavy and quite unlike most of its 6.53 oz. In return we have a more compact look great all the design \"unibody\" inaugurated with Nokia N9. Care adds details, such as wireless charging sold separately.HTC 8XThe headliner HTC is all a sample of expertise and stand out very well against its rivals, with several points in which the lead.The screen is not one of the sections which emerged victorious. The HTC 8X offers the smallest screen of the three devices with its 4.3 inches, but it does maintain a great resolution of 1280x720 which give it the highest density of pixels from the comparison. Its Super LCD technology maybe stay a little behind the rest but offers more than enough quality. In their guts have the same processor dual-core Snapdragon S4 of ATIV S and 1GB of RAM, although in this case with less battery of three in competition. Storage also remains somewhat behind, with 16GB internal and lack of microSD card slot.Paragraph photographic eye, because, without hogging all attention wing that has taken the Lumia 920 in this issue, the 8X offers an 8-megapixel camera more than satisfactory, equipped with technology similar to what HTC has offered in its latest Android devices . And to complete the multimedia section, nothing better than to take their work with Beats Audio for great sound provide the terminal. Not to mention LTE and NFC connectivity it shares with its other two rivals.Despite seeming to be left behind by its smaller battery, less internal storage and lack of microSD slot, the explanation is found faster when we take a look at its small size. The 8X is the smallest of the three high-end WP8, but still thicker than the ATIV S, leaving its weight in a mere 4.59 oz. To this we attach a very attractive design that has received very good reviews from those who have had their hands in appearance and comfort.SAMSUNG ATIV SProbably the most enigmatic of high-end phones with Windows Phone 8. Samsung is superior in several sections.The ATIV S boasts the largest screen size with 4.8 inches they leave behind its competitors. Also, this comes with HD Super AMOLED technology so successful that the company has made on other devices. Instead maintains the same resolution 1280x720, leaving a lower pixel density than its rivals, although still at very high levels. Again we have a dual-core processor at 1.5 GHz and the same 1 GB of RAM, although in this case is supported by a battery of 2300 mAh, significantly better than their opponents. As for storage, the Samsung is the most flexible, allowing internal choose a size 16 or 32 GB and appending its possible expansion with microSD cards.The camera is perhaps where worst comes stopped ATIV S compared to the other two competitors in the high range. While maintaining the type with its 8 megapixel, lack of promotion by Samsung of the same rule we can think of as technological added special in this case advertise their rivals. The rest of the features is on par with its rivals, including the maximum connectivity LTE and NFC.That if, as a work of engineering the Samsung smartphone stands out from the rest thanks to its spectacular screen size in the body content thinnest of the three, with just 0.34 in. thick. To that we can add their meager 4.76 oz, almost on par with the HTC 8X, and you have a real beast of a body very content.

Had a friend break his screen a week after he got his and I just broke mine after a couple months of use.-Very little support material such as cases, running carriers, etc. Definitely none in stores.-THE APP STORE. Maybe Android spoiled me, but there are cobwebs in the Windows Store. Going from iPhone and an Android device, you will cry if APPS are your big thing. You can't Instagram(I don't really care about that, but I did like looking at my friends' pictures). You want to track your Weight Watchers points? Good luck. Have a favorite running app? Sorry. Those are just a few examples, there's a ton more. It's abysmal.****TL:DR VERSION****: I have nothing bad to say about the phone. It's a fabulous phone, truly a great experience and well made. I've never had one real complaint about HTC, I love them. But buy a case/insurance ASAP. And if you want a phone that has an APP store with more than 5 things, you're out of luck. Right now the Windows Experience is like being the only person that listens to a hip band, but that band charges you $300 for a 10 second show. Since mine is broke, I don't think I'll be getting another one to replace it. But when Windows gets an APP market that rivals Android, I will return with excess speed.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "stopped booting", "Author": "meta gx", "ReviewID": "R3088JJ4T5QNJQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had the phone for a couple weeks and it stopped booting up.

In general I'm liking the phone, the battery life is great, Windows Phone 8 is a very good upgrade from 7.5. The case of the phone feels nice to hold. However, there are many small things which annoyed me with this phone:The power button is hard to reach! It would be even more annoying if my hands were any smaller than average, as it is I can just reach.The touch screen is not calibrated right for where the screen edges are. It detects my fingers as on screen when I'm sure they should be off, and often doesn't respond to me touching the start+back buttons because I touch it a smidgen too low down.The buttons on the side are hard to feel with fingers, it's hard to manipulate them without looking.The camera is hard to use, it is hard to focus + aim at the same time, and in my experience so far does not take such good quality photos in normal to dim light.

It feels right in the hand.  I would buy this phone if you are interested in a new OS or have to access Outlook/SAP/VPN.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eight Times the Phone Greatness With the Windows Phone 8X", "Author": "Eric J Wilborn", "ReviewID": "R2ZE29EV3A015G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're new to the smartphone game or if you just want to change up your experience a bit, you need to look no further than the Windows Phone 8X by HTC. With Windows Phone OS navigating the user experience, users who work with or own a PC at home will feel, well, right at home. Android, iPhone and BlackBerry users will find this refreshing, while first-time smartphone users will find this very welcoming.One aspect of Android that keeps so many users close to its heart is the ability to customize. As HTC also produces Android phones, they kept that in mind and offered a main customization right out of the box: colored handsets. If you want to keep it basic, they offer black. But for those who want to set their phones apart from the crowd, you can choose from a deep blue, a vibrant red and an electrifying yellow. Once you've picked the right device color for your life, you can change the color of the Live Tiles on the home screen as often as you would like.What are Live Tiles, you ask? I'm glad you asked! Your \"Start\" screen (the screen that is \"Home\" on your phone) contains tiles. It can hold as many or as few as you would like. You can pin people to your Start screen and even your favorite games. Practically everything on the phone can be shown on your Start screen.Other commonly featured tiles are a time/date/weather tile, messaging, mail and phone. But you're not common, are you? If you don't use your phone for that whole talking thing very often, then you don't have to display it. Leave room for what matters most in your life, like your photos.So why are they called \"Live Tiles?\" Live Tiles are \"live\" because they update. Of course the time, date and weather will keep you up-to-date, but so will the messaging tile to tell you if you have unread messages. Miss a call? Your phone tile (should you choose to display it) will let you know about that, as well.Want more innovation? There's more innovation with the Windows Phone 8X! If you like to take pictures, then the 8X is definitely a phone to consider. The front-facing camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens that helps you get more in frame. Don't worry about dim rooms either. With a fast lens on board, the 8X is great in low-light situations, as well.To bring all of the camera features together, HTC provided its users with an external camera button. Press it once to enter camera mode, press it again to take a picture. With so many people relying on their phones to be their cameras, why not make it something simple?However, if you'd like more control of the picture, feel free to dive into the vast array of settings available. I personally couldn't find a situation where the camera didn't take a great photo.For those who rely on their phones as a music source, HTC had you in mind, as well. Beats Audio is a wonderful and welcome addition to any and all devices in my mind. Plug in any pair of headphones and quickly notice the difference. I constantly find myself hearing new tones and aspects of songs that I've been listening to for YEARS. And if you watch a movie on the 8X, you'll find that Beats Audio brings you about as close to a theater experience as you're going to get when paired with a 4.3\u2033 screen.In short: If you're looking for a great new phone, then get thee to a Verizon store and pick up an 8X!

I would have given the performance a full five stars however the phone takes a while to boot up, other than that the performance is great.The material used for the back of the phone has a nice texture with good grip, it should be used on all phones.The sound is very good; especially with the HTC blue took stereo headphones. My one complaint is a lack of a graphic equalizer, however that is not a big deal due to the improvement of the built in audio. I personally prefer having an EQ to adjust so that is one area lacking from the WP 7/WP 7.5.The screen images are crystal clear and sharp, and the size of the screen is good.There is still a limit on the availability of apps, such as I Heart Radio does not have an WP8 app yet. The ESPN, Weather Channel, Facebook, and Twitter apps are very good, better than the Android apps. (with the exception of Facebook)I am pleased that this phone has integrated Windows Live messenger and Facebook Chat into the messaging feature as did the WP 7 and WP7.5, Android phones need that feature.As with the WP 7 and WP 7.5 contact sync is simple and quick by with signing into Windows Live, Facebook, and Twitter.

It is undeniably the best looking phone I've ever held. Sleek, light, really great screen. I had been curious to try WP for a while, and I'm really glad I waited until the 8X came along. Coming from Android, I wanted something that was fresh, reliable and a little out of the ordinary, and I'm very happy with my choice. I had the choice of spending hundreds less for a Samsung GSIII or the Nokia 920 but I just don't like huge phones (not to mention the 920 was heavy as a brick).Pros:- Great look and feel, both physically and UI-wise, can't emphasize enough- Super light and right-sized for people who don't have huge hands- Has never crashed, but there have been instances where apps encounter an error and you have to exit- Smart enough to wait for wifi for large downloads- Super easy set up with Outlook and Gmail- Google contacts transferred over automatically- Outlook calendar syncs great, calendar notifications work flawlessly- Office attachments look better than on other phones - but don't expect to do any real \"work\"- LiveTiles are convenient, and you can \"pin\" almost anything to the start screen- Able to \"hide\" a set of contacts (such as fb) in your address book but still able to search through all of them- Option to view emails in threads or individually, as well as linking inboxes- Video capability is pretty good, but I don't use muchCons:- No good Google maps, chat, etc. since Google announced that they aren't going to develop any WP apps (sigh Goog, gone the way of conceited fruit company - they can go .... themselves) - there are some unofficial apps, but they are just ok- Lack of true notification center - LiveTiles are supposed to replace the need for one, but still wish there was a go-to place with summary of notifications- Inboxes take longer to sync - if I read an email on my phone, it will still show as unread on my computer for a while, and vice versa. No idea why they can't fix this, though new mail gets pushed instantaneously- Occasionally on calls I will accidentally hit 'Hold' or hang up - not sure why this happens, but I've never turned on the camera like some people have mentioned- Bing search is hard-wired into the third button, and will launch any where any how if you hit it. I'm lukewarm on Bing, it still doesn't give me good local search results- Lack of apps - this a big one if you really can't live with the apps that you know and love. I would suggest checking out the store to see which ones have WP8 versions. Even if some are official, they may not be as good as  Android or iOS apps. Hopefully this will improve as more people adopt WP, but I'm not holding my breath- For a while my phone was rebooting randomly, even after the so-called update fix. It wasn't enough to really bother me though, and start-up is pretty fast- Camera is terrible in low-light. Sigh.I haven't utilized the SkyDrive, XBox, or Rooms features yet, so can't speak to those. Day-to-day, battery life is decent and I can get >24 hrs with light use. I can't tell what the difference is with Beats audio, I think it's a sham (UPDATE 2 - see below). The things I miss the most about Android would be Google Maps and the confidence of knowing that there's probably an Android version available of any app out there. I'm a minimalist when it comes to phones though, so the 8X fits my needs. All in all, it's a solid device that will only get better as the ecosystem improves, and the OS is truly up there with the best. I hope that more and more people will adopt WP, and consequently companies and developers will take notice and start catering more to this OS.Update: Nokia Drive (voice assisted GPS) has been released in beta mode, also Google Maps is back. Haven't tried out Nokia Drive yet, but this is a good sign that things are finally moving along.Update 2: Pandora is now available (ad-free for the rest of the year!), and I have finally been able to test out the \"Beats Enhanced\" audio via headphone jack - I have to say, the audio sounds GREAT, appreciably better than when I plug my headphones into my computer.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "J-review", "ReviewID": "R2VUNOMSY3T0RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is game changer for me.

The front facing camera with the wide angle lens allows me to take brilliant self shots and I can have all my friends and family in one shot. I like to vlog and the clear video that the front camera can record is a huge plus for me. The audio quality is top of the line in my opinion. I haven't had any issues with hearing someone in noisy places and they can hear me very clearly. I also love the Beats integration that HTC did. I don't own Beats headphones but you don't need them to hear the difference. The high notes are clearer and the bass is ear bursting. I would recommend getting Beats headphones just to enjoy the full experience. I have not had any lag while using the device and I am what they call a power user. My phone is with me 24/7 and I am always on it. Having a dependable device at all times with awesome battery life is a must for me.

When switching to Verizon this appeared to be a solid replacement, and while there was a lot new to like in WP8 I ended up exchanging the phone for a RAZR M.The main issue was that roughly 10/15 of the people I talked with had issues hearing me, and there was often static and/or echoing heard from my end. This was not an issue with either my Focus or my RAZR. All reviews I read mentioned excellent call quality so I may have had a defective unit, however as I already did not like having to exchange the phone I did not want to try another.Also WP7 had turn by turn built into the maps app, which was especially useful outside of the country as data could be downloaded over WiFi and stored for full maps/nav on a route without a data plan. For whatever reason they decided to remove this in WP8.One last thing is that if you were used to the Zune wireless syncing that worked so well with WP7, this has been removed as well. Most people will probably prefer the Xbox music and WP8 setup where everything is done in the cloud, however if you have a large music collection (~20 GB for me) the old sync method was far superior.Otherwise there was a lot to like about the phone. Hardware was great, with solid build quality, good sound output and a great screen. WP is far ahead of IOS or Android as far as UI is concerned, and its nice that the experience is fairly consistent across devices (vs the different launcher, slight app changes and bloatware on my RAZR). Everything works smoothly and while WP is missing a few of the key apps (Pandora and Mint for me), it also has some unique apps as well, and with so many quality apps integrated into the OS very few additional apps are necessary.The maps and syncing issues will likely be fixed with software updates in the near future.
