The one I ordered appeared to be a Japanese model and required me figuring out the Japanese menus to switch to US English (but it was easy since my old HTC One menu was virtually the same).The phone is zippy quick.

I'm still learning how to customize everything but this is the best phone I've owned yet.FWIW, I am in the US (FL) and use T-Mobile service.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useless product", "Author": "Samuel Omoding Okiror", "ReviewID": "R31NUXXTP16PB2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone keeps blacking off, i mean the screen goes black every time.
