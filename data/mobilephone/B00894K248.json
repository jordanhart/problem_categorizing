{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone, but Not Perfect!", "Author": "LoveMyToys", "ReviewID": "R165VEBR24U1WP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GS3's sexy specs and glossy good looks (particularly in pebble blue) won me over.  On launch day, I swapped my beloved Droid Razr Maxx, for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Prior to the Maxx, I briefly owned the Verizon version of the GNexus (which I can't recommend at all).  Before I get into the nitty gritty details, with pro's, con's and comparisons, at the time of this review, this is the phone you have been waiting for--the phone that will make you use that upgrade or cause you to sign a ridiculous contract with Verizon.  After spending ten minutes with the phone, it's an obvious step up from the Razr Maxx and Galaxy Nexus--the former top tier Android phones on Big Red's network.PerformanceAs much as I loved my Razr Maxx (and its marathon 2-3 solid days of battery life), after spending a few minutes with the GS3, the performance leap is very noticeable.  The GS3 is silky smooth, with no lagginess at all.  Apps (particulary heavy duty games like GTA III) launch quickly and are game play is flawless.  I know many of you aren't going to play anything requiring more than the occasional fling of a few angry birds, but the GS3's ability to handle hardcore mobile games with ease is a sure fire indicator that it will be able to run 99.9% of the apps out there in two years.  In other words, this phone has the chops to allow you to make it through your contract without starting a countdown for your next upgrade.How about some real world examples of the GS3's muscle?  The Qualcomm S4 chipset with an industry leading 2gb of Ram can cut through 1080p video files like butter.  Surprisingly, it was able to play back a 23.5 mbps AVCHD file using hardware decoding decoding!!!  I was even able to take play back the file with the video in screen, while I did a couple of google searches. The average $400 laptop would have a tough time handling that!The GS3 doesn't disappoint on the audio side either.  While HTC touts its Beats Audio Technology, that's nothing more than a brand name equilizer setting with limited value-- unless you're spend $100 or more on a beats headphones (which I personally don't care for).  Sammy, on the other hand, dropped in two Wolfson digital to analog converters, which allows the GS3 to pump out lossless high bit rate music with ease.  Using a pair of Etyotic HF3 IEM earphones, sound quality was crisp and clean for music playback.  Even lossy tracks streaming from Amazon Cloud sounded surprisingly full.  Much more so than on some other phones that I own.  In terms of music playback, the GS3 is every bit the equal of the iPhone and possibly a little better.The ScreenThe's GS3's 4.8\", 720p HD screen is a stunner!  The Super AMOLED panel provides rich color saturation and outstanding contrast.  The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.  the slight curve in the design makes it a pleasure to touch.  Text is crisp and I see no issue with this most recent implementation of pentile technology.  The fuzziness from Galaxy S, GNexus and Fascinate is a thing of the past.  Watching videos on the GS3 is a treat.All is, however, not perfect with the GSIII's screen.  While the contrast and color saturation are strong points for the phone, if you like natural color tones, the pumped up saturation levels may bother you.  Personally, I would dial back the saturation level if I could.  The GS2 had a settings menu that allowed users to tweak brightness, contrast, tint and saturation.  For reasons I don't understand, that great feature was some how left behind on this next gen phone, which is a real pity.While saturation is a matter of taste, the real issue with the screen though is brightness.  Even cranked to 100%, the screen still seems to be a few nits behind the curve.  I would love to be able to dial up to 120%.  The maximum brightness is noticeably less bright than the screen on the Maxx (which Motorola sourced from Sammy).  So, what gives?  I am not sure, but my best guess is that in the interest of improving battery life and to compensate for the size of the screen (and the power that size screen will suck), Sammy choose to put a software restriction that limits the ability of users to pump of the brightness.  Hopefully, this can be cured by a future firmware update.While the brightness could use a boost, this deficiency is further amplified by awful auto-brightness implementation.  When auto-brightness is turned on, the phone makes sudden and drastic adjustments in brightness even in a consistently well lit setting.  It seems as if the software has only 3 settings for brightness when it is set to auto--low, medium and high (which isn't that high to begin with).  The phone will drop from high to low suddenly, leaving the screen unreadably dark.  Until Sammy sends out a software update to fix the problem, I have disabled the auto-brightness feature.Software ImplementationThe user interface for this latest version of touchwiz is really very nice.  This phone provides IOS levels of comfort and ease of use to a smartphone beginner, but allows the flexibility for the nerds among us to customize the phone to suit our needs and tastes.  CNET and Phonedog have done excellent video reviews on the GS3's user interface and software features and highly recommend that  you check them out (Amazon won't allow links to outside sites--so you'll have to google them).I do have a few software gripes, one of which could effect some peoples' buying decision.One of the purported advantages of the GS3 over its top competitors from the HTC One line of phones is the fact that the GS3's has a micro SD card slot and accepts up to 64gb cards.  Android allows must apps to be saved and launched from the micro SD cards.  This feature allows low and mid-range phones to be made with limited internal storage because users can add their own cards.Sammy, however, wants power users to buy the bigger capacity 32gig phones for an extra $50.  To force us to buy the step up model, Samsung disable the ability to move apps from internal storage to the micro SD card.  I am not sure of the size of the app partition in the phone, but I hope Sammy didn't put too big of a restriction on internal storage or that could be a problem for some people down the road.  I understand why Sammy made the decision to disable the feature, but it seems like a low rent Apple type move to me and, in fairness, the HTC One series doesn't accept SD cards at all (nor does the iPhone nor any of the current Windows 7 phones).Another small grip I have is with Sammy's decision not to incorporate ICS's native ability to generate folders for apps simply by stacking one app icon on top of another .  Motorola incorporated this feature on its ICS update to the Razr and its native to ICS, so why force us to have to press the menu screen, select create folder and than drag and drop files?  Sammy, that's very Gingerbread of you.  A good UI should use the strengths of the underlying Software and improve on the weakness--not just make changes for change sake.  This is one of the few areas that the Sammy's \"Nature\" UI seems to fall short.Battery LifeGripes are over for now. :)  The batter life on the GS3 seems pretty decent.  I have had it off the charge since 8:30 this morning (its 4:47 in the afternoon), and have been using the phone heavily.  Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.  I have done some light web surfing--shopped on ebay and amazon for a new case for the sammy.  Send about 7 or 8 emails, 10-12 tests, and made about 80 minutes worth of phone calls.  Brightness is set to around 90% (auto-brightness is disabled).  I even played about 15 to 20 minutes of GTA III, and watch about 20 minutes of an episode of Lost on Netflix.  It's now 6:33 in the evening and the battery says it has 62% remaining.  I would still be in the mid-80's with the Razr Maxx and the GNexus would have been dead or on the charger a few hours ago.I would say the battery is good--but it's not close to being in the same league as the Maxx.  The fact that it is removable, however, does give it a major step up on phones like the HTC One (X-S), Razr (original), Sony ION, iPhone 4S and Atrix HD.  In short, if you are on Verizon and don't need the Maxx's 2 full days worth of battery life, I would take the GS3 over the Razr Maxx (which is exactly what I did).CameraThe camera on the GS3 gets top marks.  It uses an updated version of the same 8MP Sony sensor used in the iPhone 4S.  Unlike the iPhone 4S, there are options galore for tweaking your photos.  I am really impressed with the sharpness of the phones, even in low light.  Depending on the shot, the camera on the GS3 (and photo quality in general) is very comparable to photo quality on the Nokia 808  and iPhone 4S.Video quality is on par with the photo quality.  It shoots very smooth 1080p video.  Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.  If you shooting a sporting events or other fast paced action, or are pan quickly, there is a lag in time while the camera gets in focus.  In fairness, I see the same issue with the iPhone 4S and I have yet to see a smart phone camera do better.  Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.  Unlike its GNexus stable mate,  the qualcomm radio and baseband in the GS3 are top notch.  I have excellent signal strength on Verizon's network.  Call quality is excellent.  The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.  Data on Verizon's 4G LTE Network is also strong.  I located in the metro NY area.  I am consistently pulling 18-24mbps download and 9-16mbps upload speeds on the 4G Network.  I get strong reception for Wifi and great broadcasting for Bluetooth as well.Comparison with CompetitorsI have no regrets about trading up from the GNexus to the Razr Maxx and even less regret about trading from the Maxx to the GS3.  Despite its plastic build, I think the phone does have a premium feel.  It's not as solid as the Maxx, but no one is going to look at the pebble blue version of the GS3 and thinks--that thing looks cheap.  It's comfortable to hold.  The HTC One X has a sharper, brighter screen and a camera that is on par with the GSC's.  The lack of a user removable battery is a big knock against the HTC One series however.  The iPhone is, well, an iPhone.  As nice as the iPhone 4S may be (and it's great phone), the lack of LTE capability and low data rates on Verizon's CDMA network make it a no go for me.  On ATT, however, it can take advantage of higher HSPA+ speeds, but ATT's network has been having some issues lately.  For that reason alone, if I am married to ATT or am on Sprint or Verizon for that matter, I am taking the GS3 over the iPhone 4S.ConclusionThis is a solid phone and a no brainer if you are on the market for a phone right now and have $200.00 in your pocket!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for older people", "Author": "Mel Doner", "ReviewID": "R1847EB8N6U0SG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got my phone the first day it came out.  I upgraded to a smartphone so I was not too sure if I would be able to figure it out but this phone was not too hard.  First thing is that it is so light and thin I was afraid of dropping it and was not comfortable holding it until I put a case and screen protector on it, but after I did so it was great. The case added just enough grip to make it easy to hold on to.  The on/off button is placed in such a way that if you squeeze it, you end up also squeezing the volume button on the other side, so I ended up pushing it while holding in one hand with the other hand, not always convenient.  The big screen is wonderful (I upgraded just for this, as I am older with bad eyesight) and everything is large enough that it can be seen without reading glasses for those of us with poor eyesite.  All the most frequently used items are right there when you start and you can customize all your screens if need be.  Making and answering calls is extremely easy and the dialing screen has large buttons and easy to access controls.  Also the buttons are labeled with what they are, such as end call for those of of who get confused by icons so we don't end up hanging up when trying to push speakerphone.  Same for texting. The speaker is clear and loud enough so that if your hearing is starting to go you can still understand people.  If you are in the car you can easily bring up the voice assist with just a quick tap and instruct the phone what to do, either make a call or to send a text (in this case you would dictate the message).  Appointments and reminders can be made the same way.  I love that on the very front it has voice assist search for google, something I use all the time (locating a type of store, reviews of products, etc).  Apps are easy to download and very quick.  This phone with 4G service is as quick and responsive when accessing the internet as my home computer.  I am a news junkie and I am able to see all the websites I would normally visit and easily read them without feeling like I cannot see what I would normally be able to see.  The large screen means limited scrolling and easy viewing.  I did not try the navigation apps included but downloaded one called Waze which works better than my onstar navigation included in my car.  This phone has easy access to WiFi so if you want to conserve your data usage it is easy enough to use that instead.  The notification bar is informative but the phone also has a small light that flashes so that when your screen is not on you can see that there is something that needs your attention. Battery usage is okay, I would make sure that you charge it every evening if you are a heavy internet access person.  It takes a couple of hours or so to fully charge directly from an outlet, longer if charging from usb port.  Taking pictures and video is a snap and the quality is wonderful.  There are a lot of other features that I have not had a need for (such as sharing files).  Overall I am very pleased with this phone.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone with Some Drawbacks", "Author": "C. Rose", "ReviewID": "R184IB3M3KKZ7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The look and feel of the phone is like none other. It is thin, light, and really really powerful.Software:It has some really advanced features such as automatic face tagging, turn over to pause, and more but I find that I really don't use those features as much as I thought I would especially since they are they aren't fully mature (ex: I have tagged my wife's face at least 3 different time and it still doesn't work). As a result, I don't use the \"cutting edge\" features as much as much as I thought I would. However, the phone excels with the day to day features that even gives my tablet trouble (my tablet Asus Transformer reboots almost 2 times/day. My cellphone, none :-)).Reception:My wife has an Evo 3D, we have also owned an LG Optimus, and Blackberry's have all have had 5 bars reception whereas my Galaxy S3 only gets 1-3 bars, mostly 2.Conclusion:Overall, I really like the phone despite the reception issues. I have never owned an Android phone in which I got to truly experience a seamless Android experience before I had the Galaxy S3. Might I also mention that this is the best looking phone in the market and it feels great to hold.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Size Screen, Snappy ICS 4.0, Great Phone - US Version", "Author": "electronicnut", "ReviewID": "R2AG14Y47JHLK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network. Other networks such at AT&T; and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "exellent phone fastest", "Author": "wilson", "ReviewID": "R2W0QK3JRYCCK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well guys dont listen to the hater applefanboy below i mean seriously why are you comparing to and iphone crap all you did was talk about siri plz next time talk about the phone not one featureProsState-of-the-art everything. Advanced call-quality features.ConsPlasticky body. Really, this lack of clarity on Sprint's LTE rollout is getting ridiculous.Bottom LineThe Samsung Galaxy S III is a top-of-the-line Android smartphone just waiting for Sprint to turn on its new LTE network.The new flagship smartphone from the world's number-one mobile phone company, Samsung's Galaxy S III ($199.99 with contract) is literally a huge achievement. If you love big phones with lots of options, the GS3 will deliver state-of-the-art performance with bonus sharing and media features that you're likely to continue discovering a year from now. Sprint subscribers now have two solid choices: The Galaxy S III ties with the HTC EVO 4G LTE ($199, 4 stars) as our Editors' Choice for touch-screen smartphones on Sprint.Editors' Note: The Samsung Galaxy S III models on all four major carriers are extremely similar, so we're sharing a lot of material between our various reviews. That said, we're testing each device separately, so read the review for your carrier of choice.Physical DesignAll of the new Galaxy S III models look the same, except for the carrier logo on the back panel. Each is available in dark blue or white (AT&T; also has a red option coming this summer), and they're some of the biggest phones we've ever handled. At 5.4 by 2.8 by 0.34 inches (HWD) and 4.7 ounces, the GS3 is slightly bigger than the already-large HTC One X ($199, 4.5 stars), although it's still noticeably smaller and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy Note phone/tablet hybrid ($299, 3 stars).  That said, this is not a phone for folks with small hands.View SlideshowSee all (5) slidesMoreI'm not a fan of the huge phone. But I've given up on panning them because every time I suggest these handsets are too big, I get pummeled by comments from people who adore them. Huge phones are the thing. I accept it.The all-plastic body feels a little less high-end than the exotic materials of the HTC One series, but the phone is solidly built, and light despite its size. The front of the phone is dominated by the 4.8-inch, 1280-by-720-pixel Super AMOLED HD screen. Yes, it's PenTile, which can sometimes look slightly pixelated. But, no, you probably won't notice. Below the screen, there's a physical Home button, as well as light-up Back and Multitasking buttons that start out invisible, so you have to memorize where they are or change a setting to keep them illuminated. The 8-megapixel camera is on the back panel, which, thanks to its reflective finish, doubles as a pocket mirror.The default Automatic Brightness setting makes the screen too dim. Kill it and pump up the brightness and it's fine, even outdoors. It's not as bright as the One X's Super LCD 2 display, but it's fine.Unlike the competing HTC One X, the S III has a removable 2100mAh battery. Taking off the back cover also reveals the microSD card slot, which supports cards up to 64GB.loading...Call Quality and InternetAre you willing for Sprint to pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today? The EVO 4G LTE  promises spectacular call quality with HD Voice...sometime in 2013, once Sprint gets the network running. But the GS3 lets you tweak your call quality now.Default call quality is good. Volume is on the high end of average, with no distortion from loud inputs. The speakerphone isn't quite loud enough to use outdoors, but it's fine for the car or a boardroom. The microphone does a good job of cancelling background noise. Bluetooth headsets work fine with Samsung's S-Voice voice dialing system.But as with so many things here, call quality gets richer if you burrow down into the GS3's menus. A Volume Boost button throws the phone into a super-loud, quasi-speakerphone mode for noisy areas, but that's just the start. Deep within the settings, there's an option to set custom call EQ. The phone plays you a sequence of quiet high and low tones and you tell it which ones you can hear, and then it EQ's calls accordingly. This is pretty radical stuff. I prefer my calls sharp, with more high-end, and the GS3 delivers.On data though, the Sprint GS3 is crippled. All new Sprint phones are. Although the phones support speedy LTE, Sprint has steadfastly refused to give us a rollout timetable for its new LTE network, leaving its high-end smartphones on the slowest 3G network in America. We tested Sprint LTE, and it's competitive with AT&T; and Verizon, but none of this matters a whit if Sprint won't tell us when anyone is getting it.This is why Sprint's Galaxy S III is getting a slightly lower rating than the other major carrier models. Sprint needs to get its act together. We will not give a Sprint phone a 4.5-star rating until the carrier gives its subscribers more information about LTE coverage.You'll have better luck getting your Internet via Wi-Fi on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are also onboard, and Google Wallet is preloaded.Our battery test didn't complete because we ran out of time. But that's good; we just about ran down the battery with an 8 hour, 35 minute call. This phone has solid battery life, and considering the battery is removable, you can carry a spare. That's something you can't do with the EVO 4G LTE.Software and PerformanceThe Galaxy S III runs Android 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" with a whole lot of exclusive Samsung extensions. Performance was excellent in my tests. The Qualcomm S4 chip running at 1.5GHz is the fastest one we've seen in smartphones so far, and it's able to take on any app challenge you throw at it, including games on the HD screen. Our benchmark tests proved this, although they were within the margin of error when compared with the One X. Both phones are very fast.Exclusive new features include S-Beam, the ability to transfer files by tapping two phones together and using a combination of NFC and Wi-Fi Direct; S-Voice, Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri; TecTiles, NFC-enabled accessory tags that can change the settings on your phone, and lots of sharing and tagging options in the camera, such as the ability to automatically tag your friends' faces, and the ability for multiple GS3s within a few feet of each other to automatically share all of their photos.Many of these features work well, but they're almost all buried. The interface is something of a scavenger hunt. Take Smart Stay, a neat new feature which detects your face and keeps the screen from going black while you're looking at it. I love it! But it's not on by default, and the only way to turn it on is by going to the Display area under Settings. S-Beam is similarly buried, under the Wireless menu.Samsung helpfully pops up various screens telling you about various cool gestures you can use, like raising the phone to your face to automatically call someone you're texting. But it's a lot of information to absorb, and a lot of gestures that you've never used before. There's a sharp learning curve here.Compare this with HTC, which has been working to reduce unique UI elements. HTC's recent Sense 4 interface focuses on a few new features and makes them integral: enhanced sound, a faster camera, and solid social networking integration. Samsung offers a lot more, but it costs you a lot more mental energy to figure it all out.I'll also call out two minor disappointments. The screen rotated unexpectedly more often that I'd like. Also, S-Voice isn't as seamless or as complete as Siri. It's a fine voice-dialing system, including over Bluetooth, but I kept vocally stepping on its prompts when trying to ask it more complicated queries.Beyond that, there's the usual raft of bloatware from both Samsung and Sprint: I count 17 pre-installed apps, some of which (Samsung's Music Hub store) didn't actually launch, and some of which (Samsung Apps and the S-Suggest app) are frustratingly redundant. Beyond that, there's the 400,000-plus apps in the Google Play Store.MultimediaThe 16GB Galaxy S III we tested had 12GB of available memory plus support for microSD cards up to 64GB, which fit under the plastic back panel. There's also a 32GB model for $249.99 with contract, but given the phone's microSD support, I don't see the point of buying the more-expensive model. It plays all the usual music and video formats, including MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, MPEG-4, H.264, DivX, Xvid, and WMV at resolutions up to 1080p.Samsung has customized both the music and video players. They aren't as good-looking as HTC's, but they're functional. Along with the typical music navigation, there's a frill called Music Square, which grades all of your music on a 2D scale from \"calm\" to \"exciting\" and \"passionate\" to \"joyful,\" creating custom playlists by mood. There's also an epic number of EQ presets, which change the sound in effective, if gimmicky ways.The picture/video gallery integrates Google and Facebook albums, and lets you sort your videos as a list or with thumbnails. The flagship feature here is Pop-Up Play, which can float a video playback window over other apps; I found it to be fairly useless. Netflix and YouTube both look good and run on LTE without any visible buffering. The phone also comes with Samsung's Media Hub music and video store, which has a solid lineup of recent movies and TV shows at industry-standard prices of $4 to rent and $15-$20 to buy.If you want to play your video on a big HDTV, you need to use Samsung's AllShare system, which like most other wireless video systems rarely works because your home network doesn't have the bandwidth, or a new-style 11-pin MHL adapter. Our old MHL adapters didn't work.The 8-megapixel camera takes good-looking, saturated photos that are sharp with little noise, at least in decent light. In our low-light test, the shutter speed dropped to 1/40 second, which will cause some softness if you don't have a steady hand. That's still better than many cameraphones. The 1-megapixel front camera also showed solid low-light performance. The video mode captures 1080p videos at 30 frames per second indoors and out with the main camera, which is more than we could say for the HTC One X.You get tons of gimmicky camera modes. HDR is considerably slower than on either the iPhone 4S ($199, 4.5 stars) or the HTC One X, and showed a tendency to create \"ghost\" images when I tried it. Smile detection worked well, and Share Shot lets you automatically stream photos to other GS3s in the area. Buddy Photo-Share tags faces with names based on the images in their social-networking profiles. Those last two are buried in the camera settings and while cool, you're not likely to stumble upon them easily.ConclusionsThe Samsung Galaxy S III and HTC EVO 4G LTE are both state-of-the-art phones. In our scoring system, they tie, each with unique features. The Galaxy has a removable battery, better video recording quality, and no hiss in quiet audio output. The EVO 4G LTE is made from higher-quality materials, has a brighter screen, a kickstand, a physical Camera button, better home-screen widgets, and HD Voice in the future. You can't go wrong with either.If these phones are just too big for you, go for the LG Viper 4G LTE ($99, 4 stars) packs dual-core power and the LTE future into a much smaller body. And if your upgrade isn't urgent, you may want to consider hanging on to that old WiMAX phone for a while, at least until you can find out when Sprint LTE is coming to your city.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sleek and slick!", "Author": "Bartleby the Sniveler \"bartlebysniveler\"", "ReviewID": "R1NHY2E780Y89R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from an HTC EVO 4g which I'd owned for a little over two years.

Includes a \"burst shot\" mode, which will rapid fire the shutter and either let you choose the best shot from the set, or keep them all.  I found this useful while trying to take pictures of my kids.-S-Voice kicks Siri's butt.. Seriously, Samsung has built in a very powerful voice command program.  It does more than Siri can, and actually works well... Unlike Siri.  It followed my commands without a hitch, even with my 1 year old yelling and banging pans in the background.  It did however get caught up with \"Dean\" thinking I said Scene or bean.  It would catch it 50% of the time.  Once I started using first names only, it was fine.Cons:-Camera Quality- I have to stress that it has very decent quality, Just not as great as my EVO.. Of course I stopped using my EVO since it literally took 20 seconds for the shutter to fire. Both are 8MP, but I think the lens was higher quality on the EVO.-Occasional lockup-  I almost didn't put this in the review, because I'm not sure if this is the apps fault or the phones.  There were a few instances where the screen would go black and I wasn't able to tell if the phone was on or off.  Hitting the lock screen a few times would generally fix the issue.  This was a vary rare event.-Slight Lag on app switching, when leaving camera mode.  Not a huge deal, but worth noting.All in all, I am extremely happy with the phone, and highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone, Beware the Hype", "Author": "K. Ray", "ReviewID": "RK7CMDXWR5ITP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad phone, just not as great as the hype suggests. I upgraded from an HTC EVO 4G, which I really liked, unfortunately it had an issue that could not be fixed. So I got the Samsung Galaxy s3. It is a good replacement for the EVO, and many of the issues I am having with it are user interface adjustments i am going to have to get used to, some minor others seem fairly major to me.The Good:Nice large bright, sharp screen. Videos, books, and pictures are clear, crisp and easy to view. (As with most every screen on any handheld device, they do not work well in bright outdoors).Loads of storage space, MP3's, eBooks, loads of pictures and a few videos and still plenty of room (In addition to the built in 16GB, I added a 16GB Micro Card) a friend added a 32GB card since he watches a ton of videos).Camera - Really nice pictures and easy to use and access controls with just one hand. Surprisingly good video as well, again ease of use is a real plus.WiFi- the wireless g capability makes this a really nice web device, picks up and connects to networks everywhere I go.Multi-tasking - On a phone call I can access the web or another app while talking on the phone, or look something up while doing a drawing or reading. I really love this.Voice Input - While not as awesome as SIR the voice input on the Samsung is still pretty cool and useful. A ways to go but definitely more than a toy.Battery Life - This is my main phone (home and work), I access the web often and apps frequently and I get a full day out of a night charge. (Of note \"FREE or ad driven apps\" will access the web to update the ads very often, as will social media apps, with the ad driven apps, if you sue them buy the full versions, and the social media and mail apps set the check for data/info settings to every few hours or even once a day rather than every 5 minutes.) You will see your battery life increase.The Not So Goods:Phone reception, is acceptable at best, My previous phones and my wife's iPhone all had or have good reception. In places that I never had a problem now I barely get 2-3 bars.4G Not an option for me, so unless you live in an area that currently has 4G I would not base buying the phone for it.Data reception, this took a month to get fixed, was a setting telling the phone to access the wireless network for data instead of the 3G network. Buggy, once off the phone works nicely.Mac compatibility - You have to download and install special software for the phone to be used with your Mac, so every Mac I want to connect to I need to download and install the software on. Many folks don't really dig the idea messing with their computer. The EVO just connect it via USB or Bluetooth and done upload and download.Specialty Software - Lots of cool software, BUT fairly useless unless you have another Samsung s3 or similar new phone, tablet or TV. I don't, so love the idea just can't use.Face unlock - again cool idea, not so great implementation. I took my Facelock picture indoors, now outside it won't unlock, or at night or if my head is not positioned just so....The On/Off button is on the right side, the volume rocker is on the left, when I hod the phone with my right hand my fingers hit the volume rocker and even with the case it is way too easy to turn the volume down or off.Clock/Weather screen on home screen. It is a nice clean simple clock and weather widget, except no real clock functions, (alarm, stopwatch, etc) that is a separate app.So in short this is a really nice phone, lots of very nice features, A lot of my gripes are because I was used to the HTC android OS the Samsung is nice but different. Some are much better, more than a few are just not well thought out and implemented. I will adjust, and would recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, not perfect.", "Author": "jra_ga", "ReviewID": "R2WS13GXGKH2T4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Upgraded from a Samsung Captivate to the S3.  Slightly larger than the Captivate, but not prohibitively so.  I love the bigger screen and the resolution is incredible.  I was already familiar with Android,so no big adjustments or surprises there.  One thing to be aware of:  If you use Windows 7 64 bit pc's, this phone will not connect using the provided data cable.  I fought this intermittently for a few days, searching the internet and downloading (supposedly) the latest usb driver from the Samsung website.  Didn't work.  Contacted Samsung Support, and after a couple of hours, their best recommendation was to do a hard reset on the phone and see if that cleared up the problem.  It didn't.  Tried it unsuccessfully, then contacted support again.  The first guy I talked to asked what operating system.  When I told him Windows 7 64 bit, he immediately said \"that's your problem.  The phone won't connect using data cable.  We're aware of the problem and are working on it.  No fix yet.\"  I spent a couple of minutes voicing my opinion on releasing a new phone with this kind of issue.  Didn't change a thing, but made me feel a little better.  After this, I went ahead and signed up for Google Drive.  Works great, and is really less aggravation than using the data cable.  I'm sure Samsung will, or may have already developed a fix, but after using Drive for a few days, I'm not too concerned about it.  Also, if you have a wireless network at home, you can use the Kies Air app.  Kind of clunky, but usable.One other small issue, and I've read other people complaining about this also.  I don't particularly care for having an actual \"physical\" HOME button.Neither of these issues is a show stopper, and in general I love the phone.

Coming from an original EVO, I thought it would be a great upgrade. It wasn't. Using the power button to turn it on, and then having to swipe the bottom of the screen is a PAIN to do one handed. The software is actually missing a lot of features from the original EVO. I returned it.I played with a friends Galaxy Nexus, and I realized quickly that Stock Android is actually pretty terrible. So many features are missing. Sense and Touchwiz really do add a lot of nice things. Sometimes they do make things worse, but generally they are much better.In the end, I picked up the Galaxy S3. Wow. It's so comfortable in your hand even though it's so large. It has nice rounded corners and easy to reach buttons.The EVO LTE does have better build quality, and if you dropped the EVO LTE and the S3 10 times, I'm sure the EVO would come out MUCH better. For now though, I'll just keep a tight grip on the S3.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Nakkiel", "ReviewID": "R1GUZHZ6Y0U634", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is very hard to beat. Since most people considering buying it are looking at either this or the iPhone I'll compare as much as I can between them.--------------------------------------------------I'll start with the negatives. Thankfully it is a very short list. The Galaxy S III does not and can not get Siri. It has S-Voice, which basically does the same thing, but it is not nearly as good. If you aren't sticking to pre-programed phrases then it has difficulty understanding you; sometimes even when using very similar phrases. Unfortunately I think this is largely do to them tip-toeing around patent rights owned by  Apple, so it is unlikely to get much better any time soon.Initial setup is actually fairly complicated. Much more complicated than the iPhone, which is designed for ease of use. However, once you learn how to do everything it becomes very customizable and is no longer difficult to navigate either.My third and last complaint is all the pre-installed software. It would not be an issue if you could uninstall some of it, but you can't. For example I bought a better music player app, but the one that came pre-installed cannot be removed because it is not listed as an app. The only way to do that would be to \"root\" the phone. These apps take up space for no real reason.---------------------------------------------------Despite having some down sides this phone is still simply amazing. To start it is incredibly fast and has amazing graphics for a phone. It is basically a small computer that makes phone calls. While the physical specs do not match up to the Note II (\"only\" dual core processor, half as much memory, etc) I do think the smaller size is worth it if you aren't wanting to carry around something so large. It is really more than fast enough. The only reason I could see the higher specs being necessary or even really beneficial is if you do some really extreme multitasking.Home screen widgets are simply amazing. Aside from app icons you can directly set up apps to function directly on the home screens so that you don't need to start them. For example I have a miniaturized version of my music player, a weather forecast for the area, convenient switch for the flashlight function, and an app that lists reminders of everything I need to get done right on my home screens. This way instead of having to access each to use them, which would make them of little use since I would have to remember to check each, they are right in my face allowing me to multitask at a much faster pace with very little thought or effort. And most widgets have different size and functionality options, and can be intermingled with app launch icons as you see fit. (You might throw an iTunes music sync app launch next to the music player widget, etc.)The voice to text works very well. Pretty much anywhere there is a text box of any kind there is also a voice to text option. If there isn't there is an option right on the on-screen keyboard, so unless the app itself is disabling it for some reason you will always have voice to text. The one thing it does not do well is e-mail addresses.There are really neat apps out there that I would never have thought of using my phone for. Want to use your phone to control iTunes on your computer? Plenty of apps for it. Want to remotely access your computer and directly control the screen for some reason? There are apps for that as well. Curious how much something you see in a store costs online but don't want to take the time to do web searches? Just download one of many apps available and scan the item's bar-code to get price comparisons. There are even Microsoft Word document editors with a great deal of functionality. They allow you to view and modify word, excel, and power-point documents.The screen is an ideal size for me. Not too big not too small. Battery life is acceptable, but anything with high graphics will drain it fast. They did make it very convenient to turn off features with one downward swipe at the top of the home screen, which helps turn off features when you do not need them. (Things such as wifi & bluetooth use battery power.) It is super thin/light, but I would have preferred a bit more battery life even if it meant being a bit thicker. However, unlike an iPhone the battery is replaceable and you can use micro SD cards to expand storage space. Up to 64 gig cards as well... so very good.--------------------------------------------------------All in all I am glad I chose this over an iPhone. The expandable storage was the primary reason I did, but it does have many really neat features as well. The one thing I really wish it had was Siri. I realize Apple is keeping it as an iPhone only app to try to keep customers buying the phone, but honestly all they really have to do is make an android version and completely overcharge for it.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Thomas F.

I compare it to loving someone with something incurable, because you feel limited in the amount of love you can give it. In this case, the something incurable is the data/wifi coverage. It doesn't pick up my wifi signal strongly enough, even my disconnected phone still picks up my wifi and I use that for the internet when I can. The 4G? You can forget about it, because you'll drain the battery even faster as it searches for it. The 3G? We all know it's slow and also a battery eater, but most times I have to click on a link a few times just for the page to load. I get a lot of problem loading page errors. I have all of my bars too btw. Then the phone overheats. I've called Sprint and they did \"refreshes\" but I think that is about as useful as the button you push to cross the street, it's more of a feel good that someone is attempting to do something than the issue being resolved. I still have time and I'm glad I ran into these problems early enough I can send the phone back in hopes that I do not get a worse phone. Same model of course. Another issue is the video quality. Beautiful. But I can't send those (unless I bluetooth it) because a 30 sec video will be 35MB!! I tried the MMS friendly video captures, but they're horrible. Video quality of the first video phone. I just don't get it. And for these issues, I bring the rating from a 4 star to a 3 star. I'm not happy....the battery life sucks for it to be a high end phone.

It is my second Samsung product and my third ICS device. After this week, it is now my hands down favorite \"toy\" and I can hardly put it down!Pros:Very fast processor. Tasks that make my 2 tablets hesitate, this thing chews them up. That little circle that says \"loading\"? Still looking for it.Display is a beauty. I love the crisp, saturated display and the stock jellyfish screen saver so far is my favorite. Watching Netflix is nice. This is where the 5 display really shows off the advantage. Having three kids, this was a selling point.Charges really fast, and has a decent battery life. Charged mine at 9am and it is 8pm, I still have 26% battery. I have made a half hour worth of phone calls, taken several photographs, surfed on the web, downloaded and personalized apps on my phone - etc.The camera is nice. Very little lag on the shutter. Pics are crisp and in focus.Cons:I don't particularly care for the home button, however I think I can live with it.The cell signal seems a bit weak, in areas I should have had service I got only roaming. This is standing side by side with a fellow sprint customer holding an iPhone.The body of the phone could have been a little nicer, IMHO. The little android Galaxy Player 5 I have feels more substantial. But the upside is this device feels light as a feather.USB cable, again this feels more flimsy than the SGP5 that I have. Could have been a bit thicker.So I currently have it in an Otterbox defender case and am loving it!

I have a macbook, I have the iPad, which is amazing. I have 2 iPod touch devices. When it came to buying my cell phone, I had my sights on the iPhone. It's the phone I had wanted for so long. I was so excited just thinking about it.But then I saw the Samsung Galaxy S3. I fell in love right away. It has a bigger screen, better resolution (in my opinion) than the iPhone. It has all the same functions the iPhone has AND more. It's also a more powerful phone, with more memory and more storage capacity than the iPhone. Plus, the Android market has many free and low priced apps. Apple CANNOT compare! Plus, I found a few areas here in my city where 4g is available, and the phone is just flawless with it.  I'm really happy with my purchase so far. However, I feel that Android is not nearly as user friendly as Apple's products. It kind of took me a bit to learn about the phone, but I'm getting the hang of it. Mind you, I'm a techie sort of person. It's easy to use once you figure it out, and it's even more comfy than iOS6, but I don't think it's as easy as iOS6. Also, battery life is AMAZING! I love it! I tried a little experiment where I charged the phone once in a day. The phone passed the test! It last nearly 26 hours without getting recharged. Definitely better than my blackberry! I love how I don't have to worry about charging the phone all the time, it's definitely good to know it can a whole day without me having to charge it.I highly recommend this phone! It is worth the money! You're getting more phone for the same or less than an iPhone 4S/5.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is all I have to say", "Author": "Dee M.

I upgraded from an evo shift, and was very hesitant to do so - I just really did not want to give up my physical qwerty keyboard. I agonized over the decision, but there just wasn't a great smartphone with Sprint with a physical keyboard that got really good reviews. So.. because the price of the upgrade was soooo cheap via Amazon, I decided to take the plunge.I do miss my keyboard, but i am adjusting my easier and faster than I thought I would. Using Swype is a huge help, and I am also finding that I am using the voice-to-text feature some, too. I don't think the lack of a keyboard is going to be as big of a deal as I thought it would be.Another one of my hesitations about upgrading, though, was a concern about the size of the phone. I have small hands, and I rarely carry a purse, so I was worried about being able to fit it easily in my pocket and/or it feeling comfortable in my hand(s). I am hoping I will adjust to this as well, but it is definitely hard to hold the phone with one hand and do anything with it with just one hand. My hands are just too small for my thumb to reach across the wide screen easily. I think I will get used to this and figure out a way to hold and use it better one-handed, but so far, this is my biggest complaint. I know the trend is for larger and larger screens on phones, but gee whiz... i don't want to carry around a tablet.Overall, it's a fantastic phone with lots of neat features (most of which I will probably never use!), and it's definitely a huge upgrade from my evo shift. If I can adjust to it being so much bigger, I will love it. For now, I just really like it. And I am super-happy I didn't have to pay the $100 upgrade price at Sprint or even the current $50 upgrade price at Best Buy.Edited to add: Forgot to mention that one of the main reasons I narrowed down my choices to THIS particular phone was because of the removeable battery - the HTC One nor the LG had that, and I want the option to do a battery reset and to have a replacement battery if/when I need it.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Need help with Itunes purchased", "Author": "Patricia M.

I absolutely love this phone. Everyone I know that has one does too. I like it so much I bought a white one for my mom for her birthday who that was hesitant to hop on the smartphone bandwagon. She felt she was too old to figure one out and didn't think she would ever use it. Now you catch her playing with it all the time lol. She just asks me to show her how do certain thinks be otherwise she has taken to it fairly well. Right now my town does not have 4g but it is creeping into this area and is available in certain areas of the next town. I did get a notice in the mail saying it is almost here. I find my phone plenty fast enough. I usually keep my phone set to CDMA because I was told by best buy LTE uses more battery. My coverage is just fine, dead spots are where other phones also have dead spots. Paying under $180 for 2 lines (myself and a friend) and having unlimited data and free any mobile calls makes it well worth the wait for 4g LTE. We were constantly going over minutes and data on verizon making our bill well over $200. We had a data malfunction on one phone and verizon refused to help or adjust the bill. If data was turned on it would eat 3g of data in minutes. We brought it to the store and they told us there was nothing running that should eat that amount of data and nothing wrong with the phone yet all they would do is charge us $5 for each g that phone ate. I love sprint the people are nice and they are not money hogs. I was given an airave for free to use in my home to boost my signal. The battery in this phone lasts quite long. Generally I can get 8 hours with heavy use and weather apps running in the background. The good news, unlike the droid, the battery can be removed so if you run out of juice you can just swap it out with a fresh one. The video quality is great, well enough to watch movies on. I love the s-beam feature too. I wish all phones had that feature. I'm always beaming things to my mom. When you call samsung they aren't completely knowledgeable of all the settings. We thought there was something wrong with my phone and it turned out to be a setting the can't be changed. The tech claimed it wasn't supposed to do it but it turns out it is a normal for the ringtone to start off quiet and get loud. They replaced it only for me to discover there was nothing wrong with my first phone so that was annoying. I always purchase insurance since I am rough on devices so it was replaced for free.

As a student, I would say I'm a fairly heavy user, between texting/using data all day and night between school and work, I've thoroughly enjoyed this phone.The biggest plus is the customization. You can decide almost everything about the lock screen, from how it notifies you that you're roaming, how you want the screen to unlock from 8 different options, to what apps you want on your unlock screen. I've redesigned my home screens many different times and have had no issues creating, deleting, and moving the pages. My phone looks and works different than my friends SIII. She also has motion turned on and I don't My only complaint in this regard is that when you download apps and you have free space on your home screens, it will automatically add this app to your screens and I haven't found a way to turn this off.A major complaint that I've heard is the sensitivity of the outside buttons. I purchased an Otter Box with my phone and immediately put it on because of my bad habit of dropping and breaking phones. When I occasionally take the case off, I do notice that the buttons seem fairly sensitive, however, when I began using the case, my chief complaint was that the buttons seemed a bit stiff, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.It has it's flaws, however the only one I can confirm totally is the excessive amounts of tutorials. It takes about a week before you've finally completed all the actions on the phone that gets a tutorial, and anytime you change preference (such as selecting to call someone with Phone instead of Skype by default), it pops up how to change that setting, despite the fact that majority of my apps are preset. Also, I had a small problem with the charger port, however the Sprint IT guy said that it was more than likely a cable short and he replaced my charger. I haven't had a problem since, but I docked the star for the overuse of tutorials and the fact that my charger died in a way after less than a month.Overall, it works well for me. I enjoy having the option of organizing my contacts into various groups to easily look at a certain group of people, I've dropped it many times (even on a tile floor without my Otter Box on) and it has yet to even begin to crack, I enjoy the high amounts of customization and use it regularly, and my data reception is so good I rarely turn on Wi-Fi and even when I spend half my day in a basement, I still get a full day out of a charge. I have noticed a time or two that it's had a bit of a lagging problem, but nothing that actually causes problems and would probably be fixed if I did a battery reset.

But even 3G is terrible here... I haven't moved, and my service is still the same spotty signals where my calls would now and then drop in the middle of a conversation. My texts can only be sent when I am in particular spots of the house. I guess that is what I get for trying to save money. What's the point of unlimited data/text/when I can't use it??Oh, and I did call Sprint asking about that hoping that they would send me an \"femtocell\" (a signal booster through broadband) or an \"airraid\" to help me with the signal problem. Nope... They told me politely that I \"qualify\" for one, but for $129/m plus $20 monthly fee. W T F?? I \"qualify\" to pay them more money?? Anyways, I think I'm done with Sprint... I might go back to ATT since I really don't use that much data and don't really need \"unlimited\" no signal from Sprint.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "make sure you get a screen protector", "Author": "diamente", "ReviewID": "RR2V4S32YSLW2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Galaxy 1 and this 3 is an upgrade.

I do as well (and yes, we really shouldn't do that, but it is what it is). When you set an alarm on the Galaxy, snooze is Off by default, so you have to remember to turn it on and then tell it how long the snooze time should be and how many times you are permitted to hit it for a given alarm. What a pain in the butt; the snooze feature should be on by default and let me have my choice between snoozing or turning off the alarm. Also, if you are a deep sleeper or non morning person like me, the stock alarm sounds on the Galaxy stand a good chance of putting you into a deeper sleep rather than - you know - waking you up.On the EVO, creating a folder for app icons is as simple as stacking the icons on top of one another; with the Galaxy, you must choose to create a folder (an ugly looking folder at that) and then slide the icons you want into that folder.S-Voice was unimpressive - and I played with it a lot. I had the phone set to show text for what S-Voice spoke; sometimes it would show me the text, sometimes it would not. Maybe that was Samsung's plan all along - to create some excitement by turning S-Voice into a little game where you and your friends can place bets on whether or not it will work.You are supposed to be able to use S-Voice to unlock the phone simply by speaking to it and that worked marginally as well.I use Google Voice in conjunction with my Sprint service; if someone calls me on Voice, I have to hit the '1' button on the keypad to accept the call. Easy, right? Well, not so easy when the screen keeps going black when I try to tap that button.On the EVO, if you tap the stock Clock/Weather widget, you are taken to either the clock or the weather forecast, depending on where you tap. On the Galaxy, tapping that widget anywhere will only take you to the weather, so you need to add a second clock widget to your screen or go into your apps each time you want to set an alarm.It's nitpicky, but Galaxy's icons for stock apps such as Messaging and Email are flat ugly to look at compared to those which HTC offers. Also, the EVO offers 'skins' which allow you to change the color scheme of your screen; the Galaxy may have that feature, but I looked for it and didn't see it.The physical 'Home' button on the Galaxy sounded like a nice idea in theory, but it kinda sucks in practice and the phone tends to lag between the time the button is pressed and you are actually taken to the home screen.The Galaxy feels very cheap in the hand versus the EVO and its glossy back becomes very slippery. Also, the back comes off the Galaxy MUCH too easily. I don't necessarily want to have to use a can opener to get the back off of a phone, but I do like having some resistance; I suspect that if the Galaxy were dropped, you would have to spend some time trying to figure out where the back landed when it popped off the phone, taking the battery with it.There is no difference in speed between the two phones, so don't let the extra gig of RAM on the Galaxy be your deciding factor.The Galaxy does have some advantages over the EVO. I liked having the power button on the side of the phone rather than the top and the volume controls are on the opposite side than they are on the EVO, so I was less likely to accidentally bump them. I also really liked being able to pull down the notification bar to toggle on or off services like WIFI, Bluetooth, Sound, etc.I am certain the Galaxy S3 is a good phone - there are too many favorable reviews to believe otherwise - and I am sure it works very well for someone willing to invest the time to learn to jump through all the hoops to perform simple tasks.As I said in the title; it's a good phone, just not for me.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, wrong network", "Author": "pjens", "ReviewID": "R122DHV8OXJF8W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would recommend another network to really test the true powers of the SIII.

The home button is mechanical instead of haptic. This makes it more difficult to use the phone one handed as the phone is very big and getting my thumb all the way down there to press on the mechanical button is awkward.2. Only three buttons. The Evo has a fourth button dedicated to google search. This makes it incredibly easy to find whatever I'm looking for. A short press on the search button and the Google Search app is ready for input. A long press and Voice search opens. On the SGS3 I can double click on the mechanical button (somethign I've already noted as a weakness of the phone), and while that shouldn't really be a bad thing...3. The S Voice feature in touch wiz is absolutely horrific. When the app loads it asks me what I want to do and I should be able to issue a number of different presets (\"Search\" or \"call\" or \"message\", etc, etc) but the software has really poor voice recognition. And any background noise renders it completely useless, as it responds to everything with \"Say 'Hello Galaxy' to wake me up!\"... Ahh... what? Why is that even the default instead of \"I can't understand you.\"? I believe this issue stems from the fact that S Voice is doing all the processing locally on the phone. Which brings up the question, why don't they just tap into Google's own \"voice recognition in the cloud\" offloading. If you use Google Search's own voice recognition, on the SGS3 it works perfectly. You would think I would just program my SGS3 so that Googe Voice Search came up with a home button double click, however...4. TouchWiz has practically NO customization options what-so-ever. I can change the wallpaper and I can move buttons around and that is about it. I can't even get rid of the TouchWiz home screen indicator that tells you what home screen you're on and consumes a whopping 1/5th of the phone's screen. Yes, its a big screen but come on. Why waste so much space on such a tiny platform with something so trivial?5. The bloatware can't be uninstalled. I've encountered this before on other phones (including my venerable Evo) however the bloat on the SGS3 isn't just (annoyingly) present on the phone. Its obtuse and intrussive. Oh, you're trying to make a phone call? Let me push a pop up over the dialer app so I can tell you how you should buy Dropbox to save all your mobile stuff that you already save with Google Drive, even though you've already checked the box telling me never to tell you this again... 5 times... in the last hour...and you're stuck with me because the app is embedded in the OS and can't be uninstalled.And these are just the biggest issues I have with the phone. There are many other gripes I have already encountered with the design and the software. With the exception of the mechanical button, most of these issues are surmountable, simply by rooting the phone and installing Cyanogen Mod however, the camera doesn't work in CM10 or 10.1. Its apparently a known issue that affects some, but not all, SGS3s. Lucky me. So I'm back to using TouchWiz just so I can get the camera working. And I hate it. I really hate it.So, with that all said, there are some good things. The phone is fast, like REALLY fast. The screen is stunningly beautiful. Full screen video with the Netflix app is excellent. The pair of headphones they give you with the phone are actually pretty nice. My cell reception is better with the SGS3.

The whole reason I got this phone, through this company, is because it said there was \"international\" service capabilities. This is not exactly true. They do NOT unlock these phones. meaning that if you go abroad, you have no choice but to use Sprint's international roaming service which is ridiculously expensive (I'm talking $2.49 per minute / $0.50 per text / 0.04 per KILO bite), instead of just unlocking it and switching to a local carrier for your trip. You could literally simply have your phone on, not make any phone calls or text and still wind up with hundreds of dollars of a bill just for roaming if you forget to place it on airplane mode.2) NO TETHERING!!! Well, there IS tethering, but it's an extra $20 a month if you want to use that service. Something I wrongly assumed would be free since there is \"unlimited data\" with this plan. All previous phones I had with other companies, you were free to use your data as you pleased, including tethering.The phone itself it not bad. I personally don't find it to be that amazing, it's just a smart phone with some cool features. I have never had a chance or a need to use any of the fancy s-beam stuff (looks cool, but really how much do you need that??).Oh, one more thing: this is a KNOWN issue, but Samsung refuses to recognise it and therefore cover it under the warranty - some of these phones fry SD cards. Mine has already fried three of them, and after this last one I just got tired of the wasted money / lost data and stopped using one in this phone. So there's that to... I checked to see if this was something that can be fixed, and that's how I found many tech forum discussions about this and learned it wasn't just my specific phone, but the Galaxy S-III model that tends to do this. Seems to be a \"luck of the draw\" kind of thing whether your phone does this or not.On the whole - not currently planning on breaking my contract over this, but do regret not knowing these things before I bought as I would have probably ended up going a different route. Regret giving up my service with T-mobile which I feel was MUCH faster on data (in the Los Angeles area, at least), and had free tethering and gave me a pretty sweet deal because I had been with them for so long.

That is crazy for $11 a month and besides I believe it should have been covered under the warranty.  Sprint said no, that Samsung would never approve a warranty claim for a cracked screen no matter what caused the damage, it is physical damage and not a warranty issue.  So I call Samsung.  The first lady I talked to was nice took the information and transferred me to Oscar; clearly not his real name; who told me that same thing Sprint did, it isn't a warranty issue.  As Oscar put it, they sent me a phone with out a crack, it arrived without a crack and now it is cracked, that isn't a warranty issue.

Living and working in the Dallas metro area, I checked Sprint's map to make sure we'd have 4G coverage in our area. The map showed full 4G coverage in all areas of the Dallas/Ft Worth metroplex where we'd need it, so we decided to proceed with the switch of phones and plans (not through Amazon). Got the phones, got our numbers transferred over the the new phones and proceeded with life. Well, I can't begin to tell you how awful the data coverage was in this area (never used the phone part, but we're both dedicated users of the data plans). Between my husband and myself, we could never get an internet page to display on our Samsung phone browser, nor could we even begin to use the Facebook app on the phone. My husband needed access to Google Maps while driving around for work, and he could not get sufficient reception for Google Maps to work. Over a 5 day period, between the two of us, we only got a 4G signal once when we were driving right next to a tower. The rest of the time, it was 3G (showing on the phone display) but because of the slowness, we never really could USE the data features of the phone.So, after 5 days, we canceled our service, returned the phones, and reinstalled our AT&T; service back onto our iPhones.

Veach", "ReviewID": "RTZPJQLXO4WTF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First let me qualify this review by saying I love the Samsung Galaxy S3 for its ease of use and fast intuitive interface.  You will love the speed of this phone.  Not to mention the slim form factor and design looks great.However,  I am so disappointed by the quality of the cover glass on the touch screen.  Within 2 weeks of babying the phone I had 2 prominent scratches about 1/4\" long and several micro scratches that could be seen if the screen was tilted the right way.  Prior to this phone I owned an HTC hero  with no scratching issues and was so excited to have the S3 but now am left with nothing but regret.I returned the phone to Samsung for evaluation and repair. After one week they had not contacted me with any updates so I decided to call.  Samsung informed me that the phone was not under warranty because the touch screen was damaged and that I had probably caused it by pressing too hard on the phone.  II reminded them that I didn't have any touch problems when I returned the phone and asked to speak to a supervisor and waited 20 minutes before Samsung disconnected my call.  I called back and was on hold another 30 minutes before I decided to end the call.  I tried going back to my carrier to dispute but they said I had to take up the issue with Samsung.My advice is to get a screen protector for this phone immediately and don't expect Samsung to stand behind their product.  I will never buy another Samsung product again which is a shame because besides the poor screen quality and non existant warranty it is an amazing phone.Update 11/26/12:  Shortly after writing this review I tried calling Samsung again.  I had to escalate my call through several layers of phone support until I got to someone who had the power to help me(could authorize a repair).  Initially they wanted to charge me $199 for replacement of the touch screen, but after escalating the problem to yet another customer service manager I was able to get Samsung to replace the touch screen and cover glass for free.  The whole process took about 3 hours.  In the end Samsung did not provide a detailed report or analysis for the scratched glass issue and maintained that my problem was a damaged touch sensor.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor performance", "Author": "Anon220", "ReviewID": "R1M7UL1C4BRZ4D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Terrible signal, most likely from a very compromised antenna.Horrible audio, both receive and transmit.Phone inhales batteries.

Nothing can truly sum up the frustration I've dealt with surrounding the usage of this phone, and in particular the COVERAGE provided via SPRINT. I've come up with a few terse statements that might figure well; following that I'll break down the Pro's, Con's and provide any other commentary for the wary buyer (this is YOUR MONEY we're talking about after all)\"A dismal, horrible wreck.\"\"Just like Gremlins; a cute Gizmo with tons of....well, GREMLINS.\"\"The most frustrating buy of 2012\"\"Infuriating.\"Plus, the statement you will doubtlessly find yourself repeating over and over:\"What the #@&*!\"Objective:This phone has endless media coverage. Particularly, with SPRINT's *alleged* 4G UNLIMITED DATA plan. You've seen it glorified and posted in every sporting event, and during the moronic pageantry of WWE \"wrestling\". BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE THE CUT. I sincerely can say it's the worst purchase I've made since buying a ticket to see BONES starring Snoop Dogg.Background:I live in the San Fernando Valley. CALIFORNIA. This is NOT THE BOONIES. It's not completely metropolitan, but it's hardly a RURAL WASTELAND...or desert for that matter. My problem is, the coverage for this device is DISMAL. I mean it is TRULY USELESS.Unless you are a stationary person who can find a key spot in the entire city (there are FEW) where the actual data plan provides adequate coverage you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THIS DEVICE TO ITS ALLEGED ABILITY.I've had this phone since December, it makes phone calls at a good percentage. I would say that at least 90% of the time I make a phone call it goes through without getting dropped. That is, UNLESS you're in a vehicle or walking. Stand STILL. It will work.I've experimented with SPRINT's coverage by walking several blocks in any location I have stopped at. The fact of the matter is that DATA coverage drops at a rate of nearly ONCE every 30 FEET. I know this is grossly inaccurate and UN-SCIENTIFIC, but i simply do not have the resources to present my argument FACTUALLY. I am merely speaking from experience.If you purchase this phone and wish to send an email or a picture via text to take advantage of the UNLIMITED DATA PLAN, you must first expect it to not go through. (MMS photo messages may take about 5-10 minutes to locate and download, but DATA simple data transfers *even EMAIL will seldom go through without encountering a NETWORK ERROR)If the battery module describes a lifetime of 8 hours and 25 minutes, expect it to work that long if you leave it at home in a drawer. This really translates to about 2 hours with infrequent usage.If you disable the WIRELESS signal option (to access WI-FI) it will inadvertently keep turning itself on. I've noticed that many people have commented on this. God help the person who's trying to be thrifty on their data usage plan.ALSO the keypad will inadvertently stop and an error message often comes up \"Sorry, the key pad has stopped working\". In order to resume typing anything you have to close the current window and recover exactly where you were at before.Initially the phone didn't come with a manual either. I found some manuals online, but on a first try I noticed that the file form was incompatible with the device. It is not equipped with a ADOBE FLASH file. You MAY however locate an older version on the adobe site for free.*If you manage to stay stationary and send a picture file or document, or download said documents, it will drain your battery life expontentially. (I'd guess at 4x the rate)My Phone account came with a $50 GOOGLE PLAY option for use (cross promotion) which has been useless for me. I \"purchased\" several albums on google play only to find out that they're actually and more accurately \"RENTALS\". You RENT the file on a server, and GOD HELP YOU IF YOU CANNOT ACCESS A SIGNAL TO STREAM ANY OF THE CONTENT.This even happens with BOOKS....  YES, BOOKS.A similar thing occurs when ATTEMPTING to watch a YOUTUBE video. My phone sometimes indicates a \"4G\" zone, but as soon as i activate a video on the YOUTUBE app, the 4G stops working and I see a swirling load arrow. This happens FAR TOO OFTEN TO BE CONSIDERED A QUALITY PRODUCT.SUM?: USELESSYou WILL ENCOUNTER THIS MESSAGE FREQUENTLY: \"NO SIGNAL FOUND FOR MOBILE NETWORK\", therefore I believe I have been suckered and baited into a worthless contract with a device that bears a slight resemblance to something of quality. What I have is truly a compact portable semi useful EXPENSIVE 8 Megapixel camera.It's taken me a long time to write this review and I hope it can assist someone else out there in making a proper decision. I believe most of the blame is upon the carrier. I'm going to see if i can transfer my 2 YEAR plan to another phone. This is ATROCIOUS. If you don't understand the level of frustration I feel, just buy one for yourself. Do a test drive, bring a friend out and see who gets browser results, who can stream video, who can get coverage.I feel nothing but disdain for this purchase and my hope rests on the dream that the resultant shoddiness of the product will nullify my contract, or that i may get in on a class action civil lawsuit by people who have purchased this phone.That said, I'll leave you with the positive:1) It's a phone and you can call people most of the time2) It has a pretty good resolution screen that seems to make some files look crisp3) If you like android devices, it doesn't crash or mess up TOO often.4) It has optional memory retention on keyboard devices, a talk to text option (my contractor friend loves this)and a stylus/finger to text option5) If you're a woman, it looks cute.6) Well, this one is far-fetched. BUT, if you happen to have problems with communication in your family, I suggest you buy one of these under the SPRINT network contract for your CHILD. Why, you ask?Well, because the sheer amount of frustration and resultant anger will DEFINITELY result in a conversation; perhaps the bunch of you will agree upon a common enemy. THIS PHONE. THIS PLAN.Horrible. Avoid at all costs, ask around. I won't even suggest any other phones, this is a candid, honest review from a guy stuck in a contract.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazingly Fast & Fancy Phone, TERRIBLE Build Quality", "Author": "Vax", "ReviewID": "R2Z0SQOAQHD5MG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Along with my multi-thousand dollar 50\" DLP TV, which had a defective chip that they came out and replaced 2 years outside of warranty for free because it was a quality issue, my Web-Connected BluRay Player and dozens of DVD & BluRay Burners, and many other Samsung products, I have owned Samsung phones of various models (Brick / Clam, Moment, Epic 4G, Epic 4G Touch, Galaxy SIII, etc) over the years, never with an issue. UNTIL NOW.Most recently, I had the original Galaxy S (Epic 4G on Sprint). Like most normal people, this phone was regularly dropped, carried in my pocket for nearly 2 years with normal wear and tear. Beyond a small chip on the edge of the plastic, it never had an issue. I work an office job, I'm not some construction worker that ran it over with a truck or something.Because of all the good experience, I decided to fork over another $200 and be locked into a 2 year contract to get the new Galaxy S3 a few weeks ago - it is an amazing phone - however, last week i dropped it FROM LESS THAN 2 FEET and to my horror, the screen is completely shattered. To top it off, just from being set down on tabletop surfaces (like my desk at work), the entire case is scratched, dented, and chipped - even the camera lens is so cheap that it's scratched to the point that the camera can't focus to take a decent picture - everything comes out blurry.Obviously, without paying the $150 deductible to Sprint to get the phone replaced with another remanufactured version of this same cheap plastic phone, Samsung has left me out to dry. Multiple drawn out phone calls with their foreign reps who barely speak English, where the rep says they will \"transfer me to a supervisor\" and actually hangs up on me.Apparently this is a common problem, I've found HUNDREDS of nearly identical stories to mine online, so I can't imagine this won't become a class action lawsuit unless Samsung works to make this right. Even if it means trading down to a higher-quality build (perhaps the Galaxy Nexus doesn't have these problems?).I can say that for me, if Samsung doesn't fix this, I'll never again buy one of their products.None of the executive customer care numbers seem to work anymore.
