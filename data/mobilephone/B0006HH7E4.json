{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Screen not visible in daylight.", "Author": "Janek", "ReviewID": "R23OGIW92SYYM6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I review the phone itself, a few words about Verizon. Their new plans count peak time till 9PM, not 8PM as it used to be. Even if you get more minutes, you're effectively loosing 20 hrs or so a month, and virtually eliminate night-time savings when calling East Coast M-F from the West Coast. This information is well hidden from prospective subscribers. Calling voicemail costs air-time minutes - make sure you program the phone to dial it automatically for speed. Their customer service has been easy to contact and pleasant to deal with, but there were numerous problems and mistakes that needed to be addressed when activating the phones and when reviewing the bills. Read your bill carefully.This stylish phone is quite well designed when it comes to integrating the variety of features it offers. There is, however, one glaring (no pun intended) flaw: the color screen is completely useless in daylight. I don't mean that it is difficult to read. It is impossible to read at all. No matter how you shield it with your hand, or try to find some shade; if there is more light than what you normally find indoors, the display simply looks as if it were turned off. There is no brightness adjustment, so it's not a question of setting the phone correctly. The only thing to be done is to find direct strong sunlight and then manipulate the phone just so, and maybe you will get a reading from this display as the sun rays reflect from the display's surface. Once indoors, or at night, there is no problem. The display then looks quite impressive and is functional.If outdoor viewing is rather handicapped, you do get compensated with a choice of wallpapers and screen savers for the display!Don't get excited about taking pictures with this phone. They are extremely poor quality. And yet, this is a gimmick pushed by both Motorola (the manual explains picture taking before anything else!) and Verizon, which wants you to pay some eight bucks a month to send up to 20 of these to other people. Someone is apparently joking around here.I have two of these phones. One of them has a somewhat brighter screen than the other, which makes manufacturing tolerances questionable. Again, brightness is not adjustable - only the duration of backlighting is. One of the phones initially had a problem with the display, but after wiggling the cover several times, the contacts apparently mated and now it works fine. However, the button backlighting turns itself off when you hit a key now and then, on either phone - someone working on power management has opted for reversed logic.The speaker phone cannot be turned on if the headset is plugged in. This makes it inconvenient if you want someone else to hear the conversation while you are using the headset. If you have the headset plugged in, folding the phone does not drop the connection - the phone disconnects only when it detects the other end of the line terminate the call. Be carefull and use the END key.Entering text can get complicated, even though Motorola tried to make it easy with their we-will-guess-as-you-type smarts - more confusing than useful. But once you get used to the basics of text entering, it's not too bad (except for that disapearing key backlighting I mentioned).Voice dialing works poorly - the phone usually does not recognize what one is saying. My old Samsung did much better than this unit (to put it simply, Samsung was useable, while this one is not). Also, it takes longer to dial with voice: you have to state a function first, than a name, each time having a little \"conversation\" with the phone's synthetic ego. A nice demo-level functionality, but quite useless in the field. The exercise gets even rediculous if you enter a person's name that's not common in English: the phone will insist that you pronounce it the way the voice synthesizer chooses to pronounce it, which means you either have to intentionally misspel it or else intentioanally mispronounce it. My old Samsung simply asked you to record your own pronounciation of an entry and then tried (quite reliably) to match it when you spoke it again while voice dialing.The selection of ring sounds offers a bunch of MIDI tunes that sound absolutely horrendous. Try using some of the more basic choices or else risk being taken for a moron by the public around you. Again, the corporate types want to steer you towards downloading more sounds and tunes for additional money.On the more positive note, the phone is stylish and convenient to use in other ways. The keypad and navigation buttons work very well. I like the single key speed dialing - but you have to dig deep into the manual to discover this feature. I also like that you can browse contacts, etc. while talking on line. In the dark the unit looks impressive and menus are thought out well. The speaker phone mode actually works. The contacts database is well designed, and you get a calendar and a calculator for good measure. The interface is quite customizable.But keep in mind that the plethora of functions can be overwhelming. This is not a gadget for technically challenged people.The reception quality is fine. Typically, you can hear people better (actually very well) than they can hear you. The headset that comes with the \"Essentials Pack\" works well and is easy to wear, but keeping the plug close to the ear canal can be a bit problematic. The leather cover looks nice and fits well, but has a tendency to quickly collect moisture between the display's surface and the transparent plastic that goes over it.I am giving it only 3 stars for taking a giant step backward in display usability and substandard voice dialing capability, both of which were implemented better three years ago on other phones using less advanced technologies. Cheap thrills driven by greed are unbecoming and embarrasing. If you can live with these limitations, go for it, you may actually end up enjoying it a lot for other reasons.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, terrible wireless providers", "Author": "J. Martin \"picky shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R2O7D3UTJX9ZOY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Motorola V265 phone with Verizon service in May on sale on Amazon for $99, with a $50 Verizon rebate and a $150 Amazon rebate. So this phone rates super good as far as cost is concerned (assuming the rebates come in OK, which is a big IF). 1 year contract, 450 minutes for $39.99/month.For comparison, my old phone was a Nokia 5165, with AT&T; Wireless (now Cingular) as the provider. I'm a low minutes user, but this is mostly because I got horrible reception at home.I live in Falmouth, MA. The region isn't well-covered by cell towers, and is moderately hilly with dense tree growth. Add to that, the fact that I live at the edge of a bay. So cell strength is a big deal for me. I spoke with co-workers and cell phone accessory retailers and most said that for the street I live on Verizon had the best coverage, although it still wasn't that great.==== Phone Minuses ====-It seems to have a short battery life, although I plan to test this with more rigor and see how it stacks up to the advertised specs.-The sound quality is a little tinny. The Nokia was more far-away and hollow sounding. The sound quality can't stand a candle to even a cheap corded land-line phone.-The camera is pretty awful, but I didn't expect much. Plus you have to pay extra to get your pictures from the phone to your computer.-The extendable antennae doesn't seem to add too much to the signal strength, and seems like it would break easily.-The volume and speakerphone buttons are in an inconvenient place on the side and they are always in the way of my thumb.-The buttons are too small and I'm a person with small hands, too! Other button configurations have seemed easier to use. I liked the raised rubber-ish buttons of my old Nokia better, and even some of the flat-ish buttons that rocked a little.-There's no protective cover for the camera lens.==== Phone Pluses ====-Lots of features to delve into, many I will probably rarely ever use but it's nice to know they're there.-I absolutely love the speakerphone feature.-A must-have feature for me is an external phone jack. A lot of phone models I looked at in stores, while they had the port for the external jack, the actual electronics weren't connected. Having this jack means that  I can go to an electronics store like Radio Shack and buy an external antenna (and the proper connecter) and get a better signal. So far, Verizon's signal is OK as compared with AT&T;/Cingular.-I like the external display; having the black & white contrast helps readability but like most screens I've tested doesn't do well in direct sunlight.==== Verizon Service Pluses (as compared to AT&T; Wireless/Cingular) ====-They seem to take more of an effort at making sure I'm satisfied. We'll see how long this lasts. I have my doubts.-I was able to port my existing phone number without hassle and the procedure took about a half-hour taling to a customer service person on the phone.-The signal strength at my house is much better. With AT&T; Wireless/Cingular, I could not make outgoing phone calls sitting on my living room couch. With Verizon, I can actually make calls, although the clarity is not great. Because of restrictive zoning laws here, most companies share towers, so I suspect the difference is a matter of one critically placed tower.==== Verizon Service Minuses ====- **** Verizon started charging me monthly fees BEFORE the phone arrived in the mail! ****Apparently, if you buy the phone through a third party like Amazon, they deem service to start at the date of purchase, rather than the date the phone is actually turned on, presumably because Verizon can't control the actions of the third party. I asked a Verizon customer service person nicely, and they agreed to prorate the bill for the difference between the date of purchase and the date of delivery. The refund did show up on the next bill.-The billing cycle for the monthly service charges is for the month ahead rather than the month just prior (as AT&T;/Cingular had done). This is likely to cause problems when I decide to end service (see below).==== FOR AT&T; WIRELESS/CINGULAR CUSTOMERS ====I have had tremendous problems on the AT&T;/Cingular end of the porting process.First, the customer service number (800-888-7600) that's on my bill keeps spitting me into the Cingular phone menu. To get around this, one customer service person said, at the prompt to enter your wireless number enter a dummy number (like 000-000-0000) to get into the AT&T; service area. There is one other hitch. Apparently the AT&T; phone menu dumps you into the GSM department. If you have digital service (like I did), you will need to find a way to get to a person in the Digital department (I never was able to do that using the phone menu options).***** Second, AT&T;/Cingular billed me for a full month's montly service charge even when I ended service in the middle of the billing cyle!!! *******I called several times, most times not even able to access a person who could deal with AT&T; accounts. So I did some web research.I found that in March 2004 AT&T; Wireless was sued in a class-action lawsuit for doing this very thing. In the lawsuit AT&T; Wireless was accused of violating the Federal Communications Act and imposing an \"unjust and unreasonable\" charge by assessing the full monthly charges after switching to another provider before the end of the billing month. Apparently, just recently (in May I think) AT&T; Wireless settled out of court. I think this would have been huge had it gone to trial.So, with this information at hand I managed to finally reach a customer service person who could handle AT&T; accounts. I asked nicely to have the bill prorated. She said no. I told her about the lawsuit, explained that I'd like AT&T; to do the right thing, and she finally relented. She later confided that making the change to have the bill prorated was up to the discression of the customer service rep (!!) so be nice and polite when you ask.On a side note about Verizon: people at my office have had problems with Verizon billing them multiple times for the same call, so be sure to check your statements.==== FOR EVERYBODY ====Depending on the terms of your agreement, you may be liable for a full month's service charge when you change services, even if you stop service a day after the new billing cycle begins. Keep this in mind when you port your old number.*** Be sure to read your service agreement with a fine-toothed comb. You will probably need to spend a couple hours to fully understand it and it will feel like you're back in school in a foreign-language class. BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACT. If you don't understand something, get a customer service person to help you. Just like with credit card companies, if it's in the contract, you gotta pay it. ***", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best & smallest Verizon phone for the price", "Author": "T.

If you don't need bluetooth, a higher megapixel camera and video capability, then the v265 is the phone to get. Keep in mind that in order to e-mail the pictures you take with any camera phone, you will need to pay extra on your Verizon account for this service.  Verizon makes money on this but it doesn't mean you have to pay for this extra service if you don't want to use it.The Motorola v265 phone does what it's supposed to do and I agree that the Verizon network is the best in many areas of the USA. The analog capability of this phone is a real plus if you like to take road trips away from major metropolitan areas. You'll still have service where digital only phones and providers will be totally useless.Small and light, works well and priced right. In many ways, it's even superior to the much more expensive V710; it's smaller and some have even said the audio quality/reception is better with the v265.

Here is my experience:First phone that I received had these problems: 1) terrible static in both the ear receiver and microphone (basically, I had trouble hearing people on the phone and they complained of not able to hear me clearly); 2) keypad backlight was dim. I notified Amazon and they shipped a replacement V265 right away.Second phone that I received from Amazon had bright keypad backlight, and the receiver and microphone seemed to work fine, BUT the phone's vibration tone did NOT work.I took my 2nd faulty Motorola V265 straight to the Verizon Wireless store and the tech support guy exchanged it with another new Motorola V265 on the spot.  I checked to make sure that the phone sounds clear and is fully functional before I left the Verizon store.  I later shipped the 1st faulty phone I received back to Amazon.So far, my 3rd Motorola V265 is working fine without new problem.  I only use it to make calls.  The camera is totally useless, so don't buy it because of the camera.Lessons that I learned:1) If you buy a Motorola V265, you have up to 66% chance of getting a bad phone.2) Amazon has great customer service3) Verizon has great customer service4) Get Motorola V710 if you want camera and analog roaming5) Get Samsung A670 if you want camera and need no analog roaming6) Get Nokia 6015i if you want analog roaming but no cameraWould I buy V265 if I have to do it all over again?

I used to have an LG which I thought was pretty generic, but it turned out to be a better phone than this. I dropped my LG in the toilet, so I needed a new phone. I got the v265 because it was the most comfortable/affordable phone available at the Verizon store. I also thought that Motorola would be of better quality. I was wrong.The first phone had a problem with the \"voice recognition key\". They button was kind of mushy and didn't click when depressed. I noticed it at the store, but thought it was intended to be this way. After a couple of hours I realized that the button didn't function at all. I took it back to Verizon the next night.The sales person tried to replace it with a refurbished phone even thought I had owned this less than 24 hours. I raised a stink and they got a brand new one out for me. They took about an hour to set it up and sent me on my way. This second phone had problems too. The button that was supposed to register that the phone was closed didn't work, so it constantly said \"Verizon Wireless\" upside down and the key lights would always come on. It also wouldn't hang up when I closed the phone. I took this one back within 24 hours as well. The guy at the Verizon store told me that this was a known issue with earlier version of the v265. I asked why he would sell me an earlier model with known problems, but he didn't have any answer. They tried again to give me a refurbished phone. I wouldn't have it. Eventually they pulled another v265 out of the box and set it up for me. At this point I was ready to get a different phone, but all the other phones at the time were about $50 more. I decided to give this one last try. The sales person claimed that this one was the newer model that didn't have the problems.The third phone hasn't caused me any problems so far. It's been about 3 months. The buttons work and it registers when the face is closed. I don't think this phone is very well built and I think I'll need to replace it within the year. If that's the case, I will try to hold out until I can find a good deal on a camera that has been out long enough to get good reviews.Pros:1. I like that you can use MP3s as ringtones.

I previously had a Motorola phone, which I was not completely happy with, but was convinced by the salesman that the V265 was the way to go.  After all, he proudly had one strapped to his belt, and spoke as highly of it as I do my daughter.Four months later, completely out of the blue, the screen has a pulsating flicker and would not turn on. No problem, I simply marched into the Verizon store.  I was given another V265.  A \"refurbished\" phone.  Great, someone else's used problem.  Interestingly enough, the salesman who sold me my phone was now sporting another non-Motorola phone on his side holster.  Clearly, he too must have experienced all that the V265 doesn't have to offer.After two days with my replacement phone, it too started experiencing problems with the display.  It simply would not turn on.  The genius technician at the Verizon store informed me that I had to \"push\" the back of the phone in order for it to work properly.  Forgive me, but I did not see this in the instruction manual on how to operate this phone.  This wasn't the type of help I was looking for after wasting my time at the Verizon store again.I think by this point, anyone would agree that this phone plainly sucks, and would be more comfortable with another brand altogether.  Unfortunately, this phone keeps coming back like Columbo, or a bad girlfriend.  I was told by Verizon's Customer Service that it is their policy to continue replacing customers with the same refurbished phones in hopes that one will work.  They do not allow you to switch phones unless you buy a different one at full price.  Thanks Verizon, I'll remember this when my contract expires....This phone is horrible.

The first week seemed to be going great for the phone, and I left for college.  Ever since I've been here, it's been absolutely horrible.  At first, it randomly beeped \"Low Battery\" so I figured maybe a small error, so I restarted the phone and it would go away.  As weeks went by, it continued to get worse.  I would hook it up to the charger, and it would read \"Charge Complete\" on the outside cover, then unplug it and \"Low Battery\" would flash.  I have even let it sit out for the night trying to charge, and I still get nothing.  It would randomly turn off on me, which is quite embarrassing when speaking with a relative.  For a phone that's supposed to be on silent, why does it beep on \"Low Battery\"?  Kind of the defeats the purpose of silent if you ask me.  The screen unlit is impossible to read, and the phone feels flimsy.  I got this phone on August 8, 2005 and September 19th, it finally decided to refuse to charge or turn on anymore, leaving me without a cell phone.  Considering the other reviews I've read about this phone, I shouldn't even give it a star, it truly is a crappy phone.  If Motorola thought this phone was acceptable to release to the public, someone must have not been thinking straight.  They might want to consider redesigning the battery compartment, as I think that may be part of the problem (easy for the battery to loose contact), but I don't know.  I only gave it two stars, as the call quality was clear, and I received great reception (I do live near a phone tower, but still).
