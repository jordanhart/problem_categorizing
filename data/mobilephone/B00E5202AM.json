Also works with T-Mobile, but you may not get 3G in your area, but you will get EDGE at the very least, which is more than enough when using the phone's built in browser.+Speaker is fairly loud and better than other basic Nokia's.+Camera is good and fast for a 3.2MP, also has extra features like panoramic and self-portrait.+Battery life is GREAT. Will last 4 days easily with moderate to heavy use and probably a week or more with light use.+Build Quality. This thing is built like a tank and the keyboard feels great. This thing will outlast any drop, maybe even a bullet...But there are a few minor issues.The Bad:-There is no volume rocker. You use the D-Pad when in a call, but you cannot adjust the volume when in any application. Like web browsing or reading text messages.-No multi-tasking. Not a big deal, but if you are in the browser or using an application like Google Maps, you cannot activate the loudspeaker unless you exit the application while still in the phone call. Also you must exit any application/game to read a text message and reload the application/game again.Other Small Issues:=Camera has no autofocus or flashlight.=No Wi-Fi. Not a big deal, especially if you have 3G service in your area.=Limited tethering capabilities. You can tether to an Android device and use it as a portable modem using BlueVPN, but you will have limited capabilities.Overall, this is an amazing phone if you want a simple, elegant and durable phone. The features are better than other basic phones and this phone is very fast. Another Nokia phone to consider is the Nokia C2-01. It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast. The C2-01 is a better option for those who like to tether their phone to iPods and Andoids and also for those who like to hack into their phone to customize it and add multi-tasking.5 Stars for the Nokia 301, it is truely a great phone.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect Gift!!!", "Author": "F.
