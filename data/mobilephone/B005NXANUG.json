Colonna", "ReviewID": "RS5LDO12X73X7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned several different Pantech phones on my family plan. Almost all run into various issues, all needed to be exchanged when under warranty, and once out of warranty, Pantech support is minimal at best. Read the other reviews. This model is no exception. It is riddled with design defects that Pantech ignores.....battery covers that won't stay on, phones that shut off by themselves.Only one Pantech model has performed well, the Pursuit/Pursuit II. Every other, most notably the Impact and the Link - AWFUL.I won't even go into the features, as this is just a bad phone and you should avoid it.We maintain our phones and keep them protected, not mistreated - this are just junk. And if you call Pantech, even willing to buy replacement parts, like battery doors, they tend to have no spare parts, probably because they get used up replacing all the defects.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little phone!", "Author": "Kay", "ReviewID": "R11JNQUSC2RL4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 8 months bought directly from at&t;, I had to purchase this particular one ever since my dog got a hold of the first one.

This phone is good for texting. I like that it sorts text messages into conversations based on who you're talking to. My biggest problem with this phone is the touchscreen on the outside number pad. It locks except for when you are on the phone, so I frequently hang up on people by brushing the end key on accident, especially when I try to prop the phone against my ear so I can use both hands and still hear the person I'm talking to because the speaker phone isn't that great. Overall, the call quality of this phone is mediocre, but if you don't call much and just want to text, it's a great phone. I've never had it freeze, though the battery covers are flimsy. I've broken 2 of them since I've had this phone.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "No headphone jack!", "Author": "Jhansi", "ReviewID": "RU19J588XEZ3R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This device has a memory card slot and a music player but no way to plug in a standard pair of headphones!
