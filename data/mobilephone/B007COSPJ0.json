I bought it for my dad, it used to work pretty well, after 35 days, it turned off by itself, It can't take any charge. I try to return, they don't let me too. It was a waste of money. Don't waste your money on that phone. Everytime after he receives a call, it turns off by itself.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R2H3FS8CKY2ILS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this so we'd have mobile internet access while traveling in Europe.  I bought a SIM card and data service from an Orange store  in France, and then another in Switzerland.  (Every country has their own service.  No roaming on pay as you go plans.)  I set up a wifi hot-spot, for our PCs and tablets, and it worked great.  We even made a couple calls.  Dual SIMs were handy when going between countries (for switching service without having to remove/swap the SIM cards). I used Google translate on menus, and to communicate with various people.  It did it's job.Note:  It does not have a lot of memory/storage, so it filled with apps (and would take no more) fairly quickly.  Even with a large external micro SD card, this is true.  However I knew that going in, and it still met my needs, so it still get 5 stars.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Runs slow!!", "Author": "Duane Mcnab", "ReviewID": "R281OQW3R9VN38", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone runs way too slow and android systems is out of date.

I am not sure how long the battery is supposed to last but it seems to run down daily and I'm hardly using it. My other Samsung phone (A697 I think) has a battery life of at least five or six days. I don't know if I need a new battery or if my settings are off and draining it. I am feeling a little challenged at the moment but will overcome. For now I'm changing the SIM card back and forth between the phones until I learn what to expect from the battery and new phone.
