Second, after the last upgrade it has randomly started playing music.

Howe", "ReviewID": "R1JPUR010FGT8T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Since people like lists, I'll start with what I liked and disliked.Pros:1.  One of the best screens that is not an iPhone 4.2.  Amazing browsing capabilities.3.  Relatively fast processor and GPU.Cons:1.  Constant echo on all voice calls (T-Mobile and Skype).2.  Sound quality through the earpiece is mediocre.3.  People on the other end often complain of audio distortion (e.g. thought they had the wrong number on numerous occasions because they couldn't recognize my voice).4.  Music player starts playing on its own through speakerphone several times per day, even if you haven't used it since a restart.  Only way to avoid it is to shut off phone entirely.5.  Keyboard is garbage for everything but playing games.6.  Sliding mechanism on screen is loose which means it will open partially in your pocket, turning on the screen momentarily (but continually) and killing your battery life.7.  Build quality is very cheap; unit feels very fragile overall and housing was actually loose around the buttons, especially camera and volume rocker buttons.8.  Outbound calls that aren't dialed through Contacts list make the phone crash completely about 5% of the time (I counted about 1 in 20 calls did this).9.  Browser performance gradually slows over a couple days until you reset the phone.10.  Camera is absolute garbage.11.  Accelerometer is way too slow for a phone of this price and supposed quality.I tried really hard to love this phone, as I had used one on several occasions in the past and was quite impressed.  Going in I realized that the keyboard is not exactly the best for what it's primarily designed for (i.e. typing messages), but it is amazing for retro gaming.  Even though it's reversed from the usual gamepad setup, the keyboard is very good for use with S/NES and other game system emulators.  For writing messages, it's simply too awkward, and in spite of my best efforts I could not get accustomed to it to the point that it was usable.  The onscreen keyboard is much better.The default browser is pretty good, and the screen is just amazing in terms of color, brightness and sharpness.  As a capacitive touchscreen, it is easily as responsive as you'd expect, though I did often experience sluggishness with on-screen command taps, even with no demanding services or applications running.  Physically speaking, I wasn't that impressed with the sliding mechanism under the screen, however.  I don't know if it was particular to the unit I received, but the screen was quite loose.  For some reason there was even some give up and down, not just side to side.  That is, the screen moved in four directions, not just two, which made me quite nervous, as the screen overall seemed to have a tenuous connection to the body of the phone.  Additionally, the screen moved way too easily in the directions it's supposed to and did not lock into an open or closed position.  As I mentioned above, it started to slide at the slightest provocation while in my pocket.  The problem is that every time the screen is moved like that, the phone wakes up and remains on for the duration you specify in settings.  Turning auto-off to a lower setting might help, but honestly that's a pretty lame workaround.  The phone shouldn't be so loosely constructed as to allow opening without a respectable amount of force in the first place.Unfortunately the worst aspect of this phone was its primary function, namely as a phone.  Every time I used it I heard an echo of myself through the earpiece.  Using a bluetooth or wired headset eliminated most of it, but for me that's a very impractical solution.  And given the cost of the phone, I am not about to suffer with a workaround for something that is supposed to work so well already.  After noticing the problem, I did some searching and came across quite a few other users who have experienced similar issues.  It seems to be a possible manufacturing defect, but after reading stories of users who had to exchange their units upwards of half a dozen times before getting one that functioned passably well as a phone, I decided to return mine and not exchange it.Besides the audio problems, I noticed something unusual when dialing numbers manually.  After dialing a number with the keypad and hitting send, the phone would sometimes lock up.  After about 10 seconds, the Motorola and then Android logos would appear, meaning the phone had just reset itself.  This happened to me twice before I started to get concerned.  I managed to reproduce the problem myself, though it takes between 10 and 20 manually dialed calls before the phone crashes completely.  Still, that is a number that I am simply not willing to live with.  What if that one call out of however many happened to be extremely important?  What if I were dialing 911 or 112 when it crashed like that?  It's a risk that I am not willing to take.Returning to the audio quality for a moment, I should also mention the unusual distortion that callers would hear on their end of the phone.  Often it would happen towards the beginning of calls, where for the first 5 seconds or so it would sound as if my voice were being heavily modulated up or down, akin to what is done to protect someone's identity on TV interviews.  Eventually it goes away, but again it was something that happened far too often to be an acceptable quirk.At the end my biggest annoyance was the music player.  If you have any music at all on your SD card or in your phone's memory, be prepared for the music player to start up of its own accord and play a random song through your speakerphone.  This happened to me daily, even after I installed a new default audio player, which was the suggested workaround I found on some unofficial forum.  It would often turn itself on during the most inopportune times:  In a meeting at work, in a quiet elevator, at a movie theater, at 3am when we're asleep, and so on.  The only way that I could manage to get it to stop happening was to remove all music from the phone, but since I use my phone at the gym as an mp3 player, it was an impractical solution.Using many workarounds, this phone would maybe have been usable, but for the price and for what it is supposed to offer, it was simply unacceptable for me.  It's distinctly possible that I'm just unlucky and got a defective unit, but keep in mind that every problem I mention above has been well documented elsewhere by numerous others for almost a year now.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great smartphone, poor info for buyers", "Author": "Luis Fabres Montoya \"Amateur Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "RZ99G9HFIDFUU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "From the first time you got it, you feel the great quality from this phone.

Bluetooth not tested yet, WiFi running very good. Pictures and video taken by the camera are acceptable. Data connection over cellphone only tested on EDGE (2G). 3G can't be tested on my area. Even I can't know what 3G bands are supported by this phone, no instructions, no info inside of the product, no info here on Amazon!. I wrote an message to Customer Service, and the answer was: \"sorry, we don't know, please contact to Motorola\". This part is the worst part.

This means that the only way for you to get any software updates are through Motorola. This could be OK except that Motorola is doing a terrible job in releasing software updates. I have been waiting for a Froyo update a long time. I'm not a phone hacker, i use my phone for work. I need froyo because of Flash support (which does not exist in previous releases). Another major reason for me wanting froyo is I cannot install more than a few apps becaue only froyo has apps2sd which allows installing apps to the larger sd card. Legitimate? Well motorola promised froyo and it got delayed and delayed and finaly they released and it is horrible, lots of reboots and freeezes. And it is not because the device is too \"weak\" for froyo - it is because moto disrespect their uses with low quality software. And on top, instead of letting users put their own custom ROMs - they locked the device so users cannot control their own devices. Too bad. This is a deal breaker.

WORSE, it does not accept your own input, so you can't dial or do anything.So far, the best theory I've heard on why this happened is humidity. I'm in South America and most of the victims of this are in India. In fact, one person at the Motorola help forum claims that his screen goes haywire every time he travels to India and returns to normal in London. My screen kinda sometimes works on dry days or in air-conditioned rooms, but is absolutely insane on rainy days.Sadly, the problem seems to degrade the phone over time as I was able to work around it for a few weeks, but now I've given up on the phone because it's gotten so bad. The last straw was when I had to make an emergency call and the screen just lay there like a dead thing and refused all input.The problem seems to be the the capacitance touch screen which gets short circuited by the moisture.Bottom line:  It doesn't matter what the rest of this phone is like, it's useless once the moisture gremlins seize control of it.As I said earlier, you can look up the numerous videos of this defect to see for yourself.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great in Sweden!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R8SVLQQRE5UD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I visited USA and got to play with this phone a little.Once i got back to Sweden i found out that motorola got no market in Sweden at all (except a few stores that took *3 the price)I stumbled uppon this by accident and went for it.Have had it over a month now and there were no problems hooking it up to Telia or Halebops net here in sweden.

Not as fast as my iPad (1) but good enough speed. I haven't had the need to root it as yet though. Supposedly one can over clock after rooting, and speeds can approach that of the Milestone 2, and other similar competitors out there? Hence I didn't see the need to pitch the extra 100+ bucks for the Milestone 2. I am using the phone on a GSM network without a data plan (how lame is that, right?). Well my corporate provided SIM does not have a data plan with it. But I use the phone on the wifi at home and at work. I was using my bro's tossed-in-a-corner Blackberry 9000 - and I didn't like it. The trackball started shorting so I couldn't scroll properly, the screen was just too small for browsing and the OS was not very user friendly. Then for some reason I couldn't access the internet, even though it said it was connected to the wifi. I prefer the bigger screen and slide out keyboard, as the touch keyboard is not useful enough when typing long SMS's or other messages.I've had the phone about 4 weeks now. During the first week of use of the Milestone, I saw two random reboots. I haven't seen any since then. Also, a couple of times, the music player started playing music on its own! Annoying. And just today I plugged in the headphone to feed my work monitor speakers with some internet radio, and the music player started on its own again, twice! :@The battery life is excellent out of the box! No battery calibration procedure needed. I am pleasantly surprised at the battery life, from all the poor reviews I read about the battery. I can easily get about 24 hours out of it with minimal browsing via wifi, bluetooth on for about 1.5 hrs a day while driving, some messaging and a few short phone calls. The slide works fine. It is not spring loaded, but there is some resistance to the slide - it does not feel loose and cheap. The phone felt slightly heavy in my hand at first - but that doesn't bother me. I have no qualms with the keyboard really. I can type alot better and quicker than with the touch keyboard or even the keyboard on the Blackberry. The auto correct sometimes get to me, but I am getting used to using the suggested words while typing.I've installed an App killer that I leave running all the time. From time to time, especially when I turn on the wifi, a bunch of apps start on their own in the background. So I use this to kill them.Regarding the software - I cannot criticize the software until I've tried to root and upgrade to Froyo. Although many of the random issues I've mentioned about seem to be software and not hardware related.Supposedly the screen is made of gorilla glass, and is very scratch resistant? However, I had my car keys jammed to it one time in my pocket, and I noticed a damm scratch on the screen already! Gggrrrr!!! So I've ordered some screen protectors for it. I'd hate to drop it too! So I intend to get me good rubberized frames for it. The camera is adequate - even in low light areas such as at night indoors with soft lighting (alot better than the tired BB 9000!)I sync with my corporate Outlook calendar using Google Calendar sync on my PC and the wifi on the phone. This helps a bunch with checking my schedule of meetings etc, when I'm not at my PC. I have a bunch of different contacts that I need to clean up- SIM contacts, Gmail contacts, and Outlook contacts. I just need to merge all of them into one proper contact list. I've used MyPhoneExplorer to sync contacts via USB- but it turns out a mess on the phone. I don't get my corporate email on it, because my company discontinued the Outlook Web Access a week after I bought the phone! And I don't intend to pay for an app to sync Outlook email to it either.All in all - a great phone.

If I could have returned this phone the day after I bought it, I would have because these all issues were immediately obvious.  The problem was that I bought the phone from a Verizon distributor, which apparently isn't a true Verizon store.  They had a crazy policy that once I bought the phone and disrupted the packaging in any way (cut a small piece off the box for the rebate) then I could never return it.  So... I'm stuck with this phone until my 2-year contract ends next March... which is marching along painfully slow!!", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Look elsewhere", "Author": "Louis", "ReviewID": "R222F8B8UCQR2N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You are likely to regret buying this.It is severely underpowered in comparison to modern Android phones.

The internet works, though not anywhere near 3G or 4G speed so if your paying for that you may want to downgrade a smidge. texting is fine, calls sound clear (I don't know if this is based on phone or provider so I included it just in case).
