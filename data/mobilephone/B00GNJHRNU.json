It's highly responsive, clean and aesthetically pleasing - definitely the best phone I've ever owned and better equipped and/or priced than the other phones in it's class.The LTE connectivity is fantastic!And I find it's physical size to be perfectly appropriate to carry in your pocket or use for media, games or general internet surfing. The screen is amazingly clear due to it's size, brightness and high resolution.Cons: the description of it being white, refers ONLY to the back panel and the mesh over the ear piece speaker. It doesn't include the sides or front of the device - making it look a little incomplete. I would thus rather recommend selecting the black or red version.The device is somewhat power hungry, but that isn't surprising - due to it's crazy processor, WiFi, high-res, large-ish screen as well as it's arsenal of sensors and other built-in gadgets.Other than that, having a lack of an SD card slot is a bit irritating, but not too much of an issue as you can still access the local storage while it's tethered to your PC. However I've already filled the 32gb of onboard storage - so I wouldn't even bother with the 16gb model if you're contemplating it.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "button malefunction", "Author": "Danna Nahman", "ReviewID": "R2XJW4J7BSFRL8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sometimes the side buttons stop working and require me to turn the phone off and on again.
