It gives you a luxurious feel with its bright display and soft nice buttons. The picture and video quality is really good better than i expected. Its definately an eyecatcher and worth every penny. I purchased from Yapper Wireless and the phone came with all the accesories and i am happy with that. It is unlocked I jus had to put in my Digicel Sim (Jamaica) and it was good to go :) The only thing i would say is that it often feels warm to touch but not hot and the battery may not be the best but if u hav a spare charger or get another battery shud be perfect. All in all..its a nice little fone..an i really like it :)", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone. I Am In Love!", "Author": "Kavi M", "ReviewID": "R2DLW0QE6GY38A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first i was skeptical about purchasing a phone through Amazon because I had never done that before. My doubts are gone! This phone arrived in a timely manner although there was a storm when the delivery was taking place. I really appreciate that. It arrived in good packaging, etc.Good Points:- Its an awesome phone. This is my first Blackberry and i love it. Its easy enough to learn your way around- it operates really efficiently in terms of browsing- It plays media wonderfully,its my new favNot so good points:- the body of the phone will need protecting from falls and scratches as the screen and casing both scratch easily.- the battery life isn't long lasting. some days i need to recharge 2 - 3 times depending on usage. (i keep my phone on silent to conserve battery power but still multiple charges are needed)Overall, i would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking for an affordable introduction to the Blackberry world or just a replacement for your old one. I have had it for over 3 months so far and there's been no major problems to report. I have been surfing the internet, downloading music, apps, games etc. I would definitely buy this phone again!

The phone just refuses to turn-on. I have now been told that it is too late to return and get a replacement.This is really a case of a seller selling a bad product. Simply, the seller should do the honorable thing and refund me the money I paid for the phone.A check on the phone has revealed that the power-on ic is faulty in the phone.
