{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NEW  PHONE NEW EXPERIENCE", "Author": "Dustbunny", "ReviewID": "R146EHX333UX7I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm old.I cancelled my old phone service because they couldn 't get me a decent phone to JUST make calls/texts and open pictures. i don't need a fancy smart phone that does everything but make coffee for me. So I'm new to this kind of unlocked phone. I'm not happy thus far.  For the inexperienced..FIRST you purchase your \"unlocked\" phone. I got my phone about a week after placing the order. It's cute. The emergency button is right smack in the middle of the back which may be a problem..I hope not. The slide buttons on the sides are really cheap and annoying. LOVE the big buttons. Readout is nice too from little I can tell.Problem ONE:  I found out by shopping locally that I could NOT simply run out and buy any old sim card without paying through the nose (plan doesn't match phone) so I went back online to find the compatible plan on the justfive website. I ordered the plan...or so I thought.  Problem TWO: No sim card or welcome email or any of that stuff so I was wary. After a few days I placed a call to the red site people because apparently when you order the PLAN thru justfive you are redirected to the Goredpocket place who then tells me I need to place ANOTHER order for a sim card and my plan is only a REFILL plan. Uh oh. Not what the justfive website said so I went back to the Justfive site to recheck and I quote: Click here to order plan and get FREE sim card. Hmph. I then called Justfive who said they needed to \"fix\" the website and would send me my \"free\" sim card--except that...Problem THREE: my plan I prepaid for is ticking away while I wait for the new sim card that SHOULD have been sent out when I first ordered all this which in retrospect..I should have  ordered from the justfive website BY PHONE right after I placed my Amazon order for my phone. Got that? This might be self-explanatory for the rest of the population, but for me...I\"m still learning and learning everything the hard way seems to be the norm. Hope this helps out somebody else too. Will let you know if I'm happier when the phone and/or the plan when it's  up and running. In the meantime, I still have no working cell phone and at the rate I'm going, I might decide to throw in the towel and..shudder...go without one?! Will keep you updated if I can add to my review.UPDATE....It's been several months. I'm OKAY..just OKAY..with the phone but the refill process is HORRIBLE. The website does NOT work and the 800 numbers (which may or may not work)..will give you the runaround and the service reps are stupid and rude. Pro: Cheap plan. Cons: Cheap plan  Oh, and texts with attachments such as photos will not come thru at all so you might as well get the talk only plan.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CLGIX82"}}
