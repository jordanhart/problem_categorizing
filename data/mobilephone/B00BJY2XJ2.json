{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone With Excellent Features - A Very Detailed Review", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R2OH226T02EAS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this phone, I had the Galaxy Note that was rather bulky and heavy, yet I still wanted a 5 inch screen, but one a sleeker and lighter weight and newer phone. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites.  My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5 inch screen. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.- TWO STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD SLOTS:  Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim cards, I just placed it into the phone and it read my carrier plan and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution GOOD to VERY GOOD, however, it is not as good as say an S4 or S3, but good. However, I have a way to make the screen look GREAT and CLEARER on the home page. What I did is installed the free app ZEDGE and choose a wallpaper that has a dark blue background. The picture I choose has a deep blue sky and mountain in it and the home screen is STUNNING and the white letters on the icons really stand out. And I will say that the screen detail is clear and easy to read and webpages are just stunning on this phone!- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and if I am fairly close to the router, the signal strength is excellent. However, when I am a long distance from the router, the signal goes down, however, I still get WiFi and go on the Internet just fine. When not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 8MP takes excellent pictures. So I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised how clear the pictures are. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.- WiFi could be a little stronger. Close to a router it gets 5 bars and very strong signal. When I am far away, one bar. So performed a test using my Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1: Of course these gave me stronger signals because these devices are WiFi only and have probably a larger WiFi receiver inside. So I compared it to my S3 Mini and the signal was close, yet the S3 mini did have a little bit stronger signal.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal as I use Dropbox to download my photos and files and it is fast and easy.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model of phone. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line:  Actual stars I rate this phone is 4.5 took off .5 stars because of the WiFi signal not as strong as S3 Mini or my Tablets. Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from this phone like the S3 or S4 models and also you want just the most important features, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Jair", "ReviewID": "R3C1XC8NVF9MTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is the information the phone has 8 GBytes of memory - we can only use 4 GBytes - the other 4 GBytes are reserved for system usage.

I can say though that, the seller understood the situation and kindly allowed me to return the purchase, unopened, in the same condition that I received it.

Bottom line, I don't hate it, but I would not recommend.Let's do the comparison:Pros: - Dual Sim  - microSD with up to 64gb  - Nice clear screenCons: - Sluggish; probably not enough RAM, but maybe their version of the code  - The included music player has a mind of its own and can be very unresponsive  - Phone randomly restarts itself (averaging about 1x per week)Notes:1) This is i9082 but is the i9082L (Latin America) version.  I have no problem with this, but part of me hesitates if there is a difference on the software installed thereby causing the restarts.  I will probably root this and figure it out for myself what is going on.2) Battery charges fast but drains fairly quickly.  I tend to use the phone a lot during the morning and in the early evening I'm usually at 3-5% battery.  This is all without any games, only music, whatsapp and phone calls.3) The way that Samsung has written their ROM, it does not include an identification of misspelled words.  The Nexus I had previously identified all misspelled words in text and apps.  This makes it more difficult to write professional emails.4) The 3G is only from SIM 1 and unfortunately, I couldn't find an LTE dual-sim phone.  Maybe I am the only on that knows how awesome this would be....", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Maria P.", "ReviewID": "R1UTZVI6YOSK87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it - great product for travel and use a different SIM in another country - WOrks like a clock!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "five stars, my second and a great purchase", "Author": "Juan F.

The first time I only had it for about a week or so and then I returned it (it was a white one and I wish I would have chosen the white one again, the blue one, which looks black, has a back cover more prone to finger prints and wipe prints maybe it's just that the color makes this more obvious but I don't like that) and I looked out there for another phone that was a big like I like, inexpensive compared to other phablets and also unlocked but my search brought me back to this one and I think I made the right decision. I am not into the technology side of it. If I can play games and text and call and go on the internet I don't care about anything else. The wifi signal is great, it automatically updated to android 4.2.2. (I do care about the android version, if you are thinking about upgrading DO NOT I have heard horror stories about phones being paper weights after android 4.4 and android 4.3 updates so I will be keeping it at android 4.3). I do not have service on the phone yet but since I have had the same phone in the past I am sure it will be great. Awesome 8mp back camera and I think the front one is 2mp or 1.3. I have used them both and pictures come out real clear. But again don't think it's going to take 13mp digital camera type pics, that's unrealistic. There is no lag when navigating but there is some lag on things like game start up or just whatever and because of all the stock programs that come with the phone and possibly the android update my phone went from 8gb down 3.2 (though it reads 2gb on the available space, when I go to app manager it says I have over 3 free) and not the 4 it was before when I had the other phone and it also received the android update, I don't know what's up with that. So you will probably still need a memory card which unfortunately will not help you if you have a lot of apps because you cannot store them on your memory card unfortunately. Also I used my first samsung galaxy grand i9082L on Metro PCS service which offers $40 unlimited plans with first 500mb at 4G speeds, I assumed that it would automatically go to 3G speeds but it was just 2G EDGE. I contacted AIO Wireless this time around and they said they offer unlimited 3G and it will never decrease in speed. I was only interested in 3G because I want to be able to be on the phone and use the data at the same time which AIO wireless claims I can do on this phone with 3G speeds. This has not been proven since I have not signed up for the company yet, when I know I will check it out.
