I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware. My experience of using camera (one of the best cameras in the smartphone and a key differentiator), navigation, reading articles, books, listening to music, watching videos were flawless. I highly recommend to anyone interested in windows platform. This phone is something to definitely checkout!As for a comparative analysis I have laid the specs of other top 2014 phones. I am sticker to useful specs and I find following spec will help you decide the best phone for your use case.Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)HTC One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.7 in, 469 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 4 MP/2.1MP, Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600, Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300, 0.66 W/kg (head), 0.40 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Spetacular device.", "Author": "Gufort", "ReviewID": "R2HKWDS5BFELI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone. Using this phone for E-mail, reading news on the web, reading Kindle books, taking pictures, using offline GPS to move from home - work - home, video chatting on Skype, streaming music on Nokia Music, Office on the go as well as OneDrive to sync my documents with my business computer.6\" screen Full HD is spectacular. Using my small iPhone 4S just for calls today. It is too small for any other productive thing. My thumbs got too big for that.Initially I thought it would be too big, but it is not. Phone is big, but experience is good.My conclusion after a Galaxy S3 is that anything above 4.5\" cannot be used with just one hand, so 4,7\u201d, 5\u201d, 5,7\u201d or 6\u201d, for me, are the same.In addition, Windows Phone take the edge on large screens as back - home - search buttons and app menu bar are at the bottom of the screen, so it is reachable. Most of the time there is no need to stretch thumbs to the top left corner for back or Menus as on iOS.So, most of the time, phone is user friendly with one hand.OneDrive + Office Experience (although a simple and limited Office version) is fantastic due to screen. Checking and revising Excel, Word or PowerPoint attachments from e-mails is simply awesome.Loving it and recommend.Vendor sent the product on time and as described.

I've grown somewhat tired of its operating system...one designed to be workable for any IQ above room temperature.  Because of Apple's aversion to menus, icons, and especially the Back Button, one is forced to use animal-like gestures to accomplish the most elementary functions.  The fact that it works perfect almost all the time makes it worthwhile, of course.I'm completely avoiding anything with the words Android or gmail attached to it for security reasons.  It is by far the most hackable platform around, and even if nothing extraordinary occurs, you've still got Google looking over your shoulder 24/7.  For the unaware, Google promises to:  Read your emails and extract any information they please; Track and record your physical movements and sell the information to the highest bidder; and take possession of all documents, pictures, videos and music left on their server for more than six months.So that leaves us with Blackberry and Windows phones.  Both Verizon and AT&T; make it pretty clear they are not interested in selling Blackberries these days.  AT&T; has a good selection of Nokias (now a captive manufacturer for Windows) and the 1520 has a gorgeous 6\" screen.  This screen has 2,000,000 pixels, compared to about 700,000 for an iPad mini or an iPhone 5.  I love to read newspapers online, and this allows me to read the full page edition.  it was bit disconcerting at first...the text was not always a suitable size when I turned to an article.  But then, after a couple of days, the machine adapted to my newspapers and the text appeared the right size.I had hoped to connect a bluetooth keyboard, but the 1520 will not accept one.  The virtual keyboard is quite good, in part because the pressure-sensitive touch screen is superior to Samsung's temp-sensitive screen.  You can use gloved fingers and/or stylus.  The predictive text is good, and adapts to your vocabulary.  It has voice dictation, which took some getting used to.  Hint: think before you speak, and pause after each sentence.The camera is one of the best.  And like the best cameras, it snaps the picture about a second after you press the button.  The iPad does not have this delay, and its pictures are noticeably inferior.  It take alot of persistence to take pictures of a fast-moving dog.The battery life is superb.  It will easily go two days between charges.  Compare this to the iPad mini, which must remain connected for several hours each day, and doesn't actually increase its charge until you stop using the LTE.  (with the supplied 1A charger)The \"Live Tiles\" of the home screen are not particularly attractive, and no wallpaper is available.  But that is my most substantial complaint so far.  I've had this phone for a week now, and I look forward to importing files from my Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 laptops....something that the iPad does not like to do.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Power House", "Author": "Will Wang", "ReviewID": "R36FXE2PCP5E3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is fantastic!

When I first got it, I was frustrated by the inability to send pictures directly to a printer.  But, as I continued to use it, I'm in love!  It is huge for a phone, but with my vision, it helps to be able to see things!  I've learned the new Windows OS quickly, and love it also!  Just wish there were more apps for it.  I hope Microsoft is working on that.  They have a good product here.  The pictures and video is amazing, and the Nokia Creative Studio makes it so easy and fun to edit pictures on the fly and send them to family and friends quickly.

I think the most natural, perfect fit will be splitting the difference between the 1520 and 920 frame sizes and make the screen as big as possible to fit that frame.The OS is Windows 8 (soon to be upgraded automatically to 8.1) so no surprises, never locks up and has a great reception and Bluetooth receiver.  I use the wireless charging every day.  Battery life is a lot longer than the 920, which is surprising.Would be 5 stars, but knocked down just a little because my hand is just a little too small for the frame.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Product made for China", "Author": "Mihai Buleu", "ReviewID": "R2K5OK384VRBP5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the product and the manual and almost everything else was in Chinese.

But that\u2019s not the case. Its very fragile. Not like its predecessor.I dropped this phone from my pocket a few days back and the display broke. And this is just a 20 days old phone. I just dropped it that one time.This is the same lumia 1520 that nokia claims to be strong, a durable one.I have used Nokia N95 and Nokia Lumia 800. Both were durable. Dropped it so many times and never broke.Especially the lumia 800 which my wife is still using has been dropped a million times, still works like a charm. Not even a scratchSo looks like this Flagship model, Lumia 1520 is not made of the same quality as its predecessor and its pretty much fragile.When i contacted nokia about this, they said due to this physical damage, my mobile is now out of warranty. I have to cover the expenses now.It costs around 200$ to replace the display. Come on, i cant spend 200$ every time i drop this phone.i should have bought a case. but the problem with the caseis that, this mobile is already huge enough to handle with one hand. This case might increase the size a bit, and i thought atending the calls would become tedious. And considering the durability of Lumia 800 which i already own, i thought this phone would also be made of good quality.This phone tends to slip out easily out of my hands as its huge and weighs a lotNokia service centre ignored my case even though i am a loyal customer. I have always been a Nokia customer. Apart from the Nokia N95 and Lumia 800, i have bought several other phones including the E5 and many other Models, which ofcourse i dont remember now. They have been mailing me Mail templates instead of a proper reply.http://youtu.be/8EWuz4YEk9kEven though i explained my case several times, they are not ready to replace the phone. Instead they wanna consider my case as a feedback.All these Nokia Flagships phones have been very sentimental to me. And i was very heartbroken when this mobile broke. Never broke a phone before. And nokia is not ready to help me out.SO, if u are really considering to buy this Lumia 1520, be ready to spend 200$ every time you drop it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$486.99", "Features": "Factory Unlocked Windows 8 Phone\n20 MP Camera\n1080p\n6\" HD Display", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 1520 White, Factory Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zYZ6QHyFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G4DTR0G"}}
